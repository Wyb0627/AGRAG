## System

Your response start after "Thought: ", where you will methodically break down the reasoning process, illustrating how you arrive at conclusions.

## Prompt user format (how prompt_user is built in HippoRAG.qa())

1. For each retrieved passage (top qa_top_k):
     prompt_user += "Wikipedia Title: {passage}\n\n"

2. If rag_mode == 'gorag' and include_passage_nodes_in_qa_input, and passage_nodes_on_path exist:
     prompt_user += "\n----\nReference Passages:\n" + "\n".join(passage_nodes_on_path) + "\n"

3. Then:
     prompt_user += "Question: " + question + "\nThought: "

So the model continues after "Thought: " with reasoning, then "Answer: <final answer>".
