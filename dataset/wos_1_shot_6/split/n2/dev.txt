electric_motor	nowadays, increasingly stringent directives in the transport sector open interesting possibilities for the development of new traction technologies based on electrochemical storage and fuel cells, that are characterized by some limitations: the electrochemical storage systems have a limited range while fuel cells have not a proper response capability for very variable load demands. with the aim to realize a hybrid electric vehicle (hev) able to increase range of autonomy, cnr itae has designed a minibus (class b-category m3) having an electric motor of 40 kw powered by a polymeric fuel cell system of 20 kw and a lithium battery system of 70 kwh. the study is focused on evaluation of the hybrid propulsion system performance in different operating conditions. in particular, powertrain configuration and energy management strategies have been studied to optimize the efficiency of the hev, overcoming the limitations of these technologies, reducing energy losses and increasing range of the vehicle. tests on the road have been conducted and energy production and consumption of the vehicle have been logged.

digital_control	in boost converters and other indirect energy transfer topologies, the fastest transient response usually does not coincide with the minimum possible output voltage deviation. this paper introduces a practical mixed-signal current programmed mode (cpm) controller that, compared to time-optimal solutions, provides a smaller deviation, lower current stress, and simpler controller implementation. to recover from transients, the controller passes through two phases. in the first phase, the inductor current is set in the proximity of its steady-state value, so that the initial transient-caused capacitor charging/discharging process is reversed. in the second phase, the voltage is gradually recovered. the controller implements a simple algorithm for setting up the inductor current and the output voltage peak/valley values during transients, based on the output current estimate, which is obtained through a self-tuning procedure. the operation of the controller is verified both through simulations and experimentally, with a boost-based 12 to 48 v, 100-w prototype, operating at 100-khz switching frequency. a comparison with a time-optimal controller shows that the introduced programmable-deviation system results in up to 1.9 times smaller voltage deviation while limiting component stress.
microcontroller	we present a high-voltage cmos neural-interface chip for a multichannel vestibular prosthesis (mvp) that measures head motion and modulates vestibular nerve activity to restore vision- and posture-stabilizing reflexes. this application specific integrated circuit neural interface (asic-ni) chip was designed to work with a commercially available microcontroller, which controls the asic-ni via a fast parallel interface to deliver biphasic stimulation pulses with 9-bit programmable current amplitude via 16 stimulation channels. the chip was fabricated in the onsemi c5 0.5 micron, high-voltage cmos process and can accommodate compliance voltages up to 12 v, stimulating vestibular nerve branches using biphasic current pulses up to 1.45 +/- 0.06 ma with durations as short as 10 mu s/phase. the asic-ni includes a dedicated digital-to-analog converter for each channel, enabling it to perform complex multipolar stimulation. the asic-ni replaces discrete components that cover nearly half of the 2nd generation mvp (mvp2) printed circuit board, reducing the mvp system size by 48% and power consumption by 17%. physiological tests of the asic-based mvp system (mvp2a) in a rhesus monkey produced reflexive eye movement responses to prosthetic stimulation similar to those observed when using the mvp2. sinusoidal modulation of stimulus pulse rate from 68-130 pulses per second at frequencies from 0.1 to 5 hz elicited appropriately-directed slow phase eye velocities ranging in amplitude from 1.9-16.7 degrees/s for the mvp2 and 2.0-14.27s for the mvp2a. the eye velocities evoked by mvp2 and mvp2a showed no significant difference (t-test, p = 0.34), suggesting that the mvp2a achieves performance at least as good as the larger mvp2.
electrical_network	this paper deals with the transfer of data by power-line communication (plc) on a pulse width modulated (pwm) energy network. target applications concern the adjustable speed drive for industrial infrastructures. in order to implement an efficient communication solution, it is necessary to have a model of the communication channel to determine certain parameters like bandwidth, carrier frequency and modulation formats. the originality of our work is the methodology used to determine the channel model. the first results of simulation and experimental validation are presented in this paper.
electricity	this paper aims to propose a methodology for optimization of solar chimney power plants taking into account the techno-economic parameters. the indicator used for optimization is the comparison between the actual achieved simple payback period for the design and the minimum possible (optimum) simple payback period as a reference. an optimization model was executed for different twelve designs in the range 5-200 mw to cover reinforced concrete chimney, sloped collector, and floating chimney. the height of the chimney was optimized and the associated collector area was calculated accordingly. relationships between payback periods, electricity price, and the peak power capacity of each power plant were developed. the resulted payback periods for the floating chimney power plants were the shortest compared to the other studied designs. for a solar chimney power plant with 100 mw at electricity price 0.10 usd/kwh, the simple payback period for the reference case was 4.29 years for floating chimney design compared to 23.47 and 16.88 years for reinforced concrete chimney and sloped collector design, respectively. after design optimization for 100 mw power plant of each of reinforced concrete, sloped collector, and floating chimney, a save of 19.63, 2.22, and 2.24 million usd, respectively from the initial cost of the reference case is achieved. sensitivity analysis was conducted in this study to evaluate the impacts of varied running cost, solar radiation, and electricity price on the payback periods of solar chimney power plant. floating chimney design is still performing after applying the highest ratio of annual running cost to the annual revenue. the sensitivity analysis showed that at the same solar radiation and electricity price, the simple payback period for 200 mw with sloped collector design would almost have the double simple payback period for 5 mw with floating chimney design.

operational_amplifier	we propose an analog front-end integrated circuit (ic) design for a readout ic (roic), which applies a fixed-voltage-bias sensing method with a capacitance transimpedance amplifier (ctia) to an input stage in order to simplify the circuit structure of the roic and the ir sensor characteristic control. for a sample-and-hold stage, in order to display and control a signal detected by the ir sensor using a 2-d focal plane array, a differential delta sampling circuit is proposed, which effectively removes the fixed pattern noise. in addition, a two-stage variable-gain amplifier equipped with a rail-to-rail fully differential operational amplifier is applied to the roic to achieve high voltage sensitivity. the output characteristic of the proposed device is 30.84 mv/k and the linearity error rate is less than 0.07%. after checking the performance of the roic using an hspice simulation, the chip is manufactured and measured using the united microelectronics corporation japan 0.35-mu m standard cmos process to confirm that the simulation results from the actual design are in close agreement with the measurement results.
analog_signal_processing	a procedure based on the multiple expansion of the brain electrical generator is used here to derive analytical expressions for the transfer matrix necessary to obtain potentials referenced to infinity. its features include: avoidance of computations that involve a large number of discrete dipole sources; faster evaluation compared to the use of the dipole layer; and a transparency showing the parameters that constitute the transfer matrix. the paper also proposes the construction of the standardization matrix without the use of the general inverse of a non-symmetrical matrix.
state_space_representation	based on dynamical modeling, robust trajectory tracking control of a spherical mobile robot is proposed. the spherical robot is composed of a spherical shell and three independent rotors which act as the inner driver mechanism. owing to rolling without slipping assumption, the robot is subjected to two nonholonomic constraints. the state space representation of the system is developed using dynamical equations of the robot 's motion. as the main contribution, a dynamical model based smc (sliding mode controller) is designed for position control of the robot under parameters uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. to decrease the chattering phenomena originated by the sign function, the well-known boundary layer technique is imposed on the smc. the control gains are determined through using lyapanov 's direct method in such a way that the robustness and to zero convergence of the controller 's tracking error are guaranteed. wide range computer simulations are performed to show the significant tracking performance of the proposed smc in particular against parameters uncertainty and white gaussian noises. the simulation results show the significant performance of the designed nonlinear control system in trajectory tracking control of the spherical robot even in the presence of parameters uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics.
signal-flow_graph	this paper introduces a systematic methodology for applying mason 's signal flow graph to the analysis of feedback circuits. we demonstrate that the relationships among signals of feedback circuits can be represented in a intuitive and graphical manner utilizing signal flow graphs. once constructed, the desired solutions can be achieved by simple inspection of the signal flow graph. the thevenin and norton equivalent circuits are utilized to model the loading effects of the feedback network in the example circuits presented.
electrical_circuits	knowledge representation plays a very important role for designing knowledge base systems as well as intelligent systems. nowadays, there are many effective methods for representing such as: semantic network, rule-base systems, computational network. computational objects knowledge base (cokb) can be used to represent the total knowledge and design the knowledge base of systems. in fact, a popular form of knowledge domain is knowledge about operations and computational relations, especially computational knowledge domain, such as: linear algebra, analytic geometry. however, cokb model and the other models have not solved yet some problems about operators: specification of operator, properties of operator, reducing an expression. in this paper, we will present a reducing model of cokb. this model, called ops-model, represents knowledge about operators between objects and solve some problems related to these operators. through that, the algorithms for designing inference engine of model have been built up. moreover, ops-model has been applied to specify a part of knowledge domain about direct current (dc) electrical circuits and construct a program for solving some problems on this knowledge domain.
lorentz_force_law	the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations of electromagnetism are reviewed and the maxwell equations are obtained from the hamiltonian for a system of many electric charges. it is shown that three of the equations which were obtained from the hamiltonian, namely the lorentz force law and two maxwell equations, can be obtained as well from a set of postulated poisson brackets. it is shown how the results derived from these brackets can be used to reconstruct the original lagrangian for the theory aided by some reasoning based on physical concepts.
system_identification	an optimal controller for high-precision spiral positioning of a piezoelectric tube scanner used in an atomic force microscope (afm) is proposed in this paper. in the proposed control scheme, a second-order vibration compensator is incorporated with the piezoelectric tube scanner (pts) to suppress the vibration of the pts at the resonant frequency. an internal model of a reference sinusoidal signal is included with the augmented plant model and an integrator is introduced with a linear quadratic gaussian controller which reduces the phase error between the input and output sinusoids. the proposed method allows a commercial afm to scan at high scanning speeds as an alternative to the raster scanning approach. the performance of this controller is assessed with closed-loop frequency response, tracking accuracy, and a set of spiral scanned images. the raster scanned images obtained using the standard afm pi controller is also presented for comparison with the spiral images. experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. note to practitioner-the main motivation for this work is to propose a control system for high-speed imaging using an afm. the scanning speed of a commercial afm is limited by the positioning accuracy of the scanner. the scanner is made of a piezoelectric tube actuator. the commercially available scanners have the following problems: 1) creep effect at slow speed scanning; 2) hysteresis effect during large range scanning (these two effects result in inaccurate reference motion tracking); and 3) vibration effect at high frequencies due to its mechanical flexibility. to overcome these limitations, an internal reference model-based linear quadratic gaussian control approach is designed and experimentally implemented using the dspace ds-1103 real-time prototype system. before the control design, the scanner is modelled (experimentally) by using a system identification method, and a vibration compensator is incorporated with the identified model. apart from the control design, a spiral motion of the scanner is considered instead of a well-known raster scanning which is adopted in all commercial afms. the designed controller is applied in the piezoelectric tube scanner experimentally, and the obtained results are presented in terms of tracking accuracy, damping of scanners vibration, and generating high-quality images as compared with the existing commercially available methods. the existing commercial system can generate a sensible image up to 30 hz scanning frequency but, using the proposed method, a high-quality image up to 120 hz is achieved. with a slight software modification, the proposed improvement can be used in commercial afms.
pid_controller	this paper deals with the design of a controller possessing tracking capability of any realisable reference trajectory while rejecting measurement noise. we consider discrete-time-varying multi-input multi-output stable linear systems and a proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controller. a novel recursive algorithm estimating the time-varying pid gains is proposed. the development of the proposed algorithm is based on minimising a stochastic performance index. the implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and boundedness of trajectories and convergence characteristics are presented for a discretised continuous-time model. simulation results are included to illustrate the performance capabilities of the proposed algorithm.
voltage_law	given a nonlinear infinite resistive network, an operating point can be determined by approximating the network by finite networks obtained by shorting together various infinite sets of nodes, and then taking a limit of the nodal potential functions of the finite networks. initially, by taking a completion of the node set of the infinite network under a metric given by the resistances, limit points are obtained that represent generalized ends, which we call ""terminals,"" of the infinite network. these terminals can be shorted together to obtain a generalized kind of node, a special case of a 1-node. an operating point will involve kirchhoff 's current law holding at 1-nodes, and so the ow of current into these terminals is studied. we give existence and bounds for an operating point that also has a nodal potential function, which is continuous at the 1-nodes. the existence is derived from the said approximations.
control_engineering	we consider the problem of estimating an arbitrary dynamical parameter of an open quantum system in the input-output formalism. for irreducible markov processes, we show that in the limit of large times the system-output state can be approximated by a quantum gaussian state whose mean is proportional to the unknown parameter. this approximation holds locally in a neighbourhood of size t(-1/2) in the parameter space, and provides an explicit expression of the asymptotic quantum fisher information in terms of the markov generator. furthermore we show that additive statistics of the counting and homodyne measurements also satisfy local asymptotic normality and we compute the corresponding classical fisher informations. the general theory is illustrated with the examples of a two-level system and the atom maser. our results contribute towards a better understanding of the statistical and probabilistic properties of the output process, with relevance for quantum control engineering, and the theory of non-equilibrium quantum open systems.
