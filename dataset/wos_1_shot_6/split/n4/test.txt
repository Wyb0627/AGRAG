lymphoma	the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)/mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mtor) signalling pathway is commonly dysregulated in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all). a phase 1 trial of the mtor inhibitor temsirolimus in combination with ukall r3 re-induction chemotherapy was conducted in children and adolescents with second or greater relapse of all. the initial temsirolimus dose level (dl1) was 10mg/m(2) weeklyx3 doses. subsequent patient cohorts received temsirolimus 75mg/m(2) weeklyx3 doses (dl0) or, secondary to toxicity, 75mg/m(2) weeklyx2 doses (dl-1). sixteen patients were enrolled, 15 were evaluable for toxicity. dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) occurred at all three dose levels and included hypertriglyceridaemia, mucositis, ulceration, hypertension with reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy, elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase and sepsis. the addition of temsirolimus to ukall r3 re-induction therapy resulted in excessive toxicity and was not tolerable in children with relapsed all. however, this regimen induced remission in seven of fifteen patients. three patients had minimal residual disease levels <001%. inhibition of pi3k signalling was detected in patients treated at all dose levels of temsirolimus, but inhibition at an early time point did not appear to correlate with clinical responses at the end of re-induction therapy.
migraine	electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (gon) has recently shown promise as an effective non-pharmacological prophylactic therapy for drug-resistant chronic primary headaches, but the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its anticephalgic action are not elucidated. considering that the spinal trigeminal nucleus (stn) is a key segmental structure playing a prominent role in pathophysiology of headaches, in the present study we evaluated the effects of gon electrical stimulation on ongoing and evoked firing of the dura-sensitive stn neurons. the experiments were carried out on urethane/chloralose-anesthetized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated male wistar rats. extracellular recordings were made from 11 neurons within the caudal part of the stn that received convergent input from the ipsilateral facial cutaneous receptive fields, dura mater and gon. in each experiment, five various combinations of the gon stimulation frequency (50, 75, 100 hz) and intensity (1, 3, 6 v) were tested successively in 10 min interval. at all parameter sets, preconditioning gon stimulation (250 ms train of pulses applied before each recording) produced suppression of both the ongoing activity of the stn neurons and their responses to electrical stimulation of the dura mater. the inhibitory effect depended mostly on the gon stimulation intensity, being maximally pronounced when a stimulus of 6 v was applied. thus, the gon stimulation-induced inhibition of trigeminovascular nociceptive processing at the level of stn has been demonstrated for the first time. the data obtained can contribute to a deeper understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of gon stimulation in primary headaches.
addiction	psychostimulants induce stable changes in neural plasticity and behavior in a transcription-dependent manner. further, stable cellular changes require transcription that is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that alter chromatin structure, such as histone acetylation. this mechanism is typically catalyzed by enzymes with histone acetyltransferase or histone deacetylase (hdac) activity. class ila hdac5 are notable for their high expression in important regions of the brain reward circuitry and their neural activity-dependent shuttling in and out of the cell nucleus. in particular, hdac5 has an important modulatory function in cocaine-induced behaviors and social defeat stress-induced effects. although a mutation in hdac5 has been shown to cause hypersensitive responses to chronic cocaine use whether this response worsens during chronic early life stress has not been examined yet. in this study, we exposed mouse pups to two different early life stress paradigms (social isolation, esi, and social threat, est) to determine whether the heterozygous null mutation in hdac5 (hdac5+/) moderated the effects of exposure to stress in early life on adult cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (cpp). notably, hdac5+/ mice that had been exposed to esi were more susceptible to developing cocaine-induced cpp and more resistant to extinguishing this behavior. the same effect was not observed for hdac5+/ mice experiencing est, suggesting that only esi induces behavioral changes by acting precisely through hdac5-related biological pathways. finally, an analysis of c-fos expression performed to discover the neurobiological substrates that mediated this phenotype, identified the dorsolateral striatum as an important structure that mediates the interaction between hdac5 mutation and esl our data demonstrate that decreased hdac5 function is able to exacerbate the long-term behavioral effects of adverse rearing environment in mouse.

atrial_fibrillation	aims the esc-ehra atrial fibrillation ablation long-term registry is a prospective, multinational study that aims at providing an accurate picture of contemporary real-world ablation for atrial fibrillation (afib) and its outcome. methods and results a total of 104 centres in 27 european countries participated and were asked to enrol 20-50 consecutive patients scheduled for first and re-do afib ablation. pre-procedural, procedural and 1-year follow-up data were captured on a web-based electronic case record form. overall, 3630 patients were included, of which 3593 underwent an afib ablation (98.9%). median age was 59 years and 32.4% patients had lone atrial fibrillation. pulmonary vein isolation was attempted in 98.8% of patients and achieved in 95-97%. afib-related symptoms were present in 97%. inhospital complications occurred in 7.8% and one patient died due to an atrioesophageal fistula. one-year follow-up was performed in 3180 (88.6%) at a median of 12.4 months (11.9-13.4) after ablation: 52.8% by clinical visit, 44.2% by telephone contact and 3.0% by contact with the general practitioner. at 12-months, the success rate with or without antiarrhythmic drugs (aads) was 73.6%. a significant portion (46%) was still on aads. late complications included 14 additional deaths (4 cardiac, 4 vascular, 6 other causes) and 333 (10.7%) other complications. conclusion afib ablation in clinical practice is mostly performed in symptomatic, relatively young and otherwise healthy patients. overall success rate is satisfactory, but complication rate remains considerable and a significant portion of patients remain on aads. monitoring after ablation shows wide variations. antithrombotic treatment after ablation shows insufficient guideline-adherence.
autism	for young children with autism spectrum disorders, one of the choice interventions is early intensive behavioral intervention. over the past ten years, its effectiveness has been abundantly evaluated based on various parameters, including the intensity and duration of the intervention. despite major advances in effectiveness evaluation, data concerning the implementation of the intervention are often described briefly, and the active ingredients of the intervention are but rarely linked to the documented effects. objectives: this study aims at reviewing with a systematic method, the studies pertaining to eibi provided to children with autism spectrum disorders over the past ten years (2005-2015) and at documenting the program implementation components described in the studies, based on dane and schneider 's (1998) model in accordance with prisma guidelines. results: the results show that, although the variables related to intervention dosage and protocol are relatively well described, the authors do not always consider them in the effects analysis. furthermore, the majority of the studies did not report information on intervention participation, differentiation or quality. conclusions: data concerning the implementation of the intervention are partially described in the articles retained. in this regard, a better description of the intervention provided and a more systematic evaluation of its implementation seem necessary to detect the subtle differences in the effects of the intervention.

autism	background: autobiographical memory plays a key role in self-understanding and psychological health. while deficits in autobiographical memory are well-established in autism, few studies have focused on adolescence; a critical period for the developing self and self-esteem. method: 16 adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (asd) and 16 typically developing adolescent controls matched for iq and gender, were asked to provide three self-defining and three everyday memories. participants rated their memories for emotional intensity, visual perspective and the extent to which they were self-revealing. memories were independently rated as self-defining or everyday experiences, and according to their valence and theme. self-esteem and depressed mood were further assessed with self-report questionnaires. results: there were no group differences in the ability to recognise self-defining memories as assessed by independent reports. both groups also reported their self-defining memories to be more intense than their everyday memories. however adolescents with asd, in contrast to non-asd controls, reported self-defining memories to reveal less about them than everyday memories. relative to controls, they retrieved fewer memories with an achievement theme and more memories with a recreational theme. the control group showed a bias towards retrieving positive rather than negative self-defining memories but the asd group showed no such tendency. self-esteem, but not mood was poorer in the asd group and self-esteem was related to the retrieval of negative self-defining memories. conclusions: adolescents with asd exhibit an instable self-representation; they recognise the types of past experiences that define them but feel weak connections with these memories.

smoking_cessation	obese smokers with diabetes are a special risk category for all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (mace). weight loss and smoking cessation are key interventions advocated for the management of diabetes in almost all the guidelines across the globe. however, there is a substantial risk of weight gain following smoking cessation which may, in some cases, cause a transient worsening of glycaemic control in people with diabetes. the risk of weight gain and the potential for worsening of hba1c may put off some obese smokers to quit. the cardiometabolic sequelae of smoking cessation in people with and without diabetes are different. the benefit of smoking cessation, in terms of reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, in people without diabetes is evident within three years of quitting. however, it may take up to 10 years for people with diabetes to get this benefit. post-cessation weight gain is much more detrimental to obese quitters with diabetes than those without. the aim of this review is to explore how best these high-risk individuals can be supported to remain abstinent long-term, and manage their vascular risk profile proactively, by concerted lifestyle intervention with judicious use of new and novel pharmacotherapy.
atrial_fibrillation	introductionthe antihistaminic antazoline (ant) was reported to be highly effective and safe for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation (af). we therefore analyzed underlying mechanisms in an experimental whole-heart model. methods and resultsisolated and retrogradely perfused rabbit hearts underwent a standardized protocol employing atrial burst pacing-induced af in five of 20 hearts under baseline conditions (seven episodes). thereafter, a combination of acetylcholine and isoproterenol was employed to enhance af occurrence. two monophasic action potential recordings on the left- and two on the right atrial epicardium showed a decrease in atrial action potential duration (aapd, -25msec, p<.05) and atrial effective refractory period (aerp; -52msec, p<.01) after infusion of acetylcholine (1mol/l) and isoproterenol (1mol/l). this led to induction of af in 14 of 20 hearts (145 episodes). simultaneous infusion of ant (20mol/l) led to a complete suppression of af in all inducible hearts. treatment with ant also led to a significant increase in aapd (+41msec, p<.01) and aerp (+74msec, p<.05), leading to a marked increase in atrial postrepolarization refractoriness (aprr, +33msec, p<.01). results were compared to 13 rabbits treated with flecainide. flecainide induced a significant increase in aprr and resulted in induction of af in seven of 13 hearts (51 episodes) while 11 of 13 hearts were inducible with acetylcholine and isoproterenol (93 episodes). conclusionadministration of ant was highly effective in suppressing af. the antiarrhythmic effect could be explained by a significant increase in postrepolarization refractoriness as a result of a more marked increase in aerp as compared with aapd.
children's_health	background: recurrent respiratory tract infections (rrtis) have a negative impact on both children 's health and family wellbeing. deficiency of zhengqi used to be an instinct factor driving rrti in traditional chinese medicine (tcm). our clinical observations suggest that children with gastrointestinal heat retention syndrome (ghrs) may have a greater risk of catching respiratory tract infections (rtis). ghrs is a new predisposing factor for rrti and it is dietary related. this study is aimed to explore association between ghrs and rrti. methods: a prospective cohort study has been conducted in beijing, china; children aged 1-18 were enrolled. tcm symptoms, demographic and physiological characteristics were recorded by using semi-structured questionnaire. ghrs was considered as a predisposing factor. children were followed up for next 12 months. we contacted with their parents using a face-to-face questionnaire survey, via email or phone every 3 months. episodes of rtis were recorded in detail. results: three hundred thirty four children were enrolled and 307 (91.92 %) followed up for 12 months. the incidence of rti was 4.32 episodes per child-year (95 % ci 4.03-4.61). 69 (43.13 %) children in the group with ghrs suffered from rrti; there were 48 (32.65 %) children in group without ghrs. the risk ratio (rr) value of rrti occurrence was 1.32 (95 % ci 0.91-1.91, p = 0.139), and the attributable risk percent (ar%) was 24.28 %. dry stool and irritability were positively correlated with rti episodes, age and bmi were negatively correlated with rti episodes in a linear regression model. dry stool (or = 1.510) was positively correlated with rrti occurrence, age (or = 0.889) and bmi (or = 0.858) were negatively correlated with rrti occurrence in our logistic regression model. conclusions: ghrs is associated with rrti in this cohort. dry stool was positively associated with rrti, and bmi was negatively associated with rrti. studies with larger sample size and longer follow up are needed to further evaluate this association. relieving ghrs should be considered when tcm practitioners treat rrti children, and this may protect children from suffering rtis.
autism	the broad autism phenotype (bap) is an individual difference whereby persons exhibit mild characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (asd), including being socially aloof and having a rigid personality. given that individuals high in bap rigidity have difficulty adjusting to change, the present research examined whether rigid persons report greater concerns about death and adhere to their cultural beliefs following mortality salience (ms). in study 1, we found that bap rigidity was positively associated with greater mortality-related concerns. in study 2, high rigid individuals evidenced increased death-thought accessibility following ms. finally, study 3 found that ms led to heightened worldview defense for individuals high in rigidity, while decreasing defensiveness for those low in rigidity. these results provide evidence for the moderating role of individual differences in terror management effects. specifically, asd characteristics in young adults, particularly in the area of rigidity, contribute to heightened death concerns and greater defensiveness.

smoking_cessation	the purpose of the study was to examine the effects of auricular acupressure for smoking cessation on male college students. the experimental group (n = 27) received auricular acupressure on specific acupoints for smoking cessation, whereas the control group (n = 26) received sham auricular acupressure on nonspecific acupoints. participants received 6 weeks of auricular acupressure intervention. for the experimental group, auricular acupressure was applied to the shenmen, lung, subcortex, hunger, stomach, and mouth. the data of nicotine dependence, self-efficacy for smoking cessation, and exhaled carbon monoxide were collected for both group 3 times: before intervention, after 3 weeks of the intervention, and after 6 weeks of the intervention. statistical differences between the two groups from pretest to posttest emerged in self-efficacy for smoking cessation (p =.048) and exhaled carbon monoxide (p <.001), but not for nicotine dependence.
osteoporosis	isoformononetin, a methoxylated isoflavone present in medicinal plants, has non-estrogenic bone forming effect via differential mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling. spectroscopic (ft raman, ft-ir, uv-vis and nmr spectra) and quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory (dft) and 6-311++g(d,p) as a large basis set have been employed to study the structural and electronic properties of isoformononetin. a detailed conformational analysis is performed to determine the stability among conformers and the various possibilities of intramolecular hydrogen bonding formation. molecular docking studies with different protein kinases were performed on isoformononetin and previously studied isoflavonoid, formononetin in order to understand their inhibitory nature and the effect of functional groups on osteogenic or osteoporosis associated proteins. it is found that the oxygen atoms of methoxy, hydroxyl groups attached to phenyl rings r1, r3 and carbonyl group attached to pyran ring r2, play a major role in binding with the protein kinases that is responsible for the osteoporosis; however, no hydrophobic interactions are observed between rings of ligand and protein. the electronic properties such as homo and lumo energies were determined by time-dependent td-dft which predict that conformer ii is a little bit more stable and chemically low reactive than conformer i of isoformononetin. to estimate the structure-activity relationship, the molecular electrostatic potential (mep) surface map, and reactivity descriptors are calculated from the optimized geometry of the molecule. from these results, it is also found that isoformononetin is kinetically more stable, less toxic, weak electrophile and chemically less reactive than formononetin. the atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital analysis are applied for the detailed analysis of intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

psoriasis	introductionpsoriasis is a multisystem, immune-mediated inflammatory disease. some authors have proposed an autoimmune basis for psoriasis; however, till date, it has not been definitely established. this study was conducted to explore the autoimmune nature of psoriasis. materials and methodsthis was a prospective study in which 43 psoriasis patients were assessed for detailed clinical, histopathological and immunopathological features to explore the diagnostic utility of subtypes, intensity and number of immunoreactants in lesional and non-lesional skin in these patients. in addition, the sera of these patients were analyzed for the presence of various autoantibodies. resultsthe patients' age ranged from 14 to 75 years with a male-to-female ratio of 1.52:1. nine patients (20.93%) were positive for antinuclear and 2 (4.65%) for antismooth muscle antibodies. direct immunofluorescence (dif) was positive in 31 (72%) biopsies from the lesional and 27 (63%) biopsies from non-lesional skin. in all these dif positive cases, granular deposits of c5b-9 were detected at the dermoepidermal junction. no significant difference was observed on comparing the type and pattern of immunoreactant positivity, among lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies (p >.05). conclusionno significant association between psoriasis and immunoreactant deposition as well as autoantibody seroprevalence was observed, thereby refuting a definite autoimmune basis for psoriasis.
asthma	purpose of review this review addresses the most recent developments on cockroach allergen research in relation to allergic diseases, especially asthma. recent findings the number of allergens relevant to cockroach allergy has recently expanded considerably up to 12 groups. new x-ray crystal structures of allergens from groups 1, 2, and 5 revealed interesting features with implications for allergen standardization, sensitization, diagnosis, and therapy. summary cockroach allergy is strongly associated with asthma particularly among children and young adults living in inner-city environments, posing challenges for disease control. environmental interventions targeted at reducing cockroach allergen exposure have provided conflicting results. immunotherapy may be a way to modify the natural history of cockroach allergy and decrease symptoms and asthma severity among sensitized and exposed individuals. the new information on cockroach allergens is important for the assessment of allergen markers of exposure and disease, and for the design of immunotherapy trials.
bipolar_disorder	background: this study explores the association of demographic and clinical features with quality of life and functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder. methods: adult participants (n = 482) with bipolar i or ii disorder were enrolled in a comparative effectiveness study across eleven study sites and completed baseline measures of medical and psychiatric history, current mood, quality of life, and functioning. participants with at least mildly depressive or manic/hypomanic symptomatic severity were randomized to receive lithium or quetiapine in addition to adjunctive personalized treatment for 6 months. results: participants with more severe depressive and irritability symptoms had lower quality of life and higher functional impairment. all psychiatric comorbid conditions except substance use disorder were associated with worse quality of life. on average, females had lower quality of life than males. patients who were married, living as married, divorced, or separated had worse functional impairment compared with patients who were single or never married. a composite score of social disadvantage was associated with worse functioning and marginally associated with worse quality of life. symptom severity did not moderate the effect of social disadvantage on quality of life or functioning. conclusions: our findings highlight that depression, irritability, and psychiatric comorbid conditions negatively impact quality of life and functioning in bipolar disorder. the study suggests that individuals with social disadvantage are at risk for functional impairment.
addiction	in this paper, we elaborate on the premises of studying problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. due to the growing medicalisation of research on problem substance use and disparities in this group, policy makers, health researchers and practitioners often feel compelled to rely on epidemiological studies when grounding and understanding the link between ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment disparities. we argue that the bulk of epidemiological research suffers from crucial methodological and conceptual flaws that necessitate a reconsideration of their usefulness in policy and treatment practice. first, epidemiological research is based on static concepts of ethnicity and race as primordial analytical categories. second, and as a consequence of the first argument, such research rarely distinguishes sufficiently between ethnic and non-ethnic determinants and mechanisms influencing problem substance use and treatment disparities. and third, these studies often depart from methodological individualism and subordinate contextual and structural determinants and mechanisms. this paper aims to re-evaluate (the factors and mechanisms mediating) the relationship between ethnicity, the nature of problem substance use, and treatment disparities, and to overcome some of the gaps in existing research methods mentioned above. more specifically, this implies (1) a critical revision of the ethnicity concept in epidemiology, (2) the inclusion of non-ethnic determinants and mechanisms by means of applying intersectional analysis and ethnic boundary making perspectives, (3) the broadening of methodological individualism in order to include all levels (from micro to macro) and loci (individual, community, society) of research in holistic research designs. such doubled research allows researchers to analyse and have an impact on treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities.
children's_health	background: nurse-family partnership is a nurse home visitation program that aims to improve the lives of young mothers and their children. the program focuses on women who are parenting for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. nurse visits start as early in pregnancy as possible and continue until the child reaches age two years. the program has proven effective in the united states - improving children 's mental health and development and maternal wellbeing, and showing long-term cost-effectiveness. but it is not known whether the same benefits will be obtained in canada, where public services differ. the british columbia healthy connections project therefore involves a randomized controlled trial evaluating nurse-family partnership 's effectiveness compared with existing (usual) services in improving children 's mental health and early development and mother 's life circumstances. the trial 's main aims are to: reduce childhood injuries by age two years (primary outcome indicator); reduce prenatal nicotine and alcohol use; improve child cognitive and language development and behaviour at age two years; and reduce subsequent pregnancies by 24 months postpartum. potential explanatory factors such as maternal mental health (including self-efficacy) are also being assessed, as is the program 's impact on exposure to intimate-partner violence. to inform future economic evaluation, data are also being collected on health and social service access and use. methods/design: eligible and consenting participants (n = 1040) are being recruited prior to 28 weeks gestation then individually randomized to receive existing services (comparison group) or nurse-family partnership plus existing services (intervention group). nurse-family partnership is being delivered following fidelity guidelines. data are being collected during in person and telephone interviews at: baseline; 34-36 weeks gestation; and two, 10, 18 and 24 months postpartum. additional data will be obtained via linkages from provincial datasets. recruitment commenced in october 2013 and will continue for approximately three years. discussion: this trial will provide important information about the generalizability of nurse-family partnership to the canadian context. findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with policymakers and practitioners through extensive public health collaborations already underway.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	we previously showed that coincident exposure to heat shock (hs; 42 degrees c for 2 h) and tnf-alpha synergistically induces apoptosis in mouse lung epithelium. we extended this work by analyzing hs effects on human lung epithelial responses to clinically relevant injury. cotreatment with tnf-alpha and hs induced little caspase-3 and poly(adp-ribose) polymerase cleavage in human small airway epithelial cells, a549 cells, and beas2b cells. scratch wound closure rates almost doubled when a549 and beas2b cells and air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were heat shocked immediately after wounding. microarray, qrt-pcr, and immunoblotting showed fibroblast growth factor 1 (fgf1) to be synergistically induced by hs and wounding. enhanced fgf1 expression in hs/wounded a549 was blocked by inhibitors of p38 mapk (sb203580) or hs factor (hsf)-1 (knk-437) and in hsf1 knockout beas2b cells. pcr demonstrated fgf1 to be expressed from the two most distal promoters in wounded/hs cells. wound closure in hs a549 and beas2b cells was reduced by fgf receptor-1/3 inhibition (su-5402) or fgf1 depletion. exogenous fgf1 accelerated a549 wound closure in the absence but not presence of hs. in the presence of exogenous fgf1, hs slowed wound closure, suggesting that it increases fgf1 expression but impairs fgf1-stimulated wound closure. frozen sections from normal and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) lung were analyzed for fgf1 and hsp70 by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and qrt-pcr. fgf1 and hsp70 mrna levels were 7.5 and 5.9-fold higher in ipf than normal lung, and the proteins colocalized to fibroblastic foci in ipf lung. we conclude that hs signaling may have an important impact on gene expression contributing to lung injury, healing, and fibrosis.
stress_management	prenatal stress can have a lasting effect on women 's mental health after childbirth. the negative effects may be particularly salient in women from low income and ethnic minority backgrounds, who are at increased risk for postpartum depression. however, social support may have the potential to attenuate the negative impact of stress. the present study evaluated 269 mexican american women (ages 18-42; 83 % spanish-speaking; median income $10,000-$15,000) for prenatal stress (daily hassles, family stress, partner stress, and culture-specific stress) in relation to depressive symptoms 6 weeks postpartum. prenatal social support was examined as a buffer against the impact of prenatal stress. partner stress, family stress, and daily hassles uniquely predicted depressive symptoms. moderate and high levels of social support attenuated risk for depression due to family stressors. prenatal interpersonal and daily stressors negatively impact the mental health of women after birth, but social support can mitigate some of these effects. among mexican american pregnant women, effective interpersonal support and stress management may be associated with reduced risk for postpartum depression.
autism	school professionals who work with students with autism spectrum disorder (asd) play a significant role in the academic experiences of these students, but some evidence suggests that teachers of students with asd experience a high risk of burnout. research has begun to examine factors that ameliorate or prevent teacher burnout, including teacher training and teacher self-efficacy, or teachers' beliefs regarding their abilities to bring about positive outcomes for their students. the present study examined variables associated with the self-efficacy of school professionals for working with students with asd, including knowledge about asd, prior experience working with students with asd, and prior training in asd and evidence-based practices. a second goal of the present study was to investigate the impact of training on asd and evidence-based practices on school professionals' knowledge and self-efficacy related to working with students with asd. in particular, the participants received training on the prevent-teach-reinforce model. results of the present study suggested the importance of training to school professionals' self-efficacy, highlighting the need for continued efforts to provide quality training to individuals who work with students with asd.
asthma	objectives: migraine is a diseases characterized with severe headaches, with neurological and systemic findings. the purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of migraine and to examine whether there is a relationship between atopic disorders, parental history and migraine in asthma patients. material and methods: a total of 288 asthma outpatients, who had the diagnosis by an early or late test of reversibility showing a reversible airway obstruction according to hospital database were included. the presence of headache, atopic symptoms and parental history about asthma, atopic disorders and migraine were asked. the patients with headache were consultated by neurology department and investigated about the presence of migraine. the diagnosis of migraine headache was made if patients fulfilled the international headache society (ihs) criteria. results: 60.4% of patients described a headache. there were 94 patients (32.6%) with headaches meeting the ihs criteria for migraine. only 12 patients had migraine with aura. there were atopic symptoms in 86.8% of patients. according to parental history, there were asthma in 47.9%, atopic symptoms in 39.6% and migraine in 22.2% of parents. patients with atopic symptoms were found to have significantly high rate of headaches (65.3%) ""p=0.007"". the prevalence of migraine was significantly high in patients with parental atopic symptoms (54%) ""p=0.002"". multiple logistic regression analysis identified that gender, parental history of asthma, allergia and migraine, and smoking were independent risk factors for presence of migraine in asthmatics. conclusion: there is a high prevalence of migraine headaches in patients with asthma. the coexistence of asthma and headaches may be related with a similar pathophysiological mechanism; parental history, common genetic compounds and smoking may play role in this mechanism. the headaches in asthma patients, atopic symptoms and family history should be questioned, and clinicians should be careful about the presence of migraine.
ankylosing_spondylitis	we present a case of pleural tuberculosis (tb) in a patient on infliximab for ankylosing spondylitis. a 36-year-old male presented to our hospital with low back ache of inflammatory type along with multiple symmetric inflammatory type ofjoint pain. further clinical examination, laboratory and radiological investigations were suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. he was initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but citing poor response it was decided to initiate biologic therapy using infliximab (antitumor necrosis factor-alpha). mantoux test and chest radiograph were done before the therapy to rule out tb. following three doses of infliximab, patient came with complaints of fever and cough for 1 week. on investigation, it was found to be a case of pulmonary tb. this shows the importance of close monitoring of patient for tb among patients on infliximab even though the screening test has come out to be negative.
mental_health	objective: previous research shows that migraine and general headache symptoms increase after traumatic events. questions remain about whether posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) produces migraine/headache symptoms, or if individuals afflicted by migraine/headache are especially likely to develop ptsd. we test whether ptsd symptoms following a natural disaster are associated with higher odds of reporting frequent headaches/migraines postdisaster. we decompose ptsd into intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptom clusters to examine which, if any, are uniquely related to headache/migraine postdisaster. method: we use prospectively collected pre- and postdisaster data to explore whether overall ptsd symptoms and symptom clusters are associated with migraine/headache in a sample of hurricane katrina survivors. we account for severity of hurricane exposure and control for baseline migraine and headache problems to reduce the probability that heightened ptsd susceptibility among those who already suffered from the conditions could explain observed associations. results: ptsd symptoms were associated with higher odds of experiencing frequent headaches or migraines with a standard deviation change in ptsd score corresponding to over twice the odds (95% confidence interval [1.64, 2.68]) of having trouble with frequent headaches or migraines in the post-katrina period. each additional point on the intrusion subscale (sample m [sd] = 1.6 [1.1]) was associated with 55% higher odds of reporting frequent headache/migraine (95% confidence interval [1.03, 2.33]), but we found no association with avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms. conclusions: clinicians and disaster planners should be aware that disaster survivors might be at heightened risk of migraine/headache episodes, and those experiencing intrusive reminders may be most affected.
osteoarthritis	to evaluate, by means of a longitudinal study, radiographic involvement of metacarpophalangeal and radio-carpal joints in hand osteoarthritis, its relationship with erosive disease and its progression, 368 patients with hand osteoarthritis were enrolled. all patients underwent hand x-rays. on the basis of the presence of central erosions in interphalangeal joints, patients were divided into three groups: 0-no central erosions, 1-one joint with central erosion, and 2-two or more joints with central erosions. a longitudinal study on 44 patients and nine normal controls, whose x-rays were available after 3.9 years, was performed. the radiological involvement of metacarpophalangeal and radio-carpal joints was evaluated using kellgren-lawrence and oarsi scores. low number of joints showed kellgren-lawrence values >= 2 group 0, 42/1290 (3.3%); group 1, 10/410 (2.4%); and group 2, 36/1980 (1.8%). low score values were obtained for all radiographic items. only metacarpophalangeal joint space narrowing score showed significant increase from groups 0 to 2. subsequent adjustment for age, gender, and bmi did not confirm the statistical significance. marginal erosions were rarely found (6.7% of joints). metacarpophalangeal and radio-carpal radiographic per patient scores significantly worsened at follow-up, but no significant increase in joints with kellgren-lawrence score >= 2 was found. in normal controls, no significant radiographic worsening was found. only a minority of metacarpophalangeal joints shows a kellgren-lawrence value ae2. metacarpophalangeal and to lesser extent radiocarpal joints had significant worsening at follow-up. metacarpophalangeal joint involvement in hand osteoarthritis is mild but progressive. radiocarpal involvement is negligible.
osteoporosis	over-activation of osteoclasts is directly responsible for pathological bone loss in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer metastasis to bone. hypoxia is a common feature of these conditions, associated with poor prognosis, which also stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption via induction of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor hif-1 alpha. here, we investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor 11 (fgf11) on osteoclast function. fgf11 is an intracellular fgf that was induced both by hypoxia (2% o-2, p < 0.01) and by inhibition of the hif-regulating prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (cocl2, p < 0.001) in osteoclasts. isoform-specific sirna demonstrated that the induction of fgf11 mrna expression by hypoxia is hif-1 alpha-dependent (p < 0.01). hypoxic stimulation of bone resorption was inhibited in osteoclasts treated with sirna targeting fgf11 (p < 0.05). this was at least partially due to reduced secretion of an unidentified pro-resorptive factor downstream of fgf11. fgf11 expression within hypoxic, resorbing osteoclasts co-localised with microtubule-associated alpha-tubulin. fgf11 was also abundantly expressed in osteoclasts within the rheumatoid synovium and in giant cell tumour of bone. this study suggests fgf11 as a novel factor driving pathological bone resorption in osteolytic disease and as a potential target for the development of new anti-resorptive therapeutic agents.
anxiety	compared to people who have never engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury (nssi), people with a history of nssi report multiple interpersonal problems. theories propose that these interpersonal difficulties play a role in prompting and maintaining nssi. the cross-sectional nature of most studies in this area limits our understanding of how day-to-day interpersonal experiences relate to the global interpersonal impairments observed among individuals with nssi, and vice versa. this study compared young adults with (n = 60) and without (n = 56) recent, repeated nssi on baseline and daily measures of interpersonal functioning during a 14-day daily diary study. groups differed in baseline social anxiety, excessive reassurance seeking, and use of support seeking relative to other coping strategies, but did not differ in self-perceived interpersonal competence. in terms of day-to-day functioning, participants with (vs. without) nssi had significantly less contact with their families and friends, perceived less support following interactions with friends, and were less likely to seek support to cope, regardless of level of negative affect. with the exception of contact with family members, these group differences in daily interpersonal functioning were accounted for by baseline levels of social anxiety and use of support seeking. contrary to expectations, participants with nssi had more frequent contact with their romantic partners, did not differ in perceptions of support in romantic relationships, and did not report more intense negative affect following negative interpersonal interactions. this study provides a novel test of recent interpersonal theories of nssi using daily reports.
psoriasis	hidradenitis suppurativa (hs) has been associated with marked inflammatory perturbation. the mechanisms regulating the inflammatory network remain elusive. micrornas (mirnas) have been described as gene regulators of inflammation. we evaluated the messenger rna (mrna) expression levels of six selected inflammation-related mirnas in lesional and perilesional skin samples of hs patients and in healthy controls. samples of 15 hs patients and 10 healthy controls were included in this prospective study. expression levels of the mirnas mirna-155-5p, mirna-223-5p, mirna-31-5p, mirna-21-5p, mirna-125b-5p, and mirna-146a-5p were studied by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. we observed a significant overexpression of mirna-155-5p, mirna-223-5p, mirna-31-5p, mirna-21-5p, and mirna-146a-5p in lesional hs skin compared to healthy controls. expression of these mirnas was also significantly increased in lesional hs skin when compared to perilesional skin. only mirna-155-5p showed an increased expression in perilesional skin compared to healthy controls. in contrast, mirna-125b-5p had a significantly lower expression in lesional hs skin compared to perilesional skin. we found that the studied inflammation-related mirnas were significantly dysregulated in lesional hs skin and may have regulatory roles in the inflammatory process of hs. given their predicted targets and functions, our findings point to these mirnas as potential disease biomarkers, and manipulation might be used therapeutically to target the inflammatory pathway in hs.
crohn's_disease	aims and objectivesto examine disease-related stress, coping strategies and the need for information and support in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or crohn 's disease). backgroundpsychological stress is an important factor in ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease, and therefore, coping strategies and support needs should be considered in routine clinical practice. designthis is a qualitative study using a descriptive interview-based approach. methodfifteen patients with ulcerative colitis (n=7) or crohn 's disease (n=8) were interviewed. the interviews were analysed with content analysis. resultsthe informants largely focused on disease-related stress (e.g. access to a toilet, symptoms and worries) and relations to other people (various reactions from others and social situations). behavioural strategies (i.e. taking actions and the need for making plans, prepare and adapt), social strategies (seeking help and information and sharing feelings about the disease with others) and emotional strategies (distraction, positive attitude and acceptance) were adopted to cope with the stress associated with the disease. the need for information and support concerned instrumental support (disease-related information) and emotional support (to talk about disease management). conclusionfaecal urgency and the fear of losing bowel control are important stressors for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. the patients handle this problem using various coping strategies depending on the type of stressful events. both instrumental and emotional support were requested which primarily occurred at the time of diagnosis and disease flare-ups. relevance to clinical practicepatients with ulcerative colitis or crohn 's disease ask for information and psychosocial support that are tailored to their individual needs and at different stages in the disease trajectory to improve everyday life and strengthen self-management strategies.
bipolar_disorder	background: until recently, actigraphy studies in bipolar disorders focused on sleep rather than daytime activity in mania or depression, and have failed to analyse mixed episodes separately. furthermore, even those studies that assessed activity parameters reported only mean levels rather than complexity or predictability of activity. we identified cases presenting in one of three acute phases of bipolar disorder and examined whether the application of nonlinear dynamic models to the description of objectively measured activity can be used to predict case classification. methods: the sample comprised 34 adults who were hospitalized with an acute episode of mania (n = 16), bipolar depression (n = 12), or a mixed state (n = 6), who agreed to wear an actiwatch for a continuous period of 24 h. mean level, variability, regularity, entropy, and predictability of activity were recorded for a defined 64-min active morning and active evening period. discriminant function analysis was used to determine the combination of variables that best classified cases based on phase of illness. results: the model identified two discriminant functions: the first was statistically significant and correlated with intra-individual fluctuation in activity and regularity of activity (sample entropy) in the active morning period; the second correlated with several measures of activity from the evening period (e.g. fourier analysis, autocorrelation, sample entropy). a classification table generated from both functions correctly classified 79% of all cases based on phase of illness (x(2) = 36.21; df 4; p = 0.001). however, 42% of bipolar depression cases were misclassified as being in manic phase. conclusions: the findings should be treated with caution as this was a small-scale pilot study and we did not control for prescribed treatments, medication adherence, etc. however, the insights gained should encourage more widespread adoption of statistical approaches to the classification of cases alongside the application of more sophisticated modelling of activity patterns. the difficulty of accurately classifying cases of bipolar depression requires further research, as it is unclear whether the lower prediction rate reflects weaknesses in a model based only on actigraphy data, or if it reflects clinical reality i.e. the possibility that there may be more than one subtype of bipolar depression.
bipolar_disorder	background: the ketogenic diet (kd) has been used in treatment-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s. it has been researched in a variety of neurological conditions in both animal models and human trials. the aim of this review is to clarify the potential role of kd in psychiatry. methods: narrative review of electronic databases pubmed, psychinfo, and scopus. results: the search yielded 15 studies that related the use of kd in mental disorders including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (asd), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). these studies comprised nine animal models, four case studies, and two open-label studies in humans. in anxiety, exogenous ketone supplementation reduced anxiety-related behaviors in a rat model. in depression, kd significantly reduced depression-like behaviors in rat and mice models in two controlled studies. in bipolar disorder, one case study reported a reduction in symptomatology, while a second case study reported no improvement. in schizophrenia, an open-label study in female patients (n = 10) reported reduced symptoms after 2 weeks of kd, a single case study reported no improvement. in a brief report, 3 weeks of kd in a mouse model normalized pathological behaviors. in asd, an open-label study in children (n = 30) reported no significant improvement; one case study reported a pronounced and sustained response to kd. in asd, in four controlled animal studies, kd significantly reduced asd-related behaviors in mice and rats. in adhd, in one controlled trial of kd in dogs with comorbid epilepsy, both conditions significantly improved. conclusion: despite its long history in neurology, the role of kd in mental disorders is unclear. half of the published studies are based on animal models of mental disorders with limited generalizability to the analog conditions in humans. the review lists some major limitations including the lack of measuring ketone levels in four studies and the issue of compliance to the rigid diet in humans. currently, there is insufficient evidence for the use of kd in mental disorders, and it is not a recommended treatment option. future research should include long-term, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover dietary trials to examine the effect of kd in various mental disorders.
asthma	purpose of review the inflammatory makeup of severe asthma is heterogeneous. identification of the predominant cellular endotype via biomarkers can aid in the selection of more advanced therapies. this review is clinically focused on how to use these biomarkers to help select between biologic agents and/or bronchial thermoplasty. recent findings several th2 biomarkers exist for the detection of eosinophilic disease; however, the best biomarker for clinical practice is debatable depending upon local resources. currently, there are three federal drug agency-approved biologic agents (omalizumab, mepolizumab and reslizumab) to treat severe asthma with frequent exacerbations despite standard medical therapy. several others are either in clinical trials or in the development phase for the treatment of eosinophilic asthma. to date, agents targeting neutrophilic inflammation have been largely unsuccessful. bronchial thermoplasty has emerged as an option for the treatment of severe asthma. summary the appropriate selection of patients through the use of eosinophilic biomarkers has led to significant reductions in exacerbations with the use of mab therapy. bronchial thermoplasty has also shown reductions in asthma exacerbations and improved quality of life; however, it is unclear which patients may respond best to this intervention.
hereditary_angioedema	background: angioedema is a vascular reaction involving the lower dermis, subcutis and/or submucosal tissue and causing a temporary localized swelling in any part of the body. for many health care professionals, the diagnosis presents an ongoing challenge; several disorders may manifest with subcutaneous or submucosal swelling and falsely be assumed to be angioedema. the clinicians at the emergency department and in the immunology/allergy clinics must be skilled at recognizing the features of angioedema and its differential diagnosis. methods: the review is based on a literature search with specific indexing terms in pubmed, a review of bibliographies and the authors' clinical experience. results: the most essential diseases that mimic angioedema, the so-called pseudoangioedemas, will each be discussed and illustrated by clinical photos, pointing out key features that help clarify the diagnoses and differentiate these from classic angioedema. conclusions: a variety of dermatologic conditions can cause swelling that resembles angioedema, some with a potentially fatal outcome if misdiagnosed. knowledge of pseudoangioedema is fundamental in the emergency setting when handling patients with edema and should be kept in mind when assessing an atypical angioedema case.

psoriatic_arthritis	background and purposeapremilast is an oral nonbiologic medication approved for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. this article summarizes the efficacy and safety of apremilast and provides characterization of the novel medication with clinical perspectives to successfully incorporate this therapy into practice for appropriate patients. data sourcesa review and synthesis of the results from the esteem (efficacy and safety trial evaluating the effects of apremilast in psoriasis) phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of apremilast for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was conducted. conclusionsresults from the esteem clinical trial program demonstrate that apremilast significantly reduces the severity of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, has an acceptable safety profile, and is generally well tolerated. implications for practicethe novel mechanism of action, convenience of oral administration, and acceptable side effect profile make this medication an attractive choice for clinicians treating patients with plaque psoriasis.
atrial_fibrillation	rotor locations and 1 year outcomes of firm ablation introductionpulmonary vein isolation (pvi) is currently the gold standard for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (af). the mechanism for af-maintenance is still controversial. the concept of rapidly activating spiral rotors perpetuating af has led to the development of several rotor-mapping systems. we present our experience with focal impulse and rotor modulation (firm) using a 64-electrode basket catheter and computational system and evaluate its feasibility in conjunction with pvi to treat af. methods and resultstwenty-five patients underwent firm mapping and ablation to treat af (paroxysmal = 10, 40%). a basket catheter was used for rotor identification within the right atrium (ra) then left atrium (la). radiofrequency energy was applied at and around each rotor core for 300 seconds and rotor-mapping and ablation was repeated until all rotors were eliminated before circumferential pvi was performed. three (1.0, 4.0) rotors were identified per patient, predominantly in the la (la = 59). note that 7/59 left-sided rotors were located 8/59 at the pv antrum. twelve (48%) patients had either af termination (termination = 6/12) or conversion to another rhythm, or cycle length (cl) prolongation 10% after rotor ablation. after a single procedure, 13 (52%) patients were free of atrial tachyarrhythmia after a follow-up period of 13 1 months. conclusionearly results suggest that firm-ablation can terminate af in a significant number of patients. rotors were frequently identified in the pvs and pv antrum, supporting pvi as the cornerstone of af ablation.
stress_management	background: mental skills training refers to the implementation of cognitive performance-enhancing strategies to promote optimal performance. we aimed to develop a surgery-specific mental skills curriculum (msc) and obtain initial evidence of efficacy. methods: the developed msc consisted of 8 proven performance-enhancing modules. its efficacy was assessed during laparoscopic simulator-based practice by novices using validated instruments of mental skills, workload, and stress, in addition to a skill transfer test to a porcine model. a paired t test was used to analyze the data. results: nine surgical novices completed the curriculum. compared with baseline assessment, participants improved significantly their laparoscopic performance and mental skills after completion of the msc. all participants completed the task in the porcine model without an appreciable change in their perceived stress. during the skill transfer test, 8 participants were observed using mental skills taught in the msc. conclusions: a surgery-specific simulator-based msc was developed, and its efficacy in improving mental skills and surgical performance was supported during a surgical skill transfer test.

atrial_fibrillation	backgroundwhile left atrial (la) enlargement is known as an early sign of left heart disease with prognostic implications in heart failure (hf), the importance of right atrial (ra) enlargement is less well studied, and the prognostic implications of interatrial size comparison are insufficiently understood. the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that ra area larger than la area in apical four-chamber view is associated with all-cause mortality in elderly patients with hf independent of left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef). methodsretrospectively, 289 patients above 65years hospitalized for hf between april 2007 and april 2008, and who underwent an echocardiogram, were enrolled. all-cause mortality was registered during a follow-up of at least 56months. baseline parameters measured were ra area, la area, la volume, lvef, left ventricular mass (lvm), tissue doppler systolic velocity of right ventricular free wall (smrv), presence of severe tricuspid regurgitation (tr), tricuspid gradient, central venous pressure, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, as well as some parameters of diastolic function. resultsin univariate analysis ra larger than la was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [hr] of 1.88, p<.001). the relation of ra larger than la to all-cause mortality remained even after adjusting for age, heart rate, lvef, atrial fibrillation, percutaneous coronary intervention, lvm index, la volume index, smrv, and the presence of severe tr (hr: 1.79, p=.04). conclusionra larger than la, independently of lvef, is associated with all-cause mortality in elderly patients hospitalized due to hf.
mental_health	background injury can greatly impact patients' long-term quality of life. resilience refers to an individual 's ability to positively adapt after facing stress or trauma. the objective of this study was to examine the relationship between preinjury resiliency scores and quality of life after injury. methods two hundred twenty-five adults admitted with an injury severity score greater than 10 but without neurologic injury were included. the 36-item short form was administered at the time of admission and repeated at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months after injury. the connor-davidson resilience scale was completed at admission and scores were categorized into high resiliency or not high resiliency. group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct recovery trajectories for physical component scores (pcs) and mental component scores (mcs) of the 36-item short form. multinomial logistic regression was used to determine whether baseline resiliency scores were predictive of pcs and mcs recovery trajectories. results age, race, sex, mechanism of injury, charlson comorbidity index, injury severity score, presence of hypotension on admission, and insurance status were not associated with high resiliency. compared with those who made less than us $10,000 per year, those who made more than us $50,000 per year had higher odds of being in the high resilience group (odds ratio, 10.92; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-46.32). three pcs and 5 mcs trajectories were identified. there was no relationship between resilience and pcs trajectory. however, patients with high resiliency scores were 85% less likely to belong to trajectory 1, the trajectory that had the lowest mental health scores over the course of the study. follow-up for the study was 93.8% for month 1, 82.7% for month 2, 69.4% for month 4, and 63.6% for month 12. conclusion patient resiliency predicts quality of life after injury in regards to mental health with over 25% of patients suffering poor mental health outcome trajectories. efforts to teach resiliency skills to injured patients could improve long-term mental health for injured patients. trauma centers are well positioned to carry out such interventions. level of evidence prognostic/epidemiologic study, level iii.
dementia	we investigated whether donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, can be used to treat sleep disturbances in patients with dementia with lewy bodies (dlb). sleep disturbances were evaluated with the sleep disturbances item of the neuropsychiatric inventory (npi) and an actigraph in 16 dlb patients and 24 normal elderly control (nc) subjects. the presence/absence of nine kinds of sleep symptoms, such as dream enactment, were also evaluated in the dlb patients. the dlb patients were then given 5 mg/day donepezil for 14 weeks and evaluated again. eight of the 16 dlb patients had some sleep disturbances before taking donepezil. the actigraphy data indicated that average activity count per minute in sleep (aac), which reflects body activity at night, was significantly higher and total sleep time was significantly longer in dlb patients than in nc subjects. the npi sleep disturbances score significantly improved and the number of dlb patients who had sleep disturbances decreased after taking donepezil. the actigraphy results indicate that the sum of all wake epochs within the sleep period, which reflects the degree of fragmented sleep, and the aac decreased in the dlb patients after donepezil treatment. these results indicate that donepezil treatment reduced sleep disturbances in dlb patients.
bipolar_disorder	background: depression is a common health condition affecting up to a third of patients attending primary care, where most of the care for people with depression is provided. adequate recognition of depression is the critical step in the path to effective care, particularly in low income countries. as part of the programme for improving mental healthcare (prime), a project supporting the implementation of integrated mental healthcare in primary care, we evaluated the level of recognition of depression by clinicians working in primary care in rural ethiopia prior to in service training. we hypothesised that the detection rate of depression will be under 10% and that detection would be affected by gender, education and severity of depression. methods: cross-sectional survey in eight health centres serving a population of over 160,000 people. a validated version of the 9-item patient health questionnaire (phq-9) was administered as an indicator of probable depression. in addition, primary care clinicians completed a clinician encounter form. participants were consecutive primary care attendees aged 18 years and above. results: a total of 1014 participants were assessed. primary care clinicians diagnosed 13 attendees (1.3%) with depression. the phq9 prevalence of depression at a cut-off score of ten was 11.5% (n = 117), of whom 5% (n = 6/117) had received a diagnosis of depression by primary care clinicians. attendees with higher phq scores and suicidality were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis of depression by clinicians. women (n = 9/13) and participants with higher educational attainment were more likely to be diagnosed with depression, albeit non-significantly. all cases diagnosed with depression by the clinicians had presented with psychological symptoms. conclusion: although not based on a gold standard diagnosis, over 98% of cases with phq-9 depression were undetected. failure of recognition of depression may pose a serious threat to the scale up of mental healthcare in low income countries. addressing this threat should be an urgent priority, and requires a better understanding of the nature of depression and its presentation in rural low-income primary care settings.
ankylosing_spondylitis	in this report, we aim to add to the existing body of evidence regarding a link between anti- tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-tnf-alpha) treatment and demyelination leading to neurological disorders, specifically guillain barr, syndrome (gbs), and treatment with an interleukin-17a (il17a) antagonist as a safe alternative for ankylosing spondylitis (as). a literature review was carried out of current research concerning anti-tnf-alpha and induced gbs. only papers published in english were reviewed and only peer-reviewed journals searched. papers published up to september 2016 were included. animal studies were excluded. data bases searched for publications online included: pub med, google scholar, the cochrane library, and web of science. searched terms include ""anti-tnf"" and ""guillain barr,"", ""il17 ankylosing spondylitis"", ""secukinumab"" and ""tnf-alpha"", ""adalimumab"", ""infliximab"", and ""etanercept"". all combinations and outcomes were used, and from these searches, a provisional reference list was constructed. the short-listed articles were read and their reference lists were reviewed. the electromyogram done for the patient showed demyelination, the mri of the brain showed no pathologies, and the mri of the spine was consistent with ankylosing spondylitis without myelopathy. the lumbar puncture results showed albuminocytological dissociation that was consistent with gbs. tnf has a proinflammatory action, and various immunoregulatory actions that, together, seem to promote the development of peripheral neuropathies syndromes in the organism. however, there is no clear mechanism of why or how anti-tnf-alpha treatment can induce a demyelinating event in a patient. in the case presented, it was found that the patient developed gbs due to treatment with etanercept, an anti-tnf agent. the treatment was stopped immediately. two years later, he was switched to secukinumab and has been well controlled for the last 8 months with no neurological findings.
bipolar_disorder	bipolar disorder as it is currently treated in the community and in academic settings is associated with a surprisingly high-degree morbidity and treatment resistance. while some of this poor outcome may be due to inherent difficulties of the illness itself, much of the difficulty appears attributable to less than optimal pharmacotherapeutic approaches and patient education about the illness. we emphasize the conceptualization of the illness progressing in an untoward direction, driven by several types of sensitization mechanisms, each involving epigenetic changes. epigenetics refers to environmentally- induced chemical changes in dna, histones, and micro rna structure and function which endure in a long-lasting fashion. this potential for accumulating epigenetic marks from recurrent stressors, episodes and bouts of substance abuse speaks to the importance of early and consistent long term pharmacoprophylaxis starting after a first episode of mania in order to prevent illness progression. we review the emerging evidence for a new recommendation for ultraintensive treatment after a first manic episode and the wealth of data indicating the importance of having lithium involved in the treatment regimen. problems of bipolar illness morbidity and treatment resistance are particularly pronounced in the united states (usa). compared to many european countries, bipolar illness in the usa appears to have an earlier age of onset, run a more difficult course, and have more psychiatric and medical comorbidities. this greater complexity of illness typically requires not monotherapy as is often recommended, but complex combination therapy with multiple medications targeting multiple symptoms and pathways. if instituted judiciously, the use of more medications can lead not only to better efficacy, but also, contrary to convention wisdom, fewer side effects. it is hoped that reconceptualization of bipolar illness as a progressive one that can undergo malignant transformation if not adequately treated will help lead to revisions in conventional treatment practices that will render the illness more benign it its long-term outcome.
addiction	the main aim of this study was to understand how adolescents express their identities in virtual worlds. fifty-nine south african high school learners (females = 51%) completed an interview and survey regarding their online interactions important for their personal identities. the adolescents completed think aloud interviews (verbalisations) and surveys which focussed on behaviour, beliefs, attitudes, opinions, feelings, expectations, self-classification, and level of involvement with social media. the data were thematically analysed and profiled by theme utilising frequency distributions. the results suggest adolescents to try out' new identities; including assumed and idealised identities. they self-report to do and say things online that they ordinarily would not do offline for social desirability reasons. adolescents appear to inhabit two reality worlds important for the enactment of the identities they construct with online friends and strangers.
smoking_cessation	rationale: graphic health warnings (ghws) on cigarette packages present an important tobacco control opportunity, particularly for vulnerable populations suffering a disproportionate tobacco burden. one mechanism by which ghws may influence smoking outcomes is by prompting interpersonal discussions within health discussion networks (the set of personal contacts with whom an individual discusses health issues). objective: the study examined the association between ghw-prompted conversations within health discussion networks and key tobacco-related outcomes, with attention to valence and content of the discussions. method: between august 2013 and april 2014, we recruited 1200 individuals from three communities in massachusetts, emphasizing recruitment of individuals of low socioeconomic position (sep) and members of other selected vulnerable groups. respondents were exposed to the nine ghws proposed by the fda in 2011, asked a series of questions, and assessed at follow-up a few weeks later. results: a total of 806 individuals were included in this analysis. about 51% of respondents reported having a health discussion network, with significantly lower reports among african-americans and hispanics compared to whites. around 70% of respondents (smokers and nonsmokers) with health discussion networks reported having one or more conversations about the ghws with network members, the bulk of which were negative and focused on warning others about smoking. for smokers, we found a small but positive association between the percentage of network conversations that were negative and reports of quit attempts. conclusion: the results point to a potential mechanism by which ghws may impact tobacco-related outcomes, prompting further inquiry into the role of health discussion networks (and discussion networks, more broadly) in tobacco control among low sep individuals.

rheumatoid_arthritis	the aim of this study was to analyze relationships between receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b (rankl), sclerostin and their gene polymorphisms with radiological progression in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). patients with early ra (n = 407, symptomatic < 1 year) (ara criteria) examined radiologically at inclusion and after 24 months were consecutively included. disease activity score and c-reactive protein were regularly recorded. sclerostin, rankl, and anti-ccp2 antibodies were analyzed in plasma at baseline using elisas. data on gene polymorphism for sclerostin and rankl were extracted from immunochip analysis. sex- and age-matched controls (n = 71) were identified from the medical biobank of northern sweden. the concentration of rankl was significantly higher in patients compared with controls, median (iqr) 0.56 (0.9) nmol/l and 0.20 (0.25) nmol/l (p < 0.001), and in anti-ccp2-positive patients compared with sero-negative individuals. sclerostin was significantly increased in female patients 0.59 (0.47-0.65) ng/ml compared with female controls 0.49 (0.4-0.65) ng/ml (p < 0.02). rankl concentration was related to the larsen score at baseline (p < 0.01), after 24 months (p < 0.001), and to radiological progression at 24 months (p < 0.001). positivity of rankl and anti-ccp2 yielded significant risk for progression with negativity for both as reference. no single nucleotide polymorphism encoding tnfsf11 or sost was associated with increased concentrations of the factors. the concentration of rankl was related to the larsen score at baseline, at 24 months, and radiological progression at 24 months particularly in anti-ccp2-positive patients, while the concentration of sclerostin was unrelated to radiological findings.
asthma	purpose of review this review will catalog the many recent longitudinal studies that have investigated the relationship between asthma and lung function, or the persistence and trajectories of lung function deficits. recent findings recent work has reported on 50-year follow-ups of some prominent population cohorts. a history of asthma confers a 10-30-fold risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. individuals reaching a reduced maximum growth of forced expiratory volume in 1 s in early adulthood are at risk for early or more severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). summary taken together, there is a wealth of overlapping cohort studies of lung function, asthma and copd. these show that asthma is associated with reduced lung function, which may start in infancy or prenatally, persists through childhood and adulthood and predisposes for early or more severe copd.
stress_management	objectivesseveral studies have shown that perseverative, worrisome thoughts are prospectively related to subjective health complaints (shc) and that a short worry postponement intervention can decrease these complaints. as shc and worry are prevalent and costly, we tested whether the intervention can be offered online to reduce these complaints in the general population. designa randomized parallel-group trial was conducted with self-selected participants from the general population. methodsvia the research website, 996 participants were instructed to register their worrying for 6 consecutive days. the intervention group was instructed to postpone worry to a special 30-min period in the early evening. the subjective health complaints inventory, as administered before and after the intervention, and daily worry frequency and duration were considered the primary outcomes. resultsthree hundred and sixty-one participants completed the study. contrary to our expectation, the registration group (n=188) did not differ from the intervention group (n=163) in shc (p2=.000, ci [0.000-0.003]), or in worry frequency or duration. nevertheless, the different worry parameters were moderately related to shc (r between .238 and .340, p.001). conclusionsin contrast to previous studies using pen-and-pencil versions of the worry postponement intervention, this study suggests that a direct online implementation was not effective in reducing shc and worry. overall, participants had high trait worry levels and reported difficulty with postponing worrying. reducing shc and worries via the internet might require more elaborate interventions that better incorporate the advantages of delivering interventions online. what is already known on this subject? the perseverative cognition hypothesis argues that perseverative cognition, such as worry and rumination, acts as a mediator by which psychosocial stress may produce negative health effects. prior research has indeed shown that worry and subjective health complaints (shc) are prospectively related, but causality studies - that is, showing that changes in worry induce changes in health outcomes - are scarce and have mainly been conducted in young samples. these studies showed that reducing worry, using a worry postponement intervention, can reduce daily worrying and shc. what does this study add? trait and daily worrying are associated with shc. an online worry postponement intervention is ineffective in reducing worry and shc. paper-and-pencil interventions cannot directly be used as online interventions.
medicare	objectives/hypothesis: endoscopic management of bilateral vocal fold paralysis (bvfp) includes cordotomy and arytenoidectomy, and has become a well-accepted alternative to tracheostomy. however, the costs and quality-of-life benefits of endoscopic management have not been examined with formal economic analysis. this study undertakes a cost-effectiveness analysis of tracheostomy versus endoscopic management of bvfp. study design: cost-effectiveness analysis. methodsa literature review identified a range of costs and outcomes associated with surgical options for bvfp. additional costs were derived from medicare reimbursement data; all were adjusted to 2014 dollars. cost-effectiveness analysis evaluated both therapeutic strategies in short-term and long-term scenarios. probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess confidence levels regarding the economic evaluation. results: the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for endoscopic management versus tracheostomy is $31,600.06 per quality-adjusted life year (qaly), indicating that endoscopic management is the cost-effective short-term strategy at a willingness-to-pay (wtp) threshold of $50,000/qaly. the probability that endoscopic management is more cost-effective than tracheostomy at this wtp is 65.1%. threshold analysis demonstrated that the model is sensitive to both utilities and cost in the short-term scenario. when costs of long-term care are included, tracheostomy is dominated by endoscopic management, indicating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic management at any wtp. conclusions: endoscopic management of bvfp appears to be more cost-effective than tracheostomy. though endoscopic cordotomy and arytenoidectomy require expertise and specialized equipment, this model demonstrates utility gains and long-term cost advantages to an endoscopic strategy. these findings are limited by the relative paucity of robust utility data and emphasize the need for further economic analysis in otolaryngology.
addiction	glutamatergic projections to nucleus accumbens (nac) drive drug-seeking behaviors during opioids withdrawal. modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission provides a novel pharmacotherapeutic avenue for treatment of opioids dependence. great deals of researches have verified that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (trpv1) channels alters synaptic transmitter release and regulate neural plasticity. in the present study, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were adopted to examine the activity of trpv1 channels in regulating glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) in nac of rat during morphine withdrawal for 3 days and 3 weeks. the data showed that the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sepscs) and the amplitudes of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eepscs) were increased during morphine withdrawal after applied with capsaicin (trpv1 agonist). capsaicin decreased the paired pulse ratio (ppr) and increased sepscs frequency but not their amplitudes suggesting a presynaptic locus of action during morphine withdrawal. all these effects were fully blocked by the trpv1 antagonist capsazepine. additionally, in the presence of am251 (cb1 receptor antagonist), depolarization-induced release of endogenous cannabinoids activated trpv1 channels to enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission during morphine withdrawal. the functional enhancement of trpv1 channels in facilitating glutamatergic transmission was not recorded in dorsal striatum. our findings demonstrate the ability of trpv1 in regulating excitatory glutamatergic transmission is enhanced during morphine withdrawal in nac, which would deepen our understanding of glutamatergic modulation during opioids withdrawal.

medicare	hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is among the most common types of cancer. liver transplantation (lt) and surgical resection (sr) are primary surgical treatment options for hcc. the aim of the study was to assess mortality within 2 years postdiagnosis among patients with hcc according to their treatment modalities. we examined data from the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer)-medicare database between 2001 and 2009. seer registries collect demographics, cancer stage and historical types, and treatments. medicare claims include diagnoses, procedures, and survival status for each beneficiary. patients with hcc were identified using the international classification of disease oncology, third edition site code c22.0 and histology code 8170-8175. treatment modalities were lt, sr, or nonsurgical treatment. total of 11,187 cases was included (age at diagnosis: 72 years, 69% male, 67% white). hcc patients who underwent lt were younger (61 vs 71 years), sicker (presence of decompensated cirrhosis: 80% vs 23%), and less likely to die within 2 years (29% vs 44%, all p<0.01), compared to sr patients. in multivariate analysis, older age (hr: 1.01 [95% ci = 1.01-1.01]), stage of hcc other than local (hr: 1.81[95% ci = 1.70-1.91]), and being treated with sr (hr: 1.95 [95% ci = 1.55-2.46]) were independent predictors of mortality within 2 years. furthermore, the presence of decompensated cirrhosis (hr: 1.84 [95% ci = 1.73-1.96]) and alcoholic liver disease (hr: 1.19[95% ci = 1.11-1.28]) increased within 2 years mortality. mortality within 2 years postdiagnosis of hcc was significantly higher in patients treated with sr than lt.
medicare	backgroundin recent years, the superior accuracy of maternal plasma cell-free dna-based prenatal screening has resulted in >50% national decline in amniocenteses and chorionic villus sampling (cvs), creating new implications for specialist training. objectiveto compare the annual figures on amniocenteses and cvs in a tertiary hospital with national population-based trends between 2012 and 2015. methodsretrospective study examining the amniocentesis and cvs procedures performed in a tertiary hospital between 2012 and 2015. numbers of procedures, indications for testing, type of test and diagnostic results were analysed. trends in the annual numbers of procedures were compared to national population-based data from medicare benefits schedule database. resultsthe annual numbers of diagnostic procedures in our tertiary centre fell from 267 to 215 over the study period, representing a 19.5% decline. this was significantly smaller than the corresponding national decline of 53.7% for the same period (p<0.0001). in 2015, ultrasound abnormality (including nuchal translucency 3.5mm) surpassed high-risk screening results as the most common indication for invasive testing. thirty percent of procedures performed for an ultrasound abnormality occurred prior to 18weeks gestation. conclusionour tertiary centre experienced a relatively smaller decline in prenatal diagnostic procedures compared with national figures, largely due to an increase in testing for ultrasound abnormalities. our results demonstrate the increasing contribution of first trimester ultrasound in the detection of fetal abnormalities in the cell-free dna era and the continued viability of specialist training in invasive procedures.
addiction	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a risk for substance use disorders. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between adult adhd symptoms, opioid use disorder, life dysfunction and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. 1057 heroin dependent patients on opioid substitution treatment participated in the survey. all patients were screened for adult adhd symptoms using the adult adhd self-report scale (asrs-v1.1). 19.4% of the patients screened positive for concurrent adult adhd symptoms status and heroin dependence. education level was lower among patients with adhd symptoms, but not significant with respect to non-adhd patients. patients with greater adhd symptoms severity were less likely to be employed. a positive association was observed between adhd symptoms status and psychiatric symptoms. patients with adhd symptoms status were more likely to be smokers. patients on methadone had a higher rate of adhd symptoms status compared to buprenorphine. those individuals prescribed psychoactive drugs were more likely to have adhd symptoms. in conclusion, high rate of adhd symptoms was found among heroin dependent patients, particularly those affected by the most severe form of addiction. these individuals had higher rates of unemployment, other co-morbid mental health conditions, heavy tobacco smoking. additional psychopharmacological interventions targeting adhd symptoms, other than opioid substitution, is a public health need.
atopic_dermatitis	ceramides based on phytosphingosine, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine are essential constituents of the skin lipid barrier that protects the body from excessive water loss. the roles of the individual ceramide subclasses in regulating skin permeability and the reasons for c4-hydroxylation of these sphingolipids are not completely understood. we investigated the chain length-dependent effects of dihydroceramides, sphingosine ceramides (with c4-unsaturation) and phytoceramides (with c4-hydroxyl) on the permeability, lipid organization and thermotropic behavior of model stratum corneum lipid membranes composed of ceramide/lignoceric acid/cholesterol/cholesteryl sulfate. phytoceramides with very long c24 acyl chains increased the permeability of the model lipid membranes compared to dihydroceramides or sphingosine ceramides with the same chain lengths. either unsaturation or c4-hydroxylation of dihydroceramides induced chain length-dependent increases in membrane permeability. infrared spectroscopy showed that c4-hydroxylation of the sphingoid base decreased the relative ratio of orthorhombic chain packing in the membrane and lowered the miscibility of c24 phytoceramide with lignoceric acid. the phase separation in phytoceramide membranes was confirmed by x-ray diffraction. in contrast, phytoceramides formed strong hydrogen bonds and highly thermostable domains. thus, the large heterogeneity in ceramide structures and in their aggregation mechanisms may confer resistance towards the heterogeneous external stressors that are constantly faced by the skin barrier.

anxiety	this case features an adult male with moderate social anxiety disorder and mild depressive symptoms who showed an initial positive response to an earlier experience of cognitive behavior therapy, but then relapsed when he started avoiding social situations again because of continuing beliefs that experiencing anxiety was unacceptable. his treatment at our clinic focused on shifting unhelpful thinking about the likelihood and consequences of becoming anxious and reengaging in avoided social situations so he could learn to tolerate negative affect and uncertainty. the treatment approach draws from cognitive behavioral models of social anxiety and highlights advances in clinical science, especially recent work on the causal role of interpretation biases (the tendency to assign negative or threatening meaning to ambiguous situations) in the maintenance and reduction of anxiety.

atrial_fibrillation	background: this study aimed to establish the changes in the incidence and characteristics of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (ii-hyper) and iodine-induced hypothyroidism (ii-hypo) in the two-year period before and the 10-year period after the increase in mandatory salt iodization from the previous 10 mg/kg of potassium iodide to 25 mg/kg in 1999. furthermore, the aim was to determine the duration of treatment in ii-hyper patients, since no data regarding severity and treatment of ii-hyper with respect to iodine supply are available. methods: this retrospective study reviewed medical records of 885 slovenian patients first diagnosed with ii-hyper or ii-hypo between 1998 and 2009 at the thyroid department of the university medical centre ljubljana. ii-hyper and ii-hypo were diagnosed by one out of 10 senior internal medicine specialists. the diagnosis was based on an adequate patient history, and laboratory measurements of thyrotropin, thyroid hormones, and thyroid antibodies. in most cases, thyroid ultrasound and thyroid scintigraphy were performed. demographic characteristics and the type and the duration of treatment were also reviewed. results: the incidence of ii-hypo was significantly higher after the increase in iodine supply than it was before (p < 0.001). after the increase in iodine supply, the incidence of ii-hyper was significantly lower than before the increase (p < 0.001). furthermore, the portion of patients with overt hyperthyroidism decreased, predominantly due to the increased proportion of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism (p = 0.007 and p = 0.015, respectively). the duration of treatment with antithyroid drugs and perchlorate was significantly shorter after the increase in iodine supply than it was before (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). a significantly positive correlation between the year of the occurrence of excessive iodine intake (eii)-induced thyroid disease and the duration of treatment with amiodarone was found (r= 0.132; p = 0.048), suggesting that the longer the patients had an adequate iodine supply, the longer they could take amiodarone before eii-induced thyroid disorder developed. conclusions: after the increase in iodine supply, a higher incidence of ii-hypo and a lower incidence of ii-hyper were observed than before the increase. less severe ii-hyper, shorter duration of treatment of ii-hyper, as well as a longer thyroid disease-free period in patients on amiodarone are additional beneficial clinical consequences after the establishment of an adequate iodine supply.
atrial_fibrillation	background antihyperglycemic drugs have been linked to new-onset atrial fibrillation (naf). however, the effect of the different classes of antihyperglycemic drugs on the development of naf in elderly patients has not been well studied. in this study, we investigated the association between different classes of antihyperglycemic drugs and naf in elderly patients materials and methods this was a nested case-control study performed using the database of national health insurance programme in taiwan. each participant aged 65 years and older who were naf from 2005 to 2012 were assigned to the naf group, whereas case was sex-, age-, diabetes duration-, index date-matched, and charlson comorbidity index score-matched randomly selected participant without naf were assigned to the non-naf group. multivariable logistic regression model was used for the estimation of odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) of naf associated with use of different classes of antihyperglycemic agents. nonusers served as the reference group. results we identified 1958 cases and 7832 controls. the risk of naf after adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities and concurrent medication was higher among the users of insulin than among the nonusers (or, 158; 95% ci, 137-182). patients who took dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors were at lower risk of developing naf than the nonusers (or, 065; 95% ci, 045-093). conclusions in this population, use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor was associated with a low risk of naf. insulin use was associated with a significant increase in the risk of naf during the long-term follow-up.
children's_health	this paper reports on the systematic search and review of the literature relating to the health and wellbeing of young children across the transition to school. it identified 56 papers (including empirical studies, reviews, commentaries, and reports) relevant to the research questions and completed an interpretive systematic review to ascertain the current state of the literature. the review employed the critical interpretive synthesis (cis) method to allow for a rigorous and systematic review of a disparate literature which stretches across several disciplines. the findings are presented in seven thematic categories: current conceptualisations of health and wellbeing, assessment and measurement, school readiness', service integration, transition actors, at risk' children, and child voice. these findings illustrate the ways in which concepts have been constructed, identified, and operationalised in early years research, practice, and policy. moreover, it highlights that what is known' can be used to inform the review or implementation of services, practices, and partnerships that support child health and wellbeing during the transition to school.
atrial_fibrillation	we investigated a quantitative imaging of reduced scattering coefficients mu(s)'(lambda) and the absorption coefficients mu(a)(lambda) of in vivo cortical tissues in the range from visible to near-infrared (nir) wavelengths based on diffuse reflectance spectral imaging technique. in this method, diffuse reflectance images of in vivo cortical tissue are acquired at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm). a multiple regression analysis aided by the monte carlo simulation for the absorbance spectra is then utilized to estimate the optical coefficients of cortical tissue. this analysis calculates the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, the scattering amplitude a and the scattering power b. the spectrum of absorption coefficient is deduced from the estimated concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. the spectrum of reduced scattering coefficient is determined by the estimated scattering amplitude and scattering power. the particle size distribution of microstructure is calculated from the estimated scattering power b for evaluating the morphological change in brain tissue quantitatively. animal experiments with in vivo exposed brain of rats demonstrated that the responses of the absorption properties to hyperoxic and anoxic conditions are in agreement with the expected well-known cortical hemodynamics. the average particle size was significantly reduced immediately after the onset of anoxia and then it was changed into an increase, which implied the swelling and shrinkage of the cellular and subcellular structures induced by loss of tissue viability in brain tissue.
osteoarthritis	purpose predictive factors for long-term outcome after in situ fixation for chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis (scfe) have so far not been systematically analysed. the aims of this study were to define predictors for long-term outcome and to assess the association between initial grade of slipping and post-slip deformities. methods we studied 51 patients (60 hips) with chronic scfe treated with in situ fixation. there were 31 males and 20 females with a mean age of 12.9 years. the mean follow-up was 39.0 years (21.1 to 56.8). post-slip deformity was defined as abnormal alpha (alpha) angles in anteroposterior (ap) and lateral radiographs; ap angle of 74 degrees and lateral angle of 63 degrees were used as cutoffs between normal and abnormal alpha-angles. harris hip score (hhs) less than 85 points was classified as a poor clinical outcome and osteoarthritis was a poor radiographic outcome. results the mean slip angle was 31.7 degrees (12 degrees to 77 degrees the mean ap alpha-angle was 67.4 degrees (36 degrees to 111 degrees and the mean lateral a-angle was 57.1 degrees (22 degrees to 104 degrees post-slip deformities developed in almost one-third of hips with a mild degree of slipping and in about half the hips with more pronounced degrees of slipping. the long-term outcome was good in 40 hips (67%) and poor in 20 hips. a small ap alpha-angle was the only independent prognostic factor for a good combined clinical and radiographic outcome. conclusion post-slip deformity, defined as an abnormally high ap alpha-angle, is the most important prognostic factor for poor long-term clinical and radiographic outcome in chronic scfe treated with in situ fixation.
bipolar_disorder	catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) inactivates catecholamines, val/val genotype was associated to an increased amygdala (amy) response to negative stimuli and can influence the symptoms severity and the outcome of bipolar disorder, probably mediated by the comt polymorphism (rs4680) interaction between cortical and subcortical dopaminergic neurotransmission. the aim of this study is to explore how rs4680 and implicit emotional processing of negative emotional stimuli could interact in affecting the amy connectivity in bipolar depression. forty-five bd patients (34 met carriers vs. 11 val/val) underwent fmri scanning during implicit processing of fearful and angry faces. we explore the effect of rs4680 on the strength of functional connectivity from the amygdalae to whole brain. val/val and met carriers significantly differed for the connectivity between amy and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and supramarginal gyrus. val/val patients showed a significant positive connectivity for all of these areas, where met carriers presented a significant negative one for the connection between dlpfc and amy. our findings reveal a comt genotype-dependent difference in corticolimbic connectivity during affective regulation, possibly identifying a neurobiological underpinning of clinical and prognostic outcome of bd. specifically, a worse antidepressant recovery and clinical outcome previously detected in val/val patients could be associated to a specific increased sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: it is unclear whether health related quality of life (hrql) may have a predictive value for mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). we investigated the relationship between hrql assessed using the st. george 's respiratory questionnaire (sgrq) and survival time in patients with ipf, and tried to determine a clinical meaningful cut off value to predict poorer survival rates. methods: we retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with ipf who underwent an initial evaluation from may 2007 to december 2012. the diagnosis of ipf was made according to the 2011 international consensus guidelines. we used cox proportional hazard models to identify independent predictors for mortality rate in patients with ipf. results: we examined 182 eligible cases, average age was 66 years old, and 86% were male. mean levels of percent predicted fvc, dlco, six-minute-walk test distance, and the sgrq total score were around 80%, 58%, 580 m, and 34 points. on multivariate analysis, the sgrq total score (hazard ratio [hr], 1.012; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.001-1.023; p = .029) and percent predicted fvc (hr, 0.957; 95% ci 0.944-0.971, p < .001) were independent predictors for mortality rate. moreover, a score higher than 30 points in the sgrq total score showed higher mortality rate (hr, 2.047; 95% ci, 1.329-3.153; p = .001). conclusions: the sgrq total score was one of independent prognostic factors in patients with ipf. total scores higher than 30 points were associated with higher mortality rates.
anxiety	background: blood-injection-injury (b-i-i) phobia is capable of producing inaccurate hypoxic challenge testing results due to anxiety-induced hyperventilation. case report: a 69-yr-old woman with a history of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, restrictive spirometry, exercise desaturation requiring supplementary oxygen on mobilizing, reduced dlco, and b-i-i phobia was referred for hypoxic challenge testing (hct) to assess in-flight oxygen requirements. hct was performed by breathing a 15% f(i)o(2) gas mixture, simulating the available oxygen in ambient air onboard aircraft pressurized to an equivalent altitude of 8000 ft. s(p)o(2) fell to a nadir value of 81% during hct, although it rapidly increased to 89% during the first of two attempts at blood gas sampling. a resultant blood gas sample showed an acceptable po-2 outside the criteria for recommending in-flight oxygen and a reduced pco(2). entering the nadir s(p)o(2) value into the severinghaus equation gives an estimated arterial po-2 of 6 kpa (45 mmhg), which was felt to be more representative of resting values during hct, and in-flight oxygen was recommended. discussion: while hyperventilation is an expected response to hypoxia, transient rises in s(p)o(2) coinciding with threat of injury are likely to be attributable to emotional stress-induced hyperventilation, characteristic of b-i-i specific phobia and expected during the anticipation of exteroceptive threat, even in normal subjects. in summary, should excessive hyperventilation be detected during hct and coincide with transient increases in s(p)o(2), hct should be repeated using s(p)o(2) only as a guide to the level of hypoxemia, and spot maintained using supplementary oxygen in accordance with alternative methods described in guidelines.
rheumatoid_arthritis	this study examined the pathogenesis of early-onset sarcoidosis (eos) in a patient with a rare nod2 mutation and surveyed the literature to identify the hallmark features for early diagnosis. an infant girl suffering from prolonged fever and skin rash of multiple pinkish papules and subsequent erythema nodosum was referred to our institution. skin biopsy and dna sequencing were performed along with cytokine profiling of the patient 's serum and stimulated mononuclear cells. nf-kappa b activation was analyzed using transfected cells. multiple non-caseating granuloma inclusions were recognized in biopsy specimens obtained from the patient 's rash. dna sequencing revealed a very rare heterozygous met513thr (m513t) mutation in nod2. mononuclear cells produced a low amount of il-1 beta upon stimulation as compared with normal control cells. mutated nod2 transfection enhanced nf-kappa b activation. we suspected that the m513t mutation in nod2 decreased il-1 beta production and enhanced nf-kappa b activation, which was likely responsible for the patient 's granuloma involvement. a comprehensive review of the literature on 30 cases of sporadic type of eos revealed that all patients had cutaneous manifestations, with all but one displaying granulation. a majority of eos patients have r334w/q. but about half of sporadic eos had nod2 mutations other than r334w/q, as in the present case. accordingly, skin rash with granuloma formation and specific nod2 mutations may represent early diagnostic hallmarks of eos in infants with persistent inflammation.
smoking_cessation	objectives: to estimate life expectancy over 25 years in hiv-positive people and to compare their life expectancy with recent estimates for the general population, by education. methods: patients aged 20 years or older enrolled in the swiss hiv cohort study 19882013 were eligible. patients alive in 2001 were matched to up to 100 swiss residents, by sex, year of birth, and education. life expectancy at age 20 was estimated for monotherapy (1988-1991), dual therapy (1992-1995), early combination antiretro-viral therapy (cart, 1996-1998), later cart (1999-2005) and recent cart (20062013) eras. parametric survival regression was used to model life expectancy. results: in all, 16 532 hiv-positive patients and 927 583 residents were included. life expectancy at age 20 of hiv-positive individuals increased from 11.8 years [95% confidence interval (ci) 11.2-12.5] in the monotherapy era to 54.9 years (95% ci 51.2-59.6) in the most recent cart era. differences in life expectancy across educational levels emerged with cart. in the most recent cart period, life expectancy at age 20 years was 52.7 years (95% ci 46.4-60.1) with compulsory education, compared to 60.0 years (95% ci 53.4-67.8) with higher education. estimates for the general population were 61.5 and 65.6 years, respectively. male sex, smoking, injection drug use, and low cd4(+) cell counts at enrolment were also independently associated with mortality. conclusion: in switzerland, educational inequalities in life expectancy were larger among hiv-infected persons than in the general population. highly educated hiv-positive people have an estimated life expectancy similar to swiss residents with compulsory education. earlier start of cart and effective smoking-cessation programs could improve hiv-positive life expectancy further and reduce inequalities. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
medicare	objective. the purpose of this study is to assess features of patient satisfaction scores for u.s. radiologists using a popular physician rating website. materials and methods. patient reviews were retrieved from the website ratemds for all listed radiologists in all 297 u.s. cities with population 100,000 or greater. reviews included rating scores of 1-5 (5 = highest) in four categories (staff, punctuality, knowledge, and helpfulness). additional physician information was obtained from medicare files. common words in patient free-text comments were assessed. statistical analyses were performed. results. we identified 1891 patient reviews for 1259 radiologists. in all four categories, the most common score was 5 for excellent (62.7-74.3%), and the second most common score was 1 for terrible (13.5-20.4%); scores of 2-4 were far less frequent (1.9-11.6%). scores for all four categories highly correlated with one another (r = 0.781-0.951). radiologists in the northeast scored significantly lower (p < 0.001) than those elsewhere for both staff and punctuality. radiologists attending a designated top 50 medical school showed nonsignificant trends toward lower scores for helpfulness (p = 0.073) and knowledge (p = 0.062). the most common words in free-text comments for positive reviews were ""caring,"" ""knowledgeable,"" and ""professional."" for negative reviews, ""rude,"" ""pain,"" and ""unprofessional"" were most common. conclusion. overall, most radiologists rated online by their patients score well, but reviews tended to be either strongly positive or negative. scores across various categories are highly correlated, suggesting that there is a halo effect. radiologists should recognize the effect of both facility-and radiologist-related factors in influencing patients' overall perceptions.
mental_health	objectives patients with common mental disorders (cmds) often suffer from comorbidities, which may limit their functioning at work. we assessed the longitudinal impact of multimorbidity, defined as two or more co-occurring chronic health conditions, on work functioning over time among workers who had returned to work after sick leave due to cmds. methods prospective cohort study of 156 workers followed for 1 year after return to work from sick leave due to cmds. a multimorbidity score was computed by counting severity-weighted chronic health conditions measured at baseline. work functioning was measured at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up with the work role functioning questionnaire. work functioning trajectories, i.e. the course of work functioning after return to work over time, were identified through latent class growth analysis. results a total of 44 % of workers had multimorbidity. four work functioning trajectories were identified: one (12 % of the workers) showed increasing work functioning scores during follow-up, whereas the other trajectories showed low, medium and high scores (23, 41 and 25 %, respectively) that remained stable across time points. although multimorbidity did not predict membership in any trajectory, within the increasing score trajectory levels of work functioning were lower among those with high baseline multimorbidity score (p < 0.001). conclusions over time, multimorbidity negatively impacts work functioning after return to work from sick leave due to cmds.
psoriasis	psoriasis skin lesions are characterized by dramatic changes in the transcriptome, reflecting altered activity of multiple signalling pathways in resident and infiltrating cells. mirnas are small non-coding rnas that have a large impact on cellular functions by regulating multiple genes simultaneously, and they have been shown to play key roles in skin homoeostasis and inflammation. in this commentary to the review article micrornas in psoriasis: immunological functions and potential biomarkers by liu etal., the role of mirnas in psoriasis and their diagnostic and therapeutic potential are discussed and remaining unanswered questions are highlighted.
children's_health	background: atopic dermatitis (ad) is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical spectrum, and some forms of ad are associated with the initial steps of allergic march. the aims of this study were to determine ad phenotypes in school-age children and investigate their associations with the allergic march in each cluster. methods: we included 242 children (6-8 years) with current ad from the children 's health and environmental research study, a 4-year prospective follow-up study with 2-year survey intervals. latent class analysis was used. serum il-13 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tslp) levels at the time of enrollment were measured using elisa. results: we identified four current ad phenotypes in children, characterized as early onset with low atopy' (26.4% of the sample; group 1), early onset with high atopy and high eosinophil percentages' (48.3%; group 2), late onset with low atopy' (9.9%; group 3), and late onset with high atopy and normal eosinophils' (15.3%; group 4). although groups 2 and 4 demonstrated high atopic burden, children in group 2 showed the persistence of ad and eosinophilia associated with a high prevalence of new cases of bronchial hyper-responsiveness and asthma symptoms during follow-up. the serum il-13 level was significantly increased in the early-onset ad groups, but there was no significant difference in the serum tslp levels across all four groups. conclusion: an allergic march-associated ad phenotype exists that is characterized by early onset of ad with its persistence, increased serum il-13 levels, high atopy, and a persistently increased blood eosinophil percentage.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. to determine the effect of prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (tnfi) therapy on secukinumab efficacy in psoriatic arthritis (psa). methods. patients were randomized to secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg, or placebo. results. american college of rheumatology 20 responses at week 24 with secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg, and placebo were 58.2%, 63.5%, 36.9%, and 15.9% in tnfi-naive (n = 258), and 45.5%, 29.7%, 14.7%, and 14.3% in tnfi-exposed patients (n = 139), respectively. week 52 responses with secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg, and 75 mg were 68.7%, 79.4%, and 58.5% in tnfi-naive, and 54.5%, 37.8%, and 35.3% in tnfi-exposed patients, respectively. conclusion. secukinumab was efficacious in tnfi-naive and tnfi-exposed patients with psa, with greatest improvements in tnfi-naive patients.
children's_health	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to examine knowledge and attitudes about preconception health care among chinese immigrants in canada. design/methodology/approach - a cross-sectional internet-based survey, informed by the principles of the health belief model, was administered to a convenience sample in ottawa, canada. in total, 76 respondents from the chinese community participated in the online survey. findings - overall, participants demonstrated: low to moderate awareness of preconception related risk factors and preconception health; neutral to slightly positive attitudes toward carrying out preconception care; considerable confusion over the differences among preconception care, premarital health care (mainland china), and prenatal health care; great sensitivity to subjective norms related to spouses, parents, and friends; and a strong desire for receiving information and communication from health care professionals. practical implications - an emphasis on reducing misperceptions and offering information about the preconception period and potential severe pregnancy-related risks may contribute to a better knowledge and intended behavior toward preconception care among chinese immigrants, and ultimately optimize both their reproductive health and their future children 's health. originality/value - the cultural norms and population policies in the sending country may frame immigrants' knowledge and attitudes related to preconception health care. this study fills the gap in the literature regarding chinese immigrants' knowledge levels and attitudes toward preconception care in canada and thus offers insights into how to deliver culturally competent care and design effective communication strategies to reach out to ethnocultural communities.
crohn's_disease	background: adolescence is a vulnerable period for those afflicted with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). there is limited knowledge of factors influencing transition readiness in this population. we sought to determine whether self-efficacy and resilience would be informative predictors of transition readiness independent of age. methods: patients with ibd aged 16 to 23 years cared for in a pediatric setting were prospectively enrolled. on entry, patients filled out the transition readiness assessment questionnaire (traq); ibd self-efficacy scale-adolescent (ibd-ses-a); and the connor-davidson resilience scale. demographic data and disease-specific information were collected from the medical record and by the provider. general linear modeling and autocorrelation were performed to investigate predictors of transition readiness. results: eighty-seven patients (62 crohn 's disease and 25 ulcerative colitis) were included, with a median age of 19 years (interquartile range 1-3: 17-20; min-max: 16-23). after controlling for age, the ibd-ses-a predicted traq [f(1) = 11.69, r-2 = 0.16, p = 0.001], accounting for 16% of the variance. the connor-davidson resilience scale also independently predicted traq score [f(1) = 6.45, r-2 = 0.09, p = 0.01], accounting for 9% of the variance. the ibd-ses-a and connor-davidson resilience scale were significantly auto correlated (r = 0.044, p = 0.001); in the final predictive model, only ibd-ses-a was predictive of traq [f(1) = 4.01, r-2 = 0.12, p = 0.004]. none of the patients' demographic, disease, or socioeconomic parameters informed transition readiness once self-efficacy and resilience were considered. conclusions: this is the first study to identify a reliable predictor of transition readiness scores in adolescents with ibd that does not seem to be influenced by age.
atopic_dermatitis	the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (ad) has increased substantially. previous studies have focused mostly on pediatric patients, while epidemiological investigation on adult ad has been very limited. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical features of adult ad in outpatients with dermatitis and eczema in china mainland. a multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among outpatients with eczema or dermatitis from 39 tertiary hospitals of 15 provinces in china from july 1 to september 30, 2014. of 8758 patients, 407 were adult ad. compared with adults with other types of dermatitis, the mean age (41.8 +/- 14.3 vs 42.04 +/- 15.38 years, p < 0.05) and onset age (35.2 +/- 11.2 vs 39.2 +/- 14.0 years, p < 0.001) of adult ad were younger, and mean disease duration was longer (5.3 +/- 7.1 vs 2.8 +/- 4.9 years, p < 0.001). about 53.3% adult ad involved 3 or more body locations, higher than adults with other types of dermatitis (34.4%, p < 0.001), but lower than those with pediatric and adolescent ad (73.8%, p < 0.001). history of asthma (19.2% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001) or allergic conjunctivitis (21.9% vs 14.9%, p < 0.05) was more common in adult ad than pediatric/ adolescent ad. suspected bacterial infection was more frequently in adult ad than adults with other types of dermatitis (24.3% vs 14.6%, p < 0.001) and pediatric/ adolescent ad (24.3% vs 14.9%, p < 0.001). more severe itching was observed in 31.4% of adult ad, higher than that of adults with other types of dermatitis (15.4%, p0.05). the highest (8.7%) and lowest prevalence (3.7%) of adult ad were in 25 degrees n to 30 degrees n and 35 degrees n to 40 degrees n latitude region. a substantial part of adult outpatients with eczema or dermatitis is adult ad. middle age, more body location involvement, more suspected bacterial infection, and severe itching are the main clinical feathers of adult ad. geographical environment and economic situation work in synergy to adult ad.
autism	objective:neurodevelopmental concerns in males with sex chromosome aneuploidy (sca) (xxy/klinefelter syndrome, xyy, xxyy) include symptoms seen in autism spectrum disorder (asd), such as language impairments and social difficulties. we aimed to: (1) evaluate asd characteristics in research cohorts of sca males under dsm-iv compared to dsm-5 criteria, and (2) analyze factors associated with asd diagnoses in sca.methods:evaluation of participants with xxy/ks (n=20), xyy (n=57) and xxyy (n=21) included medical history, cognitive/adaptive testing, social communication questionnaire, social responsiveness scale, autism diagnostic observation schedule, autism diagnostic interview-revised, and dsm asd criteria. clinical impressions of asd diagnostic category using the ados and dsm-iv criteria were compared to ados-2 and dsm-5 criteria. t-tests compared cognitive, adaptive, ses and prenatal vs. postnatal diagnoses between asd and no asd groups.results:asd rates in these research cohorts were 10% in xxy/ks, 38% in xyy, and 52% in xxyy using ados-2/dsm-5, and were not statistically different compared to dsm-iv criteria. in xyy and xxyy, the asd group had lower verbal iq and adaptive functioning compared to those without asd. many children without asd still showed some social difficulties.conclusion:asd rates in males with sca are higher than reported for the general population. males with y chromosome aneuploidy (xyy and xxyy) were 4.8 times more likely to have a diagnosis of asd than the xxy/ks group, and 20 times more likely than males in the general population (1 in 42 males, cdc 2010). asd should be considered when evaluating social difficulties in sca. studies of sca and y-chromosome genes may provide insight into male predominance in idiopathic asd.
healthy_sleep	sensitizing young adults about sleep hygiene knowledge and helpful sleep attitudes may have the potential to instill long-lasting healthy sleep practices. towards these ends, evaluation of psychoeducational program sleep 101 tailored to college students was undertaken. following two weeks of sleep-log recordings, participants were randomly assigned to a sleep 101 (experimental) condition or a sleep monitoring (control) condition. the sleep 101 condition was comprised of two 90-minute workshops aimed to educate students about healthy sleep practices, helpful thoughts about sleep, and ways to improve sleep. the sleep monitoring group received a sleep hygiene handout and completed sleep logs for the study duration. sleep 101 participants endorsed fewer maladaptive beliefs and attitudes about sleep, increased sleep hygiene knowledge, and reduced sleep onset latency compared to the sleep monitoring participants. brief psychoeducational courses may be a cost-effective way to alleviate current, and/or prevent future, sleep problems in young adults.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	purpose human breath analysis is proposed with increasing frequency as a useful tool in clinical application. we performed this study to find the characteristic volatile organic compounds (vocs) in the exhaled breath of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) for discrimination from healthy subjects. methods vocs in the exhaled breath of 40 ipf patients and 55 healthy controls were measured using a multi-capillary column and ion mobility spectrometer. the patients were examined by pulmonary function tests, blood gas analysis, and serum biomarkers of interstitial pneumonia. results we detected 85 voc peaks in the exhaled breath of ipf patients and controls. ipf patients showed 5 significant voc peaks; p-cymene, acetoin, isoprene, ethylbenzene, and an unknown compound. the voc peak of p-cymene was significantly lower (p < 0.001), while the voc peaks of acetoin, isoprene, ethylbenzene, and the unknown compound were significantly higher (p < 0.001 for all) compared with the peaks of controls. comparing voc peaks with clinical parameters, negative correlations with vc (r =-0.393, p = 0.013), %vc (r =-0.569, p < 0.001), fvc (r = -0.440, p = 0.004), %fvc (r =-0.539, p < 0.001), dlco (r =-0.394, p = 0.018), and %dlco (r =-0.413, p = 0.008) and a positive correlation with kl-6 (r = 0.432, p = 0.005) were found for p-cymene. conclusion we found characteristic 5 vocs in the exhaled breath of ipf patients. among them, the voc peaks of p-cymene were related to the clinical parameters of ipf. these vocs may be useful biomarkers of ipf.
psoriasis	objective the authors' group recently published a novel technique for a navigation-guided frameless stereotactic approach for the placement of depth electrodes in epilepsy patients. to improve the accuracy of the trajectory and enhance the procedural workflow, the authors implemented the isys1 miniature robotic device in the present study into this routine. methods as a first step, a preclinical phantom study was performed using a human skull model, and the accuracy and timing between 5 electrodes implanted with the manual technique and 5 with the aid of the robot were compared. after this phantom study showed an increased accuracy with robot-assisted electrode placement and confirmed the robot 's ability to maintain stability despite the rotational forces and the leverage effect from drilling and screwing, patients were enrolled and analyzed for robot-assisted depth electrode placement at the authors' institution from january 2014 to december 2015. all procedures were performed with the s7 surgical navigation system with synergy cranial software and the isys1 miniature robotic device. results ninety-three electrodes were implanted in 16 patients (median age 33 years, range 3-55 years; 9 females, 7 males). the authors saw a significant increase in accuracy compared with their manual technique, with a median deviation from the planned entry and target points of 1.3 mm (range 0.1-3.4 mm) and 1.5 mm (range 0.3-6.7 mm), respectively. for the last 5 patients (31 electrodes) of this series the authors modified their technique in placing a guide for implantation of depth electrodes (gide) on the bone and saw a significant further increase in the accuracy at the entry point to 1.18 +/- 0.5 mm (mean +/- sd) compared with 1.54 +/- 0.8 mm for the first 11 patients (p = 0.021). the median length of the trajectories was 45.4 mm (range 19-102.6 mm). the mean duration of depth electrode placement from the start of trajectory alignment to fixation of the electrode was 15.7 minutes (range 8.5-26.6 minutes), which was significantly faster than with the manual technique. in 12 patients, depth electrode placement was combined with subdural electrode placement. the procedure was well tolerated in all patients. the authors did not encounter any case of hemorrhage or neurological deficit related to the electrode placement. in 1 patient with a psoriasis vulgaris, a superficial wound infection was encountered. adequate physiological recordings were obtained from all electrodes. no additional electrodes had to be implanted because of misplacement. conclusions the isys1 robotic device is a versatile and easy to use tool for frameless implantation of depth electrodes for the treatment of epilepsy. it increased the accuracy of the authors' manual technique by 60% at the entry point and over 30% at the target. it further enhanced and expedited the authors' procedural workflow.
addiction	ibogaine is a plant alkaloid used as anti-addiction drug in dozens of alternative medicine clinics worldwide. recently, alarming reports of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cases of sudden death associated with the ingestion of ibogaine have accumulated. using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we assessed the effects of ibogaine and its main metabolite noribogaine on action potentials in human ventricular-like cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. therapeutic concentrations of ibogaine and its long-lived active metabolite noribogaine significantly retarded action potential repolarization in human cardiomyocytes. these findings represent the first experimental proof that ibogaine application entails a cardiac arrhythmia risk for humans. in addition, they explain the clinically observed delayed incidence of cardiac adverse events several days after ibogaine intake. we conclude that therapeutic concentrations of ibogaine retard action potential repolarization in the human heart. this may give rise to a prolongation of the qt interval in the electrocardiogram and cardiac arrhythmias.
anxiety	adolescence is a time of continued brain maturation, particularly in limbic and cortical regions, which undoubtedly plays a role in the physiological and emotional changes. prenatally stressed offspring rats were used to investigate the potential antidepressive-like effects of imperatorin (imp) extracted from the root of radix angelica. after 4 weeks of treatment of imp, behavioral tests (sucrose-preference test, forced-swimming test, and open-field test) were measured. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serotonin transporters (5-htt) and 5-ht1a receptor (5-ht1ar) mrna expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were also determined by real-time pcr. administration with imp (15 and 30 mg/kg/day, intragastrically) for 28 days markedly increased the percentage of sucrose (anhedonia), decreased the immobility time, and increased the number of total crossings, center crossings, rearing, and grooming in the male prenatally stressed offspring. meanwhile, we found that 5-ht concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was significantly increased in the imp-treated group. subsequently, we found significantly decreased 5-htt and increased 5-ht1ar mrna expressions in the hippocampus and frontal cortex after imp treatment in the prenatally stressed male offspring. imp showed antidepressive-like effects and increased 5-ht concentration in male prenatally stressed offspring, suggesting that imp could be of therapeutic use in preventing depressive-like behavior in adolescence. copyright (c) 2017 the author(s). published by wolters kluwer health, inc.
hereditary_angioedema	kinin-mediated angioedema results from accumulation of kinins, vasoactive and vasopermeant peptides, on the vascular endothelium. the disease is characterized by sudden episodes of swelling in the subcutaneous and submucosal tissues; the edema may occur spontaneously or it may be precipitated by triggering factors such as physical or emotional stress, or certain medicines. the characterization of kinin formation and catabolism systems helps improve knowledge of the aetiopathogenic mechanisms involved and provides the basis for classification of kinin-mediated angioedema conditions; thus, we may distinguish between angioedenna with c1 inhibitor deficiency, whether inherited or acquired, and angioedema with normal c1 inhibitor activity, associated with increased kinin-forming activity or deficiency in kinin catabolism enzymes. in support of the clinical diagnosis, the physician may request laboratory investigation for a functional and molecular definition of the disease. laboratory diagnosis is based on the characterization of: (1) kinin production control by c1 inhibitor investigation (function, antigen levels and circulating species); (2) kinin production (kininogenase activity, kininogen cleavage species); and (3) kinin catabolism enzymes (aminopeptidase p, carboxypeptidase n, angiotensin-i converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase iv). an abnormal biological phenotype is supported by examination of susceptibility genes (serping1, f12 and xpnpep2) and mutation segregation in the families.

healthy_sleep	background. anesthesiologists who work extended hours exhibit acute and chronic sleep deprivation. the newest bilateral bispectral index (bis)-vista monitor offers new advantages over earlier models, which include a new algorithm (version 1.4). one possible useful application for bis monitoring of physiological sleep would be in critically ill patients who almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption and deprivation because they loose their circadian rhythm due to the harsh noisy environment of critical care units. previous studies, which used earlier versions of the bis monitor to depict normal physiologic sleep, produced widely conflicting results. the aim of our study was to assess whether the new bis-vista monitor would exhibit a temporal decline that corresponds to natural physiologic sleep stages in healthy sleep-deprived, post-call anesthesiologists. methods. bis-vista sensors were bilaterally mounted, according to the manufacturer guidelines, onto the forehead of 10 healthy sleep-deprived volunteer anesthesiologists. using the conventional rechtschaffen and kales criteria, bis values during the awake, si, s2, s3, s4, and rapid eye movement (rem) sleep stages were recorded. results. meant +/- sd bis values during the awake, si, s2, s3, s4, and rem sleep stages significantly declined for the left (96 +/- 2, 82 +/- 11, 73 +/- 10, 53 +/- 13, 43 +/- 11, 66 +/- 9) and right (97 +/- 2, 78 +/- 11, 69 +/- 9, 50 +/- 10, 39 +/- 13, 61 +/- 14) hemispheres respectively. there were no significant interhemispheric differences in bis values over time (two-way anova). however, in one subject, the left and right bis values were mostly discordant throughout the recordings. conclusion. we demonstrated that although the bis-vista monitor was neither designed nor validated for monitoring normal physiologic sleep, it depicted a temporal decline that corresponds to normal physiologic sleep stages in sleep-deprived anesthesiologists.

crohn's_disease	a current major challenge in leprosy control is the prevention of permanent disabilities. host pathological inflammatory responses termed type 1 reaction (t1r) are a leading cause of nerve damage for leprosy patients. the environmental or inherited factors that predispose leprosy cases to undergo t1r are not known. however, studies have shown an important contribution of host genetics for susceptibility to t1r. we have previously identified variants encompassing the tnfsf15/tnfsf8 genes as t1r risk factors in a vietnamese sample and replicated this association in a brazilian sample. however, we failed to validate in brazilian patients the strong association of tnfsf15/tnfsf8 markers rs6478108 and rs7863183 with t1r that we had observed in vietnamese patients. here, we investigated if the lack of validation of these variants was due to age-dependent effects on association using four independent population samples, two from brazil and two from vietnam. in the combined analysis across the four samples, we observed a strong association of the tnfsf15/tnfsf8 variants rs6478108, rs7863183, and rs3181348 with t1r (p(combined) = 1.5e-05, p(combined) = 1.8e-05, and p(combined) = 6.5e-06, respectively). however, the association of rs6478108 with t1r was more pronounced in leprosy cases under 30 years of age compared to the global sample [odds ratio (or) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.54-2.46, p(combined) = 2.5e-08 versus or = 1.46, 95% ci = 1.23-1.73, p(combined) = 1.5e-05]. a multivariable analysis indicated that the association of rs6478108 with t1r was independent of either rs7863183 or rs3181348. these three variants are known regulators of the tnfsf8 gene transcription level in multiple tissues. the age dependency of association of rs6478108 and t1r suggests that the genetic control of gene expression varies across the human life span.
ankylosing_spondylitis	ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by pathological osteogenesis and inflammation. however, the pathogenesis of as and the pathological relationship between osteogenesis and inflammation in this disease remain largely unknown. mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) are multipotent progenitor cells capable of osteogenic differentiation and immunoregulation. recently, we demonstrated that mscs from as patients (asmscs) have a greater potential for osteogenic differentiation than mscs from healthy donors (hdmscs), which therefore seems to be a component of pathological osteogenesis in as. previous studies have indicated that the immunoregulatory abilities of mscs change following differentiation. however, the subsequent effects of asmscs during abnormal osteogenic differentiation are unclear. here, we further demonstrated that asmscs secreted more monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp1) than hdmscs during osteogenic differentiation. this enhanced mcp1 secretion augmented monocyte migration, increased classical macrophage polarization, and enhanced tnf-alpha secretion. inhibiting mcp1 secretion from osteogenic differentiated asmscs using lentiviruses encoding short hairpin rnas ameliorated these dysfunctions. blocking the erk1/2 pathway in asmscs with u0126 corrected the abnormal osteogenic differentiation, inhibited mcp1 overexpression, and prevented subsequent monocyte dysfunction. finally, mcp1 expression was up-regulated during osteogenic differentiation in asmscs in vivo and was locally augmented in osteoblasts at ossification sites in as patients. in summary, our study determined that mcp1 overexpression during abnormal osteogenic differentiation of asmscs triggers monocyte dysfunctions. we propose the novel hypothesis that pathological osteogenesis can lead to inflammation in as. this hypothesis may contribute to reveal the precise pathological relationship between osteogenesis and inflammation in the field of osteoimmunology. asmscs secreted more mcp1 during abnormal osteogenic differentiation. mcp1 overexpression leads to monocyte dysfunctions. pathological osteogenesis can lead to inflammation in as.
autism	the goal of this study was to identify unique profiles of readers in a sample of 8-16 year olds with higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (hfasd) and examine the profiles in relation to asd symptom severity. eighty-one students were assessed utilizing a comprehensive reading battery that included basic word reading, language, and comprehension. using latent profile analysis, four empirically distinct profiles of readers emerged. next, using the autism diagnostic observation schedule, second edition (lord et al., autism diagnostic observation schedule, 2nd edn, western psychological services, torrance, ca, 2012), analyses were conducted to determine if significant differences existed between profiles as a result of asd symptomatology. findings demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of reading profiles in students with hfasd and significant differences between the reading profiles and asd symptom severity.
atrial_fibrillation	as a stressful environment in families, mothers' depressive symptoms might increase children 's risks of developing behavioral problems by exacerbating genetic influences. using data from the nationally representative early childhood longitudinal study-birth cohort data of approximately 750 pairs of twins, we examined whether genetic influences on preschoolers' behavioral problems depended upon mothers' depressive symptoms. results indicated that the genetic etiology for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors varied with maternal depressive symptoms at 9-months child age. genetic effects on externalizing behaviors increased as mothers' depressive symptoms increased; however, genetics effects on internalizing behaviors increased when depressive symptoms either increased or decreased from the median level. these different patterns of interactive effects suggest potentially different mechanisms for the etiology of children 's externalizing and internalizing behaviors.
autism	there is some disagreement in the literature regarding the presence of elevated testosterone concentrations in boys with autism spectrum disorder (asd). to explore that disagreement, the presence of significant differences in testosterone concentrations in young males with autism spectrum disorder (asd) and normally developing controls aged 6 yr. to 17 yr. was investigated. a total of 136 young males with asd and 48 age-matched non-asd males contributed samples of saliva at a set time and these were assayed for testosterone concentrations. there was no significant difference in testosterone concentrations between the two entire samples. when examined at two-yearly intervals, asd participants had significantly lower testosterone concentrations at age 12 yr. to 13 yr. and also exhibited relatively homogeneous testosterone concentrations compared to non-asd participants. these data challenge the 'extreme male brain' hypothesis for asd and suggest that asd young males were delayed in their pubertal development and that the developmental variability expected in the wider population was not present.
psoriasis	breast cancer is the most important cause of death in women globally. though, improved survival is due to the developments in the screening techniques, initial diagnosis, and advances in treatments. numerous factors contributed in the progression of breast cancer, such as inflammation. the most significant factor involved in the inflammatory process, is t helper 17 (th17) cells. th17 cells have an exceptional role in many of inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast cancer through production of proinflammatory cytokine (il17). as the collected indication recommends a possible relevance between chronic inflammation and cancer tumorigenesis, it appears that this cytokine can stimulate the tumorigenesis of breast tumor cells. the il17 family consist of 6 protein members, among them il17b and its receptor, and il17rb signaling pathway plays a key role in development and progression of breast cancer, and targeting this signaling pathway or its specific downstream mediators by a chemotherapy drug and small interfering rna interference is a potentially novel therapeutic pathway for inhibition of this disease. this comprehensive review details the recognition of activity, signaling, and the roles of il17b-il17rb in breast cancer have caused to determination of new therapeutic mechanisms with the purpose of introduction this system and the regulation of its signaling pathway.

bipolar_disorder	depression is one the world leading global burdens leading to various comorbidities. lithium as a mainstay in the treatment of depression is still considered gold standard treatment. similar to lithium another agent agmatine has also central protective role against depression. since, both agmatine and lithium modulate various effects through interaction with nmda receptor, therefore, in current study we aimed to investigate the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of agmatine with lithium in mouse force swimming test. also to know whether if such effect is due to interaction with nmda receptor. in our present study we found that when potent dose of lithium (30 mg/kg) was administered, it significantly decreased the immobility time. also, when subeffective dose of agmatine (0.01 mg/kg) was coadministered with subeffective dose of lithium (3 mg/kg), it potentiated the antidepressant-like effect of subeffective dose of lithium. for the involvement of nmda receptor in such effect, we administered nmda receptor antagonist mk-801 (0.05 mg/kg) with a combination of subeffective dose of lithium (3 mg/kg) and agmatine (0.001 mg/kg). a significant antidepressant-like effect was observed. furthermore, when subeffective dose (50 and 75 mg/kg) of nmda was given it inhibited the synergistic effect of agmatine (0.01 mg/kg) with lithium (3 mg/kg). hence, our finding demonstrate that agmatine have synergistic effect with lithium which is mediated by nmda receptor pathway (c) 2017 elsevier masson sas. all rights reserved.
crohn's_disease	cobalamin deficiency is common in patients with crohn 's disease (cd). intramuscular cobalamin continues to be the standard therapy for the deficiency and maintenance treatment in these patients, although oral route has been demonstrated to be effective in other pathologies with impaired absorption. our aims were to evaluate the efficacy of oral therapy in the treatment of cobalamin deficiency and in long-term maintenance in patients with crohn 's disease. we performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 94 patients with crohn 's disease and cobalamin deficiency. seventy-six patients had b12 deficiency and 94.7% of them normalized their cobalamin levels with oral treatment. the most used dose was 1 mg/day, but there were no significant differences in treatment effectiveness depending on the dose used (>= 1 mg/24 h vs. < 1 mg/24 h). eighty-two patients had previous documented b12 deficiency and were treated with oral b12 to maintain their correct cobalamin levels. after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the oral route was effective as maintenance treatment in 81.7% of patients. a lack of treatment adherence was admitted by 46.6% of patients in who the oral route failed. in conclusion, our study shows that oral cyanocobalamin provides effective acute and maintenance treatment for vitamin b12 deficiency caused by cd with or without ileum resection.
children's_health	objective: this study aims to identify the scientific evidence on the risks and effects of exposure to environmental contaminants in children during sensitive developmental periods. data source: the search was performed in the bireme database, using the terms: children 's health, environmental exposure, health vulnerability, toxicity pathways and developmental disabilities in the lilacs, medline and scielo systems. data synthesis: children differ from adults in their unique physiological and behavioral characteristics and the potential exposure to risks caused by several threats in the environment. exposure to toxic agents is analyzed through toxicokinetic processes in the several systems and organs during the sensitive phases of child development. the caused effects are reflected in the increased prevalence of congenital malformations, diarrhea, asthma, cancer, endocrine and neurological disorders, among others, with negative impacts throughout adult life. conclusion: to identify the causes and understand the mechanisms involved in the genesis of these diseases is a challenge for science, as there is still a lack of knowledge on children 's susceptibility to many environmental contaminants. prevention policies and more research on child environmental health, improving the recording and surveillance of environmental risks to children 's health, should be an ongoing priority in the public health field.

crohn's_disease	this study was aimed at correlating a magnetic resonance index of activity (maria) and a magnetic resonance enterography global score (megs) with activity indexes in a paediatric population with crohn 's disease (cd). this retrospective study included 32 paediatric patients (median age 14.5 years, 18 male) with proven cd who underwent magnetic resonance enterography (mre). a correlation analysis was performed on the mre-based scores, the simplified endoscopic score for cd (ses-cd), the paediatric crohn 's disease activity index (pcdai), and c-reactive protein (crp) levels. based on pcdai, comparison of both global maria and megs was made between patients with mild and moderate/severe disease activity. global maria correlated with ses-cd (r = 0.70, p = 0.001) and pcdai (r = 0.42, p = 0.016). megs correlated with pcdai (r = 0.46, p = 0.007) and crp levels (r = 0.35, p = 0.046). megs differed significantly (p = 0.027) between patients grouped by clinical disease severity. mre-based global scores correlated with clinical indexes of cd activity. therefore, they represent a potential useful tool to predict cd activity and severity, as well as a possible promising alternative to endoscopy, to monitor paediatric patients with cd during their follow-up. mre is widely used to for accurate assessment of cd. global maria and megs have been suggested as indicators of cd activity. paediatric studies comparing mre-based global scores with clinical cd activity are lacking. such scores can serve as predictors of cd activity/severity in paediatric patients. mre offers an alternative to clinical score/endoscopy for paediatric cd monitoring.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. to determine if patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa) who achieved remission within 6 months with etanercept (etn) treatment (with or without methotrexate) were able to maintain remission over 66 months. monotherapy status over the study duration was also monitored. methods. this was a post hoc analysis of prove (nct00938015), a multicentre, observational study into the long-term adherence of etn performed in rheumatology clinics in belgium. to be included in prove, patients had active psa and were either already receiving etn treatment or had recently been prescribed it. patients who achieved remission (defined as zero joints with synovitis) after 6 months of etn treatment were monitored for maintenance of remission at each subsequent visit. in addition, patients on etn monotherapy at month 6 were observed. results. 303 patients participated and 156 (51.5%) patients completed 66 months of etn treatment. the mean (standard deviation [sdp disease duration was 7.5 (7.4) years and the majority had polyarticular-type psa (87.1%). overall, 142 patients achieved remission after 6 months of etn treatment. among the 83 patients who were in remission at month 6 and remained in the study until the end, 72 (86.7%) were still in remission at month 66. after 6 months, 66 patients were receiving etn monotherapy and the majority continued with it until month 66 (n=22/26; 84.6%). conclusion. within this patient population, remission was achieved quickly and was sustained in the long-term. of those patients who were receiving monotherapy, most continued with this treatment strategy for the duration of the study.
bipolar_disorder	it is well established that traumatic brain injury (tbi) is associated with the development of psychiatric disorders. however, the impact of psychiatric disorders on tbi outcome is less well understood. we examined the outcomes of patients who experienced a traumatic subdural hemorrhage and whether a comorbid psychiatric disorder was associated with a change in outcome. a retrospective observational study was performed in the california office of statewide health planning and development (oshpd) and the nationwide inpatient sample (nis). patients hospitalized for acute subdural hemorrhage were identified using international classification of diseases, ninth revision (icd-9) diagnosis codes. patients with coexisting psychiatric diagnoses were identified. outcomes studied included mortality and adverse discharge disposition. in osphd, diagnoses of depression (or=0.64, p<0.001), bipolar disorder (or=0.45, p<0.05), and anxiety (or=0.37, p<0.001) were associated with reduced mortality during hospitalization for tbi, with a trend toward psychosis (or=0.56, p=0.08). schizophrenia had no effect. diagnoses of psychosis (or=2.12, p<0.001) and schizophrenia (or=2.60, p<0.001) were associated with increased adverse discharge. depression and bipolar disorder had no effect, and anxiety was associated with reduced adverse discharge (or=0.73, p=0.01). results were confirmed using the nis. analysis revealed novel associations between coexisting psychiatric diagnoses and tbi outcomes, with some subgroups having decreased mortality and increased adverse discharge. potential mechanisms include pharmacological effects of frequently prescribed psychiatric medications, the pathophysiology of individual psychiatric disorders, or under-coding of psychiatric illness in the most severely injured patients. because pharmacological mechanisms, if validated, might lead to improved outcome in tbi patients, further studies may provide significant public health benefit.
children's_health	aimto evaluate parents' feedback regarding their experience in registering and accessing funding with the national disability insurance scheme (ndis) and communicating with the national disability insurance agency (ndia). methodsparents of children less than 7years of age, who were assessed through the child development unit (cdu) at the women 's and children 's health network from july 2013 to june 2014 and referred to the ndis, were invited to complete a study questionnaire regarding their experience with the ndis. the questionnaire was initially mailed to the parents. if no response was returned, families were telephoned to complete the questionnaire by phone or to be sent another copy of the questionnaire to complete. resultsof 121 children eligible for the study, 42 (34.7%) parents completed the questionnaire. thirty-six (85.7%) parents reported having no difficulty with the ndis registration process, while six parents (14.3%) had difficulty. with regards to accessing funding, 27 (64.3%) reported having no difficulty, 11 (26.2%) stated that it was difficult and 4 parents did not comment. twenty-six parents (61.9%) reported that it was easy to communicate with the ndia, while 12 (28.6%) found it difficult. overall, 26 (61.9%) parents were satisfied with the ndis and ndia, 6 (14.8%) were unsatisfied and 9 (21.4%) were neutral. conclusionthe majority of parents were satisfied with both the processes required to register and access funding through the ndis for early intervention services for their children with developmental disabilities, and their ability to communicate with the ndia.
psoriasis	psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease in which t-helper i (th1) and t-helper 17(th17) cells play an important role in its pathology. formula psori-cm01 was a novel formulated chinese medicine used for psoriasis therapy. it had been demonstrated previously that psori-cm01 and serum contained formula psori-cm01 (pcmo1cs) could improve psoriasis by inhibiting the epithelial hyperplasia, how psori-cm01 affects inflammatory cytokine and chemokine in dermis is still unknown. in this study we found psori-cm01 pre-treated 3 days before imq painting could ameliorated imq-induced mice skin lesion as pasi score was apparently reduced. th1 related cytokine ifn-gamma and th17 related cytokine il-17/il-22 was used to induce inflammatory models on human keratinocyte cell line hacat in vitro, respectively. pcmo1cs significantly reduced ifn-gamma induced mrna expression of il-6, il-12 and cxcl-10, reduced il-6 and cxcl-10 release into hacat supernatant. 20 ng/ml il-17/il22 co-stimulation significantly upregulated expression of il-6, il-8 and ccl20 mrna expression in hacat cells, pcmo1cs significantly inhibit these cytokines expression both in mrna and in protein levels. finally, pcmo1cs could obviously inhibit nuclear nf-kappa b p65 expression which activated by ifn-gamma and il-17/1l-22 stimulation. thus, our new findings reveal that formula psori-cm01 may possess therapeutic action on psoriasis by inhibiting inflammatory within skin environments.

anxiety	stress plays a key role in addiction etiology and relapse. rodent models posit that following repeated periods of alcohol and other drug intoxication, compensatory allostatic changes occur in the central nervous system (cns) circuits involved in behavioral and emotional response to stressors. we examine a predicted manifestation of this neuroadaptation in recently abstinent alcohol-dependent humans. participants completed a translational laboratory task that uses startle potentiation to unpredictable (vs. predictable) stressors implicated in the putative cns mechanisms that mediate this neuroadaptation. alcohol-dependent participants displayed significantly greater startle potentiation to unpredictable than predictable stressors relative to nonalcoholic controls. the size of this effect covaried with alcoholrelated problems and degree of withdrawal syndrome. this supports the rodent model thesis of a sensitized stress response in abstinent alcoholics. however, this effect could also represent premorbid risk or mark more severe and/ or comorbid psychopathology. regardless, pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions may target unpredictable stressor response to reduce stress-induced relapse.
asthma	asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. allergen sensitization and high frequencies of comorbid allergic diseases are characteristic of severe asthma in children. omalizumab, an anti-ige mab, is the first targeted biologic therapeutic approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma (aa) that remains uncontrolled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus other controller medications. since its initial licensing for use in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of omalizumab have been demonstrated in several published clinical trials in children aged 6 to less than 12 years with moderate-to-severe aa. these studies supported the approval of the pediatric indication (use in children aged >= 6 years) by the european medicines agency in 2009 and the us food and drug administration in 2016. after this most recent change in licensing, we review the outcomes from clinical trials in children with persistent aa receiving omalizumab therapy and observational studies from the past 7 years of clinical experience in europe. data sources were identified by using pubmed in 2016. guidelines and management recommendations and materials from the recent us food and drug administration 's pediatric advisory committee meeting are also reviewed.
medicare	aims: to compare patient characteristics, rates, and costs of medically attended falls among patients with parkinson 's disease (pd) and probable pd plus neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (pd+noh). materials and methods: marketscan commercial and medicare supplemental databases (january 1, 2009-december 31, 2013) were used to identify pd and probable pd+noh patients. the first medical or prescription claim suggesting these diagnoses served as the index date. baseline characteristics and post-index all-cause and fall-related healthcare utilization and costs were compared between patient groups. results: a total of 17,421 pd and 281 pd+noh patients were identified. compared with pd patients, pd+noh patients were older (77 vs 74 years; p<.0001) and had more comorbidities. pre- and post-index date, more pd+noh patients had a medically attended fall than pd patients (25% vs 20% [p=.0159] and 30% vs 21% [p=0.0002], respectively). fallers in both groups had similar numbers of medically attended falls 12-months pre-index (mean =1.9), but pd+noh fallers had more falls post-index (2.5 vs 2.0; p=.0176). compared with pd patients, more pd+noh patients (all p<.01) had fall-related emergency department (ed) visits (18% vs 10%), hospitalizations (7% vs 3%), and non-office visit outpatient services (15% vs 10%). adjusted total post-index medical costs for falls ($2,260 vs $1,049; p=.0002) and total all-cause costs ($31,260 vs $20,910; p<.0001) were higher for pd+noh vs pd patients. limitations: this study had some limitations. there is no icd-9-cm diagnosis code for noh, so a combination of pd and oh diagnoses (with confounding conditions excluded) served as a proxy for an noh diagnosis. also, the rate of falls and associated costs in these cohorts might be under-reported because only medically attended falls were evaluated. conclusions: pd+noh patients had a higher prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities and a higher rate of medically attended falls than those with pd alone, leading to increased costs of care.
children's_health	particulate matter (pm) contributes to an increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, cancer, and preterm birth complications. this project assessed pm exposure in eastern indonesia 's largest city, where air quality has not been comprehensively monitored. we examined the efficacy of wearing masks as an individual intervention effort to reduce in-transit pm exposures. handheld particulate counters were used to investigate ambient air quality for spatial analysis, as well as the differences in exposure to pm2.5 and pm10 (mu g/m(3)) by different transportation methods [e.g. motorcycle (n = 97), pete-pete (n = 53), and car (n = 55); note: n = 1 means 1 m(3) of air sample]. mask efficacy to reduce pm exposure was evaluated [e.g. surgical masks (n = 39), bandanas (n = 52), and motorcycle masks (n = 39)]. a monte carlo simulation was used to provide a range of uncertainty in exposure assessment. overall pm10 levels (91 +/- 124 mu g/m(3)) were elevated compared to the world health organization (who) 's 24-hour air quality guideline (50 mu g/m(3)). while average pm2.5 levels (9 +/- 14 mu g/m(3)) were below the who 's guideline (25 mu g/m(3)), measurements up to 139 mu g/m(3) were observed. compared to cars, average motorcycle and pete-pete pm exposures were four and three times higher for pm2.5, and 13 and 10 times higher for pm10, respectively. only surgical masks were consistent in lowering pm2.5 and pm10 (p < 0.01). young children (<= 5) were the most vulnerable age group, and could not reach the safe dosage even when wearing surgical masks. individual interventions can effectively reduce individual pm exposures; however, policy interventions will be needed to improve the overall air quality and create safer transportation.

mental_health	objective: despite early dietary treatment phenylketonuria patients have lower iq and poorer executive functions compared to healthy controls. cognitive problems in phenylketonuria have often been associated with phenylalanine levels. the present study examined the cognitive profile and mental health in adult phenylketonuria, in relation to phenylalanine levels and tetrahydrobiopterin treatment. method: fifty-seven early treated adult patients with phenylketonuria and 57 healthy matched controls (18-40 years) performed iq subtests and executive function tests from the amsterdam neuropsychological tasks. they also completed the adult self-report on mental health problems. analyses of variance were performed to examine group differences. results: patients with phenylketonuria had normal iqs although lower than controls. they performed poorer on working memory, inhibitory control, and sustained attention tasks. patients reported depressive and avoidant personality problems more frequently. specifically, patients with childhood and lifetime phenylalanine >= 360 mu mol/l had poorer cognitive and mental health outcomes than controls. in a subset of patients, comparisons between patients on and off tetrahydrobiopterin showed that nontetrahydrobiopterin users (matched for childhood, pretreatment phenylalanine) were slower (on number of tasks) and reported more mental health problems. conclusions: adult patients had lower iq and poorer executive functions than controls, resembling problems observed in younger patients with phenylketonuria, as well as more internalizing problems. group differences and phenylalanine-outcome associations were smaller than those observed in younger populations. a subset of nontetrahydrobiopterin users, matched for childhood phenylalanine level, had a poorer outcome on some tests than tetrahydrobiopterin users, which might indicate an impact of tetrahydrobiopterin treatment beyond lowering phenylalanine. however, clinical relevance needs further investigation.
atopic_dermatitis	introduction. - omalizumab is used as a treatment for severe allergic asthma. its intended mechanism of action is based on its anti-ige proprieties. however, recent studies have highlighted other mechanisms of action. state of the art. - omalizumab treatment is associated with a decrease in the number of dendritic cells, t and b lymphocytes and eosinophils. this anti-inflammatory activity is characterized by a decrease in the levels of several cytokines involved in the recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils and mastocytes, and in a th2 orientation of the immune response. a modulation of bronchial remodeling by omalizumab has recently been shown. a decrease in the production of extracellular matrix components and in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells could be involved in this modulation. these mechanisms of action could explain in part the clinical efficiency of omalizumab in non-allergic conditions such as non-allergic asthma, non-allergic urticaria or nasal polyposis. conclusion. - a precise knowledge of the mechanisms of action of omalizumab could allow the identification of biomarkers predictive of efficacy of this treatment. these could be useful tools in the phenotyping of severe asthma.

addiction	this paper presents the development and preliminary evaluation of an integrated group cognitive behavioral treatment (cbt) for comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. the 12-session, manualized treatment was developed collaboratively by a mental health program in a teaching hospital and a community-based addictions service and administered in both settings. results from an uncontrolled effectiveness trial of 29 treatment completers suggest that integrated group cbt may reduce stress and alcohol use symptoms and improve substance refusal self-efficacy. changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and drug use were not significant, although the effect size for anxiety reduction was in the medium range. nonetheless, the clinical significance of treatment effects on mood, anxiety, and substance use symptoms was modest. changes in coping skills and quality of life were not significant, although medium-to-large effects were observed for changes in several coping skills. participants reported being highly satisfied with treatment, found the treatment strategies to be useful, and noted an improvement in their functioning, particularly socially. methodological and sample size limitations warrant more rigorous follow-up investigations of this treatment. results are considered in the context of the current literature on integrated psychological treatments for these common comorbidities.

addiction	the mesolimbic dopamine (da) circuitry determines which behaviors are positively reinforcing and therefore should be encoded in the memory to become a part of the behavioral repertoire. natural reinforcers, like food and sex, activate this pathway, thereby increasing the likelihood of further consummatory, social, and sexual behaviors. oxytocin (ot) has been implicated in mediating natural reward and ot-synthesizing neurons project to the ventral tegmental area (vta) and nucleus accumbens (nac); however, direct neuroanatomical evidence of ot regulation of da neurons within the vta is sparse. to phenotype ot-receptor (otr) expressing neurons originating within the vta, we delivered cre-inducible adeno-associated virus that drives the expression of fluorescent marker into the vta of male mice that had cre-recombinase driven by otr gene expression. otr-expressing vta neurons project to nac, prefrontal cortex, the extended amygdala, and other forebrain regions but less than 10% of these otr-expressing neurons were identified as da neurons (defined by tyrosine hydroxylase colocalization). instead, almost 50% of otr-expressing cells in the vta were glutamate (glu) neurons, as indicated by expression of mrna for the vesicular glu transporter (vglut). about one-third of otr-expressing vta neurons did not colocalize with either da or glu phenotypic markers. thus, otr expression by vta neurons implicates that ot regulation of reward circuitry is more complex than a direct action on da neurotransmission. j. comp. neurol. 525:1094-1108, 2017.

osteoarthritis	objective bone marrow stimulation surgeries are frequent in the treatment of cartilage lesions. autologous chondrocyte implantation (aci) may be performed after failed microfracture surgery. alterations to subchondral bone as intralesional osteophytes are commonly seen after previous microfracture and removed during aci. there have been no reports on potential recurrence. our purpose was to evaluate the incidence of intralesional osteophyte development in 2 cohorts: existing intralesional osteophytes and without intralesional osteophytes at the time of aci. study design we identified 87 patients (157 lesions) with intralesional osteophytes among a cohort of 497 aci patients. osteophyte regrowth was analyzed on magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as small or large (less or more than 50% of the cartilage thickness). twenty patients (24 defects) without intralesional osteophytes at the time of aci acted as control. results osteophyte regrowth was observed in 39.5% of lesions (34.4% of small osteophytes and 5.1% of large osteophytes). in subgroup analyses, regrowth was observed in 45.8% of periosteal-covered defects and in 18.9% of collagen membrane-covered defects. large osteophyte regrowth occurred in less than 5% in either group. periosteal defects showed a significantly higher incidence for regrowth of small osteophytes. in the control group, intralesional osteophytes developed in 16.7% of the lesions. conclusions even though intralesional osteophytes may regrow after removal during aci, most of them are small. small osteophyte regrowth occurs almost twice in periosteum-covered aci. large osteophytes occur only in 5% of patients. intralesional osteophyte formation is not significantly different in preexisting intralesional osteophytes and control groups.
stress_management	objectives: this study compared a behavioral weight loss program (bwl) with a stress management-based program, emotional brain training (ebt), on weight loss, blood pressure, depression, perceived stress, diet, and physical activity. methods: subjects with a body mass index (bmi) of >28 and <45 kg/m(2) were recruited in lexington, kentucky in january 2014 and randomized to bwl or ebt for a 20-week intervention. of those recruited, 49 participants were randomized to ebt or bwl. randomization and allocation to group were performed using spss software. weight, blood pressure, depression, perceived stress, dietary intake, and physical activity were measured at baseline, 10 week, and 20 week. linear models for change over time were fit to calculate 95% confidence intervals of intervention effects. results: bwl produced greater changes in bmi than ebt at both 10 (p = 0.02) and 20 wk (p = 0.03). at 10 wk, both ebt and bwl improved bmi, systolic blood pressure, depression and perceived stress (p < 0.05). bwl also improved diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.005). at 20 wk, ebt maintained improvements in bmi, systolic blood pressure, depression, and perceived stress while bwl maintained improvements only in bmi and depression (p < 0.05). conclusions: bwl produced greater weight loss than ebt; however, ebt produced sustained improvements in stress, depression, and systolic blood pressure. a combination of the two approaches should be explored.

atopic_dermatitis	background: there is a paucity of literature to direct physicians in the prescribing of immunomodulators for patients with severe atopic dermatitis (ad). objective: to survey systemic agent prescribing practices for severe childhood ad among clinicians in the united states and canada. methods: the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children taskforce (treat), us&canada, a project of the pediatric dermatology research alliance (pedra), developed an online multiple-response survey to assess clinical practice, gather demographic information and details of systemic agent selection, and identify barriers to their use in patients with recalcitrant pediatric ad. results: in total, 133 of 290 members (45.9%) of the society for pediatric dermatology completed the survey, and 115 of 133 (86.5%) used systemic treatment for severe pediatric ad. first-line drugs of choice were cyclosporine (45.2%), methotrexate (29.6%), and mycophenolate mofetil (13.0%). the most commonly used second-line agents were methotrexate (31.3%) and mycophenolate mofetil (30.4%); azathioprine was the most commonly cited third-line agent. the main factors that discouraged use of systemic agents were side-effect profiles (82.6%) and perceived risks of long- term toxicity (81.7%). limitations: investigation of the sequence of systemic medications or combination systemic therapy was limited. recall bias may have affected the results. conclusion: great variation exists in prescribing practices among american and canadian physicians using systemic agents for treatment of pediatric ad.
bipolar_disorder	abnormalities of t cell-mediated immune activation, in the absence of active somatic immune diseases, have consistently been reported in mood disorders. apart from being important players in the regulation of cells of the immune system, t cells are essential for normal brain development. we here report studies on the relationship between circulating levels of t helper cells and structural and functional brain imaging in depressed bipolar patients. since the ccl20-ccr6 axis is an important entry to the brain we differentiated the various t helper cell subpopulations on the basis of their chemokine receptor expression. methods: facs staining was performed for th1,th2,th17, th22 and t regulatory cells on frozen leukocytes of 25 consecutively admitted inpatients affected by a major depressive episode, without psychotic features, in the course of bipolar disorder i and 21 healthy controls. the frequency of the t helper populations was associated with dti and fmri data acquired on a philips 3.0 tesla scanner. tract based spatial statistic was used to obtain measures of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivity) from a standard dti sequence with 35 directions. patients were also studied for fmri through a moral valence decision task were subjects had to decide whether morally tuned stimuli were positive or negative. results: the percentage of circulating th17 (ccr6(+)cxcr3(neg)ccr4(+)ccr10(neg)) cells correlated positively with higher fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts contributing to the functional integrity of the brain both in patients and healthy controls, while the frequency of circulating t regulatory (cd(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+)) cells correlated positively with higher radial and mean diffusivity in patients. the frequency of circulating t regulatory cells also correlated to lower neuronal responses to negative versus positive morally tuned stimuli in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients. thl cells correlated negatively with white matter integrity in several tracts (healthy controls), while the cells showed a positive correlation to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (patients). conclusion: this study shows a new putative role for th17 cells. th17 cells are not only playing a role in inducing autoimmunity and auto-inflammation, but might also play a counter intuitive anabolic role in the maintenance of the functional and structural integrity of the brain.

migraine	background: airplane headache (ah) occurs during flights and often appears as an intense, short lasting headache during take-off or landing. reports are limited on pathological mechanisms underlying the occurrence of this headache. proper diagnosis and treatments would benefit from identification of potential pathways involved in ah pathogenesis. this study aimed at providing a simulated airplane headache condition as a proxy towards identification of its underlying mechanisms. methods: fourteen participants including 7 volunteers suffering from ah and 7 healthy matched controls were recruited after meeting the diagnostic and safety criteria based on an approved study protocol. simulation of ah was achieved by entering a pressure chamber with similar characteristics of an airplane flight. selected potential biomarkers including salivary prostaglandin e-2 (pge(2)), cortisol, facial thermo-images, blood pressure, pulse, and saturation pulse oxygen (spo) were defined and values were collected before, during and after flight simulation in the pressure chamber. salivary samples were analyzed with elisa techniques, while data analysis and statistical tests were handled with spss version 22.0. results: all participants in the ah-group experienced a headache attack similar to ah experience during flight. the non-ah-group did not experience any headaches. our data showed that the values for pge2, cortisol and spo were significantly different in the ah-group in comparison with the non-ah-group during the flight simulation in the pressure chamber. conclusion: the pressure chamber proved useful not only to provoke ah-like attack but also to study potential biomarkers for ah in this study. pge(2), and cortisol levels together with spo presented dysregulation during the simulated ah-attack in affected individuals compared with healthy controls. based on these findings we propose to use pressure chamber as a model to induce ah, and thus assess new potential biomarkers for ah in future studies.
bipolar_disorder	objectives: reliable predictors of response to lithium are still lacking in bipolar disorders (bds). however, childhood trauma has been hypothesized to be associated with poor response to lithium. methods: we included 148 patients with bd, euthymic when retrospectively and clinically assessed for response to lithium and childhood trauma using reliable scales. results: according to the 'alda scale', the sample consisted in 20.3% of excellent responders, 49.3% of partial responders and 30.4% of nonresponders to lithium. a higher level of physical abuse significantly correlated with a lower level of response to lithium (p = 0.009). as compared to patients not exposed to any abuse, patients with at least two trauma abuses (emotional, physical or sexual) were more at risk of belonging to the non-responders group (or = 4.91 95% ci (1.01-27.02)). among investigated clinical variables, lifetime presence of mixed episodes and alcohol misuse were associated with non-response to lithium. multivariate analyses demonstrated that physical abuse and mixed episodes were independently associated with poor response to lithium (p = 0.005 and p = 0.013 respectively). conclusions: childhood physical abuse might be involved in a poor future response to lithium prophylaxis, this effect being independent of the association between clinical expression of bd and poor response to lithium.
atopic_dermatitis	both spontaneous and inducible forms of chronic urticaria pose a significant economic burden and have an adverse effect on patients' quality of life. the international guidelines and us practice parameters for the diagnosis and management of chronic urticaria both recommend performing a thorough patient history and physical examination, conducting limited routine laboratory testing, and taking a stepwise approach to treatment. these documents differ in several areas, such as the order of diagnostic procedures and the treatment for patients non-responsive to standard dose h-1-antihistamines. patients with chronic urticaria who visit a specialist have typically been treated with second-generation h-1-antihistamines-the recommended first-line treatments. the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment option should be taken into consideration when selecting therapies beyond h-1-antihistamines. greater awareness of the international guidelines and us practice parameters will likely improve the quality of care for patients with chronic urticaria.
hereditary_angioedema	the term ""swelling"" has been used in the old scriptures to illustrate a change of normal figure and, as such, an expression of illness. it should be noted that in ancient times, human diseases were very often regarded a punishment from god. hence, it is not surprising that one of the oldest tests for infidelity involved swelling as an inflicted punishment. the great greek physician hippocrates (377-460 bc), considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine and ""father of the western medicine,"" already used the term oida""ma to describe swelling of organs. it took many centuries later until the first description of angioedema as a distinct medical entity was minted by quinke in 1882. the historical progression in angioedema research has been characterized by intermittent ""leaps"" in interest and scientific achievements. as an example, it took 75 years from the accurate description of hereditary angioedema (hae) by osler (1888), until a group of researchers headed by donaldson (1963) disclosed the central role of c1 inhibitor in angioedema pathophysiology. what followed was a result of a collective effort by many researchers and scientific groups who were able to elucidate the intricate connections between the implicated biochemical pathways. still, scientific progress was hardly translated into effective therapy, and another 45 years had to elapse until the renewed interest in hae was boosted by studies on the efficacy and safety of novel therapies about 10 years ago. in the twenty-first century, hae ceased to be an ""orphan disease"" and its future is far more optimistic. it is better managed now by specialized angioedema centers, harmonized clinical guidelines, educational programs, laboratory services, and continued basic and clinical research. patient associations worldwide are offering support and guidance, and governments and healthcare systems are gradually addressing patient and family needs.
osteoporosis	among 95,057 patients >= 50 years with new antiosteoporosis medications (aom) (2001-2013) in primary care, 1-year cessation was 51% (28%-68%), higher in men, smokers, patients with missing lifestyle data, and out normal bmi, and lower in those aged 60-79, with recent fractures or other anti-osteoporotics, suggesting non-severe osteoporosis and less risk awareness. purpose low compliance to anti-osteoporosis medications (aom) has been previously reported. we aimed to estimate 1-year cessation rates of different aoms as used in spanish healthcare settings, and to identify associated risk factors. methods a cohort study was performed using primary care records data (bifap). patients entered the cohort when aged 50 years in 2001-2013, with >= 1 year of data available, and identified as incident users of aom (1-year washout). participants were divided into six cohorts: alendronate, other oral bisphosphonates, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, and denosumab. patients were followed from therapy initiation to the earliest of cessation (90-day refill gap), switching (to alternative aom), loss to follow-up, death, or end of 2013. one-year therapy cessation was estimated using life tables. hazard ratios (of cessation) according to age, sex, lifestyle factors, morbidity, and co-medication were estimated after stepwise backwards selection. results a total of 95,057 aom users were identified (91% women; mean age 68). one-year cessation was 51% overall, highest for strontium ranelate (68%), and lowest for denosumab (28%). cessation probability was higher in men (14% to 2.1-fold), smokers (>6%), and patients with missing bmi (19-28%) or smoking (6-20%) data, and overweight/obese/underweight (7% to 2.6-fold increase compared to normal weight). patients aged 60-79 years, with a recent fracture or other drugs used for osteoporosis, had better persistence. conclusions over half of the patients initiating aom stopped therapy within the first year after initiation. the described risk factors for cessation could be proxies for non-severe osteoporosis, and/or disease/risk awareness, which could inform the targeting of high-risk patients for monitoring and/or interventions aimed at improving persistence.
mental_health	background: little is known about whether family economic status might influence the long-term (e.g. over 10years) outcome of persons with schizophrenia in the community. aim: to examine the differences in outcome at 14-year follow-up of persons with schizophrenia from high versus low family economic status backgrounds in a chinese rural area. method: a prospective 14-year follow-up study was conducted in six townships in xinjin county, chengdu, china. all participants with schizophrenia (n=510) were identified in an epidemiological investigation of 123,572 people aged 15years and older and followed up from 1994 to 2008. results: individuals from low family economic status (<mean) in 1994 had significantly higher rate of homelessness (9.9%) and lower rate of survival (63.8%) in 2008 than those from high family economic status (mean; 3.2% and 76.6%, respectively). individuals from low family economic status had significantly lower rates of marriage and complete remission, higher mean scores on positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) and lower mean score on global assessment of functioning (gaf) than those from high family economic status in 2008. the predictors of low family economic status of individuals in 2008 encompassed the baseline low family economic status, poor families' attitude toward the patient, younger age, older age of first onset and longer duration of illness. conclusion: low family economic status is a predictive factor of poor long-term outcome of persons with schizophrenia in the rural community. individuals' family economic status should be considered in making mental health policy and providing community-based mental health services.
bipolar_disorder	introduction: electroconvulsive therapy (ect) remains an effective treatment for major depressive disorder. since 1995, texas has maintained an ect database including patient diagnoses and outcomes, and reporting any deaths within 14 days of receiving an ect treatment, encompassing a total of 166,711 ect treatments administered in texas over the previously unreported period of 1998 to 2013. methods: descriptive analysis summarized information on deaths reported during the 16-year period-cause of death, type of treatment (index or maintenance) and patient demographics. multiple logistic regression of death incidence by treatment session was performed to determine whether patient age, sex, race, diagnosis, or year of treatment was associated with death after ect. results: of those deaths occurring within 1 day of an ect treatment, the death rate was 2.4 per 100,000 treatments. looking at all deaths within 14 days of an ect treatment, the death rate increased to 18 per 100,000 treatments but included all deaths regardless of likelihood of causal association with ect, for example, accidents and suicides, the latter a leading cause of death among individuals with severe major depression or other disorders for which ect is indicated. death rate increased significantly with increasing patient age (p = 0.001) and male sex (p = 0.009), and there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased death amongst patientswith bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (p = 0.058) versus depression. conclusions: our data indicate that ect is in general a safe procedure with respect to the likelihood of immediate death. suicide remains a significant risk in ect patients, despite evidence that ect reduces suicidal ideation.
anxiety	background: the diagnostic construct of mild neurocognitive disorders (mncds) is substantially congruent with previously proposed criteria for mild cognitive impairment (mci). mncd/ mci is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (nps). previous studies have examined the prevalence of nps in amnestic and non-amnestic mci subtypes; however, no studies exist for etiological types of mncd. we aimed to estimate the prevalence of nps in patients with mncd due to alzheimer 's disease (mncd-ad) and subcortical vascular mncd (scvmncd) and to determine whether nps would expand these mncd phenotypes. methods: the sample comprised 70 patients with mncd-ad, 70 patients with scvmncd, and 55 cognitively normal elderly persons (cnep). the diagnosis of mncd-ad was made according to dsm-5 criteria for possible mncd-ad. scvmncd patients fulfilled the dsm-5 criteria of the probable vascular mncd and the diagnostic criteria for subcortical vascular mci according to frisoni et al. (1). the prevalence of nps was based on the neuropsychiatric inventory. the statistical analyses included parametric and non-parametric tests, multivariate regression, and spearman 's correlation coefficient. results: about 69.1% of cnep, 97.1% of mncd-ad, and 100% of scvmncd patients had one or more nps. the prevalence of nps in both mncd groups was significantly higher than that in cnep. the most prevalent nps that had significant differential diagnostic value in separating mncd-ad from scvmncd, as well as mncd from cnep, were anxiety (81.43%) and irritability (67.14%) in mncd-ad and depression (81.43%) in scvmncd. in both mncd groups, we observed significant (p< 0.05) correlations between all distinguishing nps and the differential cognitive disturbances: the amnestic syndrome in mncd-ad and executive dysfunction in scvmncd. conclusion: nps occur in the majority of persons with mncd-ad and scvmncd.anxiety and irrtability are the most prevelant nps in mncd-ad, as well as depression in scvmncd.the ammestic-anxious-irritable syndrome can be the main phenotype in mncd-ad, on the other hand,the dysexecutive-depressive syndrome can be considered as the most prevelant clinical manifestation in scvmncd.obtained data may be used for clinical differentiation of mncd-ad and scvmncd patients.
healthy_sleep	study objectives: to examine sleep health knowledge and beliefs and their relationship to sleep practices in a community sample of caregivers of young children. methods: a convenience sample of caregivers visiting a museum on one of 2 consecutive weekend days completed a brief parent-report survey on child sleep habits and parental basic sleep knowledge and beliefs and attitudes regarding sleep as a health behavior. results: of the 253 analyzable surveys (response rate 80%; mean age of index child 3.4 +/- 2.0 years), 23% of children did not have a consistent bedtime, 25% had a bedtime later than 9 pm, 23% had at least one electronic device in the bedroom, and 56% frequently fell asleep with an adult present. both positive and negative sleep habits tended to cluster together. children who had irregular and late bedtimes were more than twice as likely to obtain insufficient sleep that those with regular and early bedtimes (or 2.30, 2.45). while 25% of children were getting less than the recommended sleep amount for age, just 13% of parents believed that their child was getting insufficient sleep. lack of knowledge regarding the potential negative impact of specific sleep practices was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in those practices. conclusions: the results of this survey study of a generally well-educated sample of caregivers suggest that there are clear parental knowledge gaps regarding healthy sleep in young children and supports the need for increased sleep health education.
atrial_fibrillation	amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent which is commonly used to treat both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. this iodine containing compound has been associated with several adverse events like it tends to accumulate in several organs. among those, the most serious is amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (apt). while the incidence of this complication has decreased with the use of lower doses of amiodarone but it can occur with any dose. pulmonary complications usually present as an acute or subacute pneumonitis. on chest x-ray and high-resolution computed tomography (ct), diffuse infiltrates were found. here, we present a case in which acute respiratory distress syndrome like features were detected which got subsided after stopping tablet amiodarone. the patient was a known case of atrial fibrillation for which she was taking tablet amiodarone for the last six months.
asthma	background: chronic immune diseases, such as asthma, are highly prevalent. currently available pharmaceuticals improve symptoms but cannot cure the disease. this prompted demands for alternatives to pharmaceuticals, such as probiotics, for the prevention of allergic disease. however, clinical trials have produced inconsistent results. this is at least partly explained by the highly complex crosstalk among probiotic bacteria, the host 's microbiota, and immune cells. the identification of a bioactive substance from probiotic bacteria could circumvent this difficulty. objective: we sought to identify and characterize a bioactive probiotic metabolite for potential prevention of allergic airway disease. methods: probiotic supernatants were screened for their ability to concordantly decrease the constitutive ccl17 secretion of a human hodgkin lymphoma cell line and prevent upregulation of costimulatory molecules of lps-stimulated human dendritic cells. results: supernatants from 13 of 37 tested probiotic strains showed immunoactivity. bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation of 2 supernatants according to polarity, followed by total ion chromatography and mass spectrometry, yielded c11h12n2o2 as the molecular formula of a bioactive substance. proton nuclear magnetic resonance and enantiomeric separation identified d-tryptophan. in contrast, l-tryptophan and 11 other d-amino acids were inactive. feeding d-tryptophan to mice before experimental asthma induction increased numbers of lung and gut regulatory t cells, decreased lung th2 responses, and ameliorated allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. allergic airway inflammation reduced gut microbial diversity, which was increased by d-tryptophan. conclusions: d-tryptophan is a newly identified product from probiotic bacteria. our findings support the concept that defined bacterial products can be exploited in novel preventative strategies for chronic immune diseases.
atrial_fibrillation	objectivespreexisting cognitive impairment is a predictor of cognitive decline after ischemic stroke, but evidence in intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is limited. we aimed to determine the prevalence of premorbid cognitive impairment in patients with ich. materials and methodswe included patients with acute ich. pre-ich cognitive impairment was determined based on the results of the informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (iqcode) that uses information from close relatives. patients were assessed as having been cognitively impaired with an iqcode score of 3.44; an iqcode 4.00 indicated pre-ich dementia. ct and mri images were reviewed to determine the extent of white matter lesions and to measure the radial width of the temporal horn as marker of brain atrophy. we investigated differences of cardiovascular risk factors and imaging data between patients with and without pre-ich cognitive impairment using correlation analyses, uni- and multivariable regression models. functional neurological state was assessed using the modified rankin scale (mrs). the mrs was dichotomized at the level of 3, and a premorbid mrs of 0-2 was considered as functional independency. resultsamong the 89 participants, median age was 70years (interquartile range 58-78) and 52 (58.4%) were male. iqcode indicated pre-ich cognitive impairment in 18.0% (16 of 89), and 83.1% were functionally independent before ich. cognitive impairment was associated with a premorbid mrs3 (chi squared test, p=0.009). in multivariable analysis, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (or 18.29, 95%-ci 1.945-172.033, p=.011) and hematoma volume (or 0.90, 95%-ci 0.812-0.991, p=.033) were independently associated with pre-ich cognitive impairment. conclusionsin conclusion, cognitive impairment frequently precedes ich. a higher frequency of cerebrovascular events suggests a role of vascular processes in the development of cognitive impairment before ich.
atrial_fibrillation	backgroundwe aimed to investigate the relationship between the hippocampal shape deformations and the serum cortisol levels in first-episode and drug-naive major depression disorder (mdd) patients. methodsthirty first-episode and drug-naive mdd patients and 40 healthy subjects were recruited. high-resolution t1-weighted imaging and morning blood samples for cortisol measurement were obtained from all mdd patients and healthy subjects. in the hippocampal shape analysis, we compared the hippocampal shape between mdd patients and healthy subjects and evaluated the linear correlation between hippocampal shape deformations and the serum cortisol levels in mdd patients and healthy subjects. resultsmdd patients showed significant inward deformations predominantly in the cornu ammonis (ca) 1 and subiculum in bilateral hippocampi compared to healthy subjects (false discovery rate (fdr) corrected, p < .05). furthermore, in mdd patients, a significant linear correlation between inward deformations and high cortisol levels were found predominantly in the ca1 and subiculum, extending into the ca2-3 (fdr-corrected, p < .05), whereas no significant linear correlation was observed in healthy subjects. conclusionsthe serum cortisol levels are therefore considered to be associated with hippocampal shape abnormalities in mdd.
children's_health	background: possible serious bacterial infection (pbsi) is a major cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. we studied risk factors for psbi in a large rural population in central india where facility deliveries have increased as a result of a government financial assistance program. methods: we studied 37,379 pregnant women and their singleton live born infants with birth weight >= 1.5 kg from 20 rural primary health centers around nagpur, india, using data from the 2010-13 population-based maternal and newborn health registry supported by nichd 's global network for women 's and children 's health research. factors associated with psbi were identified using multivariable poisson regression. results: two thousand one hundred twenty-three infants (6 %) had psbi. risk factors for psbi included nulliparity (rr 1.13, 95 % ci 1.03-1.23), parity >2 (rr 1.30, 95 % ci 1.07-1.57) compared to parity 1-2, first antenatal care visit in the 2nd/3rd trimester (rr 1.46, 95 % ci 1.08-1.98) compared to 1st trimester, administration of antenatal corticosteroids (rr 2.04, 95 % ci 1.60-2.61), low birth weight (rr 3.10, 95 % ci 2.17-4.42), male sex (rr 1.20, 95 % ci 1.10-1.31) and lack of early initiation of breastfeeding (rr 3.87, 95 % ci 2.69-5.58). conclusion: infants who are low birth weight, born to mothers who present late to antenatal care or receive antenatal corticosteroids, or born to nulliparous women or those with a parity >2, could be targeted for interventions before and after delivery to improve early recognition of signs and symptoms of psbi and prompt referral. there also appears to be a need for a renewed focus on promoting early initiation of breastfeeding following delivery in facilities.
atrial_fibrillation	background: the aim of our study was to investigate the reliability of automated oscillometric blood pressure (bp) monitoring in the presence and absence of atrial fibrillation (af) in hypertensive patients. methods: bp was measured and compared in 71 randomly selected patients with af and arterial hypertension diagnosis, 4 times each by auscultatory and oscillometric (microlife bp a6 pc with af detection system) methods. results: study included 71 patients: 36 males (mean age 67.4 years) and 35 females (70.2 years). at the time of bp measuring procedure, 36 patients were in sinus rhythm (sr) and 35 in af. in sr patients mean systolic blood pressure (sbp) was 132 +/- 17.9 mmhg with auscultatory method (am), 137.4 +/- 19.4 mmhg with oscillometric method (om); mean diastolic bp was 77.1 +/- 10.9 mmhg (am), 78.5 +/- 12.2 mmhg (om), in af patients mean sbp was 127.5 +/- 15.1 mmhg (am), 133.6 +/- 17.4 mmhg (om); mean diastolic bp was 81.4 +/- 9.9 mmhg (am), 83.5 +/- 11.8 mmhg (om), p = 0.037. the averages of differences for sbp and dbp in sinus rhythm group were (-5.3 mmhg (95% limits of agreement -27.2 -16.6)) and (-1. 4 mmhg (95% limits of agreement -12.8 -10.0)), respectively. in patients with af the averages of differences for sbp and dbp were (-6.1 mmhg (95% limits of agreement -23.9 -11.7)) and (-2.1 mmhg (95% limits of agreement -12.9 -8.7)), respectively. conclusions: the oscillometric device validated for patients with af on average gives 5.3 mmhg higher systolic bp values for patients with sr and 6.3 mmhg higher bp values for patients with af. however, the limits of agreement between two methods reveal wide range of random error rates which is a questionable topic in clinical practice, as it could possibly affect the treatment of arterial hypertension in patients with af.
hereditary_angioedema	background: registration of trigger factors, prodromal symptoms, swelling localization, therapeutic behavior and gender-specific differences of the largest cohort of patients with hereditary angioedema due to c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) in switzerland. methods: questionnaire survey within a cohort study: consenting eligible patients with diagnosed hae according to clinical history, physical examination and laboratory results, including plasma values for c1-inh and c4 were selected. to each participant we sent a questionnaire assessing patients' birthday, sex, date of first symptoms and diagnosis, trigger factors, prodromal symptoms, frequency and localization of angioedema, medication use and co-morbidities. clinical information was collected in each center and then transmitted to the cohort database. frequencies and distributions were summarized. associations between gender and trigger factors or prodromal symptoms or localization of angioedema were assessed in multivariate analyses correcting for patients' age. results: of 135 patients, data from 104 patients (77 %) were available for analysis. fifty-four percent were female, mean age at diagnosis was 19.5 years (sd 14.1), mean age when completing the questionnaire was 44.0 (sd 19.8). more women than men were symptomatic (44/57 vs. 36/47; p = 0.005). this association remained when correcting for age at diagnosis (16.10. 95% ci (5.17 to 26.70); p = 0.004). swelling episodes ranged between 1 and 136 episodes/year. swelling was more common among female than among male (-13.15 (95 % ci; -23.10 to -3.22), p = 0.010). age at diagnosis was inversely associated with the total number of attacks 0.50 (-0.88 to -.011); p = 0.012). one third of patients were on danazol prophylaxis. conclusion: we found large differences of hae in male and female both in terms of symptom number and swelling episodes. women are more affected by intensity and frequency of angioedema episodes than men. danazol treatment remains widely used as effective prophylaxis despite its side effects. new therapies which selectively influence the hormonal estrogen balance could open new therapeutic options mainly for women and maybe also for men.
osteoporosis	background context: compromise of pedicle screw purchase is a concern in maintaining rigid spinal fixation, especially with osteoporosis. little consistency exists among various tapping techniques. pedicle screws are often prepared with taps of a smaller diameter, which can further exacerbate inconsistency. purpose: the objective of this study was to determine whether a mismatch between tap thread depth (d) and thread pitch (p) and screw d and p affects fixation when under-tapping in osteoporotic bone. study design: this study is a polyurethane foam block biomechanical analysis. materials and methods: a foam block osteoporotic bone model was used to compare pullout strength of pedicle screws with a 5.3 nominal diameter tap of varying d 's and p 's. blocks were sorted into seven groups: (1) probe only; (2) 0.5-mm d, 1.5-mm p tap; (3) 0.5-mm d, 2.0-mm p tap; (4) 0.75-mm d, 2.0-mm p tap; (5) 0.75-mm d, 2.5-mm p tap; (6) 0.75-mm d, 3.0-mm p tap; and (7) 1.0-mm d, 2.5-mm p tap. a pedicle screw, 6.5 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length, was inserted to a depth of 40 mm. axial pullout testing was performed at a rate of 5 mm/min on 10 blocks from each group. results: no significant difference was noted between groups under axial pullout testing. the mode of failure in the probe-only group was block fracture, occurring in 50% of cases. among the other six groups, only one screw failed because of block fracture. the other 59 failed because of screw pullout. conclusions: in an osteoporotic bone model, changing the d or p of the tap has no statistically significant effect on axial pullout. osteoporotic bone might render tap features marginal. our findings indicate that changing the characteristics of the tap d and p does not help with pullout strength in an osteoporotic model. the high rate of fracture in the probe-only group might imply the potential benefit of tapping to prevent catastrophic failure of bone.

children's_health	introduction: perfluorinated alkylated substances (pfas) are persistent industrial chemicals that have resulted in global environmental exposures. previous epidemiological studies have reported possible effects on the immune system after developmental pfas exposure, but the possible impact on childhood infectious disease is unclear. objectives: to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to pfas and symptoms of infections at age 1-4 years. methods: the odense child cohort is an on-going prospective study on children 's health, where serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (pfos), perfluorooctanoic acid (pfoa), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (pfhxs), perfluorodecanoic acid (pfda) and perfluorononanoic acid (pfna) were measured in 649 pregnant women before gestational week 16. of these women, 359 reported on symptoms of infection in their child every two weeks for a one-year period. the association between prenatal exposure to pfas and the symptoms was estimated using a logistic regression model and a negative binomial regression model. for the latter, the outcome was reported as an incidence rate-ratio (irr), and all models were adjusted for maternal age, educational level, parity and child age. results: on average, the children experienced symptoms of infection 23% of the time during one year. pfos exposure in the high tertile compared to the low tertile was associated with a statistically significant increased proportion of days with fever (irr: 1.65 (95% ci: 1.24, 2.18), p-trend < 0.001) and an increased odds of experiencing days with fever above the median (or: 2.35 (95% ci: 1.31, 4.11). the latter tendency was also apparent for pfoa (or: 1.97 (95% ci: 1.07, 3.62). further, higher concentrations of pfos and pfoa tended to increase the number of episodes of co-occurrence of fever and coughing and fever and nasal discharge during the one-year study period. conclusion: we found a positive association between prenatal exposure to pfos and pfoa and the prevalence of fever, which may be a sensitive marker of infection. this finding is in agreement with an immunotoxic effect of prenatal exposure to pfas. the wider implications for childhood infectious disease deserve attention.

dementia	aimdementia and cognitive impairment are important public health challenges to a rapidly aging country. the present study aimed to explore the protective factors against cognitive decline among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people from health, social, and lifestyle perspectives. methodsdata of the social environment and biomarkers of aging study, a population-based cohort study in taiwan, were retrieved for the study. overall, 676 participants with intact baseline cognitive function (measured by the short portable mental status questionnaire) were enrolled and followed for six years. any increasing score of the short portable mental status questionnaire in the observational period was referred to as cognitive function decline. associated factors for cognitive decline were identified by the logistic regression model. resultsamong all participants, 205 (30%) experienced cognitive decline during the study period. crude logistic regression showed that women (odds ratio [or] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.3-2.6), low educational level (or 2.0, 95% ci 1.4-3.0) and low mastery (or 1.4, 95% ci 1.0-1.9) were associated with cognitive decline, but no daily consumption of vegetables and fruits had only a marginal association (or 1.3, 95% ci 0.9-1.8). in the fully adjusted logistic regression analysis, old age, women, low educational level and low sense of mastery were independent predictors for cognitive decline. participants with two modifiable factors (mastery, and daily consumptions of vegetables and fruits) had a lower risk of cognitive decline (or 0.5, 95% ci 0.3-0.9), compared with those without any protective factor. conclusionsparticipants with a better educational level, better personal mastery, and more consumption of fruits and vegetables were less likely to experience cognitive decline. an intervention study combining these features should be carried out to promote better cognitive health in communities. geriatr gerontol int 2017: 17 (suppl. 1): 20-27.
lymphoma	soft tissue reactions to paraffin include inflammation, fibrosis, disfigurement, and granulomatous inflammation with foreign body giant cell reaction. the authors report the case of a 77-year-old woman with cutaneous marginal zone b cell lymphoma located on glabella, arising in association with underlying paraffinoma. while it is unclear whether the implant directly contributed to the development of lymphoma, this association has not been previously documented, prompting this report.
asthma	mast cells are effector cells in immunoglobulin e (ige)-mediated immediate hypersensitivity and allergic diseases such as asthma and food allergy. mast cells are activated by the aggregation of the ige-bound high-affinity ige receptor fceri with multivalent antigen. activated mast cells secrete proinflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, and proteases and produce cytokines and chemokines. however, it has been reported that mast cells are activated by crosslinking of fceri with monomeric ige in the absence of antigen. we have recently demonstrated that histamine releasing factor (hrf) is involved in ige-mediated mast cell activation both in vitro and in vivo. hrf binds to a subset of ige and igg molecules [hrf-reactive antibodies (abs)]. the fab, but not fc, portions of the ige and igg molecules are hrf-binding sites, and the n-terminal 19-residue (n19) and h3 portions of hrf are hrf-reactive ab-binding sites. we observed that both n19 and h3 tagged with glutathione s transferase (gst) (gst-n19 and gst-h3) can inhibit the interaction between hrf and hrf-reactive abs. using acute- and late-phase passive cutaneous anaphylaxis mouse models, it was shown that hrf initiates mast cell activation through hrf-reactive, but not hrf-nonreactive, ige in vivo. antigen-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis was inhibited by pretreatment with gst-n19 and gst-h3. we demonstrated that pretreatment with gst-n19 before antigen challenge inhibited antigen-induced mast cell-dependent airway inflammation. in addition, gst-n19 partially inhibited aspergillus fumigatus extract-induced ige-dependent airway inflammation. however, gst-n19 did not inhibit t cell-dependent airway inflammation. these results suggest that mast cells are target cells for hrf to initiate ige- and mast cell-dependent airway inflammation.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: the treatment of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (chp) often includes systemic oral corticosteroids, but the optimal pharmacologic management remains unclear. the morbidity associated with prednisone has motivated the search for alternative therapies. we aimed to determine the effect of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) or azathioprine (aza) on lung function in patients with chp. methods: patients with chp treated with either mmf or aza were retrospectively identified from four interstitial lung disease centers. change in lung function before and after treatment initiation was analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling (lmm), adjusting for age, sex, smoking history, and prednisone use. results: seventy patients were included: 51 were treated withmmfand 19 with aza. median follow-up after treatment initiation was 11 months. prior to treatment initiation, fvc and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (dlco)% predicted were declining at amean rate of 0.12% (p <.001) and 0.10% (p <.001) per month, respectively. treatment with either mmf or aza was not associated with improved fvc (0.5% at 1 year; p =.46) but was associated with a statistically significant improvement in dlco of 4.2% (p <.001) after 1 year of treatment. results were similar in the subgroup of patients treated with mmf for 1 year; the fvc increased nonsignificantly by 1.3% (p =.103) and dlco increased by 3.9% (p <.001). conclusions: treatment with mmf or aza is associated with improvements in dlco in patients with chp. prospective randomized trials are needed to validate their effectiveness for chp.
crohn's_disease	aim to assess the impact of disease characteristics on the quality of life (qol) in children with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd). methods this was a cross-sectional study conducted at the first department of pediatrics of the university of athens at the ""aghia sophia"" children 's hospital. children diagnosed with crohn 's disease (cd) or ulcerative colitis (uc), who were followed as outpatients or during a hospitalization, participated, after informed consent was obtained from their legal representative. qol was assessed by the impact-iii questionnaire. demographic data and disease characteristics were also collected. statistical analyses included parametric (student 's t-test and pearson 's r) and non-parametric (mann-whitney test, fisher 's test and spearman 's rho) procedures. results ninety-nine patients (uc: 37, 73.0% females, cd: 62, 51.6% females), aged 12.8 +/- 2.6 years were included. overall, as well as, sub-domain scores did not differ between uc and cd (overall score: 73.9 +/- 13.3 vs 77.5 +/- 11.2, respectively, p = 0.16). in the entire sample, total score was related to physician 's global assessment (pga, patients classified as ""mild/moderate"" active disease had, on average, 14.8 +/- 2.7 points lower total scores compared to those "" in remission"", p < 0.001) and age at impact completion (pearson 's r = 0.29, p = 0.05). disease activity assessed by the indices pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index, pediatric crohn 's disease activity index or pga was significantly associated with all subdomains scores. presence of extraintestinal manifestations had a negative impact on emotional and social functioning domains. conclusion disease activity is the main correlate of qol in children with ibd, underlining the importance of achieving and sustaining clinical remission key words: inflammatory
hereditary_angioedema	the clinical immunology literature is punctuated with research on psychosocial dimensions of illness. studies investigating the lived experiences and stated needs of patients with primary immune deficiencies and their families are essential to improving clinical management and determining the research questions that matter to patients and other stakeholders. yet, to move the field forward, a systematic review of literature and proposed agenda is needed. a systematic review was conducted via pubmed and scopus to include original research on psychological, social, or behavioral aspects of primary immune deficiencies published between 1999 and 2015. a title/abstract keyword search was conducted, 317 candidate article abstracts were manually reviewed, and forward/backward reference searches were completed. twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. these illuminate the complex psychological, social, and emotional experiences of primary immune deficiency. themes included the potential for negative psychosocial impact from disease; adaptation over time; the multi-dimensional assessments of quality of life; familial impact; the important roles of hope, developing a sense of control, social support; and addressing anxiety/depression in our patients and their families. methodological considerations and areas for improvement are discussed. we propose the research agenda focus on study creativity and rigor, with improved engagement with existing literature and critical study design (e.g., methodology with adequate statistical power, careful variable selection, etc.). this review highlights opportunities to advance psychosocial research and bring a brighter future to clinicians, researchers, and families affected by primary immune deficiency.
healthy_sleep	due to the frequency of this phenomenon and the often considerable distress caused to the affected person, competent advice, diagnosis and treatment of snoring in adults is of particular importance. the aim of this guideline is to promote high-quality medical care for patients affected by this problem. according to the three-level concept of the awmf, it corresponds to an s1 guideline. prior to any therapeutic intervention, relevant sleep medical history, clinical examination, as well as a mandatory objective diagnostic measure are performed. snoring is only treated if the patient asks for it. in general, invasive methods should be viewed critically and the patient should be advised correspondingly. in the case of surgical therapy, minimally invasive techniques are preferred. reducing body weight (in the case of overweight snorers), abstinence from alcohol, nicotine and sleep medication, as well as maintaining a healthy sleep-wake cycle can be recommended from a sleep-medicine perspective, although convincing clinical studies are not yet available. since evidence for the effectiveness of muscle stimulation or various methods for toning and training of the muscles of the floor of mouth is not available, these methods are not recommended. snoring can be successfully treated with the use of an intraoral device; however, careful patient selection is important. avoiding a supine position during sleep can be helpful in some cases. only limited data is available on the success rates of the surgical approaches and long term data is often lacking, and not all techniques have been sufficiently evaluated from a scientific point of view. nasal surgery is only indicated if the patient suffers from nasal obstruction. extensive data supports the effectiveness of laser-assisted resection of excessive soft palate tissue (laser-assisted uvuloplasty, laup). in principle, however, such resections can be performed using other techniques. placebo-controlled studies were able to prove the effectiveness of radiofrequency surgery of the soft palate. a reduction in snoring could also be achieved in many cases by means of soft palate implants with minimal post-operative morbidity. the indication for tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty should be made cautiously due to the comparatively high morbidity associated with these procedures.
addiction	this study was a randomized effectiveness trial of the use of incentives to improve treatment retention and post-treatment outcomes among parolees in community treatment. parolees entering community treatment were randomized to incentives (n = 104) or brief education (n = 98). it was hypothesized that the use of incentives to increase treatment retention would result in improved post-treatment outcomes (i.e., arrest, employment, and drug use), but at 18 months post-intake, there were no group differences for any outcome. in secondary analyses, rearrest by 18 months post-intake was predicted by substance use, greater number or severity of psychological symptoms, treatment non-completion, unemployment, and younger age. contrary to expectations, results indicated that participants who received incentives for attendance had arrest, employment, and drug use outcomes similar to those who received a brief education session. our findings, in concert with those of several other researchers, suggest that there may be certain populations or settings where incentives may not be effective.
osteoarthritis	to provide experimental basis for clinic treatment by observing the effects of simple acute hematoma on cartilage and synovium, and improvement of hyaluronic acid (ha) on the damage. twenty-four new zealand white rabbits were randomly divided 3 groups according to killed time: hematoma group, ha group and control group. these rabbits were killed at 4 days, 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. knee articular cartilage and synovium were obtained to detect histology, histochemistry and chondroitin proteoglycans (pg). morphologies of cartilage and synovium in the control group were normal, while cartilage cells were detected hyperplasia of activation and each layer was disorganized in hematoma groups with 4 days and 2 weeks. compared to the control group, concentrations of pg in 4 days and 2 weeks groups were significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while no significant difference was detected between 4 weeks group and the control group. morphology was recovered normal in 8 weeks. compared to hematoma group, morphology and histochemistry were improved in ha group at each time frame. simple acute hematoma can lead to temporary change of morphology and biochemistry. application of ha can reduce damage of hemarthrosis on cartilaginous and shorten the cartilage recovery time.
digestive_health	the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract is the major interface between the external world (e.g., the gut lumen) and the body, and as such the proper maintenance and regulation of epithelial barrier function is a key determinant of digestive health and host well-being. many enteropathies are associated with increased gut permeability, including inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). maintaining the barrier function of the epithelium, independent of whether paracellular or transcellular permeation pathways are considered, is an energy-dependent process. here we present an overview of the impact that metabolic stress (e.g., reductions in epithelial atp synthesis) can have on permeability characteristics of epithelial monolayers and show that metabolic stress in the presence of a commensal flora results in a significant loss of epithelial integrity, and that this increase in epithelial permeability can be enhanced by the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha). we speculate that the combination of these factors in vivo would result in significant perturbations in epithelial barrier function that could be of pathophysiological significance and contribute to the initiation of ibd or the induction of disease relapses.
addiction	objective there is increasing interest in neuromodulation for addiction. methamphetamine abuse is a global health epidemic with no proven treatment. the objective of this study was to examine the effects of intermittent nucleus accumbens shell (acbsh) deep brain stimulation (dbs) on operant methamphetamine intake and on methamphetamine seeking when stimulation is delivered in an environment different from that of drug use. methods eighteen rats were implanted with intravenous (iv) catheters and bilateral acbsh electrodes and subsequently underwent daily sessions in 2-lever (active/methamphetamine and inactive/no reward) operant chambers to establish iv methamphetamine self-administration. after stable responding was achieved, 3 hours of dbs or sham treatment was administered (sham: 0 mu a, n = 8; active: 200 mu a, n = 10) in a separate nondrug environment prior to the daily operant sessions for 5 consecutive days. immediately following each dbs/sham treatment, rats were placed in the operant chambers to examine the effects of remote stimulation on methamphetamine intake. after the 5 days of therapy were finished, rats reestablished a posttreatment baseline, followed by extinction training, abstinence, and 1 day of relapse testing to assess methamphetamine-seeking behavior. results there was a decrease in total methamphetamine intake in rats receiving active dbs versus sham on days 1 (42%) and 2 (44%). methamphetamine administration returned to baseline levels following the cessation of dbs therapy. compared with baseline drug responding, methamphetamine seeking was reduced (57%) in the dbs group but not in the sham group. conclusions it is feasible to deliver noncontinuous dbs outside of the drug use environment with a resultant decrease in iv methamphetamine intake and seeking. the acbsh is a neuroanatomical substrate for psychostimulant reinforcement and may be a target for intermittent neuromodulatory therapies that could be administered during brief periods of sobriety.
crohn's_disease	aim to investigate the clinical implications of infliximab trough levels (ifx-tls) and antibodies to infliximab (ati) levels in crohn 's disease (cd) patients in asian countries. methods ifx-tl and ati level were measured using prospectively collected samples obtained with informed consent from cd patients being treated at asan medical center, south korea. we analyzed the correlations between ifx-tls/ati levels and the clinical activity of cd (quiescent vs active disease) based on the cd activity index, c-reactive protein level, and physician 's judgment of patients' clinical status at enrollment. the impact of concomitant immunomodulators was also investigated. results this study enrolled 138 patients with cd (84 with quiescent and 54 with active disease). in patients with quiescent and active diseases, the median ifx-tls were 1.423 mu g/ml and 0.163 mu g/ml, respectively (p < 0.001) and the median ati levels were 8.064 au/ml and 11.209 au/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). in the ati-negative and -positive groups, the median ifx-tls were 1.415 mu g/ml and 0.141 mu g/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). in patients with and without concomitant immunomodulator use, there were no differences in ifx-tls (0.632 mu g/ml and 1.150 mu g/ml, respectively; p = 0.274) or ati levels (8.655 au/ml and 9.017 au/ml, respectively; p = 0.083). conclusion ifx-tl/ati levels were well correlated with the clinical activity in south korean cd patients. our findings support the usefulness of ifx-tls/ati levels in treating cd patients receiving ifx in clinical practice.
osteoarthritis	degradation of the extracellular matrix type ii collagen (col ii) induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) is an important hallmark of osteoarthritis (oa). oxytocin (ot) is a well-known neurohypophysical hormone that is synthesized in the paraventricular (pvn) and supra optic nuclei (son) of the hypothalamus. in this study, we have found that oxytocin receptor (otr) was expressed in human primary chondrocytes, and the expression of which was reduced in chondrocytes from oa patients and in response to tnf-alpha treatment in a dose dependent manner. notably, it was shown that tnf-alpha-induced degradation of col ii was restored by treatment with ot in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, tnf-alpha treatment (10 ng/ml) highly elevated the expression of mmp-1 and mmp-13 in sw1353 chondrocytes, which were reversed by ot in a dose dependent manner at both gene and protein expression levels. in addition, it was demonstrated that the jak2/stat1 pathway was involved in the restoration effects of ot in the degradation of col ii. lastly, knockdown of otr abolished the inhibitory effects of ot on the degradation of col ii and the induction of mmp-1 and mmp-13 expression, suggesting the involvement of otr. our study implied the therapeutic potential of ot for cartilage degradation.

asthma	picornavirus replication is known to cause extensive remodeling of golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and a number of the host proteins involved in the viral replication complex have been identified, including oxysterol binding protein (osbp) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase iii beta (pi4kb). since both osbp and pi4kb are substrates for protein kinase d (pkd) and pkd is known to be involved in the control of golgi membrane vesicular and lipid transport, we hypothesized that pkd played a role in viral replication. we present multiple lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis. first, infection of hela cells with human rhinovirus (hrv) induced the phosphorylation of pkd. second, pkd inhibitors reduced hrv genome replication, protein expression, and titers in a concentration-dependent fashion and also blocked the replication of poliovirus (pv) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) in a variety of cells. third, hrv replication was significantly reduced in hela cells overexpressing wild-type and mutant forms of pkd1. fourth, hrv genome replication was reduced in hap1 cells in which the pkd1 gene was knocked out by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas9. although we have not identified the molecular mechanism through which pkd regulates viral replication, our data suggest that this is not due to enhanced interferon signaling or an inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and pkd inhibitors do not need to be present during viral uptake. our data show for the first time that targeting pkd with small molecules can inhibit the replication of hrv, pv, and fmdv, and therefore, pkd may represent a novel antiviral target for drug discovery. importance picornaviruses remain an important family of human and animal pathogens for which we have a very limited arsenal of antiviral agents. hrv is the causative agent of the common cold, which in itself is a relatively trivial infection; however, in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients, this virus is a major cause of exacerbations resulting in an increased use of medication, worsening symptoms, and, frequently, hospital admission. thus, hrv represents a substantial health care and economic burden for which there are no approved therapies. we sought to identify a novel host target as a potential anti-hrv therapy. hrv infection induces the phosphorylation of pkd, and inhibitors of this kinase effectively block hrv replication at an early stage of the viral life cycle. moreover, pkd inhibitors also block pv and fmdv replication. this is the first description that pkd may represent a target for antiviral drug discovery.
osteoporosis	bone turnover markers (btms) are product of bone cell activity and are generally divided in bone formation and bone resorption markers. the purpose of this review was to structure the available information on the use of btms in studies on small ruminants, especially for monitoring their variations related to diet, exercise, gestation and metabolic lactation state, circadian and seasonal variations, and also during skeletal growth. pre-clinical and translational studies using btms with sheep and goats as animal models in orthopaedic research studies to help in the evaluation of the fracture healing process and osteoporosis research are also described in this review. the available information from the reviewed studies was systematically organized in order to highlight the most promising btms in small ruminant research, as well as provide a wide view of the use of sheep and goat as animal models in orthopaedic research, type of markers and commercial assay kits with cross-reactivity in sheep and goat, method of sample and storage of serum and urine for bone turnover markers determination and the usefulness and limitations of bone turnover markers in the different studies, therefore an effective tool for researchers that seek answers to different questions while using btms in small ruminants.
atrial_fibrillation	objectives: we sought to investigate the incidence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation for typical atrial flutter and to determine the predictors for symptomatic atrial fibrillation that required a further additional dedicated ablation procedure. design: 127 patients underwent elective cavotricuspid isthmus ablation with the indication of symptomatic, typical atrial flutter. the occurrence of atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular events and the need for additional ablation procedures for symptomatic atrial fibrillation was assessed during long-term follow-up. results: the majority of patients (70%) manifested atrial fibrillation during a follow-up period of 68 +/- 24 months, and a significant proportion (42%) underwent one or multiple atrial fibrillation ablation procedures after an average of 26 months from the index procedure. recurrence of typical atrial flutter was rare. ten patients (8%) suffered cerebrovascular events. earlier documentation of atrial fibrillation (or 3.53), previous use of flecainide (or 3.33) and left atrial diameter (or 2.96) independently predicted occurrence of atrial fibrillation during the follow-up. a combination of pre- and intra-procedural documentation of atrial fibrillation (or 3.81) and previous use of flecainide (or 2.43) independently predicted additional atrial fibrillation ablation. discussion: atrial fibrillation occurred in the majority of patients after ablation for typical atrial flutter and 42% of them required an additional dedicated ablation procedure. pre- and intra-procedural documentation of atrial fibrillation together with previous use of flecainide independently predicted atrial fibrillation occurrence and a need for additional ablation. anticoagulation treatment should be continued in high-risk patients in spite of clinical disappearance of atrial flutter.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background and aimsprevious studies mostly focused on the diagnostic accuracy of transbronchoscopic lung biopsy (tblb) in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ilds). we aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of tblb results in the diagnostic procedure of undefined ilds. methodsthe retrospective analysis included patients undergoing tblb for the diagnosis of undefined ilds from january 2007 to december 2010. the clinically useful tblb was defined as that lead to a specific histopathological diagnosis or that was consistent with the working diagnosis based on existing clinical and radiological data. resultsa total of 664 patients were included in the study. tblb failed to obtain lung parenchyma in 155 cases (23.3%). tblb was considered clinically helpful in 202 procedures (30.4%), including 114 cases that provided definitive histopathological diagnoses and 88 cases that were consistent with working diagnoses. among 202 cases of clinically useful tblbs, the majority were diagnosed as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (pap) (67 cases, 33.2%), connective tissue disease-related ilds (ctd-ilds) (65, 32.2%) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) (33, 16.3%). although tblb could provide definitive histopathological diagnoses in all cases diagnosed as pap, only few cases of ipf (7, 21.2% of ipf diagnoses) and ctd-ilds (9, 13.8% of ctd-ild diagnoses) could be identified by tblbs. conclusionthe clinical usefulness of tblb, in conjunction with thorough clinical and radiological data, in the diagnosis of ilds may be varied depending on different subtypes. the use of histopathological analysis and the type of biopsy employed should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis.
psoriatic_arthritis	objectives: to study the association of clinical and/or ultrasound variables with patients' (pga) and physicians' (ega) global assessment of disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (psa). the correlation of these parameters with the discordance between pga and ega, as well as with pga/ega changes over 6 months was also investigated. methods: prospective study of 83 consecutive psa patients with 2 visits scheduled 6 months apart. all patients underwent the following assessments: tender (tjc) and swollen joint count (sjc), pasi, dactylitis and leeds enthesitis index. pga, patients' level of pain (pain vas), ega, and haq were also recorded. grey scale (gs) and power doppler (pd) ultrasound were performed at 68 joints (evaluating synovia and tendons) and 14 entheses. regression analyses were performed to assess the association of these variables with pga and ega. two new variables ""pga(minus)ega"" and ""pgachange - egachange"" were developed to explore the discrepancy between pga and ega and the consistency of pga/ega changes over time, respectively. results: the parameters explaining most of pga and ega variability were pain vas (30.5%) and sjc (48.5%), respectively. the correlation between ega and joint counts was stronger in patients with high vs. low levels of ultrasound verified inflammation. pga(minus)ega was mainly explained by pain and sjc. pain was the most important predictor of pga change whereas tjc and haq were more closely associated with ega changes. ""pgachange-egachange"" was linked to pain and sjc. ultrasound scores were not linked with either of these variables. conclusions: pain vas and joint counts are the most important clinical parameters explaining patients' and physicians' perception of disease activity, whereas the correlation of active inflammation as verified by sonography with these factors is limited.

psoriasis	bacterial colonization on skin or tonsil may influence the clinical response of patients with psoriasis to immunosuppressive drugs. however, few studies have investigated the effects of bacterial superantigens on therapy in these patients. recently, combination therapy with topical glucocorticoids (gc) and vitamin d3 (vd3) appears to be more effective than gc or vd3 monotherapy for psoriasis. we evaluated the suppressive effects of betamethasone butyrate propionate (bbp), three vd3 derivatives (calcipotriol, maxacalcitol and tacalcitol), cyclosporin and bbp plus vd3, on concanavalin a (cona)- or streptococcal pyrogenic enterotoxin a (spea)-stimulated proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) obtained from 35 psoriasis patients. drug concentrations effecting 50% inhibition concentration of cona- or spea-stimulated pbmc proliferation were estimated. cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor-, -interferon, interleukin-1b, -2, -4, -5, -6, -8 -10 and -12p70 in pbmc culture supernatants were measured with bead-array procedures. suppression of pbmc proliferation by bbp was significantly lower when pbmc were stimulated by spea than when stimulated by cona. in contrast, the suppressive effects of calcipotriol and tacalcitol increased significantly when pbmc were stimulated by spea than when stimulated by cona. the suppressive effect of bbp on spea-stimulated pbmc proliferation was improved significantly by adding 1-1000 ng/ml calcipotriol, compared with bbp alone. cytokine levels in pbmc culture supernatants were not significantly different between cona- and spea-stimulated pbmc. calcipotriol and bbp in combination markedly suppressed spea-stimulated pbmc proliferation. spea produced by colonization of hemolytic streptococci may reduce the efficacy of bbp but not vd3 derivatives in the treatment of psoriasis.
psoriasis	background/objective: to date, no clinical trials have evaluated the therapeutic response among psoriasis patients switching from ustekinumab to secukinumab. the objective of this study was to report our experience of treating psoriasis patients with secukinumab therapy who had ever received ustekinumab previously. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the therapeutic responses of nine patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who attended the clinical trials of first ustekinumab and then secukinumab. ustekinumab (45 mg) was given at weeks 0, 4, and 16, and patients were evaluated for safety and efficacy at weeks 12 and 16. after the end of the ustekinumab treatment period, patients were treated as needed by other modalities. in 2011, eligible patients were recruited again in a phase 3, double-blind, secukinumab trial (erasure). secukinumab (150 mg or 300 mg) was given at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and then every 4 weeks. a single evaluator performed all the assessments. results: among the nine patients, five patients (55.6%) had at least 75% reduction in the psoriasis area severity index (pasi75) score response, and four patients (44.4%) had at least 90% reduction in the psoriasis area severity index (pasi90) score response at week 12 during secukinumab therapy. their prior experience during ustekinumab therapy revealed at least pasi75 response in four patients (44.4%) and at least pasi90 response also in four patients (44.4%) at week 12. mean absolute pasi change at week 12 of secukinumab therapy in our patients was -17.47. conclusion: biologic switch is effective and valuable. patients who have ever responded to ustekinumab seem to have a better response to secukinumab. copyright (c) 2016, taiwanese dermatological association. published by elsevier taiwan llc.
bipolar_disorder	objective: to evaluate the length of the interval between the onset and the initial management of bipolar disorder (bd). method: we conducted a meta-analysis using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. systematic searches located studies reporting estimates of the age of onset (aoo) and indicators of the age at initial management of bd. we calculated a pooled estimate of the interval between aoo and age at management. factors influencing between-study heterogeneity were investigated using sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, and multiple meta-regression. results: twenty-seven studies, reporting 51 samples and a total of 9415 patients, met the inclusion criteria. the pooled estimate for the interval between the onset of bd and its management was 5.8 years (standardized difference, .53; 95% confidence interval, .45 to .62). there was very high between-sample heterogeneity (i-2 = 92.6; q = 672). a longer interval was found in studies that defined the onset according to the first episode (compared to onset of symptoms or illness) and defined management as age at diagnosis (rather than first treatment or first hospitalization). a longer interval was reported among more recently published studies, among studies that used a systematic method to establish the chronology of illness, among studies with a smaller proportion of bipolar i patients, and among studies with an earlier mean aoo. conclusions: there is currently little consistency in the way researchers report the aoo and initial management of bd. however, the large interval between onset and management of bd presents an opportunity for earlier intervention.
osteoporosis	we present final results of a study comparing teriparatide 20g every day (qd) with risedronate 35mg once per week (qw) started within 2 weeks after surgery for a pertrochanteric hip fracture. patients with bmd t-score-2.0 and 25ohd 9.2ng/ml were randomized to receive 26-week double-dummy treatment plus calcium and vitamin d, followed by 52-week open-label treatment with the same assigned active drug. primary endpoint was change from baseline in lumbar spine (ls) bmd at 78 weeks. secondary and exploratory endpoints were change in bmd at the proximal femur, function, hip pain (charnley score and 100mm visual analog scale [vas]), quality of life (short form-36), radiology outcomes, and safety. data were analyzed with mixed models for repeated measures (mmrm) and logistic regression. totally, 224 patients were randomized; 171 (teriparatide: 86) contributed to the efficacy analyses (mean +/- sd age: 77 +/- 7.7 years, 77% females). mean baseline ls, femoral neck (fn), and total hip (th) t-scores were -2.16, -2.63, and -2.51, respectively. at 78 weeks, bmd increased significantly more with teriparatide compared to risedronate at the ls (+11.08% versus +6.45%; p<0.001) and fn (+1.96% versus -1.19%; p=0.003), with no significant between-group difference in th bmd. timed up-and-go (tug) test was significantly faster with teriparatide at 6, 12, 18, and 26 weeks (differences: -3.2 to -5.9s; p=0.045 for overall difference). hip pain during tug test by 100mm vas was significantly lower with teriparatide at 18 weeks (adjusted difference: -11.3mm, p=0.033; -10.0 and -9.3mm at 12 and 26 weeks, respectively; p=0.079 for overall difference). other secondary and exploratory outcomes were not different. teriparatide group showed two new hip fractures versus seven with risedronate (p=0.171) and more frequent hypercalcemia and hyperuricemia. in conclusion, 78-week treatment with teriparatide showed significantly greater increases in ls and fn bmd, less pain, and a faster tug test versus risedronate.

healthy_sleep	purpose: to experimentally test whether chronic sleep restriction, which is common among adolescents, is causally related to poor learning, inattentive behaviors, and diminished arousal in a classroom-like situation. methods: sixteen healthy adolescents underwent a sleep manipulation that included, in counterbalanced order, five consecutive nights of sleep deprivation (6 hours in bed) versus five nights of healthy sleep duration (10 hours in bed). at the end of each condition, participants viewed educational films and took related quizzes in a simulated classroom. eight participants also underwent video and electroencephalography monitoring to assess levels of inattentive behaviors and arousal, respectively. results: as compared with the healthy sleep condition, sleep-deprived participants had lower quiz scores (p = .05), more inattentive behaviors (p < .05), and lower arousal (p = .08). conclusions: these pilot data complement previous correlational reports by showing that chronic sleep restriction during adolescence can cause inattention, diminished learning, and lowered arousal in a simulated classroom.

osteoporosis	introduction: the use of frax without the inclusion of bone mineral density (frax-bmi) may be useful in clinical practice to identify patients at high risk of fracture and inform treatment decisions, but its usefulness is debated. the aim of the study is to evaluate the agreement between the risk of fracture calculated by frax with or without bone mineral density (bmd). patients and methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted with 431 women (40-90 years) without treatment. the concordance of the probability of fracture was assessed by the concordance correlation coefficient (ccc), and by bland-altman method. the kappa index was used to evaluate the agreement results: the difference between the risks of a major osteoporosis fracture (mofr) was 1.02 +/- 1.40% (95% ci -2 to 1.90) and -0.03 +/- 0.51% (95% ci -1.18 to 1.32) for the hip fracture risk (hfr). agreement between mofr and hfr frax scores was good (ccc 0.879, 95% ci 0.85-0.90 and ccc 0.821, 95% ci 0.79-0.85, respectively). the correlation between bmd of the femoral neck and fracture risk calculated by fraxbmi was a moderate, mofr (r = -0.55, p < .001) and hfr (r = -0.54, p < .001). the agreement between the recommendations of treatment was 87% (kappa 0.61). conclusions: the good agreement between the risk of fracture obtained suggests that frax-bmi allows us to provide an estimate of risk in most cases.

addiction	individuals with substance use disorders (sud) have high rates of chronic illness and readmission, yet few are engaged in addiction treatment. hospitalization may be a reachable moment for initiating and coordinating addiction care, but little is known about motivation for change in the inpatient setting. to explore the experiences of hospitalized adults with sud and to better understand patient and system level factors impacting readiness for change. we performed a qualitative study using individual interviews. the study was nested within a larger mixed-methods needs assessment. hospitalized adults admitted to medical or surgical units at an urban academic medical center who reported high-risk alcohol or drug use on audit-c or single-item drug use screener. we conducted a thematic analysis, using an inductive approach at a semantic level. thirty-two patients participated. the mean age was 43 years; 75% were men, and 68% identified as white. participants reported moderate to high-risk alcohol (39%), amphetamine (46%), and opioid (65%) use. emergent themes highlight the influence of hospitalization at the patient, provider, and health system levels. many patients experienced hospitalization as a wake-up call, where mortality was motivation for change and hospitalization disrupted substance use. however, many participants voiced complex narratives of social chaos, trauma, homelessness, and chronic pain. participants valued providers who understood sud and the importance of treatment choice. patient experience suggests the importance of peers in the hospital setting, access to medication-assisted treatment, and coordinated care post-discharge. this study supports that hospitalization offers an opportunity to initiate and coordinate addiction care, and provides insights into patient, provider, and health system factors which can leverage the reachability of this moment.
dementia	with hip fracture and dementia increasing in incidence in the global ageing population, there is a need for the development of specific procedures targeting optimal treatment outcomes for these patients. this paper looks primarily at the factors that limit access to subacute rehabilitation services as a growing body of evidence suggests that access to timely inpatient rehabilitation increases functional outcomes for patients both with dementia and without. information was gathered by searching electronic data bases (scopus, medline, cinahl, health source nursing/academic addition, psychinfo and the cochrane library) for relevant articles using the search terms dementia or alzheimer* and hip fracture and subacute rehabilitation or convalescence for the period 2005-2015. abstracts were scanned to identify articles discussing eligibility and access. a total of nine papers were identified that directly addressed this topic. other papers discussing success or failure of rehabilitation and improved models of care were also reviewed. barriers to access discussed in the literature include information management, management of comorbidities, attitudes, resource availability, and the quality of evidence and education. by identifying these factors we can identify strategic points of intervention across the trajectory of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation that may improve outcomes for this growing group of vulnerable patients. emerging best practice for these patients is also discussed.
osteoporosis	to assess intra- and inter-observer agreement in the morphological evaluation of mandibular cortical bone on panoramic radiographs, to examine factors affecting the diagnosis, and to determine causes of diagnostic discrepancy. three experienced observers evaluated mandibular cortical shape on panoramic radiographs of 228 females, and divided the images into three classes. the intra- and inter-observer agreements were calculated. the effect of mandibular cortical width on shape classification was examined. causes of diagnostic discrepancy were investigated. overall intra- and inter-observer kappa values in diagnosing mandibular cortical shape were 0.58-0.76 and 0.62-0.69, respectively. the kappa values in diagnosing class 2 were low. in radiographs diagnosed as class 2 and class 3, the ranges of mandibular cortical width overlapped. discrepancies in diagnosis were caused by slight resorption at the endosteal margin of the cortical bone, endosteal cortical residues near the thinned smooth cortex, and superimposition of the hyoid bone over the mandible. inter-observer agreement in evaluating mandibular cortical shape was moderate to substantial. diagnostic discrepancies were mainly caused by differences in evaluation of the endosteum near the cortical bone.
osteoporosis	we analyzed the association of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) with mortality after osteoporosis-related hip fracture in austria. ppis were associated with reduced 90-day mortality but elevated mortality after half a year when initiated pre-fracture. inpatients and discharged patients on ppis showed lowered in-hospital and 90-day mortality, respectively. we herein investigated use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) and mortality among hip fracture patients in a nationwide study in austria. in this retrospective cohort study, data on use of ppis were obtained from 31,668 austrian patients aeyen>50 years with a hip fracture between july 2008 and december 2010. all-cause mortality in patients without anti-osteoporotic drug treatment who had received their first recorded ppi prescription in the study period either before or after fracture was compared with hip fracture patients on neither ppis nor anti-osteoporotic medication using logistic and cox regression analysis. with ppi use, 90-day mortality was significantly reduced, both at initiation before (or 0.66; p 0.0001) and after hip fracture (or 0.23; p 0.0001). 90-day mortality was also reduced when ppis were prescribed not until after discharge from the last recorded hip fracture-related hospital stay (or 0.49; p 0.0001) except for patients aged 70 years. in a sub-cohort of patients beginning ppis during hospital stay, in-hospital mortality (0.2%) was substantially reduced relative to matched control patients (3.5%) (p 0.0001). longer-term mortality significantly increased after half a year post-fracture only among those who started ppi prescription before fracture. ppi use during and after hospital stay due to hip fracture is associated with a considerable decrease in mortality. these findings could have implications for hip fracture treatment.
ankylosing_spondylitis	infliximab (ifx) is an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody used to treat inflammatory joint diseases. infusion reactions (ir) can occur during and after intravenous administration and often require discontinuation of ifx therapy. this retrospective study aimed at evaluating the incidence of ir in patients with joint inflammatory diseases receiving ifx with and without premedication. clinical charts of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis patients receiving ifx from january 2002 to december 2014 were reviewed. patients receiving only one premedication protocol over time were enrolled and clustered based on the type of premedication as follows: group 1 received no premedication; group 2 received paracetamol, esomeprazole, hydrocortisone, and chlorpheniramine maleate; group 3 received paracetamol, hydoxyzine, ranitidine, and 6-methylprednisolone. adverse events were recorded during the infusion, in the following hours and at control visits. the charts of 105 patients treated with ifx were selected. ir were observed in 23/51 patients of group 1, in 7/35 patients of group 2, and none of 19 patients in group 3. ir incidence was significantly lower in the second (p = 0.021) and third (p < 0.001) compared to the first group. the incidence of ir was significantly lower in group 3 than group 2 (p < 0.043). moreover, patients in group 1 had a relative risk of developing an ir 2.5 times higher than group 2. in our experience, the use of premedication significantly reduced the number of ir to ifx. in particular, the combination of paracetamol, hydroxyzine, 6-methylprednisolone and ranitidine was more efficacious than paracetamol, esomeprazole, hydrocortisone, and chlorpheniramine maleate combination protocol.
stress_management	background: psychosocial distress can contribute to avoidance, refusal, or discontinuation of cancer treatment, which could impact recovery and survival. aims: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a community based psychosocial program on alleviating mood disturbance in breast cancer survivors at different stages of their breast cancer journey. method: a total of 37 women participated in an 8-week psychosocial program at their local community centre. the weekly 3-hour program was delivered in a small group format. program components included health education, behavioural training, cognitive behavioural therapy, art therapy and stress-management. questionnaires aimed at assessing psychiatric morbidity and mood adjustment were administered at the beginning of the program (pre) and at the completion of the program (post). results: group data revealed a significant reduction in psychiatric morbidity and improved psychological adjustment. when participants were divided into degree of psychiatric morbidity (mild, moderate, severe, very severe) a significant reduction in the reporting of anxiety symptoms in the mild, moderate, severe and very severe groups was reported; depression symptoms in the severe and very severe groups were noted, and anger, confusion and somatic symptoms in the mild group were noted. the level of activity was also significantly improved in the very severe group. conclusions: a structured community based psychosocial program is beneficial to women struggling to come to terms with the emotional consequences of breast cancer at all stages of recovery.
children's_health	objectives the objective of this study was to describe factors that influence the ability of state medicaid agencies to report the centers for medicare & medicaid services' (cms) core set of children 's health care quality measures (child core set). methods we conducted a multiple-case study of four high-performing states participating in the children 's health insurance program reauthorization act (chipra) quality demonstration grant program: illinois, maine, pennsylvania, and oregon. cases were purposively selected for their diverse measurement approaches and used data from 2010 to 2015, including 154 interviews, semiannual grant progress reports, and annual public reports on child core set measures. we followed yin 's multiple-case study methodology to describe how and why each state increased the number of measures reported to cms. results all four states increased the number of child core set measures reported to cms during the grant period. each took a different approach to reporting, depending on the available technical, organizational, and behavioral inputs in the state. reporting capacity was influenced by a state 's medicaid data availability, ability to link to other state data systems, past experience with quality measurement, staff time and technical expertise, and demand for the measures. these factors were enhanced by chipra quality demonstration grant funding and other federal capacity building activities, as hypothesized in our conceptual framework. these and other states have made progress reporting the child core set since 2010. conclusion with financial support and investment in state data systems and organizational factors, states can overcome challenges to reporting most of the child core set measures.
asthma	the worldwide increase in asthma prevalence during the last decades and the re-emergence of vitamin d deficiency in many populations hinted toward an underlying association between these two conditions. since asthma is presented with high incidence in childhood and neonatal vitamin d stores depend on maternal vitamin levels, a possible programming effect of maternal vitamin d status during gestation was suggested. observational and longitudinal studies on this subject led to inconclusive results with glimmer of positivity. in the randomized controlled clinical trials (rcts) that followed, increased doses of vitamin d were tested in pregnant women being at high risk of having an asthmatic child. although, the results of rcts showed a potential association with asthma-related phenotypes rather than asthma per se, the low toxicity of vitamin d supplements make it tempting to speculate that pregnant women at a high risk of obtaining a child with asthma may be benefited, especially if they are vitamin d deficient.
atrial_fibrillation	novel mapping technique for af introductionidentification of wavefront propagation pattern during af remains challenging in ablation procedures. we sought to test a novel combination of a new mapping technology called ripple map and high-density mapping to distinguish focal and reentrant activation during atrial fibrillation (af). methods and resultssubjects were patients undergoing ablation for persistent af. if af remained after isolation of the pulmonary veins, the left atrium (la) was mapped by a high-density mapping catheter for later analysis, after which ablation was continued using a conventional stepwise approach. after the procedure, electrograms from the high-density mapping catheter were analyzed using ripple map, which is a new feature in the carto (r) 3, and type of activation on 3 consecutive af cycles was determined. high-density mapping was performed on 569 sites in 45 patients (13 3 sites per patient). af wavefront propagation determined by ripple map was in good agreement with analysis of manual annotation of bipolar electrograms. ripple map 's representation of wavefront activation pattern, which could include local as well as far-field activity, allowed us to identify focal activation in 64 (11%) sites and 1 (0.2%) reentrant activation site. radiofrequency delivery in atrial regions with activation sites identified as focal by ripple map resulted in termination of af more often than regions without focal activation (22% vs. 7%, p = 0.015). conclusionthis study demonstrated that ripple map enabled quick identification of af wavefront activation pattern, potentially being helpful for determining ablation targets in persistent af.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd) is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder, with current estimates of more than 1% of affected children across nations. the patients form a highly heterogeneous group with only the behavioral phenotype in common. the genetic heterogeneity is reflected in a plethora of animal models representing multiple mutations found in families of affected children. despite many years of scientific effort, for the majority of cases the genetic cause remains elusive. it is therefore crucial to include well-validated models of idiopathic autism in studies searching for potential therapeutic agents. one of these models is the btbr t(+)itpr3(tf)/j mouse. the current review summarizes data gathered in recent research on potential molecular mechanisms responsible for the autism-like behavioral phenotype of this strain.

osteoporosis	the santa fe bone symposium is an annual meeting of healthcare professionals and clinical researchers that details the clinical relevance of advances in knowledge of skeletal diseases. the 17th santa fe bone symposium was held in santa fe, new mexico, usa, on august 5-6, 2016. the program included plenary lectures, oral presentations by endocrinology fellows, meet-the-professor sessions, and panel discussions, all aimed to provide ample opportunity for interactive discussions among all participants. symposium topics included recent developments in the translation of basic bone science to patient care, new clinical practice guidelines for postmenopausal osteoporosis, management of patients with disorders of phosphate metabolism, new and emerging treatments for rare bone diseases, strategies to enhance fracture healing, and an update on bone health extension for community healthcare outcomes, using a teleconferencing platform to elevate the level of knowledge of healthcare professionals in underserved communities to deliver best practice care for skeletal diseases. the highlights and important clinical messages of the 2016 santa fe bone symposium are provided herein by each of the faculty presenters.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background and objective: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and variable clinical course. although matrix metalloproteinase-7 (mmp-7) is emerging as an important ipf biomarker, reproducibility across studies is unclear. we aimed to determine whether a previously reported prognostic threshold for mmp-7 was predictive of mortality in an independent cohort of ipf patients. methods: mmp-7 concentrations obtained from heparinized plasma samples were determined by elisa in 97 patients with ipf and 41 healthy controls. the association of the previously published heparin plasma mmp-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/ml with all-cause mortality or transplant-free survival (tfs) was determined, either as an independent biomarker or as part of the modified personal clinical and molecular mortality index (m-pcmi). results: mmp-7 plasma concentrations were significantly higher in ipf patients compared to healthy controls (14.40 +/- 6.55 ng/ml vs 6.03 +/- 2.51 ng/ml, p < 0.001). the plasma mmp-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/ml was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality and tfs (unadjusted cox proportional hazard ratio (hr) = 25.85 and 15.49, 95% ci: 10.91-61.23 and 5.41-44.34, respectively, p < 0.001). mmp-7 concentrations, split by 12.1 ng/ml, were significantly (p < 0.05) predictive of mortality and tfs after adjusting for age, gender, smoking and baseline pulmonary function parameters, in a multivariate cox proportional hazards model. mmp-7 concentrations were negatively correlated with diffusing lung capacity of carbon monoxide (dlco) (r = -0.21, p = 0.02), and positively with a mortality risk scoring system (gap) that combines age, gender, forced vital capacity (fvc) and dlco (r = 0.32, p = 0.001). conclusion: this study confirms that mmp-7 concentrations could be used to accurately predict outcomes across cohorts and centres, when similar collection protocols are applied.
bipolar_disorder	bipolar disorder with comorbid substance abuse is associated with high rates of treatment nonadherence. adherence interventions developed to date have had mixed effects in this population. valued living (i.e., the consistency between a patient 's personal values and daily actions) represents a potentially useful treatment target that may improve adherence. we investigated the relationship between valued living, medication adherence, symptoms, and functioning in a sample of 39 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and a comorbid substance use disorder. results showed that greater values-action consistency explained a unique amount of variance (r-2 change = 15.2%) in medication adherence even after controlling for symptom severity, functional impairment, and other reported reasons for nonadherence. drug use and treatment beliefs also predicted nonadherence. findings suggest that valued living should be investigated further as a potentially malleable treatment target in future adherence intervention research.
mental_health	the purpose of this study was to develop the health and work survey (insat) and examine the validity of the discomfort rating scale. data were collected from 706 portuguese workers from six economic sectors with the support of the health and work survey (insat-inquerito saude e trabalho). the insat is a self-administered questionnaire to assessing working conditions, health and wellbeing, and to provide information to the occupational health systems in the organisations. for the survey instrument validation, the rasch partial credit model (pcm) was used to analyse item fit statistics. from the application of pcm, person separation reliability was obtained (0.8761) and the value can be considered very good (>0.8). from the statistical analysis, the overall model fit information, given by outfit mean square/infit mean square, is between 0.5 and 1.5, meaning ""productive for measurement"" and ""acceptable fit overall"". the insat items can generate predictable response patterns. we recommend that the insat discomfort rating scale and some other items should be reviewed in future works. in any event, this tool proves to be useful in assessing the relationship between work and health and in evaluating key main risk factors, helping to prevent problems and improving occupational health systems.
kidney_health	background: erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esas) are commonly used for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (ckd) and end stage renal disease (esrd). patients often lack an understanding of the potential risks and benefits of esas, despite government mandated education on this topic. decision aids are tools commonly used to discuss important information in health care settings. to address this knowledge gap, we designed this study to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel esa decision aid at promoting informed shared decision making (isdm) between patients and providers related to esa use for ckd- and esrd-related anemia. methods: using the principles of informed shared decision making theory, we designed and piloted an esa decision aid intended to increase ckd and esrd patient understanding of the potential risks and benefits of esas. informed by the findings during development, the esa decision aid was modified and finalized for testing. we will perform a randomized clinical trial to assess if administration of the esa decision aid improves patient understanding of the risks and benefits of esa use compared to control patients receiving standard care. participants with either ckd or esrd and who are receiving esas will be eligible for participation. the primary outcome is patients' score on the patient anemia knowledge in kidney disease (pakkd) survey assessed at enrollment and 3 months after. secondary outcomes include decisional conflict related to esas, and patient satisfaction with provider communication. discussion: the anemia risk communication for patients with kidney disease (arc-kd) study will assess the effectiveness of a novel esa decision aid to improve patient understanding of esa use to manage ckd-and esrd-related anemia. this decision aid is the first resource targeted to improve patient understanding of anemia management in the kidney health context. with the increasing options available for anemia management, this will serve as an important foundation to evolve in the future to optimize anemia-related shared decision making.
addiction	cocaine users characteristically display preferences for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards, and this delay discounting (dd) has been proposed as an endophenotype of cocaine addiction. recent evidence suggests that the norepinephrine system and more specifically the alpha 2a-adrenergic receptor (adra2a) are impacted by chronic cocaine use while also being potentially involved in the neural mechanisms underlying dd. hence, we investigated the effects of adra2a polymorphisms and adra2a mrna expression levels on dd of cocaine users and stimulant-naive controls. two hundred and twenty-three participants (129 cocaine users and 94 stimulant-naive healthy controls) completed a computerized dd paradigm and were genotyped for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps; rs1800544, rs521674 and rs602618) in the adra2a gene, while their peripheral adra2a mrna expression was quantified in whole blood samples. the three snps were in near-perfect linkage disequilibrium. accordingly, significant group*genotype interactions were found for all three adra2avariants revealing steeper dd in cocaine users (but not in controls) carrying the g-allele of snp rs1800544, the t-allele of rs521674 and the c-allele of rs602618. similarly, high adra2a mrna expression levels were significantly associated with a reduced tendency to choose smaller more immediate rewards (over larger delayed rewards) in cocaine users but not in controls. as the relationship between dd and cocaine use was moderated by adra2a snps and by peripheral adra2a gene expression, we propose that the norepinephrine systemis involved in dd deficits observed in cocaine using individuals. consequently, pharmacological compounds targeting adra2asmight be considered for the symptom-specific treatment of delay aversion in stimulant addiction.
stress_management	this paper introduces a wearable feedback device that aims at relaxing the user in stressful situations. the system, which is called wearelaxable, provides various feedback modalities, such as vibration, ambient light, acoustic stimuli and heat in order to reduce the user 's stress level. the development of wearelaxable is based on two studies: at first, all five kinds of feedback and appropriate body positions for stimulation were evaluated with 15 participants. based on the findings of this initial study, we built a wearable arduino prototype to prove the feasibility of our concept. the experience while using the system was tested with 26 test subjects under laboratory conditions. we conclude with a concept design of a wrist-worn device that provides acoustic and visual feedback. as tactile stimulation, a shirt would provide vibration at the positions of the shoulders as well as heat at the loins. users can explicitly activate the system at any time and in any combination of feedback modalities.
anxiety	objectives:chronic pain places a burden on individuals and the economy. although there is evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior therapy, it is recognized that the effects are limited. acceptance and commitment therapy (act), which aims to increase valued action in the presence of pain, has been suggested as an alternative approach. the objective of this review was to determine the clinical effectiveness of act for chronic pain in adults when compared with control conditions and other active treatments.methods:the searches of this systematic review were conducted in the cochrane library, medline, embase, cinahl plus (ebsco), and psycinfo. grey literature, reference list, and reverse citation searches were also completed.results:eleven trials were included. act was favored over controls (no alternative intervention or treatment as usual). significant, medium to large effect sizes were found for measures of pain acceptance and psychological flexibility, which are typically considered processes of act. significant small to medium effect sizes were found for measures of functioning, anxiety, and depression. measures of pain intensity and quality of life were not significantly different than zero. generally effect sizes were smaller at follow-up.discussion:act was more clinically effective than controls on a number of outcomes. it is possible that methodological limitations, some of which are common to psychological trials, may have led to overestimated effects. only a few studies compared act to active treatments and while the evidence is promising for act in the treatment of chronic pain, further methodologically robust trials are required.
kidney_health	background/objectives: numerous randomised controlled trials (rcts) published in first tier medical journals have evaluated the health effects of diets high in protein. we conducted a rigorous systematic review of rcts comparing higher-and lower-protein diets. methods: we searched several electronic databases up to july 2011 for studies focusing on patient-important outcomes (for example, cardiovascular disease) and secondary outcomes such as risk factors for chronic disease (for example, adiposity). results: we identified 111 articles reporting on 74 trials. pooled effect sizes using standardised mean differences (smds) were small to moderate and favoured higher-protein diets for weight loss (smd - 0.36, 95% confidence interval (ci) - 0.56 to - 0.17), body mass index (- 0.37, ci - 0.56 to 0.19), waist circumference (- 0.43, ci - 0.69 to - 0.16), blood pressure (systolic: - 0.21, ci - 0.32 to - 0.09 and diastolic: - 0.18, ci - 0.29 to - 0.06), high-density lipoproteins (hdl 0.25, ci 0.07 to 0.44), fasting insulin (- 0.20, ci - 0.39 to - 0.01) and triglycerides (- 0.51, ci - 0.78 to - 0.24). sensitivity analysis of studies with lower risk of bias abolished the effect on hdl and fasting insulin, and reduced the effect on triglycerides. we observed nonsignificant effects on total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, c-reactive protein, hba1c, fasting blood glucose, and surrogates for bone and kidney health. adverse gastrointestinal events were more common with high-protein diets. multivariable meta-regression analysis showed no significant dose response with higher protein intake. conclusions: higher-protein diets probably improve adiposity, blood pressure and triglyceride levels, but these effects are small and need to be weighed against the potential for harms.
atrial_fibrillation	the sinoatrial node (san) is the dominant pacemaker of the heart. abnormalities in san formation and function can cause sinus arrhythmia, including sick sinus syndrome and sudden death. a better understanding of genes and signaling pathways that regulate san development and function is essential to develop more effective treatment to sinus arrhythmia, including biological pacemakers. in this review, we briefly summarize the key processes of san morphogenesis during development, and focus on the transcriptional network that drives san development.
autism	rett syndrome (rtt) requires total caregiver attention and leads to potential difficulties throughout life. the caregiver burden inventory, designed for alzheimer disease, was modified to a rtt caregiver inventory assessment (rtt cia). reliability and face, construct, and concurrent validity were assessed in caregivers of individuals with rtt. chi square or fisher 's exact test for categorical variables and t tests or wilcoxon two-sample tests for continuous variables were utilized. survey completed by 198 caregivers; 70 caregivers completed follow-up assessment. exploratory factor analysis revealed good agreement for physical burden, emotional burden, and social burden. internal reliability was high (cronbach 's alpha 0.898). rtt cia represents a reliable and valid measure, providing a needed metric of caregiver burden in this disorder.
asthma	probiotic supplementation is a promising preventive strategy for atopic dermatitis (ad). to help clarifying the significance of timing with respect to prevention of ad, we here evaluate the benefit of prophylactic use of probiotic supplementation in neonates younger than 30 weeks of gestation. preterm children from the department of neonatology, rigshospitalet, denmark from two different admission periods were included in a historically controlled cohort study. neonates from january 2007 to february 2010, not treated with and neonates from march 2010 to february 2013 treated with probiotic were enrolled. main outcome was prevalence of ad, and secondary outcomes were use of topical corticosteroids, and number of skin-related visits to gps and dermatologists. 527 preterm neonates were included in the study, 249 treated and 278 not treated with probiotics. response rate for the two cohorts was 76.7 and 77.7% respectively. the prevalence of ad was similar in the two groups (20.9% in the probiotic treated group versus 17.1% in the not treated group, p = 0.33). no significant differences were found between the groups with respect to treatment with topical corticosteroids, or visits at gps or dermatologist. we found no indication that probiotics may prevent ad when administered to neonates < 30 gestation weeks from birth until discharge home. factors influencing the early maturation of the immune system have been assumed to be of particular importance in atopic dermatitis, and hence, our unique cohorts contribute information on how probiotic supplementation may affect the extremely immature immune systems of preterm infants.
mental_health	background: this study evaluates the benefits of integrating behavioral health and trauma services for latinas with a history drug use. changes in quality of life (qol) domains were documented after participation in a manualized intervention in a cohort of latinas. methods: participants were part of a prospective cohort study of 136 latinas with co-occurring disorders (cod) who may have experienced trauma and receiving services in our outpatient treatment facility in bayamon, puerto rico. the whoqol-bref spanish version was used to score physical, psychological, social, and environmental qol domains, at intake and after six months. sociodemographic variables, alcohol, drug use, mental health disorders, and severity of substance use disorders (as defined by the dsm-5) were also tabulated. descriptive statistics and paired t test or the wilcoxon signed-rank test were computed for comparison. results: a median age of 39 years was seen and with 76% high school education or higher degree. the majority were unemployed (95.9%). a diagnosis of severe cocaine use (51.4%) was present and almost half (49.5%) had three or more dsm-5 diagnoses. mean qol scores were higher at six months with statistically significant differences in each domain. women with neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia yielded higher mean qol scores for each domain at six months except for the social domain. women with polydrug use and women who reported exposure to trauma and depressive disorder experienced statistically significant increments in the physical, psychological and social domains in comparison to counterpart women. conclusions: significant and positive changes in qol were found in each domain. latinas who reported traumatic events had lower scores in the physical and psychological qol domains. there was a high prevalence of diminished physical and mental functioning in latinas with cod. the exposure to trauma and the lack of social support negatively affect treatment access and retention for latinas.
children's_health	extremely low frequency magnetic fields (elf-mfs) exposure is still a topic of concern due to their possible impact on children 's health. although epidemiological studies claimed an evidence of a possible association between elf-mf above 0.4 mu t and childhood leukemia, biological mechanisms able to support a causal relationship between elf-mf and this disease were not found yet. to provide further knowledge about children 's elf-mf exposure correlated to children 's daily activities, a measurement study was conducted in milan (italy). eighty-six children were recruited, 52 of whom were specifically chosen with respect to the distance to power lines and built-in transformers to oversample potentially highly exposed children. personal and bedroom measurements were performed for each child in two different seasons. the major outcomes of this study are: (1) median values over 24-h personal and bedroom measurements were <3 mu t established by the italian law as the quality target; (2) geometric mean values over 24-h bedroom measurements were mostly <0.4 mu t; (3) seasonal variations did not significantly influence personal and bedroom measurements; (4) the highest average mf levels were mostly found at home during the day and outdoors; (5) no significant differences were found in the median and geometric mean values between personal and bedroom measurements, but were found in the arithmetic mean.
osteoporosis	saikosaponin-a (sa), a class of native compound with numerous biological activities, may exert protective effect against postmenopausal bone loss. however, it remains unknown whether sa regulates the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (bmscs) in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. in this study, bmscs were treated with various concentrations of sa to stimulate osteogenic differentiation over a 14-day period. additionally, a canonical ovariectomized (ovx) mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of 3-month sa treatment in preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. in vitro, we found that sa promotes alkaline phosphatase activity/staining and alizarin red assay, stimulated the expression of osteogenic markers, i.e., runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx2), osterix, osteopontin, and osteocalcin (ocn) in bmscs. in vivo, the trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and trabecular bone mineral density of the distal femoral metaphysis were significantly increased in ovx mice treated intraperitoneally with sa for 3 months compared with ovx mice that not treated with sa. moreover, the expression of runx2 and ocn in ovx + sa mice was significantly increased than that in ovx mice. finally, we found that sa activated the wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the expression of several downstream genes including t-cell factor-1 and lymphoid enhancer factor-1. inhibition of wnt/beta-catenin pathway by dickkopf-related protein 1 blocked the positive role of sa on osteogenesis. therefore, sa promoted the osteogenic differentiation of bmscs through wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
asthma	this article presents an overview of future uses for biologic therapies in the treatment of immunologic and allergic conditions. discussion is centered on the use of existing therapies outside of their current indication or on new therapies that are close to approval. this information may help familiarize practicing allergists and immunologists with therapies they may soon encounter in their practice as well as help identify conditions and treatments that will require further study in the near future.
atrial_fibrillation	the detection of embolic sources in patients with atrial fibrillation (af) is important to guide anticoagulant therapy. two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (tee) is the gold standard to study left atrial appendage (laa) anatomy and morphology, despite some false-positive diagnosis. we hypothesized that real time 3d tee (rt3dtee) is superior to 2dtee in detecting and/or excluding laa thrombi. we studied 93 patients with non-valvular af (60 males, age = 67.1 +/- 14.2 years) referred for electric cardioversion with transthoracic, 2dtee and rt3dtee. before cardioversion, tte allowed a confident measurement of emptying velocity of laa (laaev) only in 59/93 patients (63%). on the contrary a good quality tee laaev was obtained in all patients with 49/93 (53%) dysfunctional laa (laaev < 40 cm/s). a subgroup of 5 patients (7.2% of the 69 effective cardioversion) presented a persistent dysfunction after cardioversion (with laaev values of < 40 cm/s on the tee post-cv). tee allowed to observe a bilobed shape in 45 patients (48.4%) and three lobes in 22 patients (23.7%). in addition, besides to several additional findings, 2dtee managed to detect thrombi with certainty in 8/93 patients (8.6%). in other 5 cases with diagnostic doubts for thrombi with 2dtee (5/93 patients: 5.4%), the addition of the rt3dtee mode allowed to discriminate with certainty the presence of just pectinate muscles in 4 patients rt3dtee in patients with af at risk of embolism is feasible, accurate and showed an additional diagnostic capability in the differential diagnosis of selected cases with suspected laa thrombi.
bipolar_disorder	introduction: ample evidence suggested a role of sigma-1 receptor in affective disorders since the interaction of numerous antidepressants with sigma receptors was discovered. a recent study on japanese subjects found a genetic variant within the encoding gene sigmar1 (rs1800866a>c) associated with major depressive disorder (mdd). we aimed to evaluate the same polymorphism in both mdd and bipolar disorder (bd) as well as its relationship to response to treatment with antidepressants and mood stabilizers. methods: a total of 238 mdd patients treated for an acute episode of depression, 132 bd patients in treatment with mood stabilizers for a manic or mixed episode, and 324 controls were genotyped for rs1800866. at discharge, response to treatments was evaluated in mdd and bd patients by the hamilton rating scale for depression (hrsd) and the young mania rating score (ymrs), respectively. results: in our korean sample, allele frequencies were different from those reported in other asian and non-asian populations. the cc genotype was associated with bd and, as a trend, with mdd. no significant effect was observed on response to antidepressants in mdd or mood stabilizers in bd, although the cc genotype was more frequent among bd patients experiencing a mixed episode. conclusion: the present findings are the first to propose the putative role of genetic variants within sigmar1 and sigma-1 receptor in bd. sigma-1 receptor can modulate a number of central neurotransmitter systems as well as some other signaling pathways (e.g., neurotrophin and growth factor signaling) which are seemingly involved in bd and other mood disorders.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: craniovertebral junction is a complex anatomical location posing unique challenges to the surgical management of its pathologies. we aimed to identify the fifty most-cited articles that are dedicated to this field. methods: a keyword search using the thomson reuters web of knowledge was conducted to identify articles relevant to the field of craniovertebral junction surgery. the articles were reviewed based on title, abstract, and methods, if necessary, and then ranked based on the total number of citations to identify the fifty most-cited articles. characteristics of the articles were determined and analyzed. results: the earliest top-cited article was published in 1948. when stratified by decade, 1990s was the most productive with 16 articles. the most-cited article was by anderson and dalonzo on a classification of odontoid fractures. by citation rate, the most-cited article was by herms and melcher who described goel 's technique of atlantoaxial fixation using c1 lateral mass screws and c2 pedicle screws with rod fixation. atlantoaxial fixation was the most common topic. the united states, barrow neurological institute, and vh sonntag were the most represented country, institute, and author, respectively. the significant majority of articles were designed as case series providing level iv evidence. conclusion: using citation analysis, we have provided a list of the most-cited articles representing important contributions of various authors from many institutions across the world to the field of craniovertebral junction surgery.
anxiety	background: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) are widely prescribed for mood and anxiety disorders. however, it is not clear whether snris are more strongly associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events than ssris. methods: this was a propensity score-matched, population-based, cohort study of manitobans who started an ssri or snri between april 1, 1998, and march 31, 2014. the primary outcomewas a composite of acute myocardial infarction (ami), stroke, or cardiovascular-related hospitalization within 1 year of drug initiation. each component of the primary outcome and death were analyzed separately in secondary analyses. results: a total of 225,504 and 54,635 patients initiated treatment on an ssri and snri, respectively. after propensity score matching, a higher risk was observed for the primary outcome among snri users (weighted hazards ratio [hr], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.06-1.21). secondary analyses showed that the risk of nonfatal stroke was higher among snri users (weighted hr, 1.20; 95% ci, 1.08-1.33). the risk of death was higher among snri users without mood and/or anxiety disorders (weighted hr, 1.17; 95% ci; 1.03-1.32). no differences were observed in the risk of ami or fatal stroke between ssri and snri use. conclusions: new snri use was associated with a higher risk of nonfatal stroke relative to ssri use. further investigation is warranted regarding the higher risk of death observed in our subgroup analysis among incident snri users without mood and/or anxiety disorders.
anxiety	couched in the context of the experience economy 3.0, this research conceptualized transformations as changes in existential authenticity and anxiety, and phenomenologically explored the essence of a transformative tourist experience and subsequent long-term changes. this research uncovered nine chronologically ordered themes in which existentially oriented concerns were prevalent. it found that tourists did not reflect on existential givens in situ until a triggering episode initiated the meaning-making process. existential anxiety felt post-trip was found to motivate tourists to resolve pertinent existential dilemmas and to initiate meaningful life changes. participants sustained enhanced existential authenticity and became more sensitive to existential anxiety in their lives thereafter.
bipolar_disorder	schizophrenia is associated with severe cognitive deficits, including impaired working memory (wm). a neural mechanismthatmay contribute towmimpairment is the disruption in excitation-inhibition (e/i) balance in cortical microcircuits. it remains unknown, however, how these alterations map onto quantifiable behavioral deficits in patients. based on predictions from a validated microcircuit model of spatial wm, we hypothesized two key behavioral consequences: i) increased variability of wmtraces over time, reducing performance precision; and ii) decreased ability to filter out distractors that overlapwithwmrepresentations. to testmodel predictions, we studied n = 27 schizophrenia patients and n = 28 matched healthy comparison subjects (hcs) who performed a spatialwmtask designed to test the computational model. specifically, we manipulated delay duration and distractor distance presented during the delay. subjects used a high-sensitivity joystick to indicate the remembered location, yielding a continuous response measure. results largely followedmodel predictions, whereby patients exhibited increased variance and less wm precision as the delay period increased relative to hcs. schizophrenia patients also exhibited increasedwmdistractibility, with reports biased toward distractors at specific spatial locations, as predicted by the model. finally, the magnitude of thewm drift and distractibility were significantly correlated, indicating a possibly shared underlying mechanism. effects are consistent with elevated e/i ratio in schizophrenia, establishing a framework for translating neural circuit computational model of cognition to human experiments, explicitly testing mechanistic behavioral hypotheses of cellular-level neural deficits in patients.

psoriasis	background: imiquimod (imq) produces a cutaneous phenotype in mice frequently studied as an acute model of human psoriasis. whether this phenotype depends on strain or sex has never been systematically investigated on a large scale. such effects, however, could lead to conflicts among studies, while further impacting study outcomes and efforts to translate research findings. methods: rna- seq was used to evaluate the psoriasiform phenotype elicited by 6 days of aldara (5% imq) treatment in both sexes of seven mouse strains (c57bl/6 j (b6), balb/cj, cd1, dba/1 j, fvb/nj, 129x1/svj, and molf/eij). results: in most strains, imq altered gene expression in a manner consistent with human psoriasis, partly due to innate immune activation and decreased homeostatic gene expression. the response of molf males was aberrant, however, with decreased expression of differentiation- associated genes (elevated in other strains). key aspects of the imq response differed between the two most commonly studied strains (balb/c and b6). compared with balb/c, the b6 phenotype showed increased expression of genes associated with dna replication, il- 17a stimulation, and activated cd8+ t cells, but decreased expression of genes associated with interferon signaling and cd4+ t cells. although imq- induced expression shifts mirrored psoriasis, responses in balb/c, 129/svj, dba, and molf mice were more consistent with other human skin conditions (e.g., wounds or infections). imq responses in b6 mice were most consistent with human psoriasis and best replicated expression patterns specific to psoriasis lesions. conclusions: these findings demonstrate strain- dependent aspects of imq dermatitis in mice. we have shown that imq does not uniquely model psoriasis but in fact triggers a core set of pathways active in diverse skin diseases. nonetheless, our findings suggest that b6 mice provide a better background than other strains for modeling psoriasis disease mechanisms.
autism	there are many challenges to developing treatments for complex diseases. this review explores the question of whether it is possible to imagine a data repository that would increase the pace of understanding complex diseases sufficiently well to facilitate the development of effective treatments. first, consideration is given to the amount of data that might be needed for such a data repository and whether the existing data storage infrastructure is enough. several successful data repositories are then examined to see if they have common characteristics. an area of science where unsuccessful attempts to develop a data infrastructure is then described to see what lessons could be learned for a data repository devoted to complex disease. then, a variety of issues related to sharing data are discussed. in some of these areas, it is reasonably clear how to move forward. in other areas, there are significant open questions that need to be addressed by all data repositories. using that baseline information, the question of whether data archives can be effective in understanding a complex disease is explored. the major goal of such a data archive is likely to be identifying biomarkers that define sub-populations of the disease. published by elsevier ltd.
mental_health	well-being is often relatively stable across adulthood and old age, but typically exhibits pronounced deteriorations and vast individual differences in the terminal phase of life. however, the factors contributing to these differences are not well understood. using up to 25-year annual longitudinal data obtained from 4,404 now-deceased participants of the nationwide german socio-economic panel study (soep; age at death: m = 73.2 years; sd = 14.3 years; 52% women), we explored the role of multi-indicator constellations of sociodemographic variables, physical health and burden factors, and psychosocial characteristics. expanding earlier reports, structural equation model (sem) trees allowed us to identify profiles of variables that were associated with differences in the shape of late-life well-being trajectories. physical health factors were found to play a major role for well-being decline, but in interaction with psychosocial characteristics such as social participation. to illustrate, for people with low social participation, disability emerged as the strongest correlate of differences in late-life well-being trajectories. however, for people with high social participation, whether or not an individual had spent considerable time in the hospital differentiated high versus low and stable versus declining late-life well-being. we corroborated these results with variable importance measures derived from a set of resampled sem trees (so-called sem forests) that provide robust and comparative indicators of the total interactive effects of variables for differential late-life well-being. we discuss benefits and limitations of our approach and consider our findings in the context of other reports about protective factors against terminal decline in well-being.
stress_management	purpose: to examine the association between periconceptional self-reported stress levels and fecund ability in women. methods: daily stress was reported on a scale from 1 to 4 (lowest to highest) among 400 women who completed daily diaries including data on lifestyle and behavioral factors, menstrual characteristics, contraceptive use, and intercourse for up to 20 cycles or until pregnancy. discrete survival analysis was used to estimate the associations between self-reported stress during specific windows of the menstrual cycle and fecundability (cycles at risk until pregnancy), adjusting for potential confounders. results: one hundred thirty-nine women became pregnant. during the follicular phase, there was a 46% reduction in fecundability for a 1 -unit increase in self-reported stress during the estimated ovulatory window (fecundability odds ratio [for] = 0.54; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.35-0.84) and an attenuated trend for the preovulatory window (for = 0.73; 95% ci 0.48-1.10). during the luteal phase, higher stress was associated with increased probability of conception (for = 1.63, 95% ci 1.07-2.50), possibly due to reverse causality. conclusions: higher stress during the ovulatory window may reduce probability of conception; however, once conception occurs, changes in the hormonal milieu and/or knowledge of the pregnancy may result in increased stress. these findings reinforce the need for encouraging stress management techniques in the aspiring and expecting mother.

osteoarthritis	purpose to propose and to assess the reproducibility of a new method (go [glenoid orientation] index) for the estimation of the glenoid orientation in relation to the anterior surface of the glenoid. methods this is a retrospective study on computed tomography (ct) scan. the go index was defined as the angle formed by a line perpendicular to the tangent to the anterior surface of the scapula and the glenoid line (which is defined as the line connecting the anterior and the posterior rim of the glenoid). the measurements were performed at the level of the glenoid where its diameter is the greatest. two independent observers performed each measurement twice. the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated by the pearson coefficient (r) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (rho, icc). the correlation between go index and glenoid version as described by friedman was also studied. results seventy-eight ct scans were analysed, 38 shoulders with glenohumeral arthritis and 40 healthy shoulders, 32 females/46 males, mean age 53.9 +/- 22.7 years. the measures were all highly correlated (r >0.50, p = 0.00001). the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was good to excellent (0.71 < rho < 0.84, p = 0.00001). go index was 26.9 +/- 6.3a degrees, 28.4 +/- 6a degrees in the group with glenohumeral osteoarthritis and 25.5 +/- 6.4a degrees in the healthy group, p = 0.04. the glenoid version was -0.8 +/- 7.9a degrees in the group with glenohumeral osteoarthritis and -3.9 +/- 6a degrees in the healthy group, p = 0.05. no agreement was found between the glenoid version and go index. conclusions go index is simple and reproducible. it could be very useful for the pre-operative planning and intra-operative positioning of the implants in total shoulder arthroplasty.
children's_health	in 2007, the centers for medicaid and medicare services (cms) created a novel payment program to create incentives for physician 's to focus on quality of care measures and report quality performance for the first time. initially termed ""the physician voluntary reporting program,"" various congressional actions, including the tax relief and health care act of 2006 (trhca) and medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 (mippa) further strengthened and ensconced this program, eventually leading to the quality program termed today as the physician quality reporting system (pqrs). as a result of passage of the affordable care act of 2010, the pqrs program has expanded to include both the "" traditional pqrs"" reporting program and the newer "" value modifier"" program (vm). for the first time, these programs were designed to include pay-for-performance incentives for all physicians providing care to medicare beneficiaries and to measure the cost of care. the recent passage of the medicare access and children 's health insurance program (chip) reauthorization act in march of 2015 includes changes to these payment programs that will have an even more profound impact on emergency care providers. we describe the implications of these important federal policy changes for emergency physicians.
osteoarthritis	objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment delivered via real-time telerehabilitation for the management of musculoskeletal conditions, and to determine if real-time telerehabilitation is comparable to conventional methods of delivery within this population. data sources: six databases (medline, embase, cochrane central, pedro, psycinfo, cinahl) were searched from inception to november 2015 for literature which reported on the outcomes of real-time telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions. review methods: two reviewers screened 5913 abstracts where 13 studies (n = 1520) met the eligibility criteria. methodological quality was assessed using the downs & black checklist for measuring quality' tool. results were pooled for meta-analysis based upon primary outcome measures and reported as standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (ci). results: aggregate results suggest that telerehabilitation is effective in the improvement of physical function (smd 1.63, 95%ci 0.92-2.33, i-2=93%), whilst being slightly more favourable (smd 0.44, 95%ci 0.19-0.69, i-2=58%) than the control cohort following intervention. sub-group analyses reveals that telerehabilitation in addition to usual care is more favourable (smd 0.64, 95%ci 0.43-0.85, i-2=10%) than usual care alone, whilst treatment delivered solely via telerehabilitation is equivalent to face-to-face intervention (smd md 0.14, 95% ci -0.10-0.37, i-2 = 0%) for the improvement of physical function. the improvement of pain was also seen to be comparable between cohorts (smd 0.66, 95%ci -0.27-1.60, i-2=96%) following intervention. conclusions: real-time telerehabilitation appears to be effective and comparable to conventional methods of healthcare delivery for the improvement of physical function and pain in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.
rheumatoid_arthritis	statins are hypocholesterolemic drugs that are prescribed for patients with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. ezetimibe has an atheroprotective activity through inhibition of the expression of vascular adhesion molecule-i and vascular cd14, a marker of the infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes. ezetimibe reduces the amount of chemoattractant protein-1 that is available for monocytes and macrophages and alters the activity of nuclear factor kappa b in leukocytes. the mechanisms of action of statins complement those of ezetimibe. previous studies have demonstrated that the combination of statins and ezetimibe has beneficial effects, including antiinflammatory activity. the present study evaluated the effects of monotherapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin compared with ezetimibe + simvastatin combined on the evolution of the inflammatory response in a rat model of complete freund 's adjuvant-induced arthritis. the animals were treated with 10 mg/kg ezetimibe, 40 mg/kg simvastatin, or 10 mg/kg ezetimibe + 40 mg/kg simvastatin for 1, 7, 14, or 28 days. we analyzed leukocyte rolling behavior, leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, the number of leukocytes that were recruited to the knee joint cavity, and the concentration of cytokines that are involved in the inflammatory response. the data were analyzed using paired t tests or analysis of variance followed by bonferroni post hoc test. the treatments reduced leukocyte rolling behavior and leukocyte adhesion. the monotherapies did not change the number of leukocytes that were recruited to the knee joint cavity, whereas the ezetimibe + simvastatin combination significantly reduced this parameter. the treatments reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine il-10, indicating antiinflammatory properties of these drugs in this experimental model of inflammation.
children's_health	objective: to understand the social care networks of children discharged from neonatal intensive care unit. methods: qualitative study conducted in the home of six families of seven children. in data collection, authors used the triangulation of techniques with thematic content analysis. results: family composition is nuclear, social networks are formed by the support of family, leisure and spiritual ties, by school and hospital institutions. the families reported the challenges of caring for a premature baby, and the main care demands were respiratory, motor and cognitive. the non-effective communication between professionals and family showed negative impact on hospitalization and home care. conclusion: social care networks for children discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit proved to be disjointed and health care for children and family proved to be fragmented.
lymphoma	in surgical series, cancer-free survival at 5 years is often referred to as a cure. in recent years, attempts to improve cure rates in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) have focussed on earlier diagnosis through cost-effective screening programs. systemic therapies have historically added only a small benefit to overall survival in both the adjuvant and palliative setting. however, in the last two decades, the development of new treatment options has added incremental improvements in nsclc survival rates. patients with a targetable sensitising mutation including epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements have significantly better prognosis, and many will survive beyond 5 years. immunotherapy is an effective treatment in selected patients with nsclc and is set to cause another leap in 5 year survival rates. although these patients are not free from disease, survival at 5 years may become the more important end-point as nsclc becomes seen as a chronic oncological disease.

children's_health	background: most children in western populations do not meet recommendations for fish consumption. oily fish is an important source of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa), which reduce blood pressure and plasma triacylglycerol in adults and may affect cognitive development and behavior. however, to our knowledge, the potential effects of oily fish on cardiometabolic health, cognitive function, and behavior in children have not been investigated. the aim of the fisk junior study is to investigate the effects of oily fish consumption on cardiovascular risk markers, cognitive function, and behavior in healthy children. methods/design: we are conducting a randomized controlled trial with 8- to 9-year-old danish children, comparing the effect of consuming 300 g/week of oily fish with poultry (control) for 12 weeks between august 2016 and june 2017. the primary outcomes are blood pressure and fasting plasma triacylglycerol, which will be measured at baseline and endpoint. in addition, we will assess erythrocyte fatty acid composition (compliance), heart rate, plasma cholesterol, markers of glucose homeostasis, growth and body composition, dietary intake, and physical activity and sleep. we will also examine effects on cognitive function (attention, memory, and executive functions) by using standardized tests, behavior and emotions by administering parent-rated questionnaires and child interviews, and we will measure physiological stress response and cortisol levels. we need 150 children to complete the trial to detect a between-groups difference of 2.7 mmhg in diastolic blood pressure and 0.13 mmol/l in plasma triacylglycerol; thus, we aim to recruit 200 children. all outcomes will be analyzed in completer analysis supplemented with sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes, and attention will be given to potential sex and genotype specificity. discussion: the results of the fisk junior study are expected to fill important gaps in the current knowledge about the importance of dietary fish and n-3 lcpufa for children 's health and development, and may be used when setting dietary recommendations.
children's_health	objective: to examine general dental and orthodontic utilization and expenditures by health insurance status, public health insurance eligibility, and sociodemographic characteristics among children aged 0 to 17 years using data from 2010-2012. methods: nationally representative data from the medical expenditure panel survey (2010-2012) provided data on insurance status, public health insurance eligibility, and visits to dental providers for both general dental care and orthodontic care. results: overall, 41.9% of us children reported an annual dental office-based visit for general (nonorthodontic) dental care. fewer hispanic (34.7%) and non-latino black children (34.8%) received dental care compared to non-hispanic whites (47.3%) and asians (40.3%). children living in families with the lowest income were also the least likely to have a visit (32.9%) compared to children in the highest income families (54.7%). among children eligible for public coverage, medicaid-eligible children had the lowest percentage of preventive dental visits (29.2%). socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in use and expenditures for orthodontic care are much greater than those for general and preventive dental care. average expenditures for orthodontic care were $1,823, of which 56% ($1,023) was paid out of pocket by families. conclusions: our findings provide a baseline assessment for examining trends in the future, especially as coverage patterns for children may change as the affordable care act is implemented and the future of the state child health insurance program remains uncertain beyond 2017.
osteoarthritis	objective: to identify effective strengthening exercise programs and provide rehabilitation teams and patients with updated, high-quality recommendations concerning traditional land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis. methods: a systematic search and adapted selection criteria included comparative controlled trials with strengthening exercise programs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. a panel of experts reached consensus on the recommendations using a delphi survey. a hierarchical alphabetical grading system (a, b, c+, c, d, d+ or d-) was based on statistical significance (p<0.5) and clinical importance (15% improvement). results: the 26 high-quality studies identified demonstrated that various strengthening exercise programs with/without other types of therapeutic exercises are generally effective for improving knee osteoarthritis management within a six-month period. strengthening exercise programs demonstrated a significant improvement for pain relief (four grade a, ten grade b, two grade c+), physical function (four grade a, eight grade b) and quality of life (three grade b). strengthening in combination with other types of exercises (coordination, balance, functional) showed a significant improvement in pain relief (three grade a, 11 grade b, eight grade c+), physical function (two grade a, four grade b, three grade c+) and quality of life (one grade a, one grade c+). conclusion: there are a variety of choices for strengthening exercise programs with positive recommendations for healthcare professionals and knee osteoarthritis patients. there is a need to develop combined behavioral and muscle-strengthening strategies to improve long-term maintenance of regular strengthening exercise programs.
asthma	asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower airways characterised by intermittent airway narrowing and airflow obstruction. the aim of this study was to examine the association of il-13 arg 130 gln (a/g) and -1112c/t cytokine gene polymorphisms and to know the secretion of il-13 cytokine levels and the interactions between the il-13 130a/g and il-13r alpha 1/il-4r alpha complex cytokine genes. the study population comprised of atopic and non-atopic asthma patients and healthy controls (hc) (n = 120). single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). il-13 cytokine serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), and homology modelling of il-13 a/g cytokine gene was performed through in silico analysis. in il-13 130a/g cytokine gene ag, gg genotypes (p < 0.0042, or = 2.87, ci 1.46-5.65; or = 1.92, ci 1.06-3.48) were found to be significant in atopic asthma patients vs hc. the mean il-13 serum cytokine levels were found to be significantly high in atopic (38.48 +/- 36.54) and non-atopic (36.05 +/- 34.54) asthma patients whereas total serum ige levels were significantly high at p < 0.0001 in atopic and low in non-atopic asthma patients at p < 0.003 compared to hc. in silico analysis indicated that residue il-13 130 with charge modifying variants was crucial in ligand-receptor interactions. il-13 cytokine serum levels were significantly high in atopic and nonatopic asthma patients compared to hc. the gg genotype of il-13 130a/g cytokine gene might be involved in the induced production of total ige and il-13 cytokine serum levels suggesting il-13 may be important in the signalling of asthma.
atrial_fibrillation	research has revealed that passive social network site (sns) use might undermine subjective well-being. however, less is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relationship. the current study tested the mediation effect of envy in the association between passive sns use and low subjective wellbeing, and whether this mediating process was moderated by gender. a sample of 707 chinese university students (mean age = 19.06 years, sd = 1.12) completed anonymous questionnaires regarding passive sns use, envy, and subjective well-being, results revealed that the association between passive sns use and low subjective well-being was mediated by envy. moreover, the mediating effect of envy was moderated by gender, with the effect being stronger for females. these findings contribute to our understanding of how and for whom passive sns use predict low subjective well-being, and suggest the need to take gender into account in prevention and intervention programs for problematic sns use.

osteoarthritis	background: total knee arthroplasty (tka) is the most frequently performed joint replacement surgery in north america. patient perspectives on tka have been investigated in various ways, including finding as many as 20% of tka patients are dissatisfied with their surgical outcomes. understanding the patient experience with tka broadly and in relation to patient satisfaction is a key gap in existing literature. methods: we report on the qualitative component of a mixed methods prospective cohort study examining patient experience and satisfaction post-tka for adults in british columbia, canada. data collection consisted of 45 in-depth interviews about individuals' knee surgery experiences conducted eight months after surgery. analysis consisted of thematic coding by multiple coders. results: participants' descriptions of their tka experiences were primarily concerned with support, or the provision of aid and assistance. support was insufficient when their expectations of support were not met; unmet support expectations led to an overall negative tka experience. support operated in three key domains: (1) informational support, (2) clinical support, and (3) personal support. key sources of informational and clinical support included pre-optimisation clinics, surgeons, and physiotherapists. key topics for informational support included pain, pain management, and recovery trajectories. personal support was provided by family, friends, other tka patients, employers, and themselves. conclusions: patient needs and expectations for support are shaped both before and after tka surgery. patients with an overall positive tka experience had improvement in their knee pain, stiffness or functioning post-tka, had their major expectations and needs for support met during their tka recovery, and believed that any significant future expectations or needs for ongoing support would be adequately met. in contrast, patients with an overall negative tka experience had at least one major expectation or need for support not met during their tka recovery, even in cases where they had good tka outcomes. suggested interventions to improve the experience of persons receiving tka include an expanded patient navigator model, revised pre-surgery educational materials, particularly around pain expectations and management, and comprehensive sharing of other patients' tka experience.
stress_management	organizational stressors are particularly prevalent across sport performers' experiences and can influence their performance, health, and well-being. research has been conducted to identify which organizational stressors are encountered by sport performers, but little is known about how these experiences vary from athlete to athlete. the purpose of this study was to examine if the frequency, intensity, and duration of the organizational stressors that sport performers encounter vary as a function of gender, sport type, and performance level. participants (n=1277) completed the organizational stressor indicator for sport performers (osi-sp; arnold etal., 2013), and the resultant data were analyzed using multivariate analyses of covariance. the findings show that demographic differences are apparent in the dimensions of the goals and development, logistics and operations, team and culture, coaching, and selection organizational stressors that sport performers encounter. more specifically, significant differences were found between males and females, between team and individual-based performers, and between performers competing at national or international, regional or university, and county or club levels. these findings have important implications for theory and research on organizational stress, and for the development of stress management interventions with sport performers.
rheumatoid_arthritis	increased inflammation arising from an abnormal immune response can damage healthy tissue and lead to disease progression. an important example of this is the accumulation of inflammatory mediators in the kidney, which can subsequently lead to hypertension and renal injury. the origin of this inflammation may involve neuro-immune interactions. for example, the novel vagus nerve-to-spleen mechanism known as the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway controls inflammation upon stimulation. however, if this pathway is dysfunctional, inflammation becomes less regulated and chronic inflammatory diseases such as hypertension may develop. systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is an autoimmune disease with aberrant immune function, increased renal inflammation, and prevalent hypertension. we hypothesized that the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is impaired in sle and that stimulation of this pathway would protect from the progression of hypertension in sle mice. female sle (nzbwf1) and control (nzw) mice were administered nicotine or vehicle for 7days (2mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) in order to stimulate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway at the level of the splenic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7-nachr). blood pressure was assessed posttreatment. nicotine-treated sle mice did not develop hypertension and this lower blood pressure (compared to saline-treated sle mice) coincided with lower splenic and renal cortical expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. these data provide evidence that the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is impaired in sle. in addition, these data suggest that stimulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can protect the kidney by dampening inflammation and therefore prevent the progression of hypertension in the setting of sle.
osteoporosis	background: patients with type i diabetes are at increased risk of osteoporosis even after insulin therapy in adult stage. this study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hesperidin (hesp) therapy versus that of insulin alone in the alleviation of osteoporosis arising from type i diabetes mellitus (t1dm) in young rats. materials and methods: hesperidin was administered orally to stz-induced diabetes. the animals were evaluated morphologically and biochemically and compared with that received daily sc injections of long-acting insulin. results: histologically, we observed the degeneration of osteoblasts and osteocytes, decreased collagen fibers, and disturbed bone turn over markers in untreated dm rats. hesperidin+ insulin supplementation to diabetic rats caused significant improvement of most of the bone histological and morphometric parameters compared with the insulin-treated group. furthermore, hesp treatment significantly reduced pro-inflammatory mediators tnf alpha and nf-kappa b and increased serum biochemical markers of bone turnover, including osteopontin (opn), osteocalcin (oc) and decreased serum alkaline phosphatase (alp). conclusion: these data demonstrated that hesp could be considered to be a beneficial drug for preventing diabetic osteoporosis in growing age.

hereditary_angioedema	introduction: upper airway angioedema is a life-threatening emergency department (ed) presentation with increasing incidence. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor induced angioedema (aae) is a non-mast cell mediated etiology of angioedema. accurate diagnosis by clinical examination can optimize patient management and reduce morbidity from inappropriate treatment with epinephrine. the aim of this study is to describe the incidence of angioedema subtypes and the management of aae. we evaluate the appropriateness of treatments and highlight preventable iatrogenic morbidity. methods: we conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive angioedema patients presenting to two tertiary care eds between july 2007 and march 2012. results: of 1,702 medical records screened, 527 were included. the cause of angioedema was identified in 48.8% (n=257) of cases. the most common identifiable etiology was aae (33.1%, n=85), with a 60.0% male predominance. the most common aae management strategies included diphenhydramine (63.5%, n=54), corticosteroids (50.6%, n=43) and ranitidine (31.8%, n=27). epinephrine was administered in 21.2% (n=18) of aae patients, five of whom received repeated doses. four aae patients required admission (4.7%) and one required endotracheal intubation. epinephrine induced morbidity in two patients, causing myocardial ischemia or dysrhythmia shortly after administration. conclusion: aae is the most common identifiable etiology of angioedema and can be accurately diagnosed by physical examination. it is easily confused with anaphylaxis and mismanaged with antihistamines, corticosteroids and epinephrine. there is little physiologic rationale for epinephrine use in aae and much risk. improved clinical differentiation of mast cell and non-mast cell mediated angioedema can optimize patient management.
kidney_health	objective: the western desert kidney health project (wdkhp) is an innovative clinical screening, arts-health and community development program, staffed by aboriginal health workers. the wdkhp is aimed at prevention and early detection, improving the chance of better management of kidney disease among people in 10 predominantly aboriginal communities in rural western australia. this paper aimed to understand community responses to the wdkhp in three of these communities. methods: interviews were undertaken with 26 aboriginal people living in three remote communities. community responses were analysed with attention to the social organisation of participants in each community and a focus on the perspectives of key groups, identified here as 'community leaders', 'homelanders', 'refuge seekers' and 'dislocated'. results: participants from all groups reported that the wdkhp was highly acceptable, and an effective means of drawing attention to the need for prevention, early detection and management of diabetes and kidney disease. the integration of aboriginal health workers to explain the project contributed to the high rates of participation in clinical screening. conclusions: outreach clinical services can be an appropriate method of engaging people in remote communities in addressing diabetes and kidney disease. implications: the remote community setting can act as an 'enabler' of healthy lifestyle for aboriginal people, particularly when augmented by well-designed outreach programs.
bipolar_disorder	glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) is widely recognized as a survival factor for dopaminergic neurons, but gdnf has also been shown to promote development, differentiation, and protection of other central nervous system neurons and was thought to play an important role in various neuropsychiatric disorders. severe mood disorders, such as primarily major depressive disorder and bipolar affective disorder, attract particular attention. these psychopathologies are characterized by structural alterations accompanied by the dysregulation of neuroprotective and neurotrophic signaling mechanisms required for the maturation, growth, and survival of neurons and glia. the main objective of this review is to summarize the recent findings and evaluate the potential role of gdnf in the pathogenesis and treatment of mood disorders. specifically, it describes (1) the implication of gdnf in the mechanism of depression and in the effect of antidepressant drugs and mood stabilizers and (2) the interrelation between gdnf and brain neurotransmitters, playing a key role in the pathogenesis of depression. this review provides converging lines of evidence that (1) brain gdnf contributes to the mechanism underlying depressive disorders and the effect of antidepressants and mood stabilizers and (2) there is a cross-talk between gdnf and neurotransmitters representing a feedback system: gdnfneurotransmitters and neurotransmitters-gdnf.
osteoporosis	background: type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), an epidemic disease around world, has recently been identified as a risk factor for osteoporosis-associated fracture. however, there is no consensus on the best method of assessing fracture risk in patients with t2dm. the aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the osteoporosis self-assessment tool for asians (osta) and the singh index (si) in hip fracture risk assessment in patients with t2dm. methods: we enrolled 261 postmenopausal women with t2dm: 87 had hip fracture resulting from low-energy trauma and 174 age-matched controls had no fracture (two controls per fracture case). bone mineral density (bmd) was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine and hip region. the si was obtained from standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis. the osta was calculated with a formula based on weight and age. data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and tests of difference. receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine optimum cutoff values, sensitivity, and specificity of screening methods. discriminative abilities of different screening tools were compared with the area under the curve (auc). results: there were significant differences in bmd at all sites (lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter, and total hip) and in si between the fracture and non-fracture groups (rho0.05). the area under the curve was 0.747 (95% ci: 0.680-0.813) for lumbar spine bmd, 0.699 (95% ci: 0.633-0.764) for total hip bmd, 0.659 (95% ci: 0.589-0.729) for femoral neck bmd, 0.631 (95% ci: 0.557-0.704) for trochanter bmd, 0.534 (95% ci: 0.459-0.610) for osta, 0.636 (95% ci: 0.564-0.709) for si, and 0.795 (95% ci: 0.734-0.857) for osta plus si. the auc for combined osta plus si was significantly superior to other parameters besides bmd of the lumbar spine. conclusions: the combination of osta plus si could be a clinical alternative tool for screening of hip fracture risk in large diabetic populations. these tests are inexpensive and simple to perform and could be especially useful in areas where bmd measurement is not accessible.
hereditary_angioedema	small interfering (si) rnas and antisense oligonucleotides (asos; here for simplicity reasons, both referred to as oligonucleotides) are small synthetic rna or dna molecules with a sequence complementary to a (pre) mrna. although the basic mechanisms of action between sirnas and aso are distinct, a sequence-specific interaction of the both oligonucleotides with the target (pre) mrna alters the target 's fate, which includes highly effective sequence- specific blockade of translation and consequently depletion of the corresponding protein. for a number of years, these oligonucleotides have been used as a tool in biological research to study gene function in vitro. more recently, safe and specific delivery of these oligonucleotides to the liver of mammals has been achieved and optimized. this not only allowed their use for in vivo gene studies in physiology and disease, but also opened the opportunity for the development of a new generation of rna-specific drugs for therapeutic purposes. in 2013, the first oligonucleotide product targeting rna from the hepatic cholesterol pathway was approved. for blood coagulation, a large portion of key proteins are produced in the liver, and thereby sirnas and asos can also be used as appropriate tools to target these proteins in vivo. in this review, we describe the first use of oligonucleotides for this purpose from zebrafish to primates. as the use of oligonucleotides allows avoidance of early lethality associated with full deficiency of several coagulation factors, it has proved to be of value for studying these proteins in physiology and disease. currently, oligonucleotides are tested as therapeutics, with the ultimate goal to beneficially modulate the hemostatic balance in thrombosis and hemophilia patients. we discuss both the preclinical and clinical studies of a number of sirnas and asos with the potential to be introduced as drugs for prophylactic and/ or treatment of thrombosis or hemophilia. we conclude that for the coagulation field, oligonucleotides are of value for research purposes, and now the moment has come to fulfill their promise as therapeutics.
bipolar_disorder	background: this review focuses on treatment-emergent mania/hypomania (tem) associated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms). methods: english-language studies involving possible rtms-induced mania/hypomania published between 1966 and 2015 were retrieved through a medline search using the search terms mania, hypomania, mixed affective state, treatment-emergent, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and rtms. fifteen case series and controlled studies describing tem associated with rtms treatment have been published involving 24 individuals, most of whomwere diagnosed with either bipolar i or ii disorder or major depressive disorder. results: rtms has been shown to possibly induce manic or hypomanic episodes in patients with depression, who are sometimes also taking antidepressants. both high-frequency and low-frequency rtms with different stimulus parameters may be associated with tem in both males and females. conclusions: given these findings, it is highly recommended that patients with bipolar disorder who are experiencing a depressive episode be prescribed a mood stabilizer and that patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder be reevaluated to consider the possibility that they might have bipolar disorder, before rtms treatment is initiated. if tem occurs, discontinuation of rtms should be considered, while continuing mood-stabilizing medications. further research is needed concerning the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and epidemiologic characteristics of tem associated with rtms.
addiction	background and aimsbarriers linked to drug control systems are considered to contribute to inequitable access to controlled medicines, leaving millions of people in pain and suffering. most studies focus on access to opioids for the treatment of severe (cancer) pain. this study aims to identify specific access barriers for patients with opioid dependence in legislation and regulations of 11 central and eastern european countries. methodsthis study builds on a previous analysis of legislation and regulations as part of the eu 7th framework access to opioid medication in europe (atome) project. an in-depth analysis was undertaken to determine specific barriers for patients with opioid dependence in need of opioid analgesics or opioid agonist therapy (oat). for each country, the number and nature of specific potential barriers for these patients were assessed according to eight categories: prescribing; dispensing; manufacturing; usage; trade and distribution; affordability; penalties; and other. an additional keyword search was conducted to minimize the omission of barriers. barriers in an additional category, language, were recorded qualitatively. countries included bulgaria, cyprus, estonia, greece, hungary, latvia, lithuania, serbia, slovakia, slovenia and turkey. resultsten of the 11 countries (all except estonia) showed specific potential barriers in their legislation and regulations. the total number of barriers varied from two (slovenia) to 46 (lithuania); the number of categories varied from one (slovenia) to five (lithuania). most specific potential barriers were shown in the categories prescribing', usage' and other'. the total number in a single category varied from one to 18 (lithuania, prescribing). individual differences between countries in the same specific potential barrier were shown; for example, variation in minimum age criteria for admission to oat ranging from 15 (lithuania, in special cases) to 20years (greece). all countries had stigmatizing language in their legislation. conclusionspatients with opioid dependence are likely to experience specific barriers to accessing opioids in addition to those experienced by other non-dependent patients.
atopic_dermatitis	background: atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic, relapsing and pruritic inflammatory skin disease whose management remains unclear to most non-dermatologists. this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (kap) of the medical staff regarding ad in yaounde, cameroon. methods: this was a cross-sectional study conducted from january to april 2014 in 20 health facilities located in yaounde, the capital city of cameroon. all medical staff who provided their consent were included in the study. a score was established for each of the kap categories, and subsequently grouped into 4 classes considering a score < 50, 50-< 65, 65-= 85%, respectively. results: we enrolled 100 medical personnel, 62% of whom were females. overall, the level of knowledge on ad was moderate (65%). allergy was the main cause of ad, stated by 64% of participants. only 43% personnel cited the genetic cause. asthma was mentioned by 78% as an associated pathology. regarding attitudes, the majority (84%) thought that ad is equally common among black and caucasian populations; 42% of participants believed that evolution is favorable when appropriate medical treatment is prescribed. these attitudes were considered wrong (64%). similarly, the general level of practice was inadequate: 50%. conclusion: levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices of the medical staff regarding ad were poor, implying that management of this condition is non optimal in our setting.
mental_health	the introduction of modern mental healthcare standards and services in the kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa), has resulted in a gradual shift towards a more positive perspective on mental health issues and related services, and has increased the demand for qualified mental health professionals and psychological interventions (who 2016). despite recent advances in mental healthcare services, psychopharmacology remains the main treatment modality for the majority of mental health issues in ksa. psychotherapy has had a rather slow developmental trajectory in ksa, and its provision requires an understanding of many specific aspects of saudi culture (dubovsky 1983). this paper will shed light on the historical development and current challenges of psychiatric and psychological services and the availability of psychotherapy in ksa. by offering an explication of a selection of local social phenomena, this paper will attempt to explain how unique saudi cultural constructs and social contexts influence the training, perception, and practice of psychotherapy in the country, outlining existing challenges as well as some expected future directions.
healthy_sleep	background: poor sleep is a frequent complaint of persons with hiv infection. objectives: to pilot test a tailored sleep promotion intervention protocol based on principles of sleep hygiene in a convenience sample of 30 hiv seropositive women. methods: at baseline and 1 week after implementing the intervention, sleep was assessed by self-reports measures and wrist actigraphy. objective sleep measures include total sleep time, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency, as well as level of daytime activity, 24-hr activity rhythm, and amount of sleep during the day. results: prior to the intervention, women averaged 6.4 hr (sd = 1.99) of sleep, and 67% (n = 20) of the sample napped more than 30 min per day. after allowing 1 week to implement sleep hygiene principles to promote healthy sleep behaviors, there was a significant improvement in their perception of sleep and a significant change in their 24-hr activity rhythm. this involved more activity and less napping during the day. discussion: although there was minimal change in objective measures of nighttime sleep for the group as a whole, those with initiation insomnia and maintenance insomnia benefited most from the intervention. these findings support the utility of a tailored sleep promotion intervention for women who are hiv positive to address their unique form of sleep disturbance.
anxiety	objective: to investigate the effect of exposure to a virtual reality (vr) environment preoperatively on patient-reported outcomes for surgical operations. background: there is a scarcity of well-developed quality improvement initiatives targeting patient satisfaction. methods: we performed a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing cranial and spinal operations in a tertiary referral center. patients underwent a 1:1 randomization to an immersive preoperative vr experience or standard preoperative experience stratified on type of operation. the primary outcome measures were the evaluation du vecu de l'anesthesie generale (evan-g) score and the amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information (apais) score, as markers of the patient 's experience during the surgical encounter. results: during the study period, a total of 127 patients (mean age 55.3 years, 41.9% females) underwent randomization. the average evan-g score was 84.3 (standard deviation, sd, 6.4) after vr, and 64.3 (sd, 11.7) after standard preoperative experience (difference, 20.0; 95% confidence interval, ci, 16.6-23.3). exposure to an immersive vr experience also led to higher apais score (difference, 29.9; 95% ci, 24.5-35.2). in addition, vr led to lower preoperative vas stress score (difference, -41.7; 95% ci, -33.1 to -50.2), and higher preoperative vas preparedness (difference, 32.4; 95% ci, 24.9-39.8), and vas satisfaction (difference, 33.2; 95% ci, 25.4-41.0) scores. no association was identified with vas stress score (difference, -1.6; 95% ci, -13.4 to 10.2). conclusions: in a randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that patients exposed to preoperative vr had increased satisfaction during the surgical encounter. harnessing the power of this technology, hospitals can create an immersive environment that minimizes stress, and enhances the perioperative experience.
medicare	purpose: to compare trends in utilization rates of imaging in the three hospital-based settings where imaging is conducted. methods: the nationwide medicare part b databases for 2004-2014 were used. all discretionary noninvasive diagnostic imaging (ndi) cpt codes were selected and grouped by modality. procedure volumes of each code were available from the databases and converted to utilization rates per 1,000 medicare enrollees. medicare 's place-of-service codes were used to identify imaging examinations done in hospital inpatients, hospital outpatient departments (hopds), and emergency departments (eds). trends were observed over the life of the study. results: trendlines were strongly affected by code bundling in echocardiography in 2009, nuclear imaging in 2010, and ct in 2011. however, even aside from these artifactual effects, important trends could be discerned. inpatient imaging utilization rates of all modalities are trending downward. in hopds, the utilization rate of conventional radiographic examinations (cres) is declining but rates of ct, mri, echocardiography, and noncardiac ultrasound (us) are increasing. in eds, utilization rates of cres, ct, and us are increasing. in the 3 years after 2011, when no further code bundling occurred, the total inpatient ndi utilization rate dropped 15%, whereas the rate in eds increased 12% and that in hopds increased 1%. conclusions: the trends in utilization of ndi in the three hospital-based settings where imaging occurs are distinctly different. radiologists and others who are involved in deciding what kinds of equipment to purchase and where to locate it should be cognizant of these trends in making their decisions.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease with severe pulmonary fibrosis. the main cause of ipf-associated death is acute exacerbation of ipf (ae-ipf). this study aims to develop a rat model of ae-ipf by two intratracheal perfusions with bleomycin (blm). methods: ninety male sprague dawley (sd) rats were randomized into three groups: an ae-ipf model group (blm + blm group), an ipf model group (blm group), and a normal control group. rats in the blm + blm group underwent a second perfusion with blm on day 28 after the first perfusion with blm. rats in the other two groups received saline as the second perfusion. six rats in each group were sacrificed on day 31, day 35, and day 42 after the first perfusion, respectively. additional 18 rats in each group were observed for survival. results: rats in the blm + blm group had significantly worse pulmonary alveolar inflammation and fibrosis than rats in the blm group. rats in the blm + blm group also developed large amounts of hyaline membrane, showed high levels of albumin (alb) and various inflammatory factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), and had markedly increased lung water content. furthermore, rat survival was reduced in the blm + blm group. the pathophysiological characteristics of rats in the blm + blm group resemble those of patients with ae-ipf. conclusions: a second perfusion with blm appears to induce acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis and may be used to model ae-ipf in rats.
digestive_health	echinacea pallida (epal), a herbaceous flowering plant with immunomodulatory properties, has been chosen to determine the pre- and post-supplementary effects on the growth performances, bacterial community, blood parameters and immunity of growing rabbits. the same grimaud does (14-week-old) from the studied in the first part of this study were randomly divided into two groups (n=50/group). the first group was fed a basal diet without supplementation (control group, c) while the another group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 3 g epal/kg diet (echinacea group, e). from the second parturition, 80 weaned kits (40 from the c does and 40 from the e does) were randomly assigned to four groups of 20 animals each and were fed a growing commercial diet supplemented with or without a 3 g epal/kg diet: the cc group (rabbits from the c does fed the control diet), ce group (rabbits from the c does fed the supplemented diet), ec (rabbits from the e does fed the control diet) and ee group (rabbits from the e does fed the supplemented diet). the dietary epal treatment did not affect the growth performance. ten fattening rabbits from each group were selected to evaluate the bacterial community and blood parameters, while the remaining rabbits (n=10/group) were used to study phagocytosis and the humoral immune response. the variability was evaluated from hard faeces at 35, 49 and 89 days, and the caecal content at 89 days. the variability of the bacterial community of the ee group was higher than that of the other groups. the phagocytic activity was higher in the ce and ee groups than in the cc and ec ones (30.9 and 29.7 v. 21.2 and 21.8%; p<0.05), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed for the blood parameters or humoral immune response against vaccination (rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus) at 95 days old which the serum was collected at 88, 102, 109, 116 and 123 days old. in conclusion, no impact of epal dietary supplementation has been observed on the growth performances, bacterial community, blood parameters or humoral immune responses in growing rabbits, except for an increase in phagocytic activities.
stress_management	changes in the levels of three structurally and functionally different important thermoprotectant molecules, namely small heat shock proteins (shsps), trehalose, and lipids, have been investigated upon heat shock in schizosaccharomyces pombe. both alpha-crystallin-type shsps (hsp15.8 and hsp16) were induced after prolonged high-temperature treatment but with different kinetic profiles. the shsp null mutants display a weak, but significant, heat sensitivity indicating their importance in the thermal stress management. the heat induction of shsps is different in wild type and in highly heat-sensitive trehalose-deficient (tps1 delta) cells; however, trehalose level did not show significant alteration in shsp mutants. the altered timing of trehalose accumulation and induction of shsps suggest that the disaccharide might provide protection at the early stage of the heat stress while elevated amount of shsps are required at the later phase. the cellular lipid compositions of two different temperature-adapted wild-type s. pombe cells are also altered according to the rule of homeoviscous adaptation, indicating their crucial role in adapting to the environmental temperature changes. both hsp15.8 and hsp16 are able to bind to different lipids isolated from s. pombe, whose interaction might provide a powerful protection against heat-induced damages of the membranes. our data suggest that all the three investigated thermoprotectant macromolecules play a pivotal role during the thermal stress management in the fission yeast.
lymphoma	introduction: in their previous work, the authors reported findings from 30 years on the incidence of hematological malignancies in szabolcs-szatmar-bereg county, hungary. until now there are no other studies on this topic available in hungary. aim: detailed analysis of epidemiologic features of patients with philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders was carried out. method: during a 33-year period (between january 1, 1983 and december 31, 2015) 4523 adult patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded in the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of szabolcs-szatmar-bereg county. among them, 255 patients with polycytaemia vera, 102 with primary myelofibrosis, and 331 with essential thrombocytaemia were registered. results: the incidence of polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia in szabolcs-szatmar-bereg county showed an increasing tendency, with an overall incidence rate of 1.35 and 1.75/100 000 inhabitants/year, respectively; while the incidence of primary myelofibrosis decreased in the course of years (0.54/100 000 inhabitants/year). in cases of polycythaemia vera and primary myelofibrosis the male: female ratio was found to be equal, however essential thrombocythaemia showed a female dominance. the mean age of patients with polycythaemia vera was 65 (21-95) years, similar to essential thrombocythaemia with 65 (19-85) years, and to primary myelofibrosis with 65.5 (33-84) years. there were only two villages found in this county where the occurrence of patients with philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders per one thousand inhabitants was significantly higher, than the average (1.22). in every familial cases of these, the manifestation of the disease in the second and the third generations became earlier than in the first genetration. the perceived average degree of the anteposition (anticipation) was found to be 22 years. conclusion: the epidemiologic features of philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders in szabolcs-szatmar-bereg county are essentially similar to data published in the literature.
bipolar_disorder	background: cognitive deficits are well-documented in patients with bipolar disorder (bpd) and may impact the efficacy of psychotherapy. cognitive control, a form of executive functioning, is often used therapeutically to shift patients' thoughts and behaviors from automatic, maladaptive responses to adaptive coping strategies. this study examined cognitive control processing in patients with bpd using the multi-source interference task (msit). method: twenty-nine patients diagnosed with bpd and 21 healthy control (hc) subjects completed the msit with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). results: patients with bpd generally performed worse on the msit relative to hc participants; the bpd group had significantly lower performance accuracy and made more omission errors. further, fmri analyses revealed differential patterns of activation between the groups during the msit. region of interest (roi) analyses revealed that relative to hc participants, patients with bpd activated significantly fewer voxels within the cingulate cortex (cc) and more voxels within prefrontal cortex (pfc), although the pfc findings did not survive more stringent significance thresholds. limitations: patients and hcs were not matched for age, sex, and premorbid verbal iq, however, these variables were controlled for statistically. medication usage in the bpd group may have possibly impacted the results. given a priori hypotheses, roi analyses were utilized. conclusions: decreased cc activation and increased pfc activation may be associated with impaired cognitive control, demonstrated by bpd patients when completing the msit. identifying the neural mechanisms which underlie key cognitive abnormalities in bpd may aid in clarifying the pathophysiology of this disorder and inform selection of potential targets for cognition remediation in bpd.
mental_health	compelling evidence of gender differences in authoritarianism, self-esteem, and mental disorders can be found in the psychology literature. however, researchers have not yet identified their etiologies. the traumatology perspective proposes that gender discrimination (gd) contributes to such differences. gd promotes internalized male superiority and enhanced self-esteem that increase authoritarianism and impact men 's behavior. gd promotes internalized gender inferiority in women and decreased self-esteem, predicting internalizing disorders. in 2 samples (sample 1, n = 319 women; sample 2, n = 204 men), using path analysis, we tested this perspective. in the men 's sample, externalizing accounted for about.75 of the variance. gd predicted internalized male superiority, increased externalizing, addiction, psychoticism, authoritarianism, and selfesteem, and decreased internalizing. in the women 's sample, gd predicted increased internalized female inferiority, internalizing, and lowered self-esteem. internalizing accounted for .415 of the variance. the results identified some etiologies and dynamics that contribute to gender differences. we then discussed the implications of these findings for advocating for gender equality.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective: as many inflammatory rheumatic diseases affect patients in childbearing age, some concern has been expressed about the safety of biologic drugs during pregnancy. this study evaluated the effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) agents on pregnancy/foetal outcomes. methods: thirty-eight pregnancies were followed prospectively from november 2008 to february 2015. information about the patients' exposure to anti-tnf alpha, disease activity, dmard therapy, pregnancy/foetal outcomes were registered. results: twenty-four/38 (71.1%) pregnancies were exposed to anti-tnf alpha at conception/i trimester, 11/38 (28.9%) prior to conception and 3 (11.1%) following paternal exposure. there were two congenital malformations: one infant (4.2%) was diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and obstructive megaureter; the mother was exposed to adalimumab at conception/i trimester. while one foetus (9.1%) showed a trisomy 16, the mother 38 year-old had suspended etanercept 4 weeks before conception. there was no significant difference in pregnancy/foetal outcome between the two groups. nor were there any significant differences in pregnancy/foetal outcomes in the various groups being treated with different anti-tnf alpha antagonists. no congenital malformations were found in connection to paternal exposure. conclusion: study results suggest that anti-tnf alpha drugs could be safe when administered during conception/i trimester and following paternal exposure.

bipolar_disorder	pde10a is a camp/cgmp phosphodiesterase important in signal transduction within medium spiny neurons of the human striatum. this gene region has been associated with bipolar disorder via case-control and linkage studies. the three most studied human pde10a isoforms differ in both their n-termini and trafficking within the cell with pde10a2 found predominantly at the plasma membrane and pde10a1 and pde10a19 remaining primarily within the cytosol. rna-sequencing and 5' rlm-race studies of the human putamen and caudate nucleus revealed 16 new exons and 12 novel transcripts of pde10a, 3 of which are predicted to produce proteins with unique n-termini. the novel first exons of these transcripts are highly conserved in non-human primate species and are rarely found in other mammals. one hundred and eight previously classified intronic snps were found within the novel pde10a exons of which 78% were classified as rare variants. since most of the rare variants localize to 5' utr regions, they may influence pde10a transcription, translation, or mrna stability. dysregulation of camp signaling has been proposed as a cause of bipolar disorder and pde10a inhibitors have been investigated as potential therapeutics for schizophrenia. understanding the mechanisms contributing to pde10a expression in the human striatum may provide evidence linking this gene to the phenotypes observed in neuropsychiatric disorders.

autism	we utilized a sociocultural lens and a qualitative approach to examine causal attributions and caregiving approaches of parents of children with an intellectual disability in a mid-sized indian city. sixteen mothers and three fathers participated in a semi-structured interview. findings elucidate participants' active processing of the cause of their child 's intellectual disability. they seemed to simultaneously draw upon religious, biological and situational factors to construct an explanation. as far as caregiving approaches, most parents reported moving away gradually from mainstream medicine to alternative medicine and physiotherapy and from regular education settings to special schools. the themes highlight the role of sociocultural factors and also cross-cultural similarities in parental causal attributions and caregiving approach. the findings are discussed in the context of implications for social work practice and policy in india.
psoriatic_arthritis	introduction: psoriatic arthritis (psa) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a wide clinical spectrum. the early diagnosis of psa is currently a challenging topic.areas covered: the literature was extensively reviewed for studies addressing the topic area diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. this review will summarize improvements in diagnostic tools, especially referral to the rheumatologist, the role of patient history and clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging techniques in getting an early and correct diagnosis of psa.expert commentary: due to the heterogeneity of its expression, psa may be easily either overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. a diagnosis of psa should be taken into account every time a patient with psoriasis or a family history of psoriasis shows peripheral arthritis, especially if oligoarticular or involving the distal interphalangeal joints, enthesitis or dactylitis. magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography are useful for diagnosing psa early, particularly when isolated enthesitis or inflammatory spinal pain occur.
atopic_dermatitis	atopic dermatitis (ad), the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, is driven by both terminal keratinocyte differentiation defects and strong type 2 immune responses. in contrast to chronic plaque-type psoriasis, ad is now understood to be a much more heterogeneous disease, with additional activation of th22, th17/il-23, and th1 cytokine pathways depending on the subtype of the disease. in this review we discuss our current understanding of the ad immune map in both patients with early-onset and those with chronic disease. clinical studies with broad and targeted therapeutics have helped to elucidate the contribution of various immune axes to the disease phenotype. importantly, immune activation extends well beyond lesional ad because nonlesional skin and the blood component harbor ad-specific inflammatory changes. for this reason, future therapeutics will need to focus on a systemic treatment approach, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe disease.
ankylosing_spondylitis	introduction. ankylosing spondylitis (as)/morbus bechterew is a chronic inflammatory rheumatoid disease. the temporomandibular joint (tmj) dysfunction is involved in 4-35% of as cases, and is correlated to the severity and extension of as. even though as-caused tmj ankylosis is exceptional, one should have high index of suspicion of tmj ankylosis in as for an early detection, because it is an extremely serious and disabling condition that causes problems with mastication, swallowing, digestion, speech, appearance and poor oral hygiene with heavy caries. case report. a 54-year-old male patient sought medical attention at the department of periodontology and oral medicine, clinic for dentistry at the military medical academy, belgrade, serbia, with the chief complaint of pain in the area of the upper left canine in the presence of limited mouth opening. the treatment plan consisted of upper left canine management and rehabilitation of the remaining teeth in the frontal and the premolar region in both, the upper and lower jaw. even though molar region needed to be treated, unfortunately it was not in the treatment plan because ankylosis of tmj made the treatment impossible. conclusion. the patients with as-caused tmj ankylosis are considered a diagnostic challenge to routine dentistry. accent should be given to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of the as patients towards the favorable disease course and outcome.
hereditary_angioedema	background: a physician survey conducted in the united states between october 2009 and february 2010 revealed wide variability in hereditary angioedema (hae) management. objective: a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the impact of newly available treatment options and investigate changes in hae care patterns. methods: between march and june 2013, 6570 physicians were contacted, of whom, 245 hae-treating physicians responded. participants completed a 46-question online survey thatwas closely patterned after the initial survey. although most data were analyzed descriptively, selected questions underwent statistical analysis to evaluate differences in treatment patterns between the 2 surveys. results: compared with the prior survey, this follow-up survey found that the proportion of physicians who reported danazol as the preferred long-term prophylaxis agent declined from 56% to 23% (p < .00005); conversely, c1-esterase inhibitor increased in this category (20% to 57%; p < .00005). the percentage of attacks self-treated at home increased from 8% to 27% (p < .00005). decreases were observed in emergency department visits (61% to 54%; p = not significant) and hospitalizations (13% to 3%; p = .0001) for hae attacks. the percentage of patients perceived by physicians to be very satisfied with hae treatment increased from 13% to 40% (p < .00005). in 2013, convenience was reported more frequently as an important patient factor that drove long-term prophylaxis choice (27% vs 10%; p < .00005), whereas adverse effects were cited less frequently (16% vs 42%; p < .00005); in both surveys, cost and/or insurance coverage was the greatest driver in this category (43% and 46%). conclusion: analysis of these findings suggests that the change in hae treatment has increased self-treatment at home, decreased emergency department visits and/or hospitalizations, and provided greater patient satisfaction.

osteoporosis	osteoporotic fracture increases the risk of premature mortality. muscle weakness is associated with both increased fracture risk and low bone mineral density (bmd). however, the role of muscle strength in post-fracture mortality is not well understood. this study examines the change of muscle strength measured at quadriceps (qs) before and after fracture and defines the relationship between muscle strength and post-fracture mortality. the study involved 889 women and 295 men (who were participating in the dubbo osteoporosis study) who had at least one low-trauma fracture (ascertained from x-ray reports) after the age of 50 years. median follow-up time was 11 years (range 1 to 24). to determine the change in muscle strength before and after a fracture, we selected a subset of 344 women and 99 men who had had at least two muscle strength measurements before the fracture event and a subset of 407 women and 105 men who had had at least two measurements after the fracture. during the follow-up period, 366 (41.2%) women and 150 (50.9%) men died. the annual rate of decrease in height-adjusted muscle strength before fracture was 0.27kg/m (1.85%) in women and 0.40kg/m (1.79%) in men. strength loss after fracture was not significantly different from that before fracture. in women, after adjusting for baseline age and bmd, each sd (5kg/m) lower height-adjusted pre- and post-fracture quadriceps strength was associated with a 27% (hazard ratio [hr]=1.27; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.07, 1.50) and 18% (hr=1.18; 95% ci 1.01, 1.38) increase in post-fracture mortality risk, respectively. similarly, in men, each sd (5kg/m) lower height-adjusted pre- and post-fracture qs was associated with increased mortality before fracture (hr=1.33; 95% ci 1.09, 1.63) and after fracture (hr=1.43; 95% ci 1.16, 1.78). muscle weakness accounted for 15% (95% ci 0.05, 0.24) of premature deaths after fracture in women and 23% (95% ci 0.11, 0.35) in men. these results indicate that in the older individuals, lower muscle strength is an independent risk factor for post-fracture mortality.

ankylosing_spondylitis	reduced bone density and secondary osteoporosis, resulting in increased risk of fracture, is a significant complicating factor in the inflammatory arthritides. while the exact etiology of systemic bone loss is not fully elucidated, recent insights into the tumor necrosis factor super family (tnfsf) revealed a potential role for death receptor 3 (dr3/tnfrsf25) and one of its ligands, tnf-like protein 1a (tl1a/tnfsf15). the mechanisms by which dr3/tl1a signalling modulates bone loss are unclear. we investigated the effect of dr3/111a signalling upon osteoclast-dependent chemokine and mmp production to unravel novel mechanisms whereby this pathway regulates oc formation and oc-dependent bone resorption. collagen induced arthritis (cia) was established in dr3(wt) and dr3(ko) mice, joints were sectioned and analysed histologically for bone damage while systemic trabecular bone loss distal to the affected joints was compared by micro-ct. ablation of dr3 protected dba/1 mice against the development and progression of cia. in dr3(ko), joints of the ankle and mid-foot were almost free of bone erosions and long bones of mice with cia were protected against systemic trabecular bone loss. in vitro, expression of dr3 was confirmed on primary human cd14(+) osteoclast precursors by flow cytometry. these cells were treated with tl1a in osteoclast differentiation medium and trap(+) osteoclasts, bone resorption, levels of osteoclast-associated chemokines (ccl3, ccl2 and cxcl8) and mmp-9 measured. tl1a intensified human osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption and increased osteoclast-associated production of ccl3 and mmp-9. our data reveals the dr3 pathway as an attractive therapeutic target to combat adverse bone pathology associated with inflammatory arthritis. we demonstrate that dr3 is critical in the pathogenesis of murine cia and associated secondary osteoporosis. furthermore, we identify a novel mechanism by which the dr3/111a pathway directly enhances human oc formation and resorptive activity, controlling expression and activation of ccl3 and mmp-9.

mental_health	losing a spouse is among the most devastating events that may occur in people 's lives. we use longitudinal data from 1,224 participants in the german socio-economic panel study (soep) to examine (a) how life satisfaction changes with the experience of spousal loss; (b) whether socio-demographic factors and social and health resources moderate spousal loss-related changes in life satisfaction; and (c) whether extent of anticipation, reaction and adaptation to spousal loss are associated with mortality. results reveal that life satisfaction shows anticipatory declines about two and a half years prior to (anticipation), steep declines in the months surrounding (reaction) and lower levels after spousal loss (adaptation). older age was associated with steeper anticipatory declines, but less steep reactive declines. additionally, younger age, better health, social participation and poorer partner health were associated with better adaptation. higher pre-loss life satisfaction, less steep reactive declines and better adaptation were associated with longevity. the discussion focuses on the utility of examining the interrelatedness among anticipation, reaction and adaptation to further our understanding of change in life satisfaction in the context of major life events.
kidney_health	it is well known that the kidney plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. the normal aging process leads to changes in kidney morphology, hemodynamics and function, which increase the incidence of cardiovascular events in the elderly population. these disturbances are influenced by several factors, including gender. in general, females are protected by the effects of estrogens on the cardiorenal system. several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of estrogens on renal function in the elderly; however, the relationships between androgens and kidney health during one 's lifetime are not well understood. sex steroids have many complex actions, and the decline in their levels during aging clearly influences kidney function, decreases the renal reserve and facilitates the development of cardiovascular disorders. therefore, in this review, we discuss the cellular, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms by which sex hormones may influence renal function during the aging process.
osteoarthritis	bacterial septic arthritis rarely occurs in the upper extremities. yet, early diagnosis and treatment is important, as a delay in diagnosis results in pain, impaired hand function, and degenerative joint disease. radioscapholunate (rsl) arthrodesis is a well-established procedure for treating inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis (primary or posttraumatic), primarily to achieve pain relief. the wrist deformity correction offers an alternative option to total wrist arthrodesis. indications for a rsl arthrodesis are osteoarthritis of the radiolunate and radioscaphoid joint with a concomitant intact midcarpal joint. we present a case study of spontaneous rsl fusion post wrist infection caused by a dog bite.
rheumatoid_arthritis	management of the airway may be challenging in patients undergoing occipito-cervical spine fusions (ocf). changes in the occipito-cervical angle (doc2a) of fusion after surgery may result in acute airway obstruction, dyspnea and/or dysphagia. objectives of the study were to review the airway management of patients during posterior ocf, determine the incidence, nature and risk factors for postoperative airway adverse events (aes), and to determine the relationship between airway aes and the change in doc2a. in this retrospective cohort of 59 patients, following extubation in the operating room (or), there were no complications in 43 (73%) patients (group 1). sixteen (27%) patients (group 2) had airway complications; 4 requiring reintubation and 12 having delayed extubation. the number of vertebral levels fused (>6), presence of difficult intubation and duration of surgery (>5 h) were significantly associated with aes. there was no significant difference in the doc2a between the groups (-1.070 +/- 5.527 versus -4.375 +/- 10.788, p = 0.127). airway management in patients undergoing ocf poses a challenge for the anesthesiology and surgical teams. the incidence of aes was 27%. the decision to extubate immediately after surgery needs to be individualized. factors such as difficult intubation, number of vertebral levels fused and duration of surgery have to be considered. a significant correlation between doc2a and postoperative aes could not be established. risk factors for postoperative aes are multifactorial and prospective evaluation of these factors is indicated.

smoking_cessation	background: the existing literature suggests the presence of a possible relationship between high anger levels and smoking behavior; however, there are no available data highlighting possible differences between moderate and heavy smokers and the putative effect of gender on smoking behavior. objectives: the aims of the current study were to assess the relationship among anger, depression, and anxiety and smoking patterns taking into account the possible mediator role of gender. methods: 150 smokers and 50 nonsmokers volunteers were recruited from the staff of the university of messina, italy. the final sample consisted of 90 smokers, divided in 50 heavy smokers (hs: more than 40 cigarettes per day), 40 moderate smokers (ms: 10-30 cigarettes per day), and 42 nonsmokers (ns). all subjects were assessed by state-trait anger expression inventory-2, self-rating depression scale, and self-rating anxiety scale. results: on anger, depression, and anxiety measures the hs group scored higher than ms and ns groups. hs showed higher than expected levels of trait-anger, a greater tendency to control anger reactions and to access to anger-management techniques. a moderate consumption of cigarettes (10-30 cigarettes per day) was not associated with negative emotions, as ms only showed higher than expected levels of state-anger. cigarettes consumption was related to gender-specific anger features. conclusions/importance: our study highlighted the importance of anger in smoking behavior and its related gender differences. recognizing the link among anger, gender differences and smoking behavior could improve the knowledge for future-focused interventions on smoking cessation.
lymphoma	in this paper we design a sure independent ranking and screening procedure for censored regression (csirs, for short) with ultrahigh dimensional covariates. the inverse probability weighted csirs procedure is model-free in the sense that it does not specify a parametric or semiparametric regression function between the response variable and the covariates. thus, it is robust to model mis-specification. this model-free property is very appealing in ultrahigh dimensional data analysis, particularly when there is lack of information for the underlying regression structure. the csirs procedure is also robust in the presence of outliers or extreme values as it merely uses the rank of the censored response variable. we establish both the sure screening and the ranking consistency properties for the csirs procedure when the number of covariates p satisfies , where a is a positive constant and n is the available sample size. the advantages of csirs over existing competitors are demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and an application to the diffuse large-b-cell lymphoma data set.
osteoporosis	werner syndrome (i.e., adult progeria) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the wrn gene, which is characterized by the premature appearance of features associated with normal aging and cancer predisposition. patients with werner syndrome can present with musculoskeletal complaints, associated with suggestive radiographic features with a potential prognostic or therapeutic impact. this review illustrates the main radiographic features of werner syndrome, focusing on the musculoskeletal system, such as soft-tissue calcification, muscular atrophy, osteoporosis, foot deformities, osteitis and osteomyelitis, and bone or soft-tissues malignancies. the identification of these features by radiologists can therefore be useful in the clinical screening of werner syndrome.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	microrna signatures of bal cells and alveolar macrophages are currently lacking in ipf. here we sought to investigate the expression of fibrosis-related micrornas in the cellular component of the bal in ipf. we thus focused on micrornas previously associated with fibrosis (mir-29a, mir-29b, mir-29c, let-7d, and mir-21) and rapid ipf progression (mir-185, mir-210, mir-302c-3p mir-376c and mir-4235p). among the tested micrornas mir-29a and mir-185 were found significantly downregulated in ipf while mir-302c-3p and mir-376c were not expressed by bal cells. importantly, the downregulation of mir-29a inversely correlated with the significantly increased levels of col1a1 mrna in ipf bal cells. collagen 1 a was found mainly overexpressed in alveolar macrophages and not other cell types of the bal by immunofluorescence. in view of the downregulation of mir-185, we tested the response of thp-1 macrophages to profibrotic cytokine tgfb and observed the downregulation of mir-185. conversely, proinflammatory stimulation lead to mir-185 upregulation. upon examination of the mrna levels of known mir-185 targets akt1, dnmt1 and hmga2, no significant correlations were observed in the bal cells. however, increased levels of total akt and akt(ser473) phosphorylation were observed in the ipf bal cells. furthermore, mir-185 inhibition in thp-1 macrophages resulted in significant increase of aktser473 phosphorylation. our study highlights the importance of bal microrna signatures in ipf and identifies significant differences in mir-185/akt and mir-29a/collagen axes in the bal cells of ipf patients.
medicare	background: the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) canceled meaningful use (mu), replacing it with advancing care information, which preserves many mu elements. therefore, transitioning from mu stage 1 to mu stage 2 has important implications for the new policy, yet the quality of care provided by physicians transitioning from mu1 to mu2 is unknown. methods: retrospective longitudinal evaluation of the quality of care delivered by outpatient physicians at an academic medical center in the transition between mu1 and mu2. results: between mu1 and mu2, 4 measures improved: hypertension control (35% vs 40%), influenza immunization (63% vs 68%), tobacco use assessment/counseling (86% vs 96%), and diabetes control (93% vs 96%; p all <.01). one worsened: senior weight screening/follow-up (54% vs 49%; p<.01). two were unchanged: chlamydia screening and adult weight screening/follow-up. conclusion: in this single-site study, when clinicians progressed from mu1 to mu2, 4 quality measures improved, 2 were unchanged, and 1 worsened. analysis of national data should guide policy decisions about the content of mu 's successor.
hereditary_angioedema	backgroundhereditary angioedema with normal c1-inh may be linked to specific mutations in the coagulation factor 12 (fxii) gene (hae-fxii) or mutations in genes that are still unknown (hae-unknown). to assess the differences in transmission and inheritance, clinical features, and laboratory parameters between patients with hae-fxii and hae-unknown. methodssixty-nine patients with hae-fxii from 23 unrelated families and 196 patients with hae-unknown from 65 unrelated families were studied. resultsboth hae-fxii and hae-unknown are inherited as autosomal-dominant traits with incomplete penetrance. the male to female ratio was 1:68 in hae-fxii and 1:6.3 in hae-unknown. the maternal to paternal transmission ratio was 35:14 for hae-fxii and 109:12 for hae-unknown. mean age at onset of clinical symptoms was 20.3years in patients with hae-fxii and 29.6years in patients with hae-unknown. the incidence of asphyxiation due to angioedema was similar for hae-fxii and hae-unknown. oral contraceptives and pregnancies had a significantly higher impact on hae-fxii than on hae-unknown. slightly decreased c1-inh activity and c4 concentration were observed in more patients with hae-fxii than hae-unknown. tests for fxi and fxii activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and activated partial thromboplastin time showed variability but no significant differences between the groups. no abnormalities were found for c1-inh protein, c1q, alpha2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. in families with hae-fxii, the number of female offspring with f12 mutations was significantly increased and that of male offspring was significantly decreased. conclusionshae-fxii and hae-unknown differ in various respects, including gender distribution, genetics, symptoms, and estrogen impact.
psoriatic_arthritis	the enthesitis-related arthritis (era) category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) is the most common category in india. hla b27 has a high prevalence in era, and ilar classification includes it in exclusion criteria for other categories, but due to its cost, it is not routinely done. we undertook this study to assess the prevalence of hla b27 in era and other groups of juvenile arthritis in india. consecutive patients of jia era and select patients from other categories were recruited from a single tertiary care hospital over a span of 3 years. hla b27 was tested using pcr. five hundred and eleven children were studied: 312 had era, and 199 had other categories (29 oligoarthritis, 107 polyarthritis, 44 systemic onset jia, 9 psoriatic arthritis and 10 undifferentiated). the prevalence of hla b27 was highest in the era group (87 %) and correlated with the presence of sacroiliitis. prevalence was 10.3 % in oligoarthritis, 16 % in polyarticular rheumatoid factor (rf)-positive arthritis, 26 % in rf-negative polyarticular arthritis, 66 % in psoriatic arthritis and 40 % in the unclassified and 0 % in systemic onset category. twenty-seven children had a change in category of jia as per ilar owing to hla b27 testing positive, most commonly in the rf-negative polyarthritis group. only six of these had clinical features suggestive of spondyloarthropathy. there is high prevalence of hla b27 in era. though hla b27 testing helps in correct classification, a minority of these patients have features suggestive of spondyloarthropathy like back pain, enthesitis or sacroiliitis.
autism	the purpose of the study was to evaluate a procedure to generate derived categorical responding by three children with disabilities and to promote the emergence of untrained intraverbal categorical responses. in the study, three 4-member equivalence classes including three stimuli (a, b, and c) and a category name (d) for each class were trained using a match-to-sample procedure. test probes were conducted for categorical responding, including both a trained (d-a) and two derived (d-b, d-c) relational responses, as well as the emergence of untrained intraverbal categorical responding (d-a/b/c) throughout the study. relational training was effective at promoting the emergence of categorical responding, and two of the three participants demonstrated the emergence of additional intraverbal responding without prior training. the results provide further evidence supporting the practical utility of stimulus equivalence as well as the peak-e curriculum.
atopic_dermatitis	schisandra chinensis (sc) and its main constituent, schizandrin (sch) exhibit antiinflammatory and anti-allergic activities. allergic and inflammatory reactions are aggravated via caspase-1 signaling pathway. however, the regulatory effects of sc and sch on caspase-1 activation have not been clarified yet. in this study, we aimed to clarify the anti-allergic effects of sc and sch using an ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized mice and anti-cd3 and anticd28 antibodies-stimulated splenocytes. sc or sch significantly inhibited the levels of immunoglobulin (ig) e, igg1, or interleukin (il)-4 in serum of ova-sensitized mice. sc or sch significantly inhibited the levels of il-6, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and il-1 beta in spleen of the ova-sensitized mice. sc or sch significantly suppressed the expression of caspase-1 and receptor-interacting protein (rip)-2 in spleen of the ova-sensitized mice. in activated splenocytes, sc or sch significantly decreased the expression of caspase-1 and rip-2 as well as the production of il-6 and tnf-alpha. we suggest that sc and sch exert an anti-allergic effect by down-regulating caspase-1 signaling.
smoking_cessation	nicotine dependence is defined by dopaminergic neuronal activation within the nucleus accumbens (acb) and by affected neural projections from nicotine-stimulated neurons. control of any subsequent neural activities would underpin any smoking cessation strategy. while extensive efforts have been made to study the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction, more limited works were developed to find imaging biomarkers. if such biomarkers are made available, addictive behaviors could be monitored noninvasively. to such ends, we employed manganese (mn2+)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (memri) to determine whether it could be used to monitor neuronal activities after acute and chronic nicotine exposure in rats. the following were observed. mn2+ infusion identified acb and hippocampal (hip) neuronal activities following acute nicotine administration. chronic exposure was achieved by week long subcutaneously implanted nicotine mini-pump. here nicotine was shown to activate neurons in the acb, hip, and the prefrontal and insular cortex. these are all central nervous system reward regions linked to drug addiction. in conclusion, memri is demonstrated to be a powerful imaging tool to study brain subregion specific neuronal activities affected by nicotine. thus, we posit that memri could be used to assess smoking-associated tolerance, withdrawal and as such serve as a pre-clinical screening tool for addiction cessation strategies in humans.
osteoporosis	osteoporosis and periodontal disease are linked by an altered receptor activator of nuclear factor b-k ligand and osteoprotegerin ratio (rankl/opg), and medical treatment with bisphosphonate (bp) may help control these molecules. the effect of bp on clinical findings and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) values of rankl and opg using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was evaluated in postmenopausal women; 13 patients with both chronic periodontitis and osteoporosis (group a), 12 systemically healthy patients with chronic periodontitis (group b), 12 periodontally healthy patients with osteoporosis (group c), and 10 systemically and periodontally healthy individuals (group d). recordings were repeated at the end of months 1, 6, and 12 in groups a, b, and c. at the baseline, groups a and b exhibited the lowest opg values (p0.008). the use of bp may be effective in preventing periodontal breakdown by controlling the levels of these markers in osteoporosis as an adjunct to periodontal treatment.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. nsaids are first-line therapy in axial spa (axspa). the proportion of patients responding to nsaids and differences between as and non-radiographic axspa (nr-axspa) in this regard have not been studied in detail to date. the aim of this study was to examine the proportion of patients with as and nr-axspa responding to nsaids according to current treatment recommendations. methods. consecutive anti-tnf-naive patients with nr-axspa and as (n = 50 each) were included if their basdai score was 54 without having received maximal nsaid doses. in case of a basdai score 54 1 week later, another nsaid was prescribed. for the next 3 weeks, continuous intake of maximal doses was recommended but patients could reduce doses in case of intolerance or improvement. mri of the si joints was performed at baseline and week 4. results. all outcomes except for crp and mri scores improved significantly after 4 weeks of nsaids, with no difference between axspa subgroups. an assessment of spondyloarthritis international society 40% (asas40) response and partial remission rates were 35 and 16% at week 4, respectively. at the same time point, a basdai score >= 4 was still present in 44% of patients, 30% of which had reduced nsaid doses, partly due to intolerance (38%). only 13% of all patients had continuously taken nsaids at the maximal dosage, but there was no difference in the efficacy outcome compared with those who had taken reduced doses. conclusion. as and nr-axspa patients had similar response rates to nsaids while objective signs of inflammation did not change over 4 weeks. only a minority of patients was willing to take maximal doses of nsaids, and >= 40% patients remained candidates for tnf blockers. these results may influence future trial designs.
anxiety	stimulant drugs produce reward but also activate stress-responsive systems. the corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) and the related hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis stress-responsive systems are activated by stimulant drugs. however, their role in stimulant drug-induced reward remains poorly understood. herein, we report that crf1 receptor-deficient (crf1-/-), but not wild-type, mice show conditioned place preference (cpp) responses to a relatively low cocaine dose (5 mg/kg, i.p.). conversely, wild-type, but not crf1-/-, mice display cpp responses to a relatively high cocaine dose (20 mg/kg, i.p.), indicating that crf1 receptor-deficiency alters the rewarding effects of cocaine. acute pharmacological antagonism of the crf1 receptor by antalarmin also eliminates cocaine reward. nevertheless, crf1-/-mice display higher stereotypy responses to cocaine than wild-type mice. despite the very low plasma corticosterone concentration, crf1-/-mice show higher nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (gr) levels in the brain region of the hippocampus than wild-type mice. full rescue of wild-type-like corticosterone and gr circadian rhythm and level in crf1-/-mice by exogenous corticosterone does not affect crf1 receptor dependent cocaine reward but induces stereotypy responses to cocaine. these results indicate a critical role for the crf1 receptor in cocaine reward, independently of the closely related hpa axis activity.

dementia	objectives: the negative effect of changes in social behavior following traumatic brain injury (tbi) are known, but much less is known about the neuropsychological impairments that may underlie and predict these changes. the current study investigated possible associations between post-injury behavior and neuropsychological competencies of emotion recognition, understanding intentions, and response selection, that have been proposed as important for social functioning. methods: forty participants with tbi and 32 matched healthy participants completed a battery of tests assessing the three functions of interest. in addition, self- and proxy reports of pre- and post-injury behavior, mood, and community integration were collected. results: the tbi group performed significantly poorer than the comparison group on all tasks of emotion recognition, understanding intention, and on one task of response selection. ratings of current behavior suggested significant changes in the tbi group relative to before the injury and showed significantly poorer community integration and interpersonal behavior than the comparison group. of the three functions considered, emotion recognition was associated with both post-injury behavior and community integration and this association could not be fully explained by injury severity, time since injury, or education. conclusions: the current study confirmed earlier findings of associations between emotion recognition and post-tbi behavior, providing partial evidence for models proposing emotion recognition as one of the pre- requisites for adequate social functioning.
rheumatoid_arthritis	dipeptidyl peptidase i (dppi) is a lysosomal cysteine protease and derived from immune granule cells. it has been suggested playing an important role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. in this study, a coumarin based fluorescent probe (gf-afc) was designed and synthesized to evaluate dppi activity in serum or tissue homogenates of collagen-induced arthritis (cia) rats, an inflammatory arthropathy model. it was revealed that the fluorescent intensity was significantly increased in a very short time after specific substrate gf-afc reacted with the dppi. the fluorophore (afc) was released to shine after the cleavage reaction which was examined by f-19 nmr spectroscopy. it has been shown that dppi hydrolyzed the gf-afc in a robust, linear, and time dependent manner at a significant high rate. a serum-based dppi activity assay was validated by spiking and gradient dilution methods, there were no interferences or auto-fluorescence observed. the coefficient of variance calculated for serum-based dppi activity assays indicates the good reproducibility. the good correlation has been seen between serum dppi levels and the severity of arthritis during ra development in cia rats. our study has demonstrated a new serum based diagnostic assay for detecting dppi activity using coumarin conjugated fluorescent (gf-afc) as a substrate. the successful implementation of the case would provide beneficial experience in rheumatoid arthritis research.(c) 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
osteoporosis	bone turnover markers assist in fracture risk prediction, management and monitoring of osteoporosis in patients without chronic kidney disease (ckd). the use in ckd-mineral bone disorder (mbd) has been limited as many of these markers and breakdown products are renally excreted, including the most commonly used and well standardized procollagen type i n propeptide and c-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type i collagen. of the markers unaffected by renal function, bone specific alkaline phosphatase is associated with mortality and fracture rate in ckd subjects and is now available on several automated analysers. when used in combination with pth, bone specific alkaline phosphatase as a bone formation marker correlated well with bone biopsy histomorphometry in predicting adynamic bone disease. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b is a resorption marker that is under development for automation. both high and low bone turnover in ckd-mbd patients are associated with increased fracture and mortality risk. bone biopsy as the gold standard to differentiate between adynamic bone disease and osteitis fibrosa is limited by availability and cost. appropriate use of bone turnover markers is vital in the decision to commence anti-resorptive agents, and to monitor efficacy in order to avoid over suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to stress fractures. further efforts are required to develop markers unaffected by renal function with standardized cut-off values and fracture as well as vascular calcification end-points.
atrial_fibrillation	aims: surveillance of geographical variations in cardiovascular health is important in order to achieve the objectives of reducing regional health disparities. we aimed to explore differences in cardiovascular disease (cvd) mortality and prevalence of cvd diagnoses made in primary and in-patient care, as well as risk factor distribution by geographic regions (urban/rural) in iceland. methods: from nationwide health registers, we obtained data on cvd mortalities (n = 7113), primary healthcare cvd contacts (n = 58,246) and hospital cvd discharges (n = 14,039), as well as data on cvd risk factors from a national health survey (n = 5909; response rate 60.3%). age-standardised annual mortality, primary healthcare contact and hospital discharge rates due to cvd were calculated per 100,000 population inside (urban) and outside (rural) the capital area (ca). logistic regression was used to explore regional differences in cvd risk factors. results: we observed slightly higher total cvd mortality rates among women outside compared to inside the ca (standardised rate ratio (srr) 1.06 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.05-1.07)), particularly due to atrial fibrillation (srr 1.47 (95% ci 1.46-1.48)), heart failure (srr 1.29 (95% ci 1.27-1.31)) and ischemic heart disease (srr 1.11 (95% ci 1.10-1.12)), while reduced mortality risk for cerebrovascular disease (srr 0.81 (95% ci 0.80-0.83)). the rates of hospital discharges and primary care contacts for these diseases, as well as prevalence of several modifiable risk factors, were generally higher outside the ca, particularly among women. conclusions: the higher prevalence of modifiable risk factors and cvd in rural areas, especially among women, calls for refined treatment and health-promoting efforts in rural areas.
atrial_fibrillation	the objective of this study was to investigate whether the potentially inappropriate medication (pim) use is a predictor for mortality in a community-based population of older adults. a cohort study was performed between january 1, 1997, and december 31, 2011, based on data from a representative sample of the population aged 60 years or older living in bambui, brazil. univariate and multivariate analyses of the association between the variable of interest (use of pim or pharmacological groups of pim) and mortality were based on the extended cox model for proportional hazards. the extended model was adopted to include the measurement of the exposure of interest throughout the follow-up period and not only at baseline. adjustment variables included sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and use of health care services and medications. a level of significance of 5% was adopted for all analyses. the prevalence of pim use was 56.0% (95%ci 53.4-58.6). after multiple adjustments, the risk of death among users of at least one pim was 44% higher (hr = 1.44; 95%ci 1.21 to 1.71) than among those who did not use any pim. among the pim groups analyzed, antipsychotics were the most strongly associated with mortality (hr = 2.33; 95%ci 1.72 to 3.17). the study revealed a high prevalence of pim use among the community-based aged population. it also identified pim use as a predictor for mortality in this group of individuals. this indicates the need for selection of safer drug therapy alternatives in this patient group.
osteoporosis	a summary the appropriate time to initiate bisphosphonate treatment after a fragility fracture has not yet been established. in this study, we found no significant differences in short-term functional recovery between femoral neck fracture patients who received bisphosphonate treatment at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. introduction bisphosphonate is the mainstay therapy for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate initiation on short-term functional recovery in femoral neck fracture patients at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. methods one hundred patients were randomly allocated into two groups in a parallel group designed, randomized, controlled trial. both groups received risedronate 35 mg/week at either 2 or 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. all patients received calcium and vitamin d supplementation. functional recovery was assessed by de morton mobility index, barthel index, euroqol 5d, visual analog scale, 2-min walk test, and timed get-up-and-go test at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. results at the 3-month follow-up, all functional outcome measures showed significant improvement in both groups. there were no statistically significant differences in any of the functional outcomes between groups at both the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. although patients who received bisphosphonate initiation at week 2 had lower serum calcium level at 3 months and more overall adverse events than patients in the week 12 group, no patients in either group discontinued their prescribed medications. conclusions while underpowered, the findings of this study suggest that there were no significant differences in short-term functional recovery or significant adverse events between the two bisphosphonate groups. thus, the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy may be considered as early as 2 weeks after femoral neck fracture. it is important that low serum calcium and vitamin d status must be corrected with calcium and vitamin d supplementation prior to or at the time of bisphosphonate initiation. clinical trial registration number this study was registered in the database via the protocol registration and results system (prs) (nct02148848).
asthma	background and objectives: asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder requiring intermittent or continuous anti-inflammatory therapy. patients often turn to alternative treatments as complements or replacements to conventional treatments. we aimed to evaluate the effect of salt room chambers (halotherapy) on bronchial hyper-responsiveness (bhr), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (feno), and quality of life in children with asthma. patients and methods: children aged 5-13 years with a clinical diagnosis of mild asthma not receiving anti-inflammatory therapy. patients were randomized in this double-blind, controlled study to salt room with halogenerator (treatment group), or without halogenerator (control group). we evaluated the effect of salt room therapy on bhr, feno, spirometry, and pediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (paqlq). the treatment period lasted 7 weeks, 14 sessions. results: twenty-nine patients were randomized to the salt room with halogenerator (treatment group), and 26 patients to the salt room without salt halogenerator (control group). a statistically significant improvement in bhr was demonstrated in the treatment group, which remained unchanged in the control group. there was no improvement in spirometry or feno levels following treatment. the treatment group showed a statistical improvement in most parameters of quality of life questionnaires. conclusions: our pilot study suggests that salt room with halogenerator, may have some beneficial effects in mild asthmatic children. randomized and larger controlled trials with long-term follow-up are necessary.

addiction	background: the multi-site prescription opioid addiction treatment study (poats), conducted by the national drug abuse treatment clinical trials network, was the largest clinical trial yet conducted with patients dependent upon prescription opioids (n = 653). in addition to main trial results, the study yielded numerous secondary analyses, and included a 3.5-year follow-up study, the first of its kind with this population. this paper reviews key findings from poats and its follow-up study. methods: the paper summarizes the poats design, main outcomes, predictors of outcome, subgroup analyses, the predictive power of early treatment response, and the long-term follow-up study. results: poats examined combinations of buprenorphine-naloxone of varying duration and counseling of varying intensity. the primary outcome analysis showed no overall benefit to adding drug counseling to buprenorphine-naloxone and weekly medical management. only 7% of patients achieved a successful outcome (abstinence or near-abstinence from opioids) during a 4-week taper and 8-week follow-up; by comparison, 49% of patients achieved success while subsequently stabilized on buprenorphine-naloxone. long-term follow-up results were more encouraging, with higher abstinence rates than in the main trial. patients receiving opioid agonist treatment at the time of follow-up were more likely to have better outcomes, though a sizeable number. of patients succeeded without agonist treatment. some patients initiated risky use patterns, including heroin use and drug injection. a limitation of the long-term follow-up study was the low follow-up rate. conclusions: poats was the first large-scale study of the treatment of prescription opioid dependence; its findings can influence both treatment guidelines and future studies.

asthma	purpose: content validity is the extent to which a patient-reported outcome measure evaluates the concepts most relevant to a patient 's condition and treatment. the st george 's respiratory questionnaire (sgrq) has been validated in a range of respiratory conditions. this study evaluated the content validity of the sgrq in patients with severe asthma. methods: a qualitative study, guided by a protocol, which included concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing of the sgrq, was conducted in patients aged >= 18 years with history of severe asthma and blood eosinophil counts of >= 150/mu l (past month) or >= 300/mu l (past 12 months). patients were recruited until saturation for concept elicitation was achieved (i.e. no additional concepts identified). concepts identified by the patients were then mapped to the sgrq. results: 18 patient interviews provided concept saturation. concept elicitation confirmed that the sgrq includes the commonly reported asthma symptoms and their impact on daily life. in total, 89-100% of patients routinely experienced cough, nighttime awakenings, shortness of breath, chest tightness, sleep difficulty, phlegm/mucus, and wheezing. patients reported asthma impacting daily and physical activities, mood and sleep. cognitive interviewing confirmed that patients understood the instructions, items and response options in the sgrq. nearly half of the concepts in the sgrq were endorsed by >= 12 patients; of the 17 items with scoring weights >= 85, 11 were mentioned by >= 12 patients. conclusions: this study demonstrates that the sgrq is a relevant, comprehensive and content-valid instrument to assess health status in patients with severe asthma.

rheumatoid_arthritis	background: sequence variation in gene promoters is often associated with disease risk. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that common promoter variation in the apom gene is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) risk and sle-related clinical phenotypes in a chinese cohort. meanwhile, we investigated the expression of apolipoprotein m (apom) in the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and its relationship with disease activity. methods: we used a case-control design and genotyped 52 sle patients and 52 healthy controls for 19 apom promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) (rs113947529, rs1143030, rs114826514, rs116715239, rs12525463, rs1266078, rs2273612, rs28432254, rs34490746, rs4947251, rs55880811, rs707921, rs74890500, rs75629491, rs76611345, rs76794541, rs805264, rs805297, rs9267528). genotyping was done by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). the blood serum concentration of apom was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sle patients and controls. results: the average concentration of apom in serum was significantly lower in sle patients compared to controls and apom levels in sle patients with positive anti-dsdna antibodies were dramatically lower than that of patients with negative anti-dsdna antibodies (p = 0.011). it was interesting that apom levels correlated with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (sledai) scores (r = -0.396, p = 0.004). no association between apom and sle susceptibility was detected in our han chinese cohort. conclusions: our results demonstrated that lower apom levels in sle patients and correlated with disease activity.
dementia	we examined selective autophagy against ubiquitinated protein aggregates in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-ibm) patients. the form of autophagy requires phosphorylation of serine 403 in p62/sqstm1 to bind to lys63-linked ubiquitin and the binding of the p62-ubiquitinated protein conjugates to lc3. in muscle biopsy specimens from 16 s-ibm patients, we compared the distribution of p62 (aa120-440) with 1) ser403-phosphorylated p62 (s403-pp62), 2) lys63-linked ubiquitin and 3) lc3 in double-colour immunofluorescence microscopy. s403-pp62, lys63-linked ubiquitin and lc3 colocalised with p62 aggregates, 79.05% +/- 13.64% (mean +/- sd), 66.54% +/- 19.91% and 51.84% +/- 14.1%, respectively. although positive deposits of s403-pp62 arid lys63-linked ubiquitin were always observed within p62 aggregates, lc3 often showed dissociated distribution from p62. we also found fibres containing small, numerous p62-positive dots that were negative for all three markers and were also observed in myositis controls. the results indicate that p62, lys63-linked ubiquitin and lc3 in s-ibm join to perform selective autophagy. p62 could be induced by some cellular stresses in all types of myositis; however, in s-ibm, compromised binding of the p62ubiquitinated protein complex to lc3 could stop the autophagy process in its initial stages, which causes the formation of aggregates of p62-oligomers with lys63-ubiquitinated proteins.

stress_management	background: oncology nursing is often a source of substantial stress for nurses. many nurses, particularly novice nurses, have inadequate preparation to care for patients at the end of life and their families. unless nurses prevent or manage work-related stress by using effective coping strategies, oncology nursing staff will continue to suffer from burnout and compassion fatigue. objectives: the purpose of this article is to identify stress levels and stressful factors of nurses working in oncology outpatient units and to explore coping behaviors for work-related stress of oncology staff nurses in outpatient units. methods: a descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to identify stress levels and stressful factors for outpatient oncology nurses, investigate differences in stress levels among nurses' demographic characteristics, and explore coping behaviors of the nurses. study participants (n = 40) included rns and licensed practical nurses who completed the nursing stress scale, three open-ended questions, and a demographic questionnaire. findings: the highest sources of stress were workload and patient death and dying. demographic variables of age and work experience in nursing showed a significant positive relationship to work-related stress scores. the three most frequently used coping behaviors were verbalizing, exercising or relaxing, and taking time for self. continuing education programs on stress management are highly recommended. outpatient oncology nurses should be nurtured and supported through tailored interventions at multiple levels to help them find effective coping strategies and develop self-care competencies. although younger and less experienced nurses had lower mean stress scores than older and more experienced nurses, the continuing education programs and tailored interventions would be helpful for all oncology nursing staff.
stress_management	dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis is associated with diverse adverse health outcomes, making it an important therapeutic target. measurement of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion provides a window into this system. at present, no guidelines exist for the optimal use of this biomarker within randomised controlled trials (rcts). the aim of this study is to describe the ways in which salivary diurnal cortisol has been measured within rcts of health or behavioural interventions in adults. six electronic databases (up to may 21, 2015) were systematically searched for rcts which used salivary diurnal cortisol as an outcome measure to evaluate health or behavioural interventions in adults. a narrative synthesis was undertaken of the findings in relation to salivary cortisol methodology and outcomes. from 78 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 30 included healthy participants (38.5 %), 27 included patients with physical disease (34.6 %) and 21 included patients with psychiatric disease (26.9 %). psychological therapies were most commonly evaluated (n = 33, 42.3 %). there was substantial heterogeneity across studies in relation to saliva collection protocols and reported cortisol parameters. only 39 studies (50 %) calculated a rhythm parameter such as the diurnal slope or the cortisol awakening response (car). patterns of change in cortisol parameters were inconsistent both within and across studies and there was low agreement with clinical findings. salivary diurnal cortisol is measured inconsistently across rcts, which is limiting the interpretation of findings within and across studies. this indicates a need for more validation work, along with consensus guidelines.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have been confirmed to play an important role in the development and progression of diseases. ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease and it is hard to be found in early time. the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of lncrna-ak001085 in the diagnosis of as. material/methods: the expression of lncrna-ak001085 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrtpcr) analysis. the relationship between its expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was also analyzed. meanwhile the correlation between lncrna-ak001085 expression and diseases activity indexes was estimated. in addition, the value of it in the diagnosis of as was explored through establishing receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve. results: serum lncrna-ak001085 expression was decreased in patients with as compared with healthy individuals. and its expression was proved to be influenced by ever cigarette smoker, exercise level and occupational activity level. besides, the correlation of the expression of lncrna-ak001085 and disease activity indexes (basdi, asdas, esr, crp) were all negative, which suggested that the lncrna-ak001085 was significantly lower in patients with a high disease activity score. it might showed that the expression of lncrna-ak001085 affected the activity of as. conclusions: lncrna-ak001085 was down-regulated in as patients and it could be an independent diagnostic indicator.
hereditary_angioedema	acquired angioedema (aae) due to c1-inhibitor (c1inh) deficiency is rare. treatment options for acute attacks are variable and used off-label. successful treatment of the associated lymphoma with rituximab seems to prevent acute attacks in subjects with aae. the aim of this study was to describe aae manifestations, its associated diseases, and patients' responses to treatments in a representative cohort. a retrospective nationwide study was conducted in france. the inclusion criteria were recurrent angioedema attacks and an acquired decrease in functional c1inh <50% of the reference value. a total of 92 cases were included, with a median age at onset of 62 years. facial edema and abdominal pain were the most frequent symptoms. fifteen patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit because of laryngeal edema, and 1 patient died. anti-c1inh antibodies were present in 43 patients. the associated diseases were primarily non-hodgkin lymphoma (n=44, with 24 splenic marginal zone lymphomas) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n=24). three patients had myeloma, 1 had amyloid light-chain (of immunoglobulin) (al) amyloidosis, 1 patient had a bronchial adenocarcinoma, and 19 patients had no associated disease. icatibant relieved the symptoms in all treated patients (n=26), and plasma-derived c1inh concentrate in 19 of 21 treated patients. six patients experienced thromboembolic events under tranexamic acid prophylaxis. rituximab prevented angioedema in 27 of 34 patients as a monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy. splenectomy controlled aae in 7 patients treated for splenic marginal zone lymphoma. after a median follow-up of 4.2 years, angioedema was on remission in 52 patients. aae cases are primarily associated with indolent lymphoma-especially splenic marginal zone lymphoma-and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance but not with autoimmune diseases or other conditions. icatibant and plasma-derived c1inh concentrate control attacks; splenectomy and immunochemotherapy prevent angioedema in lymphoma setting.
atrial_fibrillation	background: acute limb ischemia (ali) is a clinical entity with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. despite advances and variety of its management, there is still no criterion standard treatment. the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of tirofiban use on the early and 6-month prognosis of patients with knee and below-knee arterial thrombosis who were treated with percutaneous thrombosuction (pt) within 24 h. material/methods: data of consecutive ali patients who were diagnosed with popliteal and infra-popliteal arterial thrombosis and underwent pt procedure within 24 h between january 2010 and september 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. patients were separated into 2 groups according to tirofiban usage. results: a total of 105 patients (mean age 67 +/- 16; 53% men) were included in the study. atrial fibrillation (n 64, 61%) and hypertension (n 60, 57%) were the most frequent comorbidities in patients with thromboembolic events. a significantly higher rate of distal embolization (6% vs. 16%; p=0.01) and slow-flow (17% vs. 30%; p<0.01) developed in patients who were not treated with tirofiban after the pt procedure. although major and minor bleeding were more frequent in the tirofiban group, only the rate minor bleeding was statistically significant (29% vs. 9%, p=0.001). reverse embolic event ratio was similar in both groups. although there was a higher rate of amputation in patients not treated with tirofiban, the difference was not significant. conclusions: adding tirofiban to pt reduces angiographic thromboembolic complications. usage of tirofiban in patients prone to thromboembolic events may be useful for improving success of the pt procedure, with a reasonable bleeding ratio.
dementia	although a few papers documented benefits of group therapeutic activities for individuals with dementia, there is a dearth of studies that have investigated the effects of group activities on persons with dementia. this paper introduces a theoretical framework of studying group therapeutic recreational activity, the comprehensive process model of group engagement, and an assessment tool, the group observational measurement of engagement (gome). we also report the psychometric properties of this assessment. one hundred and four persons with dementia took part in ten different group activities, with each activity conducted twice at random order so that 20 activities were observed for each group of participants. following each group activity, research and therapeutic recreation staff members used the gome assessment to independently rate participants on individual-level measures of attendance duration and engagement, and group level measures (e.g., positive and negative interactions among group members). reliability and validity analyses comparing observer ratings for each group activity on the individual-level measures of attendance and engagement showed good psychometric properties. different measures collected on a group level differed with respect to their psychometric quality. we present a theoretical framework to understand group engagement and present measures that could be used in future research and practice.
bipolar_disorder	aims. few studies have compared time trends for the incidence of psychosis. to date, the results have been inconsistent, showing a decline, an increase or no significant change. as far as we know, no studies explored changes in prevalence of early risk factors. the aim of this study was to investigate differences in early risk factors and cumulative incidences of psychosis by type of psychosis in two comparable birth cohorts. methods. the northern finland birth cohorts (nfbcs) 1966 (n = 12 058) and 1986 (n = 9432) are prospective general population-based cohorts with the children followed since mother 's mid-pregnancy. the data for psychoses, i.e. schizophrenia (narrow, spectrum), bipolar disorder with psychotic features, major depressive episode with psychotic features, brief psychosis and other psychoses (icd 8-10) were collected from nationwide registers including both inpatients and outpatients. the data on early risk factors including sex and place of birth of the offspring, parental age and psychosis, maternal education at birth were prospectively collected from the population registers. the follow-up reached until the age of 27 years. results. an increase in the cumulative incidence of all psychoses was seen (1.01% in nfbc 1966 v. 1.90% in nfbc 1986; p < 0.001), which was due to an increase in diagnosed affective and other psychoses. earlier onset of cases and relatively more psychoses in women were observed in the nfbc 1986. changes in prevalence of potential early risk factors were identified, but only parental psychosis was a significant predictor in both cohorts (hazard ratios 3.0; 95% ci 1.86-4.88). the difference in psychosis incidence was not dependent on changes in prevalence of studied early risk factors. conclusions. surprisingly, increase in the cumulative incidence of psychosis and also changes in the types of psychoses were found between two birth cohorts 20 years apart. the observed differences could be due to real changes in incidence or they can be attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, or to early psychosis detection and treatment.
bipolar_disorder	background: bipolar disorder (bd) is a major psychiatric disorder characterized by alternating mood episodes, including major depressive, hypomanic, and manic episodes. previous genetic studies of bd have reported several genes as potentially associated with bd. the ank3 gene has been identified as a possible bd susceptibility gene in genome-wide association analyses.aims: the goal of the present study was to evaluate the association of ank3 variants with bd in the korean population.methods: based on previous results, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), rs1938526 and rs10994336, were selected in the ank3 gene. the study included 287 bd patients and 340 healthy controls. case-control association and case-control haplotype analyses of the two ank3 variants were performed.results: no significant association was found of either single snp with bd by case-control association analysis. however, rs1938526 and rs10994336 showed a significant association (overall p=3.6x10(-11); permutation p=0) in a case-control haplotype analysis.conclusions: the haplotype analysis results suggest that ank3 variants rs1938526 and rs10994336 may confer susceptibility for bd in the korean population. association analysis revealed a probable genetic difference between korean and caucasian populations in the degree of ank3 involvement in bd pathogenesis.
asthma	objective: to investigate the prevalence of self-reported edentulism and its associated risk factors among community-dwelling adults aged 45years and older in china. materials and methods: data from the national baseline survey (2011-2012) of the china health and retirement longitudinal study (charls) were used for this study (n=17167). bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to assess the predictors of edentulism. models 1 and 2 were based on the whole sample. models 3 and 4 were based on the subsample (n=9933) from whom anthropometric and blood biomarker data were available. results: the prevalence of edentulism was 8.64% among chinese adults aged 45 and above. as shown by model 1, older age was a robust predictor for edentulism (odds ratio [or]=3.81 for people aged 55-64; or=11.22 for people aged 65-74; or=24.05 for people aged 75 and above). other factors positively associated with edentulism included being female (or=1.25), rural residence (or=1.30), asthma (or=1.48), depression (or=1.20), reduced physical function (or=1.37) and current smoking status (or=1.36). people with higher educational levels (or=0.75 for people who can read and write; or=0.64 for people who obtained a junior high school education or above) and better-off economic status (or=0.80) were less likely to be edentate. the association between edentulism and age, educational level, economic status and physical function remained significant in model 3, and in addition, being underweight appeared as another strong predictor (or=1.93). conclusions: the estimated prevalence of edentulism and the identified associated factors will provide epidemiologic evidence for future research and interventions in the target population in china.
mental_health	mental illness is a prevalent and extraordinarily complex phenomenon. psychologists have developed distinct approaches toward understanding and treatingmental illness, rooted in divergent epistemology. this introduction to the special issue on clinical psychological science and practice provides a brief overview of the scientist-practitioner gap, and explores one step (of many) toward bridging this divide. seven compelling case illustrations featured in this special issue apply empirical findings to case formulation, treatment selection, and assessment across complex and varied clinical presentations. this issue thereby demonstrates the feasibility of integrating research and clinical expertise in mental healthcare.

asthma	adult bronchial asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, and presents clinically with variable airway narrowing (wheezes and dyspnea) and cough. long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling, leading to intractable asthma. the number of patients with asthma has increased; however, the number of patients who die of asthma has decreased (1.2 per 100,000 patients in 2015). the goal of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to attain normal pulmonary function and lead a normal life, without any symptoms. a good relationship between physicians and patients is indispensable for appropriate treatment. long-term management by therapeutic agents and elimination of the causes and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. four steps in pharmacotherapy differentiate between mild and intensive treatments; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, varying from low to high levels. long-acting beta(2)-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist are recommended as add-on drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin e antibody and oral steroids are considered for the most severe and persistent asthma related to allergic reactions. bronchial thermoplasty has recently been developed for severe, persistent asthma, but its long-term efficacy is not known. inhaled beta(2)-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and other approaches are used as needed during acute exacerbations, by choosing treatment steps for asthma in accordance with the severity of exacerbations. allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspirin-induced asthma, and pregnancy are also important issues that need to be considered in asthma therapy. copyright (c) 2016, japanese society of allergology. production and hosting by elsevier b.v.
rheumatoid_arthritis	disgust and disease-related cues can activate the immune system. here, we test whether immuno-suppression is associated with an up-regulation of cognitions and behaviors that assist in disease avoidance. people with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), who have a heightened risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality, were compared to age, gender and demographically matched healthy controls on a range of disease avoidance tasks. people with ra scored higher on reports of behavior likely to control infection, were more accurate in spotting individuals who were sick, and showed disease-specific ethnocentrism, ascribing a greater risk of contracting disease to non-caucasians, although having no overall propensity for greater racism on the modern racism scale. contrary to predictions, disgust sensitivity (ds) did not differ between groups, however among people with ra, ds was found to be lower in those taking drugs that can increase infection risk. while more explicit disease avoidance behaviors are clearly up-regulated in people with ra, changes in ds may have a different and perhaps more biological casual basis.

asthma	the immune system possesses a vast number of potential targets for therapeutic intervention. although therapies for many pathways have been pursued, only few have yielded significant success. hindrances in altering biologic pathways include the potential for unwanted downstream effects, ineffectiveness owing to biological redundancy, recognition of a therapeutic molecule as foreign by the body 's innate immune system, and the risks of subsequent malignancy and/or autoimmunity. this article covers currently available biotherapeutic agent classes as well as potential direction for future therapy.
mental_health	aims and objectives. to describe nursing activities in primary care with patients affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders. background. patients in primary care who are affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression require care and follow-up based on their physical and mental health condition. primary care nurses are increasingly expected to contribute to the care and follow-up of this growing clientele. however, little is known about the actual activities carried out by primary care nurses in providing this service in the province of quebec (canada). methods. a qualitative descriptive study was conducted. data were obtained through semistructured individual interviews with 13 nurses practising among patients with physical chronic disease in seven family medicine groups in quebec (canada). results. participants described five activity domains: assessment of physical and mental health condition, care planning, interprofessional collaboration, therapeutic relationship and health promotion. conclusion. the full potential of primary care nurses is not always exploited, and some activities could be improved. evidence for including nurses in collaborative care for patients affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders has been shown but is not fully implemented in family medicine groups. future research should emphasise collaboration among mental health professionals, primary care nurses and family physicians in the care of patients with physical chronic disease and common mental disorders. relevance to clinical practice. primary care nurses would benefit from gaining more knowledge about common mental disorders and from identifying the resources they need to contribute to managing them in an interdisciplinary team.
healthy_sleep	longitudinal studies in japan indicate that nocturnal sleep onset has become later and sleep duration has been progressively shortened. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep patterns and sleep problems among children, and to determine the association between parents and their children 's sleep habits. questionnaires about sleep problems and life habits were administered to families living in tokyo metropolitan areas of japan. we analyzed the data of pre-school-age (1-5 years old; n = 319, including 175 girls) and elementary school-age children (6-11 years; n = 217, including 116 girls) as well as their parents (402 mothers: 37.0 +/- 4.9 years, 402 fathers: 39.0 +/- 5.9 years). subjects were categorized as morning (evening) type when they answered their lifestyle habit as ""definitely or moderately morning (evening) type"". sleep was categorized into regular, irregular, and intermediate from the sleeping-waking regularity scores. the frequency of daytime dozing is significantly high in children with evening-irregular sleep. moreover, mothers of children (aged 1-5 and 6-11 years) with evening-irregular sleep have significantly more irregular sleep habits than those of children with morning-regular sleep. likewise, fathers of children (aged 1-5 years) with evening-irregular sleep have significantly more irregular sleep habits. thus, irregular late bedtime of parents is associated with sleep problems, daytime sleepiness, and irregular dietary habits of children. mothers' sleep habits have a stronger influence on their children 's sleep than fathers'. our study indicates the importance of promoting sleep hygiene that encourages healthy sleep for all family members.
atopic_dermatitis	background: prevention of ige-binding to cellular ige-receptors by anti-ige (omalizumab) is clinically effective in allergic asthma, but limited by ige threshold-levels. to overcome this limitation, we developed a single-use ige immunoadsorber column (igenio). igenio is based on a recombinant, ige-specific antibody fragment and can be used for the specific extracorporeal desorption of ige. objective: to study safety and efficacy of igenio regarding the selective depletion of ige in a randomized, open-label, controlled pilot trial in patients with allergic asthma and to investigate if igenio can bind ige-omalizumab immune complexes. methods: fifteen subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the treatment group (n=10) or to the control group (n=5). immunoadsorption was done by veno-venous approach, processing the twofold calculated plasma volume during each treatment. a minimum average ige-depletion of 50% after the last cycle in the intention-to-treat population was defined as primary endpoint. safety of the treatment was studied as secondary endpoint. in addition, possible changes in allergen-specific sensitivity were investigated, as well as clinical effects by peak flow measurement and symptom-recording. the depletion of ige-omalizumab immune complexes was studied in vitro. the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (nct02096237) and conducted from december 2013 to july 2014. results: ige immunoadsorption with igenio selectively depleted 86.2% (+/- 5.1% sd) of ige until the end of the last cycle (p < 0.0001). removal of pollen allergen-specific ige was associated with a reduction of allergen-specific basophil-sensitivity and prevented increases of allergen-specific skin-sensitivity and clinical symptoms during pollen seasons. igenio also depleted ige-omalizumab immune complexes in vitro. the therapy under investigation was safe and well-tolerated. during a total of 81 aphereses, 2 severe adverse events (sae) were recorded, one of which, an episode of acute dyspnea, possibly was related to the treatment and resolved after administration of antihistamines and corticosteroids. conclusions: this pilot study indicates that ige immunoadsorption with igenio may be used to treat patients with pollen-induced allergic asthma. furthermore, the treatment could render allergic patients with highly elevated ige-levels eligible for the administration of omalizumab and facilitate the desorption of ige-omalizumab complexes. this study was funded by fresenius medical care deutschland gmbh, bad homburg, germany.

addiction	this study comprehensively examined the effects of treatment interventions for internet addiction among adolescents in south korea through a meta-analysis. we analyzed 70 domestic master 's theses and journal articles that reported on controlled studies and involved pre- and post-test analyses in the design. the dates of these publications fall between 2000 and 2015. the total effect size, calculated by random-effect analysis (g), revealed that interventions for the treatment of internet addiction were effective (es=1.838). meta-anovas revealed differences between groups based on a theoretical model, intervention group size, and intervention duration. integrative therapy produced larger effect sizes (es=2.794) compared to other treatment models such as cognitive behavioral therapy and reality therapy. effect sizes for interventions, including nine to 12 people (es=2.178), were larger than those of interventions including more or fewer participants. finally, treatment interventions that lasted 8 or more weeks revealed larger effect sizes (es=2.294) compared to shorter interventions. the study findings suggest directions for the development and effective operation of future internet addiction interventions among korean adolescents. increasing the effectiveness of these interventions requires an integrative theoretical model, an intervention group size of nine to 12 participants, and a long-term intervention.
hereditary_angioedema	background & aims: hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is characterized by arterio-venous malformations (avm). it frequently involves the liver without clinical symptoms, but may lead to biliary ischaemia, portal hypertension, or fatal high-output heart failure. the indication of liver transplantation is controversial. methods: herein, we report the case of a 65-year-old female patient with a 'double osler syndrome' consisting of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (hht) and type i hereditary angioedema diagnosed at the age of 25 and 22 years respectively. results: hereditary angioedema was treated with danazol for several decades until multiple hypoechogenic liver masses were detected. albeit danazol treatment was replaced by c1 esterase inhibitor infusions, hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed at the age of 64 and the patient was listed for liver transplantation. hht was marked by recurrent epistaxis until the age of 63 when severe intestinal bleeding occurred. at the age of 65, severe dyspnoea (nyha class iv) developed and rapidly progressive high-output cardiac failure was diagnosed. despite argon plasma coagulation to control bleeding from intestinal angiodysplasia, and treatment with bevacizumab to inhibit angiogenesis, the patient died from severe gastrointestinal bleeding associated with cardiogenic shock at the age of 66 before being transplanted. conclusion: the indication to list this patient for liver transplantation was debated several times before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma because of good general condition and low meld score. precise guidelines for screening and management of patients with hepatic hht need to be better defined.
anxiety	the purpose of this study was to determine the anxiety of prospective music teachers (n =129) during piano exams and to examine the effects of peer and self-assessments on anxiety and exam achievement of individuals with high performance and test anxiety (n = 5). female students were more anxious compared to males, students of the fourth class were the most anxious, and students who had graduated from fine arts high schools had lower anxiety levels. there was a positive and significant relation between test anxiety and music performance anxiety. no significant relation was determined between piano course achievement scores and test or performance anxiety. despite awareness of coping recommendations, students with high levels of anxiety experienced anxiety that could influence performance during exams.
children's_health	safe school environments are essential for healthy development, yet some schools are near large-scale livestock facilities that emit air pollution. hydrogen sulfide ( h2s) from decomposing manure is an indicator of livestock-related air pollution. we measured outdoor concentrations of h2s at three public middle schools near livestock facilities in north carolina. we used circular graphs to relate h2s detection and wind direction to geospatial distributions of nearby livestock barns. we also used logistic and linear regression to model h2s in relation to upwind, distance-weighted livestock barn area. circular graphs suggested an association between upwind livestock barns and h2s detection. the log-odds of h2s detection per 1000 m(2) increased with upwind weighted swine barn area (school a: beta-coefficient (beta) = 0.43, se = 0.06; school b: beta = 0.64, se = 0.24) and upwind weighted poultry barn area (school a: beta = 0.05, se = 0.01), with stronger associations during periods of atmospheric stability than atmospheric instability (school a stable: beta = 0.69, se = 0.11; school a unstable: beta = 0.32, se = 0.09). h2s concentration also increased linearly with upwind swine barn area, with greater increases during stable atmospheric conditions (stable: beta = 0.16 parts per billion (p.p.b.), se = 0.01; unstable: beta = 0.05 p.p.b., se = 0.01). off-site migration of pollutants from industrial livestock operations can decrease air quality at nearby schools.
healthy_sleep	the present randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-drug controlled, crossover study assessed residual sedation after zaleplon 10 mg, flurazepam 30 mg (as an active control), and placebo, taken during a nocturnal awakening in patients with sleep maintenance insomnia. twenty-two healthy sleep maintenance insomniacs (11 men; mean age, 42 y) received zaleplon, flurazepam, or placebo after an experimental awakening 3.5 hours after bedtime on two consecutive nights in each of three conditions. residual sedation was measured with sleep latency testing (5 and 6.5 h postdrug), digit symbol substitution, symbol copying, and subjective sleepiness by visual analog scale, each twice each morning. zaleplon did not differ from placebo on any measure of residual sedation; flurazepam showed significant sedation on all measures. no residual sedative effects were detected 5 or 6.5 hours after ingestion of zaleplon during the middle of the night by sleep maintenance insomniacs.
rheumatoid_arthritis	to evaluate whether c-reactive protein (crp), including variation within the normal range, is predictive of long-term disease outcome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia). consecutive patients with newly diagnosed jia were included prospectively from defined geographic areas of the nordic countries from 1997 to 2000. inclusion criteria were availability of a baseline serum sample within 12 months after disease onset and 8-year clinical assessment data. systemic onset jia was not included. crp was measured by high-sensitive elisa (detection limit of 0.2 mg/l). one hundred and thirty participants with a median follow-up time of 97 months (range 95-100) were included. at follow-up, 38% of the patients were in remission off medication. absence of remission was associated with elevated level of crp at baseline (odds ratio (or) 1.33, confidence interval (ci) 1.08-1.63, p = 0.007). by applying a cutoff at the normal upper limit (>10 mg/l), the risk of not achieving remission was increased to an or of 8.60 (ci 2.98-24.81, p < 0.001). variations of crp within the normal range had no predictive impact on disease activity at follow-up. baseline levels of esr were available in 80 patients (61%) and elevated esr was associated with absence of remission in a multivariable logistic regression analysis (or 2.32, ci 1.35-4.00, p = 0.002). this results of this study indicate that baseline crp concentrations above 10 mg/l are predictive of a poor outcome at 8-year follow-up. we could not demonstrate any predictive value of crp variations within the normal range.
bipolar_disorder	as one of the primary mechanisms by which dopamine signaling is regulated, the dopamine transporter (dat) is an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of diseases based in dopaminergic dysfunction. in this work we demonstrate for the first time that the commonly prescribed breast cancer therapeutic tamoxifen and its major metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen, inhibit dat function. tamoxifen inhibits [h-3]dopamine uptake into human dat (hdat)-n2a cells via an uncompetitive or mixed mechanism. endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen, asymmetrically inhibits dat function in hdat-n2a cells, showing a preference for the inhibition of amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux as compared to dopamine uptake. importantly, we demonstrate that the effects of tamoxifen and its metabolites on the dat occur independently of its activity as selective estrogen receptor modulators. this work suggests that tamoxifen is inhibiting dat function through a previously unidentified mechanism.
lymphoma	cutaneous t-cell lymphomas (ctcl) are characterized by the presence of chronically inflamed skin lesions containing malignant t cells. early disease presents as limited skin patches or plaques and exhibits an indolent behavior. for many patients, the disease never progresses beyond this stage, but in approximately one third of patients, the disease becomes progressive, and the skin lesions start to expand and evolve. eventually, overt tumors develop and the malignant t cells may disseminate to the blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and visceral organs, often with a fatal outcome. the transition from early indolent to progressive and advanced disease is accompanied by a significant shift in the nature of the tumor-associated inflammation. this shift does not appear to be an epiphenomenon but rather a critical step in disease progression. emerging evidence supports that the malignant t cells take control of the inflammatory environment, suppressing cellular immunity and anti-tumor responses while promoting a chronic inflammatory milieu that fuels their own expansion. here, we review the inflammatory changes associated with disease progression in ctcl and point to their wider relevance in other cancer contexts. we further define the term ""malignant inflammation"" as a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory environment orchestrated by the tumor cells and discuss some of the mechanisms driving the development of malignant inflammation in ctcl.
atopic_dermatitis	introduction: there is growing knowledge of the wide ranging effects of histamine throughout the body therefore it is important to better understand the effects of this amine in patients with asthma. we aimed to explore the association between histamine pharmacodynamic (pd) response and genetic variation in the histamine pathway in children with asthma. methods: histamine lontophoresis with laser doppler monitoring (hild) was performed in children with asthma and estimates for area under the effect curve (auec), maximal response over baseline (emax), and time of emax (tmax) were calculated using non-compartmental analysis and non-linear mixed-effects model with a linked effect pk/pd model. dna isolation and genotyping were performed among participants to detect known single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) (n = 10) among genes (hdc, hnmt, abp1, hrh1, hrh4) within the histamine pathway. general linear model was used to identify associations between histamine related genetic variants and measured histamine pd response parameters. results: genotyping and hild response profiles were completed for 163 children. abp1 47 c/t, abp1 4107, and hnmt-1639 c/twere associated with emax (abp1 47 cc genotype mean emax 167.21 vs. ct/tt genotype mean emax 139.20, p = 0.04; abp1 4107 cc genotype mean emax 141.72 vs. cg/gg genotype mean emax 156.09, p = 0.005; hnmt-1639 cc genotype mean emax 132.62 vs. ct/tt genotype mean emax 155.3, p = 0.02). in a stratified analysis among african american children only, abp1 and hnmt snps were also associated with pd response; hrh4 413 cc genotype was associated with lower emax, p = 0.009. conclusions: we show for the first time that histamine pathway genetic variation is associated with measureable changes in histamine response in children with asthma. the variability in histamine response and impact of histamine pathway genotype is important to further explore in patients with asthma so as to improve disease phenotyping leading to more personalized treatments.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: the overlap syndrome of primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis) and primary sclerosing cholangitis is an extremely rare condition that has never been described in association with other immune-mediated diseases, including psoriatic arthritis. while treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) agents has proved to be effective in inflammatory arthropathies such as psoriatic arthritis, they have been employed in only a limited number of patients with autoimmune hepatitis, and their effectiveness is unclear. case presentation: we report the case of a 51-year-old female affected with psoriatic arthritis concomitant to overlapping primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis in whom 28 months of adalimumab treatment improved the symptoms of the inflammatory arthropathy as well as those of both cholangiopathies. conclusion: our results suggest that further studies examining the therapeutic role of this particular tnf-a blocker are warranted in cholestatic autoimmune hepatitis patients, and in particular in those individuals in whom the disease is associated with inflammatory arthropathies.
asthma	atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) is increasingly expressed on airway and inhibits pulmonary arterial remodeling. however, the role of anp in remodeling of respiratory system is still unclear. the role of anp on airway remodeling and the possible mechanism was explored in this study. both human bronchial epithelial 16hbe-14o cells and alveolar epithelial a549 cells were stimulated by tgf-beta 1, anp, cgmp inhibitor, pkg inhibitor, and cgmp analogue. the expressions of epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers, and smad3 were assessed by quantitative real-time pcr and western blotting. immunohistochemical staining was employed to assess smad3 expression once it was silenced by sirna in 16hbe-14o or a549 cells. our results showed that the mrna and protein expressions of e-cadherin were decreased, whereas alpha-sma expressions were increased after induction by tgf-beta 1 in 16hbe-14o and a549 cells. the e-cadherin expressions were increased and alpha-sma expressions were decreased after anp stimulation. inhibition of cgmp or pkg decreased e-cadherin expression but increased alpha-sma expression, which could be reversed by cgmp analogue. moreover, the phosphorylated smad3 expression was consistent with alpha-sma expression. after smad3 was silenced, smad3 was mostly expressed in cytoplasm instead of nucleus as non-silenced cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt). in conclusion, anp inhibits tgf-beta 1-induced emt in 16hbe-14o and a549 cells through cgmp/pkg signaling, by which it targets tgf-beta 1/smad3 via attenuating phosphorylation of smad3. these findings suggest the potential of anp in the treatment on pulmonary diseases with airway remodeling.

dementia	objective: executive function consists of multiple cognitive processes that operate as an interactive system to produce volitional goaloriented behavior, governed in large part by frontal microstructural and physiological networks. identification of deficits in executive function in those with neurological or psychiatric conditions can be difficult because the normal variation in executive function test scores, in healthy adults when multiple tests are used, is largely unknown. this study addresses that gap in the literature by examining the prevalence of low scores on a brief battery of executive function tests. method: the sample consisted of 1,050 healthy individuals (ages 16-89) from the standardization sample for the delis-kaplan executive function system (d-kefs). seven individual test scores from the trail making test, color-word interference test, and verbal fluency test were analyzed. results: low test scores, as defined by commonly used clinical cut-offs (i. e., <= 25th, 16th, 9th, 5th, and 2nd percentiles), occurred commonly among the adult portion of the d-kefs normative sample (e.g., 62.8% of the sample had one or more scores <= 16th percentile, 36.1% had one or more scores <= 5th percentile), and the prevalence of low scores increased with lower intelligence and fewer years of education. conclusions: the multivariate base rates (br) in this article allow clinicians to understand the normal frequency of low scores in the general population. by use of these brs, clinicians and researchers can improve the accuracy with which they identify executive dysfunction in clinical groups, such as those with traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases.
healthy_sleep	attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is commonly associated with disordered or disturbed sleep. the relationships of adhd with sleep problems, psychiatric comorbidities and medications are complex and multidirectional. evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with adhd with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of adhd with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. adhd is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with adhd for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of adhd, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between adhd and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: adhd may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic adhd; adhd and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and adhd and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.
migraine	pediatric migraine is a disorder that significantly interferes with the everyday life and school life of approximately 8% of children and adolescents in korea. recently, studies on migraine have been carried out very rapidly, many drugs have been developed, and acute-phase and preventive treatments for migraine have been evaluated. therefore, it is necessary to understand the diagnostic criteria and degree of impairment in pediatric migraine and to become familiar with up-to-date treatment methods in children. research into the use of botulinum toxin or calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists to treat adult migraine headaches is progressing, and we expect these therapies to be applicable to pediatric patients soon. many students in our country are suffering from migraines in their daily life. therefore, we need to acquire the relevant knowledge and identify practical treatment methods for pediatric migraine in children and adolescents in order to reduce their pain.
asthma	both air pollution and meteorological factors in metropolitan areas increased emergency department (ed) visits from people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). few studies investigated the associations between air pollution, meteorological factors, and copd-related health disorders in asian countries. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the environmental factors and copd-associated ed visits of susceptible elderly population in the largest taiwanese metropolitan area (taipei area, including taipei city and new taipei city) between 2000 and 2013. data of air pollutant concentrations (pm10, pm2.5, o-3, so2, no2 and co), meteorological factors (daily temperature, relative humidity and air pressure), and daily copd-associated ed visits were collected from taiwan environmental protection administration air monitoring stations, central weather bureau stations, and the taiwan national health insurance database in taipei area. we used a case-crossover study design and conditional logistic regression models with odds ratios (ors), and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for evaluating the associations between the environmental factors and copd-associated ed visits. analyses showed that pm2.5, o-3, and so2 had significantly greater lag effects (the lag was 4 days for pm2.5, and 5 days for 03 and so2) on copd-associated ed visits of the elderly population (65-79 years old). in warmer days, a significantly greater effect on elderly copd-associated ed visits was estimated for pm2.5 with coexistence of o-3. additionally, either o-3 or so2 combined with other air pollutants increased the risk of elderly copd-associated ed visits in the days of high relative humidity and air pressure difference, respectively. this study showed that joint effect of urban air pollution and meteorological factors contributed to the copd-associated ed visits of the susceptible elderly population in the largest metropolitan area in taiwan. government authorities should review existing air pollution policies, and strengthen health education propaganda to ensure the health of the susceptible elderly population.(c) 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
asthma	mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (mkp-1) expression is induced by inflammatory factors and serves as an endogenous p38 mapk suppressor to limit inflammatory response. glucocorticoids are very effective anti-inflammatory drugs and they are used for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and copd. we investigated the role of mkp-1 in the inhibition of cytokine production by dexamethasone in human a549 bronchial epithelial cells. we found that dexamethasone increased mkp-1 expression, inhibited p38 mapk phosphorylation, and suppressed tnf and mip-3 alpha production in a549 cells. interestingly, the suppression of p38 mapk phosphorylation and the inhibition of tnf expression by dexamethasone were attenuated in cells, where mkp-1 expression was silenced by sirna. in conclusion, these data suggest that dexamethasone increases mkp-1 expression and this results in the suppression of p38 mapk signaling leading to the inhibition of cytokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells. these results point to the role of mkp-1 as an important factor in the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases.
hereditary_angioedema	complement activation is of major importance in numerous pathological conditions. therefore, targeted complement inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy. c1-esterase inhibitor (c1-inh) controls activation of the classical pathway (cp) and the lectin pathway (lp). however, conflicting data exist on inhibition of the alternative pathway (ap) by c1-inh. the inhibitory capacity of c1-inh for the cp is potentiated by heparin and other glycosaminoglycans, but no data exist for the lp and ap. the current study investigates the effects of c1-inh in the presence or absence of different clinically used heparinoids on the cp, lp and ap. furthermore, the combined effects of heparinoids and c1-inh on coagulation were investigated. c1-inh, heparinoids or combinations were analysed in a dosedependent fashion in the presence of pooled serum. functional complement activities were measured simultaneously using the wielisa (r)-kit. the activated partial thrombin time was determined using an automated coagulation analyser. the results showed that all three complement pathways were inhibited significantly by c1-inh or heparinoids. next to their individual effects on complement activation, heparinoids also enhanced the inhibitory capacity of c1-inh significantly on the cp and lp. for the ap, significant potentiation of c1-inh by heparinoids was found; however, this was restricted to certain concentration ranges. at low concentrations the effect on blood coagulation by combining heparinoids with c1-inh was minimal. in conclusion, our study shows significant potentiating effects of heparinoids on the inhibition of all complement pathways by c1-inh. therefore, their combined use is a promising and a potentially cost-effective treatment option for complement-mediated diseases.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	rapid access to lung-derived cells from stable subjects is a major challenge in the pulmonary hypertension field, given the relative contraindication of lung biopsy. in these studies, we sought to demonstrate the importance of evaluating a cell type that actively participates in disease processes, as well as the potential to translate these findings to vascular beds in other nonlung tissues, in this instance perivascular skin mesenchymal cells (mcs). we utilized posttransplant or autopsy lung explant-derived cells (abcg2-expressing mesenchymal progenitor cells [mpcs], fibroblasts) and skin-derived mcs to test the hypothesis that perivascular abcg2 mpcs derived from pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) patient lung and skin would express a gene profile reflective of ongoing vascular dysfunction. by analyzing the genetic signatures and pathways associated with abnormal abcg2 lung mpc phenotypes during pah and evaluating them in lung- and skin-derived mcs, we have identified potential predictor genes for detection of pah as well as a targetable mechanism to restore mpcs and microvascular function. these studies are the first to explore the utility of expanding the study of abcg2 mpc regulation of the pulmonary microvasculature to the epidermis, in order to identify potential markers for adult lung vascular disease, such as pah.
children's_health	previous research has shown a negative relationship between adverse childhood events (aces) and health and resiliency among the general population, but has not examined these associations among children with autism. purpose to determine the prevalence of aces among children with autism and how aces are associated with resiliency and health. methods a quantitative analysis was conducted using data from the 2011-2012 national survey of children 's health. results children with autism experience significantly more aces than their peers, which is negatively associated with their health. however, resiliency is not significantly associated with aces in this population. aces disproportionately affect children with autism, which is negatively associated with health, but not resiliency. further investigation into why children with autism experience more aces but maintain resiliency is warranted.
osteoarthritis	background: the objective of this study was to determine the influence of loading frequency on the failure of articular cartilage-on-bone specimens under three-point bending. methods: in this study, cyclic three-point bending was used to introduce failure into cartilage-on-bone specimens at varying loading frequencies. sinusiodally varying maximum compressive loads in the range 40-130 n were applied to beam-shaped cartilage-on-bone specimens at frequencies of 1, 10, 50 and 100 hz. results: the number of cycles to failure decreased when loading frequency increased from normal and above gait (1 and 10 hz) to impulsive loading frequencies (50 and 100 hz). it was found that 67 and 27% of the specimens reached run-out at loading of 10,000 cycles at frequencies of 1 and 10 hz, respectively. however, 0% of the specimens reached run-out at loading frequencies of 50 and 100 hz. conclusion: the results indicate that increasing the loading frequency reduces the ability of specimens to resist fracture during bending. the findings underline the importance of the loading frequency concerning the failure of articular cartilage-on-bone and it may have implications in the early onset of osteoarthritis.
medicare	the goal of the current study was to explore information search and processing differences between individuals who are less and more numerate in an attempt to better understand the mechanisms that might differentiate the choices they make. we did so using a computerized process-tracing system known as mousetrace, which presented monetary gambles in an alternative x attribute matrix with outcome (dollar amount) and probability information as attributes. this information was initially occluded but could be revealed by clicking on the cell that contained the desired information. beginning with nine gambles offering the chance of gaining or losing a specified amount, participants (n = 110) narrowed down the options (to three and then one) using an inclusion or exclusion strategy. consistent with previous research, inclusion was a more effortful strategy, and individuals who were higher in numeracy were more likely to select prospects with the highest expected value. process measures revealed these individuals expended more effort (i. e., attended to and sought out more information and processed it in greater depth) and exhibited more compensatory processing than those who were lower in numeracy, but this sometimes depended on whether one was asked to include or exclude. these results serve as further evidence that individuals with higher levels of numeracy often engage in more elaborative processing of the decision task, which tends to lead to more optimal choices. however, they also suggest that individuals are adaptive and that the specific situation can matter. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
osteoarthritis	meniscal cartilage tears are common and predispose to osteoarthritis (oa). most occur in the avascular portion of the meniscus where current repair techniques usually fail. we described previously the use of undifferentiated autologous mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) seeded onto a collagen scaffold (msc/collagen-scaffold) to integrate meniscal tissues in vitro. our objective was to translate this method into a cell therapy for patients with torn meniscus, with the long-term goal of delaying or preventing the onset of oa. after in vitro optimization, we tested an ovine-msc/collagen-scaffold in a sheep meniscal cartilage tear model with promising results after 13 weeks, although repair was not sustained over 6 months. we then conducted a single center, prospective, open-label first-in-human safety study of patients with an avascular meniscal tear. autologous mscs were isolated from an iliac crest bone marrow biopsy, expanded and seeded into the collagen scaffold. the resulting human-msc/collagen-scaffold implant was placed into the meniscal tear prior to repair with vertical mattress sutures and the patients were followed for 2 years. five patients were treated and there was significant clinical improvement on repeated measures analysis. three were asymptomatic at 24 months with no magnetic resonance imaging evidence of recurrent tear and clinical improvement in knee function scores. two required subsequent meniscectomy due to retear or nonhealing of the meniscal tear at approximately 15 months after implantation. no other adverse events occurred. we conclude that undifferentiated mscs could provide a safe way to augment avascular meniscal repair in some patients.
atopic_dermatitis	chronic itch in inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, markedly diminishes the quality of life of affected individuals. comprehensive progress has been made in understanding itch signaling and associated mediators in the skin, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and central nervous system, which may amplify or suppress atopic itch. conventional therapies for atopic dermatitis are capable of reducing atopic itch; however, most patients are not satisfied with the antipruritic capacity of conventional treatments. exploring itch pathways and mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for atopic itch.
crohn's_disease	aim to evaluate the quality and accuracy of websites written to the public on inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) (crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis) and assess their readability level. methods google t, bing t, and yahoo t search engines were searched independently by three researchers in december 2014. only english-language websites were selected on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. researchers independently evaluated the quality of each website by using the discern and the honcode instruments. the readability levels were calculated using two formulas; the flesch-kincaid grade level index, and the coleman-liau readability index. the agreement between the evaluators was calculated using cohen kappa coefficient. results eighty-four websites were finally identified. scores varied from a minimum discern score of 18 to a maximum of 68 [ mean +/- sd, 42.2 +/- 10.7; median = 41.5, interquartile range, interquartile range (iqr) = 15.8] and a minimum score of honcode of 0.14 and a maximum of 0.95 (mean +/- sd, 0.16 +/- 0.19; median = 0.45, iqr = 0.29). most of these websites were reviewed in 2014 and 2015 (n = 51). the creators of these websites were: universities and research centers (n = 25, 30%), foundations and associations (n = 15, 18%), commercial and pharmaceutical companies (n = 25, 30%), charities and volunteer work (n = 9, 10%), and non-university educational bodies (n = 10, 12%). the flesch-kincaid grade level readability score (mean +/- sd) was 11.9 +/- 2.4 and the coleman-liau readability index score was 12.6 +/- 1.5. significant correlation was found between the two readability scores (r-2 = 0.509, p = 0.001). the overall agreement between evaluators measured by cohen kappa coefficient was in the range of 0.804-0.876; rated as ""good"". conclusion the discern and the honcode scores of websites varied and the readability levels of most websites were above the public readability level. the study highlights the areas that need further improvement and development in patient education online materials about ibd.
medicare	objectiveto examine the influence of physician and hospital market structures on medical technology diffusion, studying the diffusion of drug-eluting stents (dess), which became available in april 2003. data sources/study settingmedicare claims linked to physician demographic data from the american medical association and to hospital characteristics from the american hospital association survey. study designretrospective claims data analyses. data collection/extraction methodsall fee-for-service medicare beneficiaries who received a percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with a cardiac stent in 2003 or 2004. each pci record was joined to characteristics on the patient, the procedure, the cardiologist, and the hospital where the pci was delivered. we accounted for the endogeneity of physician and hospital market structure using exogenous variation in the distances between patient, physician, and hospital locations. we estimated multivariate linear probability models that related the use of a des in the pci on market structure while controlling for patient, physician, and hospital characteristics. principal findingsdess diffused faster in markets where cardiology practices faced more competition. conversely, we found no evidence that the structure of the hospital market mattered. conclusionscompetitive pressure to maintain or expand pci volume shares compelled cardiologists to adopt dess more quickly.
lymphoma	background: myc is an essential gene having multiple functions such as in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, genomic stability, angiogenesis, and disease biology. a large number of researchers dedicated to myc biology are generating a substantial amount of data in normal and cancer cells/tissues including burkitt 's lymphoma and ovarian cancer. results: mycbase (http://bicresources. jcbose. ac. in/ssaha4/mycbase) is a collection of experimentally supported functional sites in myc that can influence the biological cellular processes. the functional sites were compiled according to their role which includes mutation, methylation pattern, post-translational modifications, proteinprotein interactions (ppis), and dna interactions. in addition, biochemical properties of myc are also compiled, which includes metabolism/pathway, protein abundance, and modulators of protein-protein interactions. the omics data related to myc-like gene expression, proteomics expression using mass-spectrometry and mirnas targeting myc were also compiled in mycbase. the mutation and pathway data from the mycbase were analyzed to look at the patterns and distributions across different diseases. there were few proteins/genes found common in myc-protein interactions and myc-dna binding, and these can play a significant role in transcriptional feedback loops. conclusion: in this report, we present a comprehensive integration of relevant information regarding myc in the form of mycbase. the data compiled in mycbase provides a reliable data resource for functional sites at the residue level and biochemical properties of myc in various cancers.
osteoporosis	trabecular bone score (tbs) is a gray-level texture measure derived from lumbar spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) images that predicts fractures independent of bone mineral density (bmd). increased abdominal soft tissue in individuals with elevated body mass index (bmi) absorbs more x-rays during image acquisition for bmd measurement and must be accommodated by the tbs algorithm. we aimed to determine if the relationship between bmi and tbs varied between 2 major manufacturers' densitometers, because different densitometers accommodate soft tissues differently. we identified 1919 women and 811 men, participants of the canadian multicentre osteoporosis study, aged >= 40 yr with lumbar spine dxa scans acquired on ge lunar (4 centers) or hologic (3 centers) densitometers at year 10 of follow-up. tbs was calculated for l1-la (tbs insight (r) software, version 2.1). a significant negative correlation between tbs and bmi was observed when tbs measurements were performed on hologic densitometers in men (pearson r = 0.36,p < 0.0001) and in women (pearson r = 0.33,p < 0.0001); significant correlations were not seen when tbs was measured on ge lunar densitometers (pearson r = 0.00 in men, pearson r = 0.02 in women). age-adjusted linear regression models confirmed significant interactions between bmi and densitometer manufacturer for both men and women (p < 0.0001). in contrast, comparable positive correlations were observed between bmd and bmi on both hologic and ge lunar densitometers in men and women. in conclusion, bmi significantly affects tbs values in men and women when measured on hologic but not ge lunar densitometers. this finding has implications for clinical and research applications of tbs, especially when tbs is measured sequentially on dxa densitometers from different manufacturers or when results from different machines are pooled for analysis.
ankylosing_spondylitis	poor sleep, depression, and anxiety are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) and associated with increased risk of relapse and poor outcomes. the effectiveness of therapies in improving such psychosocial outcomes is unclear but is an important question to examine with increasing selectivity of therapeutic agents. this prospective cohort enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe cd or uc starting biologic therapy with vedolizumab or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (anti-tnf). sleep quality, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated short-form nih promis questionnaires assessing sleep and mood quality over the past 7 days. disease activity was assessed using validated indices. improvement in sleep and mood scores from baseline was assessed, and regression models were used to identify determinants of sleep quality. our study included 160 patients with ibd (49 anti-tnf, 111 vedolizumab) among whom half were women and the mean age was 40.2 years. in the combined cohort, we observed a statistically significant and meaningful decrease in mean scores from baseline (52.8) by week 6 (49.8, p = 0.002). among vedolizumab users, sleep t-score improved from baseline (53.6) by week 6 (50.7) and persisted through week 54 (46.5, p = 0.009). parallel reductions in depression and anxiety were also noted (p < 0.05 by week 6). we observed no difference in improvement in sleep, depression, and anxiety between vedolizumab and anti-tnf use at week 6. both vedolizumab and anti-tnf biologic therapies were associated with improvement in sleep and mood quality in ibd.
asthma	purpose of review the aim of this study is to characterize, diagnose, evaluate, and treat severe childhood asthma. recent findings understanding the occurrence of the physiologic and clinical presentations of childhood severe asthma, the treatment and response may be predicted by biomarkers, but the patient 's response is highly variable. summary the onset of severe asthma occurs early and is primarily predicted by severity of viral infection and coexistence of the atopic state.
lymphoma	treatment response of follicular lymphomas (fl) is highly variable. we, therefore, investigated the role of fl cancer-associated fibroblasts (cafs) on tumor cell viability, in particular in response to treatment with cytotoxic drugs. stromal cells outgrown from fl patients were characterized and pure caf populations were co-cultivated with fl cells. to analyze fibroblast-mediated effects, cells in co-culture were treated with abt-737 and bortezomib. the adherent cell population was positive for all fibroblastic markers tested and showed increased mrna-expression of the activation marker fap. no effect on fl cell viability was noted when co-cultivating them with cafs. however, stromal cells protected tumor cells from apoptosis in response to cytotoxic treatment. this might be explained by mrna-induction of abcc1 and abcg2 and up-regulation of bcl2l1 in fl cells. our finding of protective mechanisms mediated by cafs is of pivotal impact for further studies of cytotoxic agents in fl.
osteoporosis	background and purpose: we have developed a 12-week balance training program for older adults shown to improve fall-related concerns, gait speed, balance performance, and physical function. we hypothesized that this balance training would also contribute to higher habitual physical activity (pa) levels and improved health-related quality of life (hrqol). the primary aim was to evaluate short- and long-term effects of the balance training program on objectively measured habitual pa in older adults with osteoporosis. secondary aims were to assess the effects of the balance training on hrqol, and to study whether any effects on pa were associated with changes in hrqol, gait speed, balance performance, fall-related concerns, and physical function. methods: a randomized controlled trial with follow-up at 3, 9, and 15 months, including 91 participants with osteoporosis (75.6 + 5.4 years), compared a balance training group (n = 61) with a control group (n = 30). the primary outcome was effect on habitual pa measured as steps/day, dichotomized into less than 5000 or 5000 or more steps/day. physical activity was assessed with pedometers (yamax) and accelerometers (actigraph), hrqol with the short form-36 (sf-36), gait with a gaitrite walkway, balance performance with modified-figure-eight test and one-leg stance, fall-related concerns with falls efficacy scale international, and physical function with the advanced lower extremity subscale of the questionnaire late life function and disability instrument. statistical methods used were multivariate logistic regression and logistic generalized estimating equation. results: sixty-eight participants completed the short-term follow-up at 3 months, and 53 participants completed the long-term follow-up at 15 months. per-protocol analysis (n = 68) showed that the odds ratio for having a daily step count of 5000 or more at 3 months was 6.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-30.91), p = .027, for the intervention group compared with the control group. the longitudinal analysis (n = 91) showed that the odds ratio for having a daily step count of 5000 or more at 15 months was 2.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-4.64), p = .096, for the intervention group compared with the control group. the mental component sum of the sf-36 improved significantly from baseline to 3 months in the intervention group, and the physical component sum improved in both groups, but no statistically significant differences were found between groups. no associations were found between pa and changes in covariates. discussion and conclusions: the short-term evaluation showed that balance training increased habitual pa in community-dwelling older adults with osteoporosis. a significantly higher proportion of participants in the intervention group reached a level of 5000 or more steps/day, which is important for overall health. this effect was not associated with improvements in hrqol, gait speed, balance performance, or fall-related concerns, and did not persist through the long-term follow-up. to accomplish a sustained pa change, a prolonged intervention or more support regarding habitual pa may be required, such as reinforcement with personalized behavior change counseling or pa on prescription.
atrial_fibrillation	inconclusive results have been reported in studies investigating the association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) rs6265 polymorphism and migraine. in the present study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the published data in order to quantitatively estimate the relationship between rs6265 and migraine susceptibility. a comprehensive search was performed through pubmed, web of knowledge, and cochrane databases up to october 2016. the pooled odds ratio (or) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (ci) was calculated to estimate the strength of the association with rs6265 under an additive, dominant, or recessive model of inheritance. a total of five studies including 1,442 cases and 1,880 controls were identified for the meta-analysis. the pooled data showed an increased risk of migraine for the allelic (or: 1.17, 95% ci: 1.03-1.34, p = 0.014) or the dominant model of rs6265 (or: 1.22, 95% ci: 1.05-1.41, p = 0.011). statistical significance of rs6265 was lost when one single study was excluded from the analysis (dominant or: 1.17, 95% ci: 1.00-1.38, p = 0.054; allelic or: 1.14, 95% ci: 0.99-1.31, p = 0.067), suggesting lack of robustness of pooled estimates. when stratified by migraine type, a similar trend of association was detected with both ma and mo, but a statistically significant association of rs6265 was reached only with the ma subtype in the dominant model (or: 1.22, 95% ci: 1.00-1.47, p = 0.047). the present meta-analysis supports that bdnf rs6265 may act as a genetic susceptibility factor for migraine. nevertheless, large-scale studies are required to confirm our findings and to assess potential modifiers of the relationship between rs6265 and migraine.
osteoporosis	background: whether all-polyethylene tibial (apt) components are beneficial to patients who received distal femur limb-salvage surgery lacks high-quality clinical follow-up and mechanical evidence. this study aimed to investigate the biomechanics of the distal femur reconstructed with apt tumor knee prostheses using finite element (fe) analysis based on our previous, promising clinical outcome. methods: three-dimensional fe models that use apt and metal-backed tibial (mbt) prostheses to reconstruct distal femoral bone defects were developed and input into the abaqus fea software version 6.10.1. mesh refinement tests and gait simulation with a single foot both in the upright and 15 degrees-flexion positions with mechanical loading were conducted. stress distribution analysis was compared between apt and mbt at the two static positions. results: for both prosthesis types, the stress was concentrated on the junction of the stem and shaft, and the maximum stress in the femoral axis base was more than 100 mpa. the stress on the tibial surface was relatively distributed, which was 1-19 mpa. the stress on the tibial bone-cement layer of the apt prosthesis was approximately 20 times higher than that on the mbt prosthesis in the same region. the stress on the proximal tibial cancellous bone and cortical bone of the apt prosthesis was 3-5 times greater than that of the mbt prosthesis, and it was more distributed. conclusions: although the stress of bone-cement around the apt component is relatively high, the stress was better distributed at the polyethylene-cement-bone interface in apt than in mbt prosthesis, which effectively protects the proximal tibia in distal femur tumor knee prosthesis replacement. these results should be considered when selecting the appropriate tibial component for a patient, especially under the foreseeable conditions of osteoporosis.
addiction	background and aims: the ""internet addiction"" paradigm has been criticized for several shortcomings, including inattention to specific online behaviors, not distinguishing the internet from other media, insufficient focus on comorbidities, and definitions that do not take into account the constant access now possible. the paradigm 's biggest casualty, however, may be that it has diverted attention away from subtle personality changes that seem to occur online, including in users who cannot be considered ""addicted"" under any definition. methods: a narrative assessment of the literature was conducted, focusing on the internet 's effects on personality traits as revealed in studies of internet users. results: impulsivity, narcissism, and aggression are some of the personality traits that seem to be nurtured by the internet, with possible negative offline consequences. discussion: ignoring the internet 's subtle effects on personality as we embrace an addiction model that implies severe pathology makes the majority of internet users feel deceptively immune to the psychological effects of new technologies. it also limits our understanding of the big cultural shifts that are happening as a result. conclusion: the internet 's potentially negative effect on personality, and by extension on society at large, is a fundamental part of online psychology, one well worthy of further investigation.
lymphoma	background: localized early-stage extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma (mzl) presents with heterogeneous organ involvement and is treated with various modalities, including resection, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy. we report the long-term outcome of a large cohort of extra-nodal mzl and assess the impact of patient and disease characteristics, organ site, and treatment strategy on disease control and survival. patients and methods: we identified 487 consecutive patients with stage ie or iie mzl referred between 1992 and 2012 to memorial sloan kettering cancer center. pathology was reviewed by hematopathologists at our institution. patient and disease factors as well as treatment types were analyzed for association with relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse. results: median follow-up after treatment was 4.7 years. five-year relapse-free survival and overall survival were 60% and 89%, respectively. cumulative incidence of disease-specific death at 5 years was 1.3%. radiotherapy alone was the initial treatment in 50% of patients, followed by surgical resection (30%), observation (8%), immunotherapy (4%), and chemotherapy (2%). initial treatment type, primary disease site, and number of involved sites were significant factors in multivariable analysis of relapse (all p2.0, p <= 0.001), except for thyroid, had higher risk of relapse. strategies such as antibiotics or topical therapies were associated with higher risk of relapse when compared with radiation therapy (p < 0.001). crude rate of transformation to pathologically confirmed large-cell lymphoma was 2% (11 patients). conclusion: overall and cause-specific survival are high in early-stage extra-nodal mzl. curative-intent treatment led to fewer relapses and reduced the need for salvage. stomach cases had lower risk of relapse than other anatomic primary sites. this study supports the use of local therapies to treat stage ie and iie mzl.
atopic_dermatitis	background. the irritant sodium lauryl sulfate (sls) is known to cause a decrease in the stratum corneum level of natural moisturizing factor (nmf), which in itself is associated with changes in corneocyte surface topography. objective. to explore this phenomenon in allergic contact dermatitis. methods. patch testing was performed on patients with previously positive patch test reactions to potassium dichromate (cr), nickel sulfate (ni), methylchloroisothiazolinone (mci)/methylisothiazolinone (mi), or p-phenylenediamine. moreover, a control (pet.) patch and an irritant (sls) patch were applied. after 3 days, the stratum corneum from tested sites was collected, and nmf levels and corneocyte morphology, expressed as the amount of circular nanosize objects, quantified according to the dermal texture index (dti), were determined. results. among allergens, only mci/mi reduced nmf levels significantly, as did sls. furthermore, only mci/mi caused remarkable changes at the microscopic level; the corneocytes were hexagonal-shaped with pronounced cell borders and a smoother surface. the dti was increased after sls exposure but not after allergen exposure. conclusions. mci/mi significantly decreased nmf levels, similarly to sls. the altered corneocyte morphology suggests that skin barrier damage plays a role in the pathogenesis of mci/mi contact allergy. the dti seems to differentiate reactions to sls from those to the allergens tested, as sls was the only agent that caused a dti increase.
rheumatoid_arthritis	objectives: this study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (pk), immunogenicity, and tolerability of lbal, a biosimilar of adalimumab, with the originator, humira (r), in healthy volunteers.methods: a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, two-arm, parallel-group study was conducted in 116 healthy subjects. they randomly received a single subcutaneous (sc) 40mg injection of lbal or humira. blood samples were collected for pk and immunogenicity assessment. pk parameters were determined using the noncompartmental method, and primary endpoint parameters were compared using the point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (cis) of the geometric mean ratios (gmrs). tolerability was also evaluated.results: the pk characteristics of the test and reference drugs were comparable. the gmr (90% cis) for c-max and auc(inf) of lbal to humira were 1.01 (0.92-1.11) and 0.96 (0.83-1.10), respectively, which were within the conventional bioequivalence criteria of 0.80-1.25. no significant differences occurred in the frequency of subjects with anti-adalimumab antibody-positive responses between both drugs. tolerability profiles including adverse events were also comparable.conclusion: the pk characteristics of the biosimilar lbal and the originator humira were similar. lbal and humira did not show significant differences in immunogenicity and both were well tolerated after a single sc injection.
mental_health	this study uses qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews to explore the adjustment challenges encountered by international graduate students during their study at us universities, and the protective factors most associated with successful adjustment. nine students from china, korea, and taiwan, attending a midwestern university, participated in the study. language barriers and discrimination were the primary challenges reported; the factors most associated with successful adjustment were personal perception, social support, strong mentoring relationships, religious belief, and use of campus services. implications for providing effective assistance for international graduate students are discussed.
digestive_health	the aim of this study was to determine the effect of saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc) on the morphological and histochemical properties of duodenum and duodenal submucosal glands of rabbits. twenty 5-6 weeks old male new zealand white rabbits were obtained from the experimental animal laboratory of uludag university, bursa. the rabbits were divided randomly into two groups for 90 day. the first group (control group) received the basal diet, the second group (sc group) received basal diet supplemented with saccharomyces cerevisiae at a level of 3 g/kg of feed. duodenal tissue were taken at the end of the experiment from duodenum of animals and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. sections were stained for localizing and characterizing glycoproteins (gps) and morphometric measurements. in this study, the total mucosa, villus heights and gland depth of the duodenum were found to be longer than those of the control group in the sc group. however, duodenal crypt depth was greater in the duodenum of control groups, but no significant difference between the groups. the goblet cells showed similar reaction in the both groups. brunner glands were similar stained with ab ph 1, ph 2.5 and pas/ab ph 1 in the both groups. however, they showed stronger positive reaction with pas and pas/ab ph 2.5 staining in the sc group compared with the control. in conclusion, the addition of sc to the diet of rabbits increased the total mucosa, villus height, and gland depth. however, the addition of sc also little affected the histochemical features of the duodenum by increased the secretion neutral and acidic mucins in the brunner 's glands. therefore, it may be proposed that higher doses of saccharomyces cerevisiae may be used for digestive health.
anxiety	shyness has been linked to several distinct behavioral antecedents and biological correlates across development, including early behavioral inhibition and neuroendocrine dysregulation. in the present study, we examined whether self-reported history of childhood behavioral inhibition, concurrent cortisol output, and sex affected shyness levels in adults. results revealed that a history of childhood social behavioral inhibition predicted higher shyness among female adults with high levels of cortisol output. among women with low cortisol levels, there was no relation between childhood social behavioral inhibition and shyness levels. these associations were not consistent when examining a history of nonsocial behavioral inhibition, or among adult males. these findings highlight the importance of differentiating social versus nonsocial behavioral inhibition when examining relations between childhood temperament and adult shyness. further, these findings raise the possibility that neuroendocrine dysregulation may have a unique role in predicting and maintaining social behaviors such as shyness depending on sex and individual differences in temperament.

rheumatoid_arthritis	objective: polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene are associated with outcome and corticosteroid responsiveness among patients with inflammatory disorders. we conducted a candidate gene association study to test the hypothesis that these polymorphisms are associated with outcome and corticosteroid responsiveness among children with septic shock. design: we genotyped 482 children with septic shock for the presence of two glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms (rs56149945 and rs41423247) associated with increased sensitivity and one glucocorticoid receptor polymorphism (rs6198) associated with decreased sensitivity to corticosteroids. the primary outcome variable was complicated course, defined as 28-day mortality or the persistence of two or more organ failures 7 days after a septic shock diagnosis. we used logistic regression to test for an association between corticosteroid exposure and outcome, within genotype group, and adjusted for illness severity. setting: multiple picus in the united states. interventions: standard care. measurements and main results: there were no differences in outcome when comparing the various genotype groups. among patients homozygous for the wild-type glucocorticoid receptor allele, corticosteroids were independently associated with increased odds of complicated course (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% ci, 1.01-5.21; p = 0.047). conclusions: based on these glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms, we could not detect a beneficial effect of corticosteroids among any genotype group. among children homozygous for the wild-type allele, corticosteroids were independently associated with increased odds of poor outcome.
children's_health	the purpose of this study is to understand the relationships in the mother-placenta-child system in case of hematogenous thrombophilia and thrombotic state of readiness in pregnant women. materials and methods. the research group consisted of 454 patients, was divided into two subgroups: the 1st subgroup included 225 women (pregnant and, subsequently, obstetric patients) and the 2nd subgroup included their 229 infants who were in the perinatal center of state novosibirsk regional clinical hospital. at 3-5 days of life 75 newborns from the 2nd sub-group underwent hemostatic system assessment. 42 healthy newborns from somatically healthy mothers (without thrombophilia) were included in the control group. the assessment of their hemostatic system was carried out to determine the performance of reference values. results. the relationships between the health condition of newborns and hemostatic system disorders in mothers with thrombotic state of readiness, hematogenous thrombophilia, and morphohistological changes in the placenta were studied. the researchers analyzed labour and delivery records, pathomorphological examination of a placenta, neonatal records, and assessed the hemostatic system. a number of complications were detected during a gestational process and an early neonatal period. the correlation analysis has established a relationship in the mother - placenta - child system in a number of factors affecting children 's health outcomes. to correct above mentioned abnormalities preventive measures can be taken. they allow to avert the development of perinatal complications in case of hematogenous thrombophilia and (or) thrombotic readiness.
dementia	background & aims: low-grade inflammation appears to play an etiological role in cognitive decline. however the association between an inflammatory dietary pattern and cognitive decline has not been investigated. we aimed to investigate dietary patterns associated with inflammation and whether such diet is associated with cognitive decline. methods: we analyzed 5083 participants (28.7% women) from the whitehall ii cohort study. diet and serum interleukin-6 (il-6) were assessed in 1991-1993 and 1997-1999. we used reduced rank regression methods to determine a dietary pattern associated with elevated il-6. cognitive tests were performed in 1997-1999 and repeated in 2002-2004 and 2007-2009. the association between dietary pattern and cognitive decline between ages 45 and 79 was assessed using linear mixed models. results: we identified an inflammatory dietary pattern characterized by higher intake of red meat, processed meat, peas and legumes, and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains which correlated with elevated il-6 both in 1991-1993 and 1997-1999. a greater decline in reasoning was seen in participants in the highest tertile of adherence to the inflammatory dietary pattern (-0.37 sd; 95% confidence interval [ci] -0.40, -0.34) compared to those in the lowest tertile (-0.31; 95% ci -0.34, -0.28) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, occupational status, education, and total energy intake (p for interaction across tertiles = 0.01). this association remained significant after multivariable adjustment. similarly for global cognition, the inflammatory dietary pattern was associated with faster cognitive decline after multivariable adjustment (p for interaction across tertiles = 0.04). associations were stronger in younger participants (<56 years), reducing the possibility of reverse causation. conclusions: our study found that a dietary pattern characterized as higher intake of red and processed meat, peas, legumes and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains was associated with higher inflammatory markers and accelerated cognitive decline at older ages. this supports the case for further research.

atopic_dermatitis	despite the widely accepted concept that probiotics confer miscellaneous benefits to hosts, the controversies surrounding these health-promoting claims cannot be ignored. these controversies hinder development and innovation in this field. to clarify the effects of age and gender on probiotic-induced immune responses, we recruited 1613 taiwanese individuals and calculated the ratio of ifn-gamma to il-10 production after each individual 's pbmcs were stimulated by six probiotic strains (l. paracasei brap01, l. acidophilus ad300, b. longum ba100, e. faecium br0085, l. rhamnosus ad500 and l. reuteri br101). our results indicated that gender and age have only minor effects on the immune modulation of probiotics. additionally, we showed that l. paracasei brap01 and l. acidophilus ad300 are the two dominant strains inducing ifn-gamma/il-10 production in taiwanese individuals and that l. reuteri br101 was the most effective stimulator of il-10/ifn-gamma. additionally, a significant inverse relationship between the ability of l. paracasei brap01 and l. rhamnosus ad500 to stimulate ifn-gamma/il-10 or il-10/ifn-gamma production was also observed. our results indicated that age and gender have only minor effects on the immune modulation abilities of probiotics.
migraine	heterozygous and rare homozygous mutations in proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (prrt2) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia episodic ataxia and migraine. most of the mutations lead to impaired prrt2 expression and/or function. recently, an important role for prtt2 in the neurotransmitter release machinery, brain development and synapse formation has been uncovered. in this work, we have characterized the phenotype of a mouse in which the prrt2 gene has been constitutively inactivated (prrt2 ko)beta-galactosidase staining allowed to map the regional expression of prrt2 that was more intense in the cerebellum, hindbrain and spinal cord, while it was localized to restricted areas in the fore-brain. prrt2 ko mice are normal at birth, but display paroxysmal movements at the onset of locomotion that persist in the adulthood. in addition, adult prrt2 ko mice present abnormal motor behaviors characterized by wild running and jumping in response to audiogenic stimuli that are ineffective in wild type mice and an increased sensitivity to the convulsive effects of pentylentetrazol. patch-clamp electrophysiology in hippocampal and cerebellar slices revealed specific effects in the cerebellum, where prrt2 is highly expressed, consisting in a higher excitatory strength at parallel fiber-purkinje cell synapses during high frequency stimulation. the results show that the prrt2 ko mouse reproduces the motor paroxysms present in the human prrt2-linked pathology and can be proposed as an experimental model for the study of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as for testing personalized therapeutic approaches.

asthma	the purpose of this study was to examine youth perceptions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) communication with their pediatric providers, their reported adherence to their adhd medications, and their desired location for an adhd educational program. youth ages 7 through 17 with an adhd diagnosis were recruited. a research associate interviewed the youth. parents completed demographic questionnaires. seventy families participated. one-third of the youth wanted more discussion about adhd with their providers during visits. the average youth had over eight questions about adhd and its treatment. most youth wanted to learn about adhd at their provider 's office. non-white and older youth were significantly more likely to be less adherent to their adhd medications. youth want their providers to engage them more during visits. providers should take advantage of this interest to engage youth more in discussions regarding adhd and its treatment during pediatric adhd visits.
atrial_fibrillation	objective the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence and degree of spontaneous echo contrast (sec) in the left atrium and of left atrial appendage (laa) contractility before and after cardioversion (cv) in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (af). methods our study included 56 patients divided into two groups: group 1, comprising 32 clinically stable patients who were admitted to the emergency department with less than or equal to 48 h duration af, and who underwent transoesophageal echocardiography (tee)-guided cv; and the control group (group 2), comprising 24 patients admitted to the cardiological department for elective tee-guided cv of greater than 48 h af. all patients underwent repeat tee within 1 h after successful cv. results patients with recent-onset af (group 1) showed no thrombogenic milieu at baseline without any evidence of atrial stunning after successful cv. sec mean grade (0-3 grading) was 0.09 +/- 0.3 versus 0.12 +/- 0.4 after cv (p=0.98), and laa flow velocity was 60.7 +/- 19.4 versus 56.7 +/- 20.5 cm/s after cv (p=0.07). group 2 patients showed a significantly higher degree of sec compared with those in group 1 (0.09 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.7, p=0.0093) and significantly lower laa flow velocities (60.7 +/- 19.4 vs. 32.5 +/- 12.4, p<0.0001), with significant worsening after successful cv (sec degree: 0.66 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.37 +/- 0.9, p=0.0093; laa flow velocity: 32.5 +/- 12.4 vs. 20.4 +/- 12.7 cm/s, p<0.0001). conclusion the absence of thrombogenic milieu and of left atrial stunning after cv in patients with recent-onset af favours early cv without anticoagulation, at least in patients with a low thromboembolic risk profile. these patients could be discharged earlier from urgent care. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
atrial_fibrillation	background: atrial fibrillation (af) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including thromboembolic events. the aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of left atrial appendage (laa) thrombi in japanese non-valvular atrial fibrillation (nvaf) patients undergoing preprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (tee) during anticoagulation therapy, and to compare the efficacy of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (doac). methods and results: this retrospective study reviewed records of 559 consecutive nvaf patients (445 men; age, 62 +/- 11 years) undergoing preprocedural tee following at least 3 weeks of anticoagulation therapy. of these, 275 patients had non-paroxysmal af (49%). laa thrombus was observed in 15 patients (2.7%). the prevalence of laa thrombi was similar between the doac group (2.6%) and the warfarin group (2.8%, p=0.86). no patients with cha(2)ds(2)-vasc score=0, or paroxysmal af without prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, had laa thrombi. on univariate analysis, non-paroxysmal af, structural heart disease, antiplatelet therapy, larger left atrium, higher brain natriuretic peptide (bnp), reduced laa flow, and higher cha(2)ds(2)-vasc score were all associated with laa thrombi. on multivariate analysis, bnp >= 173pg/ml remained the only independent predictor of laa thrombi. conclusions: laa thrombi were found in 2.7% of japanese nvaf patients scheduled for procedures despite ongoing oral anticoagulation therapy. incidence of thrombi was similar for patients on doac and on warfarin.
psoriatic_arthritis	psoriasis treatments range from topical treatments and phototherapy to oral systemic medications and injections. despite good control of the disease when applying appropriate treatments (according to disease severity, insurance parameters, patient preference, and patients' ability to adhere), continued advancements will allow even better symptomatic control, reduced adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. this review aims to assess traditional and new psoriasis treatments and how to apply them in clinical practice. a literature review on psoriasis treatments and clinical applications was performed using pubmed. mild-to-moderate psoriasis treatments include topicals, localized phototherapy, and newer therapies combining two types of topicals, phototherapy with topicals, and easy-to-use foam and spray vehicles. moderate-to-severe psoriasis therapies include monotherapy or various combinations of generalized phototherapy, oral treatments, and biologic agents, with new oral and biologic agents on the horizon. dermatologists and primary care providers share roles in screening for associated comorbidities (including cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney disease, crohn disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance, depression, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and psoriatic arthritis), managing patients' treatments, and reevaluating treatment needs as new therapies are approved. continued advancements in psoriasis treatment and improvement in coordinated care will allow better overall care of patients with psoriasis.
psoriasis	background: phase ii data suggested that guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, was efficacious in psoriasis. objective: we sought to assess efficacy and safety of guselkumab in moderate to severe psoriasis versus placebo and adalimumab, including interrupted treatment and switching adalimumab nonresponders to guselkumab. methods: patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg (weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; n = 496); placebo ->guselkumab (weeks 0, 4, and 12 then guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20; n = 248); or adalimumab (80 mg week 0, then 40 mg week 1, and every 2 weeks through week 23; n = 248). at week 28, guselkumab 90% or greater improvement in psoriasis area and severity index (pasi) score from baseline (pasi 90) responders were rerandomized to guselkumab or placebo with guselkumab after loss of response. placebo ->guselkumab responders and adalimumab responders received placebo, then guselkumab after loss of response. nonresponders received guselkumab. results: at week 16, more patients receiving guselkumab achieved an investigator global assessment (iga) score 0/1 (cleared/minimal) (84.1% vs 8.5%) and pasi 90 (70.0% vs 2.4%) versus placebo (coprimary end points). guselkumab was superior to adalimumab at week 16 (iga score 0/1, 75% or greater improvement in pasi score from baseline, and pasi 90) and week 24 (iga score 0/1 and 0, pasi 90, 100% improvement in pasi score from baseline) (p < .001). from weeks 28 to 48, better persistence of response was observed in guselkumab maintenance versus withdrawal groups (p < .001). of adalimumab nonresponders who switched to guselkumab, 66.1% achieved pasi 90 at week 48. guselkumab improved patient-reported outcomes. adverse events were comparable among groups. limitations: one-year follow-up limits retreatment data. conclusions: guselkumab is a highly effective, well-tolerated, maintenance therapy, including in adalimumab nonresponders.
migraine	parry-romberg syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a progressive facial hemiatrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, musculature, bone, and cartilage. it is often associated with neurological symptoms such as trigeminal neuropathy, paresthesia of the face, migraine, and seizures and can be paired with ocular problems and ipsilateral progressive body atrophy. here, we present a young woman with progressive facial hemiatrophy, who was referred for fdg-pet/ct. hypometabolism was observed in the left cingulate and postcentral gyrus, left cerebellum, and right basal ganglia. hypometabolism may be observed before anatomical changes and therefore facilitate early diagnosis.
medicare	objectives: to longitudinally evaluate the association of post-icu muscle weakness and associated trajectories of weakness over time with 5-year survival. design: longitudinal prospective cohort study over 5 years of follow-up. setting: thirteen icus in four hospitals in baltimore, md. patients: one hundred fifty-six acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors. interventions: none. measurements and main results: strength was evaluated with standardized manual muscle testing using the medical research council sum score (range, 0-60; higher is better), with post-icu weakness defined as sum score less than 48. muscle strength was assessed at hospital discharge and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after acute respiratory distress syndrome. at discharge, 38% of patients had muscle weakness. every one point increase in sum score at discharge was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [95% ci], 0.96 [0.94-0.98]), with similar findings longitudinally (0.95 [0.93-0.98]). having weakness at discharge was associated with worse 5-year survival (1.75 [1.01-3.03]), but the association was attenuated (1.54 [0.82-2.89]) when evaluated longitudinally over follow-up. persisting and resolving trajectories of muscle weakness, occurring in 50% of patients during follow-up, were associated with worse survival (3.01 [1.12-8.04]; and 3.14 [1.40-7.03], respectively) compared to a trajectory of maintaining no muscle weakness. conclusions: at hospital discharge, greater than one third of acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors had muscle weakness. greater strength at discharge and throughout follow-up was associated with improved 5-year survival. in patients with post icu weakness, both persisting and resolving trajectories were commonly experienced and associated with worse survival during follow-up.
anxiety	understanding the dynamics of mental health of recently resettled refugees is an essential component of any comprehensive resettlement program, yet establishing the components of a successful and acceptable mental health intervention is an elusive task. semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 resettled refugees from five countries who had received treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, or anxiety. themes generated from the interviews emphasized the need for strong group-based social support as well as a focus on practical needs such as acquiring and maintaining employment, language and literacy training, and access to care.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. to evaluate the incidence of new cases of psoriatic arthritis (psa) in patients with plaque psoriasis receiving biologic drugs. methods. a retrospective study was performed on 434 psoriatic patients under biologic treatment, attending the psoriasis care centre of dermatology at the university federico ii of naples from january 2011 to november 2015. as part of the routine clinical practice, assessment of disease activity was made at baseline, and every 3 months. psa diagnosis was performed by a rheumatologist through clinical examination, evaluation of the caspar criteria, laboratory and radiological assessment. results. on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we reviewed and analysed the clinical data of 327 patients with plaque psoriasis. the biologic drugs adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab were prescribed to 116 (35.5%), 88 (27.0%), 27 (8.2%), and 96 (29.3%), respectively. we found that 22 out of 327 patients with plaque psoriasis developed psa during treatment with biologic drugs. in particular, 6 (27.2%) psa patients were under etanercept therapy, 10 (45.4%) under adalimuniab, 4 (18.2%) under ustekinumab and 2 (9.2%) under infliximab. conclusion. the results of this study show that in several psoriasis patients, biologic therapy may not he sufficient to prevent the onset of articular involvement. in most of the verified psa cases, arthritis occurred in concomitance with severe cutaneous involvement.
mental_health	informal care-giving can be a demanding role which has been shown to impact on physical, psychological and social well-being. methodological weaknesses including small sample sizes and subjective measures of mental health have led to inconclusive evidence about the relationship between informal care-giving and mental ill-health. this paper reports on a study carried out in a uk region which investigated the relationship between informal care-giving and mental ill-health. the analysis was conducted by linking three data sets, the northern ireland longitudinal study, the northern ireland enhanced prescribing database and the proximity to service index from the northern ireland statistics and research agency. our analysis used both a subjective measure of mental ill-health, i.e. a question asked in the 2011 census, and an objective measure, whether the respondents had been prescribed antidepressants by a general practitioner between 2010 and 2012. we applied binary logistic multilevel modelling to these two responses to test whether, and for what sub-groups of the population, informal care-giving was related to mental ill-health. the results showed that informal care-giving per se was not related to mental ill-health, although there was a strong relationship between the intensity of the care-giving role and mental ill-health. females under 50, who provided over 19 hours of care, were not employed or worked part-time and who provided care in both 2001 and 2011 were at a statistically significantly elevated risk of mental ill-health. caregivers in remote areas with limited access to shops and services were also at a significantly increased risk as evidenced by prescription rates for antidepressants. with community care policies aimed at supporting people to remain at home, the paper highlights the need for further research in order to target resources appropriately.
atopic_dermatitis	the epidermal-derived ""alarmins"" high-mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) protein and interleukin-33 (il-33) are upregulated in patients with atopic dermatitis. however, their capacity as pro-inflammatory cytokines and their derived effects on skin barrier regulation are poorly elucidated. we investigated the impact of hmgb1 and il-33 on gene transcription, protein expression and epidermal differentiation across 3 distinct keratinocyte in vitro models. primary keratinocytes from healthy donors were used in submerged monolayer cultures, 3d human epidermis equivalents and 3d human skin equivalents. all keratinocyte models underwent 96-h stimulation with hmgb1 (100 mu m) or il-33 (100 ng/ml) using il-4 (50 ng/ml) as positive control of regulation and vehicle as negative control. we found that hmgb1 and il-33 downregulated transcription of several genes from members of the epidermal differentiation complex, including filaggrin. furthermore, hmgb1 downregulated the expression of the encoded proteins in the upper epidermis. finally, il-33 and hmgb1 ultimately led to impaired epidermal growth and maturation. in conclusion, hmgb1 and il-33 could play a significant role in the atopic dermatitis pathophysiology due to negative regulation of structural proteins, stratum corneum formation and epidermal growth.
lymphoma	the purpose of this study was to examine potential effects of reallocating time between sleep, sedentary and active behaviours on fatigue symptoms and quality of life in a sample of non-hodgkin lymphoma survivors. non-hodgkin lymphoma survivors identified from the western australian cancer registry (n = 149) (response rate = 36%; median age = 64 years) wore an actigrapha (r) gt3x+ accelerometer for 7 days and completed the fatigue scale, the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general and the pittsburgh sleep quality index. we used isotemporal substitution methods in linear regression models to examine the potential effects of reallocating time between sleep, sedentary and activity behaviours on fatigue and quality of life. data collection was conducted in western australia in 2013. significant differences were observed for fatigue symptoms when 30 min per day of bouted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (10 min) was reallocated from 30 min per day of sleep (5.7 points, 95% ci = 1.8, 9.7), sedentary time bouts (20 min) (5.7 points, 95% ci = 1.6, 9.7), sedentary time non-bouts (5.1 points, 95% ci = 1.0, 9.3) or light intensity activity (5.5 points, 95% ci = 1.5, 9.5). isotemporal substitution effects of reallocating sedentary time, sleep and light physical activity with bouted physical activity was significantly associated with fatigue, but not quality of life. findings from the present study may aid in the development and delivery of health behaviour interventions that are more likely to influence the health outcome of interest.
stress_management	the study examined whether a behavior-change intervention focusing on self-regulatory strategies and emphasizing role model support increases physical activity (pa) among insufficiently active (not meeting pa guidelines of 150min/week) cancer patients. ambulatory cancer patients [n=72; 54% female; m=56years, sd=12.34; most with breast or colon cancer (34, 15%)] were enrolled in the motivaction-study, a 4-week intervention (1-hr counseling, followed by weekly phone calls), with pretest (t1), posttest (t2) and a 10-week follow-up (t3). participants were randomized to either an exercise or to a stress management intervention (active control). the exercise intervention emphasized self-regulatory strategies (e.g. action- and coping planning and self-monitoring); patients were also encouraged to contact a physically active same-sex role model as a potential exercise partner. the active control condition consisted of coping and relaxation techniques. sixty-seven patients remained in the study and completed the squash assessment of pa and a measure of perceived stress. pa was validated by actigraph accelerometry. at t2, 46% of the patients in the exercise group and 19% of stress management patients increased their activity levels to meet pa guidelines (>150min/week; (2)(1)=5.51, p=.019). at t3, participants in the exercise intervention maintained their exercise level (46%), but also 31% of the stress management patients met the guidelines. all patients reported reductions in perceived stress. additional analyses comparing patients in the exercise group by role model contact (63% realized contact) revealed that those who had contact with their role model were significantly more likely to adhere to the recommended guidelines (t2:50%; t3:64%) compared to those who did not have contact with a role model (t2:39%; t3:15%), suggesting the potential of mobilizing role model support to facilitate pa. in sum, cancer patients may not only benefit from an exercise intervention emphasizing self-regulation, but also from stress management, regarding both reducing stress and increasing pa.
crohn's_disease	backgroundthe objective of this systematic review was to systematically investigate whether there is an association between inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and oral health. methodsliterature searches for randomized and non-randomized studies were performed up to january 2017. risk of bias within studies was assessed with the downs and black checklist. across-studies risk of bias was assessed with the grade framework. quantitative synthesis was conducted with random-effects meta-analyses. resultsa total of 9 cross-sectional studies including 1297 patients were included. ibd was associated with increased risk of periodontitis (332 more patients per 1000 patients; 95% confidence interval (ci): 257-388 patients; p<0.001) compared to non-ibd patients. additionally, the decayed-missing-filled-teeth index of ibd patients was significantly worse than non-ibd patients (mean difference: 3.85; 95% ci: 2.36-5.34; p=0.005). patients with ulcerative colitis had considerably worse oral health for most of the assessed factors, while the quality of overall evidence ranged from high to low, due to the observational nature of contributing studies. conclusionsinflammatory bowel disease was associated with significantly higher risk of periodontitis and worse oral health compared to non-ibd patients. however, longitudinal studies are needed in order to establish a causality link between ibd and periodontal disease.
smoking_cessation	background: the estimated number of cigarette smokers in the world is 1.3 billion, expected to rise to 1.7 billion by 2025, with 10 million smokers living in the u.k. smoking is the leading, preventable death-cause worldwide, being responsible for almost 650,000 deaths in the e.u. annually. a combination of pharmacological interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural support is the most effective approach to smoking cessation. however, even the best methods have high relapse rates of approximately 75% within 6 months. electronic (or ""e-"") cigarettes use battery power to disperse a solution that usually contains propylene glycol or glycerine, water, flavouring and nicotine. e-cigarettes have become the most popular smoking cessation aid in england, however, information on their effects on cardiovascular function is limited and contradictory. as e-cigarettes are not solely nicotine-based products, existing research exploring the effects of nicotine on the cardio-vasculature provides only limited information, while their extensive uptake urges the need of evidence to inform the general public, smokers and policy-makers. methods: this is a pragmatic, 3-group, randomised, assessor-blinded, single-centre trial exploring the cardiovascular physiological effects of the use of e-cigarettes (nicotine-free and nicotine-inclusive, assessed separately) combined with behavioural support as a smoking cessation method in comparison to the combination of nrt and behavioural support. the primary outcome will be macro-vascular function, determined by a flow mediated dilatation ultrasound assessment, 6 months following participants' ""quit date"". discussion: participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 days following their self-determined ""quit date"", at intervention end (3 months) and 6 months following their "" quite date"". findings are expected to give an indication of the cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes both in the short-and in the medium-term period, informing the general public, policy holders and researchers, helping to define the future role of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.
osteoporosis	previous studies of posture in parkinson 's disease (pd) patients focused on the pathophysiology of severe deformities, using mainly subjective estimations or goniometric measures. the aim of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with flexed posture in pd and their effects on the course of posture variations. one hundred-ninety patients with definite pd were prospectively evaluated for angles of spinal inclination in upright position, extension, and flexion using a mechanical computer-assisted, hand-held device (spinalmouse). patients underwent clinical examination, including background data and bone mineral density. motor function was evaluated with the updrs, and back pain with the rmdq. physical activity data were collected by self-report. postural measurements were repeated after 10-17 months. angle of upright inclination correlated with age (p = 0.0004), older age at disease onset (p = 0.0085), longer disease duration (p = 0.003), higher updrs motor and posture score (p = 0.0005 and 0.0001), the presence of back-pain (p = 0.0097), and osteoporosis (p = 0.027). there was no correlation between upright angle of inclination and gender, disease type, or side of disease onset. re-evaluation of posture in 124 patients at 13.77 +/- 4.4 months after the initial evaluation showed significant deterioration in forward bending (p < 0.0001) and was significantly associated with disease duration (p = 0.029), worsening of the updrs score (p = 0.016), right-side disease onset (p = 0.032), presence of vertebral fractures (p = 0.049), and the lack of physical activity (p = 0.0327). older age, disease severity and duration, presence of back-pain and osteoporosis are associated with postural abnormalities in pd. physical activity might slow the worsening of postural abnormalities in pd.
smoking_cessation	background: the development of tobacco use treatments that are effective for all smokers is critical to improving clinical and public health. the multiphase optimization strategy (most) uses highly efficient factorial experiments to evaluate multiple intervention components for possible inclusion in an optimized tobacco use treatment. factorial experiments permit analyses of the influence of patient characteristics on main and interaction effects of multiple, relatively discrete, intervention components. this study examined whether person-factor and smoking characteristics moderated the main or interactive effects of intervention components on 26-week self-reported abstinence rates. methods: this fractional factorial experiment evaluated six smoking cessation intervention components among primary care patients (n = 637): prequit nicotine patch vs. none, prequit nicotine gum vs. none, preparation counseling vs. none, intensive cessation in-person counseling vs. minimal, intensive cessation telephone counseling vs. minimal, and 16 vs. 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nrt; nicotine patch + nicotine gum). results: both psychiatric history and smoking heaviness moderated intervention component effects. in comparison with participants with no self-reported history of a psychiatric disorder, those with a positive history showed better response to 16- vs. 8-weeks of combination nrt, but a poorer response to counseling interventions. also, in contrast to light smokers, heavier smokers showed a poorer response to counseling interventions. conclusions: heavy smokers and those with psychiatric histories demonstrated a differential response to intervention components. this research illustrates the use of factorial designs to examine the interactions between person characteristics and relatively discrete intervention components. future research is needed to replicate these findings.

stress_management	the immunosuppressive effects of dexmedetomidine, a highly selective and widely used alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist for sedation, analgesia, and stress management, are investigated in vitro. in the present study, the respiratory burst of human neutrophils separated from venous blood was evaluated with dexmedetomidine treatment after escherichia coli stimulation. the effects of five concentrations of dexmedetomidine (1, 5, 10, 50, 100 mu g/ml) were evaluated by rhodamine in a flow cytometer. the nitric oxide (no) production and nitric oxide synthase (inos) activity were also determined by using commercial kits. the results were compared to the positive control responses (respiratory burst without drug). we found that dexmedetomidine significantly suppressed respiratory burst, no production, and inos activity after stimulation with e. coli, in a dose-dependent manner. the suppressive effects of dexmedetomidine on phagocytic activity of human neutrophils were associated with respiratory burst coupled with no production.
dementia	this paper provides an overview of the evidence on the perspective of health care professionals (hcps) in relation to advance care planning (acp) for people with dementia, residing in long-term care settings. a narrative approach was adopted to provide a comprehensive synthesis of previously published literature in the area. a systematic literature search identified 14 papers for inclusion. following review of the studies four themes were identified for discussion; early integration and planning for palliative care in dementia; hcps ethical and moral concerns regarding acp; communication challenges when interacting with the person with dementia and their families and hcps need for education and training. despite evidence, that hcps recognise the potential benefits of acp, they struggle with its implementation in this setting. greater understanding of dementia and the concept of acp is required to improve consistency in practice. synthesising the existing evidence will allow for further understanding of the key issues, potentially resulting in improved implementation in practice.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: the role of environmental exposures in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (as) remains unclear. in particular, two types of exposures have been suspected to play a role: mechanical stress and infections. the objective of this case-control study was to determine if childhood infections are associated with later development of as. methods: the cases with as were identified through the swedish national outpatient specialised-care register, based on having been given at least one as diagnosis in the register between 2001 and 2010. five controls per case were identified in the swedish population register, matched at the time-point of the index case 's first spondyloarthritis diagnosis on sex, birth year, and county. all cases/controls matched prior to the age of 17 years were excluded, as well as all cases/controls given a diagnosis of reactive arthritis or juvenile arthritis at any time point, or any other diagnosis of a rheumatic disease, psoriasis, iridocyclitis, or inflammatory bowel disease before the time-point of matching. all events of hospitalisation with an infection before the age of 17 years were retrieved from the register, and categorised according to the focus of the infection. odds ratios (ors) and confidence intervals (cis) were determined through conditional logistic regression analyses. results: of the 2453 cases with as and 10,257 controls, 17.4 % of the cases and 16.3 % of the controls had been hospitalised with an infection before the age of 17 years (or 1.08, 95 % ci 0.96-1.22). appendicitis (1.5 % cases; 2.5 % controls; or 0.59, 95 % ci 0.41-0.83), respiratory tract infections (cases 11.2 %; controls 9.2 %; or 1.24, 95 % ci 1.07-1.44) and, in particular, tonsillitis (cases 3.7 %; controls 2.8 %; or 1.31, 95 % ci 1.03-1.67) were associated with as. there were no associations between as and any other type of infection, and the point estimates were similar in several sensitivity analyses. conclusions: childhood appendicitis was associated with a decreased risk, whereas respiratory tract infections were associated with an increased risk for later development of as. these findings support a possible relationship between childhood infections and later development of as, although the study is limited to infections resulting in inpatient care.
autism	the wide range of factors associated with the induction of autism is invariably linked with either inflammation or oxidative stress, and sometimes both. the use of acetaminophen in babies and young children may be much more strongly associated with autism than its use during pregnancy, perhaps because of well-known deficiencies in the metabolic breakdown of pharmaceuticals during early development. thus, one explanation for the increased prevalence of autism is that increased exposure to acetaminophen, exacerbated by inflammation and oxidative stress, is neurotoxic in babies and small children. this view mandates extreme urgency in probing the long-term effects of acetaminophen use in babies and the possibility that many cases of infantile autism may actually be induced by acetaminophen exposure shortly after birth.
healthy_sleep	background: standard replacement therapy for addison 's disease (ad) does not restore a normal circadian rhythm. periods of sub-and supra-physiological cortisol levels experienced by patients with ad likely induce disrupted sleep. given that healthy sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation, the novelty of the current study was to characterise, using objective measures, the relationship between sleep and memory in patients with ad, and to examine the hypothesis that poor sleep is a biological mechanism underlying memory impairment in those patients. methods: we used a within-subjects design. ten patients with ad and 10 matched healthy controls completed standardised neuropsychological tests assessing declarative memory (rey auditory verbal learning test) and procedural memory (finger tapping task) before and after a period of actigraphymeasured sleep, and before and after a period of waking. results: relative to healthy controls, patients with ad experienced disrupted sleep characterised by poorer sleep efficiency and more time spent awake. patients also showed impaired verbal learning and memory relative to healthy controls (p = 0.007). furthermore, whereas healthy controls' declarative memory performance benefited from a period of sleep compared to waking (p = 0.032), patients with ad derived no such benefit from sleep (p = 0.448). regarding the procedural memory task, analyses detected no significant between-group differences (all p 's < 0.065), and neither group showed significant sleep-enhanced performance. conclusions: we demonstrated, using actigraphy and standardized measures of memory performance, an association between sleep disturbances and cognitive deficits in patients with ad. these results suggest that, in patients with ad, the source of memory deficits is, at least to some extent, disrupted sleep patterns that interfere with optimal consolidation of previously-learned declarative information. hence, treating the sleep disturbances that are frequently experienced by patients with ad may improve their cognitive functioning.

stress_management	many college students exhibit unhealthy eating behaviors, consuming large quantities of high-fat foods and few fruits and vegetables. perceived stress has been linked to daily dietary choices among college students; however, this work has been conducted among predominantly white, female populations. the role of perceived stress management in moderating this relationship is unclear. this study investigated the relationship between perceived stress and dietary choices among a diverse sample of male and female college freshmen and assessed whether perceived ability to manage stress moderated this relationship. 613 students from a large, public university completed an online survey which assessed past week consumption of various foods and beverages (e.g. soda, fast food, fruits, vegetables), as well as perceived stress and ability to manage stress. hierarchical linear regression examined the association between perceived stress and past week dietary choices, and the moderating effect of perceived ability to manage stress, controlling for demographic variables. perceived stress was positively associated with past week soda, coffee, energy drink, salty snack, frozen food, and fast food consumption (p < 0.05). perceived stress management moderated the relationship between stress and sweet snack consumption. individuals who reported low ability to manage stress consumed greater amounts. findings indicate greater stress is associated with poor dietary choices among college freshmen. the relationship between stress and sweet snack consumption was exacerbated among those who reported low ability to manage stress. it may be important for college nutrition education programs to focus on the relationship between stress and diet and promote effective stress management techniques.

psoriatic_arthritis	objective. treatment options for psoriatic arthritis (psa) have increased and improved in the past decade; treatment patterns in psa remain poorly understood. understanding current practices would aid in treatment management of patients with psa. methods. this observational study was based on data from the corrona registry of adult patients with psa in north america collected between january 1, 2004, and december 31, 2012. patients were divided among 3 therapy cohorts: tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (tnfi) monotherapy, methotrexate (mtx) monotherapy, and tnfi and mtx combination therapy. patients were further divided among 3 study periods to understand changes over time: 2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2012. data were collected on persistence, discontinuation, restarting, switching, adding/dropping therapy, and dose stretching. results. this study included 520 patients: 190 tnfi monotherapy, 217 mtx monotherapy, and 113 combination therapy; 110 from 2004 to 2006, 192 from 2007 to 2009, and 218 from 2010 to 2012. over time, the proportion of patients initiating tnfi monotherapy decreased, while the proportion initiating combination therapy remained constant. the percentage of patients who were persistent decreased over time across all therapy cohorts, but remained higher in tnfi monotherapy than in other cohorts. duration of persistence decreased over time. patients initiating mtx monotherapy were more likely than their tnfi counterparts to add therapy. conclusion. treatment patterns in patients with psa have changed from 2004 to 2012. physicians are not more likely to initiate tnfi monotherapy, although clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness has increased over this study period, and patients remain more persistent with it.
addiction	amphetamine and other drugs of abuse have both short-term and long-lasting effects on brain function, and drug sensitization paradigms often result in chronic impairments in behavioral flexibility. here we show that acute amphetamine administration temporarily renders rats less sensitive to reward omission, as revealed by a decrease in lose-shift responding during a binary choice task. intracerebral infusions of amphetamine into the ventral striatum did not affect lose-shift responding but did increase impulsive behavior in which rats chose to check both reward feeders before beginning the next trial. in contrast to acute systemic and intracerebral infusions, sensitization through repeated exposure induced long-lasting increased sensitivity to reward omission. these treatments did not affect choices on trials following reward delivery (i.e. win-stay responding), and sensitization increased spine density in the sensorimotor striatum. the dichotomous effects of amphetamine on short-term and long-term loss sensitivity, and the null effect on win-stay responding, are consistent with a shift of behavioral control to the sensorimotor striatum after drug sensitization. these data provide a new demonstration of such a shift in a novel task unrelated to drug administration, and suggests that the dominance of sensorimotor control persists over many hundreds of trials after sensitization. this article is part of a special issue entitled: cognitive flexibility.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	backgroundthe current recommendation for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (ltbi) in solid organ transplant candidates is isoniazid for 9months, but this treatment has the main problem of frequently reaching the posttransplant period. methodsthis is the study of efficacy and safety of a 3-month regimen with isoniazid and rifampicin (3hr) in lung transplant candidates in the reina sofia hospital in cordoba. resultsthree hundred and ninety-eight lung transplant patients were evaluated. ninety-two (24.9%) had ltbi and just 22 received the 3hr treatment. one additional patient was treated because he had a history of previous incomplete treatment for active tb. none of the treated patients developed posttransplant tuberculosis compared to three of the 62 patients with ltbi who were not treated (4.8%). three patients could not conclude the 3hr treatment (13%), but only two had adverse effects (8.7%). conclusionstreatment of ltbi in lung transplant candidates using a short course of 3hr appears to be effective and safe in preventing posttransplant tb in lung transplant recipients.
crohn's_disease	genes, bacteria, and immunity contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. most genetic risk relates to defective sensing of microbes and their metabolites or defective regulation of the host response to the microbiota. because the composition of the microbiota shapes the developing immune system and is determined in early life, the prospect of therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota in adulthood after the onset of disease is questionable. however, the microbiota may be a marker of risk and a modifier of disease activity and a contributor to extraintestinal manifestations and associations in some patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
osteoporosis	background proximal humerus fractures remain challenging to the treating orthopaedist in both their initial diagnosis and classification and in their corresponding management. they account for approximately 5% of all fractures, 1,2 and their incidence is expected to increase secondary to an ageing population and the associated osteoporosis.(3,4,5,6) these fractures are the third most common type of fragility fractures after distal radius and hip fractures in patients aged 65 years and above. materials and methods in our study, 42 patients were treated and followed for a period of 2 years from july 2014 to july 2016 in department of orthopaedics, siddhartha medical college, vijayawada, andhra pradesh. in our study, 42 patients were treated with philos locking plate and their intra and postoperative period followup done for 2 years; outcome of patients, complications studied throughout this period. results in our study, 42 cases treated with locking plates, age incidence most common in 41-50 years age group, more common in males (34 cases), more common on right side (31 cases). in our study, maximum number of cases belong to neer 's 2-part surgical neck of humerus fractures (24 out of 42 cases) followed by fracture dislocations (9 out of 42 cases) and three-part fractures (8 out of 42 cases). mean followup of our study was 18.9 months ranging from 9 months to 24 months. average time for union was 12.5 weeks in our study ranging from 12 weeks to 14 weeks. out of 42 cases we have operated 28 cases within 7 days of injury and 8 cases within 7-14 days and remaining 6 cases after 14 days due to delay in presentation to us. adequate reduction is achieved in 32 cases out of 42 cases. mean neck shaft angle calculated on immediate postoperative radiographs was 136.3 degrees and mean angle after fracture healing was 131.6 degrees. there was a mean 4.7 degrees varus collapse (mean fall of neck shaft angle) from initial fixation to fracture healing in our study. range of motion was affected by increasing age in our study, best range of motion was found in age group of 20-30 years with a mean of 136 degrees forward flexion, 133 degrees abduction, 85 degrees of external rotation and 86 degrees of internal rotation. range of motion reduced with advancing age in our study can be explained by the age related rotator cuff dysfunction. results were evaluated based on the constant murley score and dash shoulder scoring systems. in 86% of cases, there was excellent to good results & fair results in 12% cases. there were two percent poor results in our study. conclusion in our study, we conclude that locking plates minimise the possible complications like screw loosening, screw back-out and varus collapse associated with traditional plates. significant improvement in functional outcome is seen with locking plates due to early mobilisation of shoulder. functional outcome is directly proportional to the reconstruction and functioning of rotator cuff and proper rehabilitation.
autism	background: lego (r) therapy uses children 's natural interest in play to help motivate behavioural change and may be an effective teaching tool to increase social competency and communication skills. although the literature is growing it has not been synthesized. objectives: to review the literature on the role of lego (r) therapy on social skills and inclusion among children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (asd). methods: a scoping review was conducted, involving comprehensive searches of international databases. eligible articles included: (a) youth aged 19 or younger, with asd; (b) empirical research on lego (r) therapy interventions; (c) published from 1996 to 2016 in a peer-reviewed journal, conference proceedings, or dissertation. results: of the 6964 studies identified, 15 articles involving 293 participants, aged 5-16 (mean age 8.7 years), across five countries met the inclusion criteria. although the outcomes of the lego (r) therapy varied across the studies, 14 studies reported at least one improvement in social and communication skills (e.g., building friendships, improved social interactions and social competence), asd-specific behaviors, belonging, family relationships, coping, and reductions in playing alone. conclusions: although lego (r) therapy shows promise as an intervention for children and youth with asd, more rigorously designed studies are needed to fully understand its impact.

children's_health	this is an integrative literature review that analyzed the scientific knowledge produced on the orientation of brazilian basic care services to primary health care focusing on child health. searches were carried out in scielo, lilacs and medline databases using descriptors ""primary health care"", ""family health program"", ""child health"" and ""evaluation of health services"". studies published in portuguese, english and spanish between 2000 and 2013 were selected. a total of 32 studies were chosen and characterized in relation to the features of primary health care, region of the country, type of study and authors' practice area. a thematic review of studies was conducted and resulted in two categories: child care in the context of brazilian primary health care and primary health care features: limitations to child care. it can be understood that brazilian primary health care services are heterogeneous regarding the presence and scope of essential child care characteristics. there is a lack of structural and process changes in the services to substantially plan child care actions in basic care.
osteoporosis	low bone mineral density (bmd) is common in people living with hiv infection (plwh), increasing fracture risk. alcohol use is also common in plwh and is a modifiable risk factor for both hiv disease progression and low bmd. in plwh, alcohol 's effect on bmd is not well understood. we studied adult plwh with substance dependence. we measured lifetime alcohol use (kg) and recent (i.e., past 30-day) alcohol use (categorized as: abstinent, low risk, or high risk). in adjusted multivariable regression analyses, we tested associations between lifetime and recent alcohol use and (i) mean bmd (g/cm(2)) at the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine and (ii) low bmd diagnosis (i. e., osteopenia or osteoporosis). we also examined associations between 2 measures of past alcohol use (i. e., total consumption [kg] and drinking intensity [kg/year]) and bmd outcome measures during 3 periods of the hiv care continuum: (i) period before first positive hiv test, (ii) period from first positive hiv test to antiretroviral therapy (art) initiation, and (iii) period following art initiation. we found no significant associations between lifetime alcohol use and mean femoral neck (beta = 0.000, p=.62), total hip (beta = 0.000, p=.83) or lumbar spine (beta = 0.001, p=.65) bmd (g/cm(2)), or low bmd diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aor]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.95-1.01). there was no significant correlation between past 30-day alcohol use and mean bmd (g/cm(2)). past 30-day alcohol use was associated with low bmd diagnosis (p=.04); compared to abstainers, the aor for high risk alcohol use was 1.94 (95% ci: 0.91-4.12), the aor for low risk alcohol use was 4.32 (95% ci: 1.30-14.33). drinking intensity (kg/year) between first positive hiv test and art initiation was associated with lower mean bmd (g/cm(2)) at the femoral neck (beta = 0.006, p=.04) and total hip (beta = 0.007, p=.02) and increased odds of low bmd (aor=1.18, 95% ci=1.03-1.36). in this sample of plwh, we detected no association between lifetime alcohol use and bmd. however, recent drinking was associated with low bmd diagnosis, as was drinking intensity between first positive hiv test and art initiation. longitudinal studies should confirm these associations.
anxiety	purpose of review the purposes of this study were to examine the relationships between obesity and a wide range of mental health issues and to identify where sex differences exist and may vary across disorders. recent findings research on sex differences in the relationship between obesity and psychiatric disorders is more abundant in some areas, such as depression and eating disorders, than others, such as anxiety, trauma, and substance use. however, for most of the disorders, their relationships with obesity and sex are complex and are usually moderated by additional variables. thus, studies that find stronger relationships for women between depression and obesity cross-sectionally do not tell the whole story, as longitudinal studies suggest that this relationship may also be present among men, particularly when confounders are considered. for those with eating disorders, men and women with obesity are fairly equally affected, and weight and shape concerns may play a role in maintaining these behaviors for both sexes. weight stigma, though, seems to have worse consequences for women than men with obesity. summary sex differences exist in relation to the associations between mental health and obesity. however, these differences vary by disorder, with disorder-specific moderators playing a role, such as age for depressive disorders, comorbid depression for anxiety disorders, and weight and shape concerns for eating disorders. more work is needed to understand if sex differences play a role in the relationship between obesity and anxiety, trauma, and substance use disorders.
digestive_health	fruit and yogurt have been identified individually as indicators of healthy dietary patterns. fruits are relatively low in energy density and are an excellent source of antioxidants and prebiotic fibers and polyphenols, which can promote digestive health. yogurt, on the other hand, is a nutrient-dense food that is a good source of dairy protein, calcium, magnesium, vitamin b-12, conjugated linoleic acid, and other key fatty acids. in addition, it contains beneficial bacterial cultures, making it a potential source of probiotics. yogurt 's unique fermented food matrix provides added health benefits by enhancing nutrient absorption and digestion. combining the intake of yogurt and fruit could provide probiotics, prebiotics, high-quality protein, important fatty acids, and a mixture of vitamins and minerals that have the potential to exert synergistic effects on health. yogurt consumption has been associated with reduced weight gain and a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, whereas fruits have established effects on reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. yogurt and fruits can be eaten together and may exert combined health benefits through potential prebiotic and probiotic effects. furthermore, substituting high-energy, nutrient-deficient snacks with fruit and yogurt could reduce the intake of high-calorie obesogenic foods. in light of the positive cardiometabolic impacts of fruit and yogurt and their association with healthy dietary patterns, there is sufficient evidence to warrant further exploration into the potential synergistic health benefits of a combined intake of fruit and yogurt.
medicare	background: use of chemotherapy near the end of life in patients with metastatic cancer is often ineffective and toxic. data about the factors associated with its use remain scarce, especially in europe. methods: nationwide, register-based study including all hospitalized patients aged >= 20 years who died from metastatic solid tumors in france between 2010 and 2013. results: a total of 279 846 hospitalized patients who died from metastatic cancer were included. during the last month before death, 19.5% received chemotherapy (including 11.3% during the last 2 weeks). female sex (or = 0.96, 95% ci = 0.93-0.98), older age (or = 0.70, 95% ci = 0.69-0.71 for each 10-year increase) and higher number of chronic comorbidities (or = 0.83, 95% ci = 0.82-0.84) were independently associated with lower rates of chemotherapy. although patients with chemosensitive tumors were statistically more likely to receive chemotherapy during the last month before death (or = 1.21, 1.18-1.25), this association was mostly fueled by testis and ovary tumors and we found no obvious pattern between the expected chemosensitivity of different cancers and the rates of chemotherapy use close to death. compared with university hospitals, patients who died in for-profit clinics/hospital (or = 1.40, 95% ci = 1.34-1.45), or comprehensive cancer centers (or = 1.43, 95% ci = 1.36-1.50) were more likely to receive chemotherapy. finally, high-volume centers and hospitals without palliative care units reported greater-than-average rates of chemotherapy near the end of life. conclusion: among hospitalized patients with cancer, young individuals, treated in comprehensive cancer centers or in high-volume centers without palliative care units were the most likely to receive chemotherapy near the end of life. we found no evident pattern between the expected chemosensitivity of different cancers and the probability for patients to receive chemotherapy close to death.
anxiety	objective: research findings have indicated that mothers of children diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses can be at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) symptoms (ptss), with african american mothers being especially vulnerable because of evidence suggesting higher rates of ptsd among both african americans and women. race/ethnicity, past trauma exposure and the interaction of these variables were evaluated as risk factors for ptss, depression, and state and trait anxiety among african american and caucasian mothers of chronically ill children. method: mothers of children (n = 91) diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (i.e., cancer or type-i diabetes mellitus [t1dm]) completed standardized measures and provided a salivary cortisol sample while attending medical appointments for their ill children. results: a mancova revealed that mothers of children diagnosed with t1dm had higher cortisol levels than mothers of children with cancer. there was no racial or ethnic disparity in the risk of ptss among the mothers. conclusion: these findings suggest that mothers of children with t1dm may be vulnerable to stress reactions, as reflected by cortisol, a biological marker. clinicians and researchers might consider illness-specific features when evaluating the risk of stress reactions among mothers of children with life-threatening illnesses.
atrial_fibrillation	aim: to evaluate the prevalence of depression using different measures in patients with schizophrenia and to study the relationship of depression in schizophrenia with cognitive insight and clinical insight, disability and socio-occupational functioning. methods: a total of 136 patients with schizophrenia were evaluated for depression, cognitive insight and socio-occupational functioning. results: of the 136 patients included in the study, one-fourth (n=34; 25%) were found to have depression as per the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (mini). the prevalence of depression as assessed by calgary depression scale for schizophrenia (cdss), hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs) and depressive subscale of positive and negative syndrome scale (panss-d) was 23.5%, 19.9% and 91.9%, respectively. among the different scales, cdss has highest concordance with clinician 's diagnosis. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for cdss was also higher than that noted for hdrs and panss-d. when those with and without depression as per clinician 's diagnosis were compared, those with depression were found to have significantly higher scores on positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) positive and general psychopathology subscales, panss total score, participation restriction as assessed by p-scale and had lower level of functioning as assessed by global assessment of functioning (gaf). no significant difference was noted on negative symptom subscale of panss, clinical insight as assessed on g-12 item of panss, disability as assessed by indian disability evaluation and assessment scale (ideas) and socio-occupational functioning as assessed by social and occupational functioning assessment scale (sofs). in terms of cognitive insight, those with depression had significantly higher score for both the subscales, that is, self-reflective and self-certainty subscales as well as the mean composite index score. conclusion: our results suggest that one-fourth of patients with schizophrenia have depression, compared to hdrs and panss-d, cdss has highest concordance with clinician 's diagnosis of depression and presence of depression is related to cognitive insight.
medicare	objectivesto examine factors associated with isolation precaution use in nursing home (nh) residents with multidrug-resistant organism (mdro) infection. designretrospective, cross-sectional analysis. settingnursing homes with centers for medicare and medicaid services' certification from october 2010 to december 2013. participantselderly, long-stay nh residents with positive mdro infection assessments. measurementsdata were obtained from the minimum data set (mds) 3.0, certification and survey provider enhanced reporting, and area health resource file. multivariable regression with facility fixed effects was conducted. resultsthe sample included 191,816 assessments of residents with mdro infection, of which isolation use was recorded in 12.8%. of the nhs reporting mdro infection in the past year, 31% used isolation at least once among residents with mdro infection. resident characteristics positively associated with isolation use included locomotion (23.6%, p < .001) and eating (17.9%, p < .001) support. isolation use was 14.3% lower in those with mdro history (p < .001). residents in nhs that had received an infection control-related citation in the past year had a greater probability of isolation use (3.4%, p = .02); those in nhs that had received a quality-of-care citation had lower probability of isolation use (-3.3%, p = .03). conclusionthis is the first study to examine the new mds 3.0 isolation and mdro items. isolation was infrequently used, and the proportion of isolated mdro infections varied between facilities. inspection citations were related to isolation use in the following year. further research is needed to determine whether and when isolation should be used to best decrease risk of mdro transmission and improve quality of care.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: fibromyalgia is a prevalent disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain and complex symptoms. this study was conducted to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of low-dose irradiation (ldi) alone or in combination with duloxetine on the reserpine-induced fibromyalgia in rats.methods: fibromyalgia was induced by administration of reserpine (1mg/kg/s.c) for 3 consecutive days. duloxetine (30mg/kg, p.o) was administered 60min before a forced swimming test (fst), and rats were exposed to a single dose of -radiation (0.5gy) 1day before the fst.results: reserpine significantly increased immobility time in the fst, decreased the amount of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine in cerebral cortex. it also increased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and reduced glutathione contents in brain tissue. ldi alone or combined with duloxetine completely antagonized reserpine-induced fibromyalgia as assessed by the measured parameters. one of the most significant findings in this study was that the therapeutic effect of duloxetine was more pronounced by its combination with ldi. a possible mechanism of action of ldi and duloxetine responsible for their therapeutic effect was discussed.conclusion: on the basis of the presented evidences, it could be concluded that ldi alone or combined with duloxetine could be of value in the management of fibromyalgia.
lymphoma	porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) has recently been reported to elicit the unfolded protein response (upr) via activation of the perk/eif2 alpha (rna-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum (er) kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha) pathway. this study attempted to examine which viral protein might be involved in inducing upr and whether this cellular event would lead to apoptosis of the cells expressing the viral protein. by transient expression, we found that both replicase (rep) and capsid (cap) proteins of pcv2 could induce er stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of perk with subsequent activation of the eif2 alpha-atf4 (activating transcription factor 4)-chop (ccaat/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) axis. cap expression, but not rep, significantly reduced antiapoptotic b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) and increased caspase-3 cleavage, possibly due to increased expression of chop. since knockdown of perk by rna interference clearly reduced cap-induced chop expression, caspase-3 cleavage, and apoptotic cell death possibly by partially rescuing bcl-2 expression, we propose that there is connection between cap-induced upr and apoptosis via the perk/eif2 alpha/atf4/chop/bcl-2 pathway. this study, together with our earlier studies, provides insight into the mechanisms underlying pcv2 pathogenesis.
autism	autism is a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease that results from the interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. several studies showed that many of genes that play role in autism are component of signaling networks that regulate growth and synaptic plasticity, play an important role in the etiology of autism. contactin associated-like 2 (cntnap2) gene is a member of the superfamily of synaptic adhesion proteins and encodes a scaffold protein called caspr2 that is involved in the interaction of neuron-glia and clusters k+ channels in myelinated axons. cntnap2 is highly expressed during the nervous system development. in this study the association of rs7794745 cntnap2 gene polymorphism and autism was investigated. two hundred patients with autism and 260 healthy individuals were included in this study. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood cells. genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp). statistical analysis was performed using the software medcalc (12.1). the genotype frequencies of aa, at, tt were 35.3%, 50.7% and 13.8% in controls and these values were 32% and 68% and 0% in patients with autism, respectively (p = 0.0001) (or = 0.01, 95% ci 0.001-0.32). the frequency of a and t alleles were 66%, 34% in patients and 60%, 40% in controls, respectively (p = 0.11). the results of this study showed that there is a significant association between rs7794745 cntnap2 gene polymorphism and autism in the studied population. however, to obtain a definitive conclusion larger studies with more patients and controls are needed to confirm the results.

bipolar_disorder	there is evidence that the human cerebellum is involved not only in motor control but also in other cognitive functions. several studies have shown that language-related activation is lateralized toward the right cerebellar hemisphere in most people, in accordance with leftward cerebral cortical lateralization for language and a general contralaterality of cerebral-cerebellar activations. in terms of behavior, hand use elicits asymmetrical activation in the cerebellum, while hand preference is weakly associated with language lateralization. however, it is not known how, or whether, these functional relations are reflected in anatomy. we investigated volumetric gray matter asymmetries of cerebellar lobules in an mri data set comprising 2226 subjects. we tested these cerebellar asymmetries for associations with handedness, and for correlations with cerebral cortical anatomical asymmetries of regions important for language or hand motor control, as defined by two different automated image analysis methods and brain atlases, and supplemented with extensive visual quality control. no significant associations of cerebellar asymmetries to handedness were found. some significant associations of cerebellar lobular asymmetries to cerebral cortical asymmetries were found, but none of these correlations were greater than 0.14, and they were mostly method-/atlas-dependent. on the basis of this large and highly powered study, we conclude that there is no overt structural manifestation of cerebellar functional lateralization and connectivity, in respect of hand motor control or language laterality.
bipolar_disorder	introduction: the influence of personality traits on suicidal behaviour risk has been well documented. personality traits and suicidal behaviour are partially genetically determined and personality has been described as an endophenotype of suicidal behaviour. the aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between personality traits with suicidal behaviour and selected serotonergic gene polymorphisms. methods: in the study we included 156 patients meeting dsm-iv criteria for bipolar disorder (bp) and 93 healthy controls. the personality dimensions were assessed using the temperament and character inventory (tci). we genotyped two selected polymorphisms of the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (tph1) gene (rs1800532 218a>c and rs1799913 779a>c) and polymorphism in the promoter region of serotonin transporter gene (5-httlpr, rs25531) related to serotoninergic neurotransmission. multiple poisson regression, logistic regression and kruskal-wallis tests were applied. results: we found numerous differences between the bp patients and the control group in terms of their tci dimensions/subdimensions. significant differences were found between patients with, and without, suicidal attempts in fatigability and asthenia (ha4), as well as in harm avoidance (ha). we also found that the interactions between tci subdimensions (the interaction of disordiness (ns4) and spiritual acceptance (st3), disordiness (ns4) and integrated conscience (c5), extravagance (ns3) and resourcefulness (sd3)) were significantly contributing for suicidal behaviour risk. we found association between all studied genetic polymorphisms and several tci dimensions and subdimensions. conclusion: our results confirm that personality traits are partially determined by genes. both personality traits and the interactions between temperament and character traits, may be helpful in predicting suicidal behaviour.
atrial_fibrillation	background: information on an individual 's risk for death following dialysis therapy initiation may inform the decision to initiate maintenance dialysis for older adults. we derived and validated a clinical risk prediction tool for all-cause mortality among older adults during the first 6 months of maintenance dialysis treatment. study design: prediction model using retrospective administrative and clinical data. setting & participants: we linked administrative and clinical data to define a cohort of 2,199 older adults (age >= 65 years) in alberta, canada, who initiated maintenance dialysis therapy (excluding acute kidney injury) in may 2003 to march 2012. candidate predictors: demographics, laboratory data, comorbid conditions, and measures of health system use. outcomes: all-cause mortality within 6 months of dialysis therapy initiation. analytical approach: predicted mortality by logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation. results: 375 (17.1%) older adults died within 6 months. we developed a 19-point risk score for 6-month mortality that included age 80 years or older (2 points), glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 14.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (1 point) or >= 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (3 points), atrial fibrillation (2 points), lymphoma (5 points), congestive heart failure (2 points), hospitalization in the prior 6 months (2 points), and metastatic cancer (3 points). model discrimination (c statistic = 0.72) and calibration (hosmer-lemeshow chi(2) = 10.36; p = 0.2) were reasonable. as examples, a score <5 equated to12 predicted that more than half the individuals would die in the first 6 months. limitations: the tool has not been externally validated; thus, generalizability cannot be assessed. conclusions: we used readily available clinical information to derive and internally validate a 7-variable tool to predict early mortality among older adults after dialysis therapy initiation. following successful external validation, the tool may be useful as a clinical decision tool to aid decision making for older adults with kidney failure.

atopic_dermatitis	although second-hand smoke (shs) exposure is associated with asthma, its effect on eczema is unclear. especially, the effect of maternal passive smoking on childhood eczema has rarely been studied. polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), and glutathione s-transferase p1 (gstp1) genes interact with air pollutants and modify allergic disease development. this study aimed to investigate the effect of gene-environment interactions between shs exposure and tnf-alpha/tlr4/gstp1 polymorphisms on childhood eczema. from 2005 to 2006, 3,639 children aged 7 or 8 years were enrolled and followed up 2 years later. details of shs exposure and eczema were collected by questionnaires. tnf-alpha (rs1800629), tlr4 (rs1927911), and gstp1 (rs1695) genotypes were determined. maternal passive smoking during pregnancy was associated with increased prevalence of eczema diagnosis ever (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 1.50, 95% confidence intervals [ci] 1.25-1.79), and eczema symptoms in the past 12 months (aor 1.23, 95% ci 1.01-1.50). persistent shs exposure (from the prenatal period to the present) was associated with increased prevalence of eczema diagnosis ever (aor 1.40, 95% ci 1.19-1.66). maternal passive smoking during pregnancy and persistent shs exposure were associated with increased risk of new eczema diagnosis in children with tnf-alpha aa or ag (aor 2.83, 95% ci 1.11-7.23 for maternal passive smoking during pregnancy; aor 3.65, 95% ci 1.29-10.29 for persistent shs exposure), tlr4 cc (aor 3.02, 95% ci 1.38-6.63 for maternal passive smoking during pregnancy; aor 2.31, 95% ci 1.01-5.28 for persistent shs exposure), and gstp1 ag or gg (aor 2.58, 95% ci 1.23-5.42 for maternal passive smoking during pregnancy; aor 3.04, 95% ci 1.32-7.01 for persistent shs exposure) genotypes. interactions between shs and tnf-alpha/tlr4/gstp1 polymorphisms may affect childhood eczema development. reducing shs exposure from the prenatal period may prevent childhood eczema in susceptible populations.
atopic_dermatitis	the janus kinase-inhibitor oclacitinib is licensed for the control of pruritus associated with allergic skin diseases in dogs. strikingly, it has been clinically reported that abrupt withdrawal of oclacitinib leads to a rebound pruritus in dogs. therefore, the primary objective of this study was to mimic the rebound phenomenon of oclacitinib using a chronic pruritic mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis. chronic allergic contact dermatitis was induced by repetitive toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (tdi) challenge in balb/c mice. oclacitinib was orally administered twice daily at 45 mg/kg for 7 days, with concurrent tdi challenge, and then treatment of oclacitinib was abruptly discontinued. scratching bouts following tdi challenge were evaluated to day 15. additionally, dorsal root ganglia (drg) and affected skin were isolated from mice receiving oclacitinib and from mice 24 h after oclacitinib withdrawal and were used to determine pruritogen induced ca2+ signals in sensory neurons, the number of activated dendritic cells (dcs) within drg, and the cytokine profiles of affected skin. mice treated with oclacitinib showed a significant decrease in scratching bouts during treatment, then following abrupt withdrawal scratching bouts were significantly increased. furthermore, following abrupt withdrawal more drg neurons were activated by pruritogenic cytokines, tnf alpha positive dcs were significantly increased, and affected skin revealed a significant increase of tnf alpha and tslp. in conclusion, while oclacitinib significantly reduced itch during treatment the abrupt withdrawal led to a rapid rebound phenomenon which can be explained by an increase in pruritogenic cytokines and fast peripheral sensitization.
smoking_cessation	purpose. a pharmacist 's role in providing care to transgender and gender nonconforming (tgnc) patients within a medical home model of care is described. summary. a comprehensive transgender services clinic was established in february 2015 in new mexico. clinic services are provided under an ""informed consent"" model of care, as opposed to the traditional ""gate-keeper"" approach. the clinic 's interprofessional team consists of a clinical pharmacist, a psychiatrist, a nurse practitioner, an endocrinologist, a diabetes educator, a massage therapist, a nurse, a nutritionist, and medical assistants. the clinical pharmacist has served in the following roles: (1) assessing health literacy and tailoring the consent process to the patient 's literacy level, (2) initiating in-depth discussion of the medical risks and benefits of cross-sex hormone therapy (ht), as well as ht alternatives, (3) discussing typical timelines for physical outcomes of ht, (4) discussing a patient 's expectations and goals for csht, (5) discussing the different ht formulations and helping to determine which formulation is best suited to meeting patient 's goals, (6) helping the team obtain prior authorizations for csht, and (7) managing risk reduction strategies such as smoking cessation and weight loss. involvement of a pharmacist in the clinic has improved care access and quality for tgnc patients in the southwestern united states. conclusion. a pharmacist in an interprofessional team staffing a clinic for tgnc people has assumed multiple responsibilities and helped improve patient care.
psoriasis	pityriasis rubra pilaris (prp) and plaque psoriasis (pp) are two distinctive erythemato-squamous skin diseases that often have to be differentiated from each other and from other similar dermatoses. dermoscopy has been proven to aid the clinical diagnosis of several inflammatory disorders, minimizing the need for skin biopsy. our aim was to determine the dermoscopic patterns of prp compared to pp and to assess the significance of certain dermoscopic criteria in the diagnosis of prp. this case-control study included 11 patients with biopsy proven prp and 25 patients with biopsy proven plaque psoriasis. the most recently developed lesion of each patient was examined by non-contact dermoscopy. whitish keratotic plugs and linear vessels in yellowish background are significant dermoscopic features of prp compared to white diffuse scales and dotted vessels in a light red background in pp. in conclusion, prp and pp reveal specific distinguishing dermoscopic patterns that may assist in their clinical diagnosis and may also be useful for the differential diagnosis from other resembling dermatoses.
medicare	background: early-stage lung cancer represents a key focus of numerous multicenter clinical trials, but common exclusion criteria such as a prior cancer diagnosis may limit enrollment. we examined the prevalence and prognostic impact of a prior cancer diagnosis among patients with early-stage lung cancer. methods: we identified patients465 years of age with early-stage lung cancer diagnosed 1996-2009 in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-medicare linked database. prior cancers were characterized by type, stage, and timing with respect to the lung cancer diagnosis. all-cause and lung cancer specific-survival rates were compared between patients with and without prior cancer using cox regression analyses and propensity scores. results: among 42,910 patients with early-stage lung cancer, one-fifth (21%) had a prior cancer. the most common prior cancers were prostate (21%), breast (18%), gastrointestinal (17%), and other genitourinary (15%). most prior cancers were localized, and 61% were diagnosed within 5 years of the lung cancer diagnosis. there was no difference in all-cause survival between patients with and without prior cancer (hazard ratio [hr] 1.01; p = 0.52). lung cancer specific survival was improved among patients with prior cancer (hr 0.79; p < 0.001). conclusions: a prior cancer history may exclude a substantial proportion of patients with early-stage lung cancer from enrollment in clinical trials. without adverse effect on clinical outcomes, inclusion of patients age 465 years with prior cancer in clinical trials should be considered to improve study accrual, completion rates, and generalizability.
healthy_sleep	objective: investigate the relationships between pain, stress, social support, and sleep disturbance among a diverse sample of hiv-positive adults. method: participants (n = 146) completed self-report measures on pain, stress, social support, and sleep disturbance. cd4 t-cell count was obtained from medical records. results: greater pain and stress were associated with greater sleep disturbance. greater assistance from friends was associated with greater sleep disturbance, whereas greater understanding from friends regarding participants' hiv-related stress was associated with less sleep disturbance. conclusion: as expected, pain was significantly associated with sleep disturbance. additionally, psychosocial variables were strongly associated with sleep. the type of support from friends differentiated whether the support was positively or negatively associated with sleep problems. social support, depending on the type, may not always be helpful for adults living with hiv/aids. future studies need to examine factors that may mediate the relationship between psychosocial constructs and healthy sleep.

healthy_sleep	objective: the purpose of this study was to examine the associations among parental knowledge and beliefs about healthy sleep, sleep practices, and insufficient sleep in a pediatric primary care clinic sample. methods: a convenience sample of caregivers of patients between 3 months and 12 years attending a hospital-based pediatric primary care clinic in an academic center completed a brief survey on (1) child sleep habits, (2) basic sleep knowledge, and (3) beliefs and attitudes regarding sleep as a health behavior. results: of the 184 analyzable surveys (response rate 72%; mean age of index child 4.0 +/- 3.2 years), 42% of children did not have a consistent bedtime, 43% had a bedtime later than 9 pm, 76% had a television in the bedroom, 69% frequently fell asleep with an adult present, and 18% had daily caffeine intake. although 76% of parents underestimated their child 's sleep needs compared to recommended amounts, just 8% reported that their child was not getting adequate sleep. more than half of parents believed that inadequate sleep increases the risk of being underweight and endorsed snoring as a sign of healthy sleep. an increased level of sleep knowledge was associated with a number of positive sleep practices and inversely correlated with sleep duration. conclusion: the results of this study document the need for increased targeted caregiver education regarding healthy sleep practices, the importance of adequate sleep, the impact of insufficient sleep on health, and recognition of potential signs of sleep problems in young children, especially in high-risk populations.
osteoporosis	osteoporosis interventions targeting older australians and clinicians were conducted in 2008 and 2011 as part of a national quality improvement program underpinned by behavioural theory and stakeholder engagement. uptake of bone mineral density (bmd) tests among targeted men and women increased after both interventions and sustained increases in osteoporosis treatment were observed among men targeted in 2008. purpose educational interventions incorporating patient-specific prescriber feedback have improved osteoporosis screening and treatment among at-risk patients in clinical trials but have not been evaluated nationally. this study assessed uptake of bmd testing and osteoporosis medicines following two national australian quality improvement initiatives targeting women (70-79 years) and men (75-85 years) at risk of osteoporosis. methods administrative health claims data were used to determine monthly rates of bmd testing and initiation of osteoporosis medicines in the 9-months post-intervention among targeted men and women compared to older cohorts of men and women. log binomial regression models were used to assess differences between groups. results in 2008 91,794 patients were targeted and 52,427 were targeted in 2011. there was a twofold increase in bmd testing after each intervention among targeted patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). initiation of osteoporosis medicines increased by 21% among men targeted in 2008 and 34% among men targeted in 2011 compared to older controls (p < 0.01). initiation of osteoporosis medicines among targeted women was similar to the older controls. conclusion programs underpinned by behavioural theory and stakeholder engagement that target both primary care clinicians and patients can improve osteoporosis screening and management at the national level.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: radiographic sacroiliitis is the hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis (as), and detection of acute sacroiliitis is pivotal for early diagnosis of as. although radiographic sacroiliitis is a distinguishing feature of as, sacroiliitis can be seen in a variety of other disease entities. case presentation: we present an interesting case of sacroiliitis in a patient with paget disease; the patient presented with inflammatory back pain which was treated with bisphosphonate. this case demonstrates comorbidity with paget disease and possible ankylosing spondylitis. we also present a review of the literature for other cases of paget involvement of the sacroiliac joint. conclusions: in addition, we review radiographic changes to the sacroiliac joint in classical ankylosing spondylitis as well as other common diseases. we compare and contrast features of other diseases that mimic sacroiliitis on a pelvic radiograph including paget disease, osteitis condensans ilii, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, infections and sarcoid sacroiliitis. there are some features in the pelvic radiographic findings which help distinguish among mimics, however, one must also rely heavily on extra-pelvic radiographic lesions. in addition to the clinical presentation, various nuances may incline a clinician to the correct diagnosis; rheumatologists should be familiar with the imaging differences among these diseases and classic spondylitis findings.
anxiety	acceptance and intention to use mobile learning is a topic of growing interest in the field of education. although there is a considerable amount of studies investigating mobile learning acceptance, little research exists that investigates the driving factors that influence students' intention to use mobile technologies for assessment purposes. the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the acceptance of mobile-based assessment (mba), the assessment delivered through mobile devices and technologies. the proposed model, mobile-based assessment acceptance model (mbaam) is based on the technology acceptance model (tam). mbaam extends tam in the context of mba by adding to the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, the constructs of facilitating conditions, social influence, mobile device anxiety, personal innovativeness, mobile-self-efficacy, perceived trust, content, cognitive feedback, user interface and perceived ubiquity value and investigates their impact on the behavioral intention to use mba. 145 students from a european senior-level secondary school experienced a series of mobile-based assessments for a three-week period. structured equation modeling was used to analyze quantitative survey data. according to the results, mbaam explains and predicts approximately 47% of the variance of behavioral intention to use mobile-based assessment. the study provides a better understanding towards developing mobile-based assessments that support learners, enhance learning experience and promote learning, taking advantage of the distinguished features that mobile devices may offer. implications are discussed within the wider context of mobile learning acceptance research.

medicare	among end-stage renal disease patients maintained by hemodialysis, anemia has been managed primarily through erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esas) and intravenous (iv) iron. following concerns about the cardiovascular (cv) safety of esas and changes in the reimbursement policies in medicare 's esrd program, the use of iv iron has increased. iv iron supplementation promotes hemoglobin production and reduces esa requirements, yet there exists relatively little evidence on the long-term safety of iron supplementation in hemodialysis patients. labile iron can induce oxidative stress and is also essential in bacterial growth, leading to concerns about iv iron use and risk of cv events and infections in hemodialysis patients. existing randomized controlled trials provide little evidence about safety due to insufficient power and short follow-up; recent observational studies have been inconsistent, but some have associated iron exposure with increased risk of infections and cv events. given the widespread use and potential safety concerns related to iv iron, well-designed large prospective studies are needed to assess to identify optimal strategies for iron administration that maximize its benefits while avoiding potential risks.
osteoarthritis	evidence has been building that the pathologic drive for development of osteoarthritis (oa) involves more than simple mechanical wear and tear. inflammatory mechanisms play an important role in the tissue response to joint injury, and are involved in development of post-traumatic oa. inflammation also appears integral to the progression of oa, whether post-traumatic or spontaneous, contributing to the evolution of joint tissue degradation and remodeling as well as joint pain. both patient-based studies and in vivo models of disease have shed light on a number of inflammatory pathways and mediators that impact various aspects of this disease, both structurally and symptomatically. recent work in this field has implicated inflammatory chemokines in osteoarthritis pathogenesis. expression of multiple chemokines and their receptors is modulated during disease in both patients and animal models. although best known for their effects on leukocyte migration and trafficking within the immune system, chemokines can have a wide variety of effects on both motile and non-motile cell types, impacting proliferation, differentiation, and activation of cellular responses. their role in oa models has also demonstrated diverse effects on disease that exemplify their wide-ranging effects. understanding how these important mediators of inflammation impact joint disease, and whether they can be targeted therapeutically, is actively being investigated by many groups in this field. this narrative review focuses on evidence published within the last 5 years highlighting chemokine-mediated pathways with mechanistic involvement in osteoarthritis and joint tissue repair.

mental_health	this pilot study examined the usability, acceptability, and effectiveness of a free provider resilience (pr) mobile application (app) designed by the national center for telehealth and technology to reduce provider burnout. outpatient mental health providers (n = 30) used the pr app for 1 month. participants rated the pr app on the system usability scale with an overall score of 79.7, which is in the top quartile for usability. results of paired sample t tests on the professional quality of life scale indicated significant decreases on the burnout (t = 3.65, p < .001) and compassion fatigue (t = 4.54, p < .001) subscales. the provider resilience app shows promise in reducing burnout and compassion fatigue in mental health care providers.
atrial_fibrillation	micrornas (mirnas) belong to the family of small non-coding rnas that mediate gene expression by post transcriptional regulation. increasing evidence have demonstrated that mir-133 is enriched in muscle tissues and myogenic cells, and its aberrant expression could induce the occurrence and development of cardiac disorders, such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, etc. in this review, we summarized the regulatory roles of mir-133 in cardiac disorders and the underlying mechanisms, which suggest that mir-133 may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic tool for cardiac disorders.
lymphoma	although gastric tumors have overlapping radiologic appearances, some unusual tumors may present specific imaging features. using multidetector computed tomography (mdct), with water as a negative oral contrast agent and intravenous contrast medium, can provide critical information for the diagnosis of gastric diseases. in addition, mdct can evaluate the involvement of the gastric wall and extragastric extent of the disease, as compared with gastroenteroscopy and double-contrast upper gastrointestinal study. regarding lesion location and size, enhancing and growth patterns, presence of calcification or fat, and involvement of the gastric wall and adjacent structures, ct may provide useful information. in this review article, we review the relevant literature and discuss the ct features and the histopathologic findings of different types of gastric lesions. the lesions are divided into benign (glomus tumors, schwannomas, leiomyomas, and lipomas), malignant (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mucinous carcinomas, lymphomas, and carcinoid tumors), and tumor-like lesions (ectopic pancreas and bezoar). familiarity with imaging appearances and pathologic findings can help physicians make an accurate diagnosis.
autism	prevalence of self-injurious behavior (sib) is as high as 50% among children with autism spectrum disorder (asd). identification of risk factors for the development of sib is critical to early intervention and prevention. however, there is little empirical research utilizing a prospective design to identify early risk factors for sib. the purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioral characteristics predicting sib at age 2 years among 235 infants at high familial risk for asd. logistic regression results indicated that presence of sib or proto-sib and lower developmental functioning at age 12 months significantly predicted sib at 24 months. a pattern of persistent sib over this period was associated with a diagnosis of autism and poorer cognitive and adaptive outcomes.
osteoarthritis	acetabular dysplasia is a known cause of hip osteoarthritis. in addition to abnormal anatomy, changes in kinematics, joint reaction forces (jrfs), and muscle forces could cause tissue damage to the cartilage and labrum, and may contribute to pain and fatigue. the objective of this study was to compare lower extremity joint angles, moments, hip jrfs and muscle forces during gait between patients with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia and healthy controls. marker trajectories and ground reaction forces were measured in 10 dysplasia patients and 10 typically developing control subjects. a musculoskeletal model was scaled in opensim to each subject and subject-specific hip joint centers were determined using reconstructions from ct images. joint kinematics and moments were calculated using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics, respectively. muscle forces and hip jrfs were estimated with static optimization. inter-group differences were tested for statistical significance (p= 0.8). results demonstrated that dysplasia patients had higher medially directed jrfs. joint angles and moments were mostly similar between the groups, but large inter-group effect sizes suggested some restriction in range of motion by patients at the hip and ankle. higher medially-directed jrfs and inter-group differences in hip muscle forces likely stem from lateralization of the hip joint center in dysplastic patients. joint force differences, combined with reductions in range of motion at the hip and ankle may also indicate compensatory strategies by patients with dysplasia to maintain joint stability.

bipolar_disorder	objective: some people with major depressive disorder (mdd) may be at a pre-onset stage for bipolar disorder (bd), where early identification or prevention efforts may be feasible. we aimed to identify rates and characteristics predictive of transition to bd in prospective follow-up studies of people with mdd. methods: using a systematic search strategy, we identified studies with a diagnostic ascertainment of mdd and bd of an adequate standard, and where the minimum length of follow-up was 6 months. we examined the incidence and point prevalence of bd and the pooled odds ratios (or) for baseline predictors. results: from 5554 unique publications, 56 were included. nearly a quarter of adults (22.5%) and adolescents with mdd followed up for a mean length of 12-18 years developed bd, with the greatest risk of transition being in the first 5 years. the meta-analysis identified that transition from mdd to bd was predicted by family history of bd (or = 2.89, 95% ci: 2.01-4.14, n = 7), earlier age of onset of depression (g = -0.33, se = 0.05, n = 6) and presence of psychotic symptoms (or = 4.76, 95% ci: 1.79-12.66, n = 5). conclusions: participants with the identified risk factors merit closer observation and may benefit from prevention efforts, especially if outcomes broader than bd are considered.
bipolar_disorder	objective: previous studies have indicated that suicide rates have significant seasonal variations. there is seasonal discordance between temperature and solar radiation due to the monsoon season in south korea. we investigated the seasonality of suicide and assessed its association with climate variables in south korea. method: suicide rates were obtained from the national statistical office of south korea, and climatic data were obtained from the korea meteorological administration for the period of 1992-2010. we conducted analyses using a generalized additive model (gam). first, we explored the seasonality of suicide and climate variables such as mean temperature, daily temperature range, solar radiation, and relative humidity. next, we identified confounding climate variables associated with suicide rate. to estimate the adjusted effect of solar radiation on the suicide rate, we investigated the confounding variables using a multivariable gam. results: suicide rate showed seasonality with a pattern similar to that of solar radiation. we found that the suicide rate increased 1.008 times when solar radiation increased by 1 mj/m(2) after adjusting for other confounding climate factors (p < 0.001). conclusion: solar radiation has a significant linear relationship with suicide after adjusting for region, other climate variables, and time trends.
atrial_fibrillation	mindfulness is known to decrease anger and aggression. self-compassion is a related and relatively new construct that may predict other clinical outcomes more strongly than does mindfulness. little research has focused on whether self-compassion is related to anger and aggression, and no studies have explored mechanisms of these associations. the current survey study explores whether angry rumination mediates the unique associations between self-compassion and anger and aggression, controlling for trait mindfulness. two hundred and one undergraduates completed questionnaires assessing self-compassion, mindfulness, angry rumination, and recent anger and aggression. supporting our hypotheses, angry rumination mediated the associations between self-compassion-particularly its over-identification subscale-and anger and aggression when controlling for mindfulness. mindfulness did not predict angry rumination, recent anger, or aggression when controlling for self-compassion. furthermore, multiple regression analyses predicting aggression-related variables indicated that angry rumination uniquely predicted over-identification, one of the six self-compassion subscales. these findings suggest that self-compassion, particularly a lack of cognitive and emotion fusion, may be a more proximal predictor of clinical outcomes than mindfulness. implications for current conceptualizations and measures of mindfulness are discussed. self-compassion may be useful for developing clinical interventions targeting anger and aggressive behavior.
digestive_health	the fattening performances, nitrogen excretion and health status of growing rabbits were studied in response to a linear reduction of the digestible fibre (dgf = water-insoluble pectins + hemicelluloses) to crude protein ratio (dfp) in four diets (from 1.01 to 1.55). as the crude protein level was reduced from 17.7% to 13.9% (in diets dfp1 dfp4), the dgf level was increased from 18.5% to 22.1%, without changes to poorly-digestible fibre levels (adf = 19%). a total of 644 rabbits per diet were used in a multi-site study (n = 6). between weaning (28d-37d according to sites) and 49d of age, reduction of the dfp ratio led to a linear decrease in weight gain (-4 g/d between dfp1 and dfp4, p<0.001), associated with a reduced feed intake (-5.7% between dfp1 and dfp4). however, for the whole fattening period, growth and intake did not differ significantly among the diets. over the whole fattening period (35d-70d old), the mean faecal nitrogen output was of 1 g/n per day and per rabbit, and remained similar for the four diets, while the urinary n output was reduced by 55% between dfpi and dfp4 (p<0.001). accordingly, the total n output per rabbit was of 82.4g. 75.5 g, 63.2 g and 57.4g (p<0.001) in animals fed with dfp1-dfp4 diets, respectively. the nitrogen output per kg of live weight of rabbit produced was 52.0 g. 47.9 g, 40.7 g and 36.9 g for dfp1 dfp4, respectively. at the same time, an increase of the dfp ratio of over 1.3 (cp20%) reduced the mortality by diarrhoea for the two highest dfp ratios when compared to the two lowest ratios (5.2% vs. 7.8%, p<0.05), and led to a 40% reduction of the health risk index between weaning and slaughtering (20.0% vs. 12.6% for dfpi and dfp4, respectively, p<0.01). a significant reduction of mortality from rabbit epizootic enteropathy (3 sites) was also observed when the dfp ratio was increased to over 1.3. a reduction of the protein level in favour of a higher digestible-fibre level is therefore a useful feeding strategy which improves the resistance of the growing rabbit to enteropathy, without major impairment of performances, and with a reduced nitrogen output.

lymphoma	backgroundno consensus exists regarding the use of radiotherapy (rt) in conjunction with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (hdc/asct) for patients with relapsed/refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma (hl). the objectives of the current study were to characterize practice patterns and assess the efficacy and toxicity of rt at 2 major transplantation centers. methodseligible patients underwent hdc/asct from 2006 through 2015 using the combination of either carmustine (bcnu), etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (beam) or cyclophosphamide, bcnu, and etoposide (cbv). resultsfor the cohort of 189 patients, the 4-year overall survival rate was 80%, the progression-free survival rate was 67%, and the local control (lc) rate was 68%. rt was used within 4 months of asct for 22 patients (12%) and was given more often for disease that was early stage, primary refractory, or [f-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg)-avid at the time of hdc/asct. disease recurrence occurring after hdc/asct was associated with primary refractory disease and fdg-avidity at the time of hdc/asct. rt was not found to be associated with lc, progression-free survival, or overall survival on univariate analysis. in a model incorporating primary refractory hl and fdg-avid disease at the time of hdc/asct, rt was found to be associated with a decreased risk of local disease recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.3; p=.02). in patients with primary refractory hl and/or fdg-avid disease at the time of hdc/asct, the 4-year lc rate was 81% with rt versus 49% without rt (p=.03). there was one case of common terminology criteria for adverse events grade3 rt-related toxicity (acute grade 3 pancytopenia). conclusionsin patients undergoing asct for relapsed/refractory hl, peritransplantation rt was used more often for disease that was early stage, primary refractory, or fdg-avid after salvage conventional-dose chemotherapy. rt was associated with improved lc of high-risk localized disease and was well tolerated with modern techniques. cancer 2017;123:1363-1371. (c) 2016 american cancer society. in a multi-institutional cohort of patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation for relapsed/refractory hodgkin lymphoma, peritransplantation radiotherapy was used more often for disease that was early stage, primary refractory, or [f-18]fluorodeoxyglucose-avid after salvage conventional-dose chemotherapy. radiotherapy was associated with improved local control of high-risk localized disease and was well tolerated with modern techniques.
atrial_fibrillation	background and purpose the recently developed total cerebral small-vessel disease (csvd) score might appropriately reflect the total burden or severity of csvd. we investigated whether the total csvd score is associated with long-term outcomes during follow-up in patients with acute ischemic stroke. methods in total, 1,096 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging were enrolled. we calculated the total csvd score for each patient after determining the burden of cerebral microbleeds (cmbs), high-grade white-matter hyperintensities (hwhs), high-grade perivascular spaces (hpvss), and asymptomatic lacunar infarctions (alis). we recorded the date and cause of death for all of the patients using data from the korean national statistical office. we compared the long-term mortality rate with the total csvd score using cox proportional-hazards models. results cmbs were found in 26.8% of the subjects (294/1,096), hwhs in 16.4% (180/1,096), hpvss in 19.3% (211/1,096), and alis in 38.0% (416/1,096). after adjusting for age, sex, and variables that were significant atp<0.1 in the univariate analysis, the total csvd score was independently associated with long-term death from all causes [hazard ratio (hr)=1.18 per point, 95% confidence interval (ci)=1.07-1.30], ischemic stroke (hr=1.20 per point, 95% ci=1.01-1.42), and hemorrhagic stroke (hr=2.05 per point, 95% ci=1.303.22), but not with fatal cardiovascular events (hr=1.17 per point, 95% ci=0.82-1.67). conclusions the total csvd score is a potential imaging biomarker for predicting mortality during follow-up in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
atopic_dermatitis	this study investigated the perspective of international patients on individual symptoms of atopic dermatitis (eczema) in determining treatment response. a questionnaire was developed to evaluate the importance of symptoms from the patient 's perspective. patients were asked: ""how important are these features in deciding whether or not a treatment is working?"", and rated symptoms on a 5-point likert scale. patients were approached via harmonising outcome measures for eczema (home) collaborators and self-selected to take part in the on-line survey. patients from 34 countries (n = 1,111) completed the survey; of these, 423 (38.3%) were parents of children with eczema. ten items were rated as being ""quite important"" or ""very important"" by more than 80% of the respondents: itch, pain/soreness, skin feels hot or inflamed, bleeding, involvement of visible or sensitive body sites, cracks, sleep difficulties, amount of body affected, and weeping/oozing. these results may be of use in determining the face validity of scales from a cross-cultural patients' perspective.
atrial_fibrillation	intracardiac leiomyomatosis is a rare complication that occurs when a uterine leiomyoma (fibroid) undergoes vascular invasion and propagates within the inferior vena cava to reach the right atrium. this article describes a case of intracardiac leiomyomatosis in a middle-aged woman, exploring the presentation, diagnosis and surgical management of this condition. in this case the presenting complaints were syncope and atrial fibrillation, illustrating the importance of performing a transthoracic echocardiogram in patients presenting with their first episode of atrial fibrillation. clinicians should consider intracardiac leiomyomatosis when evaluating women with right heart masses, especially those with a history of uterine leiomyomas.
atopic_dermatitis	background: an emerging paradigm holds that resistance to the development of allergic diseases, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, relates to an intact epithelial/epidermal barrier during early childhood. conceivably, the immunologic and genomic footprint of this resistance is preserved in nonatopic, nonallergic adults and is unmasked during exposure to an aeroallergen. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain direct support of the epithelial/epidermal barrier model for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. methods: twenty-three adults allergic to house dust mites (hdms) (m+) and 15 nonsensitive, nonallergic (m-) participants completed 3-hour exposures to aerosolized hdm (dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) powder on 4 consecutive days in an allergen challenge chamber. we analyzed: (1) peripheral blood leukocyte levels and immune responses; and (2) rna sequencing-derived expression profiles of nasal cells, before and after hdm exposure. results: on hdm challenge: (1) onlym+ persons developed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms; and (2) peripheral blood leukocyte levels/responses and gene expression patterns in nasal cells were largely concordant between m+ and m- participants; gross differences in these parameters were not observed at baseline (pre-exposure). two key differences were observed. first, peripheral blood cd4(+) and cd8(+) t-cell activation levels initially decreased in m- participants versus increased in m+ participants. second, in m-compared with m+ participants, genes that promoted epidermal/epithelial barrier function (eg, filament- aggregating protein [filaggrin]) versus inflammation (eg, chemokines) and innate immunity (interferon) were upregulated versus muted, respectively. conclusion: an imprint of resistance to hdm challenge in nonatopic, nonallergic adults was muted t-cell activation in the peripheral blood and inflammatory response in the nasal compartment, coupled with upregulation of genes that promote epidermal/epithelial cell barrier function.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: azathioprine is a commonly prescribed therapy for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (ctd-ild). combination therapy that included azathioprine was recently shown to increase the risk of death and hospitalization in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. whether azathioprine increases the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with fibrotic ctd-ild, including those with ctd-associated usual interstitial pneumonia (uip), remains unknown. methods: a retrospective cohort analysis was performed to determine the combined incidence rate of death, transplant and respiratory hospitalization associated with azathioprine exposure. a fibrotic ctd-ild cohort treated with mycophenolate mofetil served as a comparator group. incidence rates were compared with an incidence rate ratio (irr) generated by negative binomial regression. longitudinal pulmonary function response was then assessed using mixed effects linear regression models. results: fifty-four patients were treated with azathioprine and forty-three with mycophenolate. medication discontinuation due to non-respiratory side effects occurred in 27% and 5% of the azathioprine and mycophenolate cohorts, respectively. the combined incidence rate of adverse outcomes was 0.015 and 0.013 for azathioprine and mycophenolate, respectively (irr 1.23; 95% ci 0.49-3.12; p = 0.66). similar incidence rates were observed among those with ctd-uip (irr 0.83; 95% ci 0.21-3.31; p = 0.79). both groups demonstrated pulmonary function stability over time, with the azathioprine group demonstrating a marginal improvement. conclusions: a significant minority of patients could not tolerate azathioprine due to non-respiratory side effects. of those who did tolerate azathioprine, a similar incidence of adverse outcomes was observed as those treated with mycophenolate. both therapies were associated with stability in pulmonary function.

atrial_fibrillation	approximately 10% of ischemic strokes are associated with atrial fibrillation (af) first diagnosed at the time of stroke. detecting asymptomatic af would provide an opportunity to prevent these strokes by instituting appropriate anticoagulation. the af-screen international collaboration was formed in september 2015 to promote discussion and research about af screening as a strategy to reduce stroke and death and to provide advocacy for implementation of country-specific af screening programs. during 2016, 60 expert members of af-screen, including physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, health economists, and patient advocates, were invited to prepare sections of a draft document. in august 2016, 51 members met in rome to discuss the draft document and consider the key points arising from it using a delphi process. these key points emphasize that screen-detected af found at a single timepoint or by intermittent ecg recordings over 2 weeks is not a benign condition and, with additional stroke factors, carries sufficient risk of stroke to justify consideration of anticoagulation. with regard to the methods of mass screening, handheld ecg devices have the advantage of providing a verifiable ecg trace that guidelines require for af diagnosis and would therefore be preferred as screening tools. certain patient groups, such as those with recent embolic stroke of uncertain source (esus), require more intensive monitoring for af. settings for screening include various venues in both the community and the clinic, but they must be linked to a pathway for appropriate diagnosis and management for screening to be effective. it is recognized that health resources vary widely between countries and health systems, so the setting for af screening should be both country-and health system-specific. based on current knowledge, this white paper provides a strong case for af screening now while recognizing that large randomized outcomes studies would be helpful to strengthen the evidence base.
asthma	background: given the strong environmental influence on both epigenetic marks and allergic asthma in children, the epigenetic alterations in respiratory epithelia might provide insight into allergic asthma. objective: we sought to identify dna methylation and gene expression changes associated with childhood allergic persistent asthma. methods: we compared genomic dna methylation patterns and gene expression in african american children with persistent atopic asthma (n = 36) versus healthy control subjects (n = 36). results were validated in an independent population of asthmatic children (n = 30) by using a shared healthy control population (n = 36) and in an independent population of white adult atopic asthmatic patients (n = 12) and control subjects (n = 12). results: we identified 186 genes with significant methylation changes, differentially methylated regions or differentially methylated probes, after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, batch effects, inflation, and multiple comparisons. genes differentially methylated included those with established roles in asthma and atopy and genes related to extracellular matrix, immunity, cell adhesion, epigenetic regulation, and airflow obstruction. the methylation changes were substantial (median, 9.5%; range, 2.6% to 29.5%). hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes were associated with increased and decreased gene expression, respectively (p < 2.8 x 10(-6) for differentially methylated regions and p < 7.8 x 10(-10) for differentially methylated probes). quantitative analysis in 53 differentially expressed genes demonstrated that 32 (60%) have significant methylation-expression relationships within 5 kb of the gene. ten loci selected based on the relevance to asthma, magnitude of methylation change, and methylation-expression relationships were validated in an independent cohort of children with atopic asthma. sixty-seven of 186 genes also have significant asthma-associated methylation changes in nasal epithelia of adult white asthmatic patients. conclusions: epigenetic marks in respiratory epithelia are associated with allergic asthma and gene expression changes in inner-city children.
hereditary_angioedema	several clinical and biological features of lymphoproliferative diseases have been associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune manifestations. acquired deficiency of c1-inhibitor (c1-inh) (aae) is a rare syndrome clinically similar to hereditary angioedema (hae) characterized by local increase in vascular permeability (angioedema) of the skin and the gastrointestinal and oro-pharyngo-laryngeal mucosa. bradykinin, a potent vasoactive peptide, released from high molecular weight kininogen when it is cleaved by plasma kallikrein (a serine protease controlled by c1-inh), is the mediator of symptoms. in total 46% of aae patients carry an underlying hematological disorder including monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (mgus) or b cell malignancies. however, 74% of aae patients have anti-c1-inh autoantibodies without hematological, clinical or instrumental evidence of lymphoproliferative disease. unlike hae patients, aae patients usually have late-onset symptoms, do not have a family history of angioedema and present variable response to treatment due to the hypercatabolism of c1-inh. experiments show that c1-inh and/or the classical complement pathway were consumed by the neoplastic lymphatic tissues and/or anti-c1-inh neutralizing autoantibodies. therapy of aae follows two directions: 1) prevention/reversal of the symptoms of angioedema; and 2) treatment of the associated disease. different forms of b cell disorders coexist and/or evolve into each other in aae and seem to be dominated by an altered control of b cell proliferation, thus aae represents an example of the strict link between autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation.
smoking_cessation	background: waterpipe tobacco smoking has increased among youth across the globe including in the us, and it continues as a common and traditional form of smoking tobacco in pakistan. a range of behavioral and pharmacological therapies are available to support people in quitting cigarette smoking; however, little evidence exists for the efficacy of these therapies in achieving abstinence among waterpipe tobacco smokers. the objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of varenicline when added to behavioral support for waterpipe tobacco smoking cessation, by measuring biochemically validated continuous abstinence in waterpipe tobacco smokers. methods/design: this is a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in four districts in punjab, pakistan. study participants include adults using a waterpipe (with or without concomitant cigarette, bidi or other forms of tobacco smoking) on a daily basis for at least 6 months and who are willing to quit. we will individually randomize 510 participants to one of the two arms of the trial. participants in the intervention arm will receive varenicline and behavioral support and those in the control arm will receive placebo and behavioral support. the primary outcome will be continuous abstinence for at least 6 months (week 25) which is biochemically verified by a carbon monoxide level of <10 ppm. secondary outcomes will include biochemically verified 7-day point abstinence at 5, 12 and 25 weeks and any lapses and relapses between the different assessment points. tertiary outcomes will include assessment of withdrawal symptoms using the mood and physical symptoms scale (mpss), smoking dependency using the lebanon waterpipe dependency scale (lwds-11) and monitoring adverse outcomes. discussion: this is an efficacy trial and would require a subsequent effectiveness trial for a definitive evaluation of the intervention.
hereditary_angioedema	introduction: the clinical characteristics and icatibant-treatment outcomes of patients with hereditary angioedema with normal c1 inhibitor (hae-nc1 inh) are limited. methods: we retrospectively analyzed data from french hae patients enrolled in the icatibant outcome survey registry (from july 2009 to september 2013) to compare disease characteristics and the effectiveness and safety of acute icatibant-treated angioedema attacks in patients with hae-nc1 inh, hae with c1 inh deficiency (type i), or dysfunction (type ii). results: one center in grenoble contributed 22 patients with hae-nc1 inh and a family history of hae while 15 centers across france contributed 153 patients with hae type i and seven patients with hae type ii. patients with hae-nc1 inh compared to hae type i, respectively, were more likely to be female (88.1% vs. 63.4%), older at median age of disease onset (21 years vs. 15 years), and have a greater rate of abdominal (80% vs. 61%) and laryngeal (23% vs. 14%) attacks. icatibant was effective in both groups though the median time to resolution of attack was significantly longer in the hae-nc1 inh group (20.0h, 37 attacks) versus the hae type i group (14.0h, 67 attacks). icatibant was self-administered for 96.1% of attacks in patients with hae-nc1 inh and 75.8% in patients with hae type i. no serious adverse side effects related to icatibant were reported. conclusions: these data help further define the disease characteristics of hae-nc1 inh in the french population and extend the limited data reporting the safe and effective use of icatibant in acute treatment of angioedema in french patients diagnosed with hae-nc1 inh.
autism	background: boys with autism spectrum disorder (asd) have lower areal bone mineral density (abmd) than typically developing controls (tdc). studies of volumetric bmd (vbmd) and bone microarchitecture provide information about fracture risk beyond that provided by abmd but are currently lacking in asd. objectives: to assess ultradistal radius and distal tibia vbmd, bone microarchitecture and strength estimates in adolescent boys with asd compared to tdc. design/methods: cross-sectional study of 34 boys (16 asd, 18 tdc) that assessed (i) abmd at the whole body (wb), wb less head (wblh), hip and spine using dual x-ray absorptiometry (dxa), (ii) vbmd and bone microarchitecture at the ultradistal radius and distal tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative ct (hrpqct), and (iii) bone strength estimates (stiffness and failure load) using micro-finite element analysis (fea). we controlled for age in all groupwise comparisons of hrpqct and fea measures. activity questionnaires, food records, physical exam, and fasting levels of 25(oh) vitamin d and bone markers (c-terminal collagen crosslinks and n-terminal telopeptide (ctx and ntx) for bone resorption, n-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (p1np) for bone formation) were obtained. results: asd participants were slightly younger than tdc participants (13.6 vs. 14.2 years, p = 0.44). tanner stage, height z-scores and fasting serum bone marker levels did not differ between groups. asd participants had higher bmi z -scores, percent body fat, igf-1 z -scores, and lower lean mass and abmd z -scores than tdc at the wb, wblh, and femoral neck (p < 0.1). at the radius, asd participants had lower trabecular thickness (0.063 vs. 0.070 mm, p = 0.004), compressive stiffness (56.7 vs. 69.7 kn/mm, p = 0.030) and failure load (3.0 vs. 3.7 kn, p = 0.031) than tdc. asd participants also had 61% smaller cortical area (6.6 vs. 16.4 mm(2), p = 0.051) and thickness (0.08 vs. 022 mm, p = 0.054) compared to tdc. at the tibia, asd participants had lower compressive stiffness (183 vs. 210 kn/mm, p = 0.048) and failure load (9.4 vs. 10.8 kn, p = 0.043) and 23% smaller cortical area (60.3 vs. 81.5 mm(2), p = 0.078) compared to tdc. a lower proportion of asd participants were categorized as ""very physically active"" (20% vs. 72%, p = 0.005). differences in physical activity, calcium intake and igf-1 responsiveness may contribute to group differences in stiffness and failure load. conclusion: bone microarchitectural parameters are impaired in asd, with reductions in bone strength estimates (stiffness and failure load) at the ultradistal radius and distal tibia. this may result from lower physical activity and calcium intake, and decreased igf-1 responsiveness.

ankylosing_spondylitis	anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-tnfs) are a class of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriatic arthritis (psa). refractory patients are commonly managed by switching from one anti-tnf to another. to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of anti-tnf cycling in psa patients, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. medline- and embase-indexed english-language publications were systematically searched from 1995 to 2015 for studies assessing real-world effectiveness outcomes of anti-tnf cycling in psa patients. of 1086 citations identified, 18 studies were included; most conducted in europe. six of seven studies testing between lines found significant differences in effectiveness between earlier and subsequent lines of anti-tnf therapy. first-line therapy yielded better results compared with second-line therapy, and significant differences were observed between second- and third-line anti-tnf treatments. in the only study with multivariate regression testing for predictors of response, danish registry patients were less likely to respond (american college of rheumatology 20 % or 50 % response) to a second anti-tnf course if safety, rather than lack of effect, caused them to switch (odds ratio [or] 0.04; p = 0.003 and or 0.05; p = 0.03, respectively). effectiveness of anti-tnfs at second line and later is reported in a small number of real-world studies of psa patients. subsequent treatment lines may be associated with less response in some measures. more research is needed to quantify the effectiveness of sequential anti-tnf lines in this progressive populationaeuroe and to compare these effects with responses to drugs with different mechanisms of action.
medicare	background: to improve patient outcomes, the center for medicare and medicaid services (cms) implemented core measures that outline the initial treatment of the septic patient. these measures include initial blood culture collection prior to antibiotics, adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation, and early administration of broad spectrum antibiotics. we sought to determine if paramedics can initiate the cms sepsis core measure bundle in the prehospital field reliably. methods: this is a retrospective, case series from a 3rd service ems system model in greenville, south carolina between november 17, 2014 and february 20, 2016. an adult prehospital sepsis assessment tool was created using the 2012 surviving sepsis guidelines: 2 of 3 signs of systemic inflammatory response (heart rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature) and a known or suspected source of infection. a sepsis alert was called by paramedics and upon iv access a set of blood cultures and blood for lactate analysis was collected prior to field antibiotic administration. the sepsis alert was compared to serum lactate levels and icd 9 or 10 admitting diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. blood culture contamination, serum lactate, and antibiotic match were determined by in-hospital laboratory analysis. results: a total of 120 trained paramedics called 1,185 sepsis alerts on 56,643 patients (50.3% male, mean age 70). patients with missing discharge diagnosis were eliminated (n = 31). the admitting diagnosis of sepsis overall was 73.5% (848/1154): sepsis 50% (578/1154), severe sepsis 14.6% (169/1154), septic shock 8.9% (101/1154). a total of 946 blood cultures were collected in the prehospital setting, with a 95.04% (899/946) no contamination rate. contamination was found in 4.96% (47/946). a total of 179 (18.9%) of the uncontaminated blood cultures were found to have positive growth with 720 (76.1%) having no growth. ems administered antibiotics matched blood culture positive growth in 72% of patients. the lactate level was greater than 2.2 in 46.9% of patients. no adverse effects were reported after prehospital administration of antibiotics. conclusion: this study demonstrates the successful implementation of an ems-driven cms sepsis core measure bundle in the prehospital setting. paramedics can acquire uncontaminated blood cultures, and safely administer antibiotics prior to hospital arrival among patients who were recognized as sepsis alerts.
asthma	background maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy might affect the developing immune system and subsequent risk of childhood atopic diseases. objective our aim was to examine the associations of maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy with allergic sensitization, allergy and eczema in children until age 10 years. methods this study among 5205 children was performed in a population-based prospective cohort from foetal life onwards. we assessed maternal and paternal psychiatric symptoms (overall, depressive, anxiety) during pregnancy and at 36 months after delivery, and maternal psychiatric symptoms at 2 and 6 months after delivery using the brief symptom inventory. inhalant and food allergic sensitization were measured by skin prick tests, and physician-diagnosed inhalant and food allergy or eczema by questionnaires from birth until age 10 years. we used multivariate logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression or generalized estimating equation models where appropriate. results we observed no association of maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy with allergic sensitization. maternal overall psychiatric, depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of inhalant allergy only (adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.96 (1.44, 2.65), 1.58 (1.25, 1.98) and 1.61 (1.27, 2.03), respectively, per 1-unit increase). maternal overall psychiatric and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of eczema (1.21 (1.05, 1.39) and 1.15 (1.02, 1.29), respectively, per 1-unit increase). effect estimates did not materially change when maternal psychiatric symptoms after delivery, or paternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy and after delivery were taken into account. conclusions and clinical relevance maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy were associated with increased risks of childhood inhalant allergy and eczema, independent of maternal psychiatric symptoms after delivery and of paternal psychiatric symptoms.
anxiety	much research has established a negative association between gender nonconformity and psychological health. less is known however regarding factors that may attenuate the link between gender nonconformity and psychological health. the present study aimed to investigate the association between gender nonconformity and psychological health in a singaporean sample, and to examine trait mindfulness and self-compassion as potential moderators of the association. a community sample of 206 adults was recruited and completed an online survey anonymously. the survey included measures of gender nonconformity, sexual orientation, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being. results showed that gender nonconformity positively and significantly predicted depressive symptoms, and negatively predicted subjective well-being. trait mindfulness moderated the association between gender nonconformity and depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being respectively, with the direction of the moderation effects indicating the role of trait mindfulness as a protective factor against psychological distress. self-compassion moderated the relationship between gender nonconformity and subjective well-being. specifically, the association between gender nonconformity and subjective well-being was positive at high levels of self-compassion, and negative at low levels of self-compassion. while cross-sectional in nature, the findings provide preliminary support for the role of trait mindfulness and self-compassion as potential buffers against negative psychological effects of gender nonconformity.
osteoporosis	subclinical hyperthyroidism is known to be associated with the risk of fractures in elderly people. however, there are few studies assessing whether low normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels affect bone density and geometry. here, we aimed to assess the influence of the tsh level on bone mineral density (bmd) and geometry in elderly euthyroid subjects. this was a cross-sectional cohort study. a total of 343 men and 674 women with euthyroidism were included and analyzed separately. the subjects were divided into tertiles based on the serum tsh level. the bmd and geometry were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and a hip structural analysis program. multiple regression analysis was used to compute the odds ratios of osteoporosis in the lower tsh tertile group and the association between geometry parameters and the tsh level. we found that the femoral neck and total hip bmds were lower in the lower tsh tertile group. in women, the cross-sectional area and cortical thickness of the femur were negatively associated with the tsh level in all three regions (the narrow neck, intertrochanter, and femoral shaft); however, in men, these geometry parameters were significantly associated with the tsh level only in the intertrochanter region. the buckling ratio, a bone geometry parameter representing cortical instability, was significantly higher in the lower tsh tertile group in all three regions in women, but not in men. our results indicated that lower tsh levels in the euthyroid range are related to lower bmd and weaker femoral structure in elderly women.
crohn's_disease	background & aims: crohn 's disease (cd) is a chronic intestinal disorder of unknown etiology involving any section of the gastrointestinal tract often associated with protein-energy malnutrition (pem). increased resting energy expenditure (ree) unmatched by adequate dietary intake is amongst the pathogenetic mechanisms proposed for pem. aim of this study was to evaluate ree in cd patients receiving or not immuno-suppressive therapy as compared to controls. methods: 36 cd patients (22 m and 14 f, age range 18-55 years) clinically stable and without complications since at least 6 month were studied. ree was evaluated by indirect calorimetry and body composition by bia. full biochemistry was performed. patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (g1 = 12 patients) without and group 2 (g2 = 24 patients) with immuno-suppressive therapy. results: the two groups were similar for age, height and bmi whereas significantly differed for weight (g1 vs g2: 56.9 +/- 7.44 vs 623 +/- 8.34 kg), fat free mass (ffm: 40.4 +/- 5.73 vs 48.2 +/- 7.06 kg), fat mass (fm: 17.0 +/- 3.55 vs 13.9 +/- 5.54 kg) and phase angle (pa: 5.6 +/- 1.4 vs 6.5 +/- 1.0 degrees). serum inflammation parameters were significantly higher in g1 than in g2: hs-pcr: 7.76 +/- 14.2 vs 7.16 +/- 13.4 mg/dl; alfa 2 protein: 11.7 +/- 3.69 vs 9.74 +/- 2.08 mg/dl; fibrinogen: 424 +/- 174 vs 334 +/- 118 mg/dl (p < 0.05). ree was higher in g2 vs gl: 1383 +/- 267 vs 1582 +/- 253 kcal/die (p < 0.05) both in men: 1579 +/- 314 vs 1640 203 and women: 1267 +/- 140 vs 1380 +/- 132. nevertheless, when corrected for ffm, ree resulted higher in g1 than g2 (34.8 +/- 4.89 vs 33.0 +/- 4.35 kcal/kg, p < 0.05) group, also higher compared to our, age and sex matched, control population (ree/ffm: 30.9 +/- 4.5 kcal/kg). conclusions: our preliminary results show that ree when adjusted for ffm is increased in clinically stable cd patients and mildly reduced by immunosuppressive therapy possibly through a direct action on inflammation and on body composition characteristics.

children's_health	background: although most clinical guidelines throughout the world indicate that clinicians take two bitewings for detecting caries lesions in primary molars of all children, evidence for this recommendation is essentially based on cross-sectional studies performed in laboratory settings or using convenience samples. the benefits and impact of performing radiographs on diagnosis and treatment decision of caries lesions in primary teeth, mainly considering relevant outcomes for patients, have not been evaluated yet. thus, the aim of this randomized clinical trial will be to evaluate the impact of performing radiographic examination adjunct to the visual inspection for detecting and making treatment decision regarding caries lesions in primary teeth compared with visual inspection performed alone. we will consider different outcomes related to children 's health and welfare. methods/design: to reach this objective, 250 children ages 3 to 6 years who sought dental treatment in our dental school will be randomly allocated in two groups according to the diagnostic strategy used for caries detection: visual inspection performed alone or visual inspection associated to radiographic examination. two trained and calibrated examiners will carry out the examinations and elaborate the treatment decision plan. then, children will be treated and followed up for 2 years, with evaluations after 12 and 24 months after the inclusion of children in the study. children will also return after 6 and 18 months to reinforce the preventive orientations. primary outcome will be the number of dental surfaces in need of dental treatment at the follow-up. secondary outcomes will be the components of the primary outcome separately, as well as, proportion of false-positive results, the oral health-related quality of life, cost-efficacy, cost-adjusted life years, and number of new lesions in the first permanent molars. discussion: our working hypothesis is that radiographic examination would actually exert little influence on patient-centered outcomes, and visual inspection would be enough as diagnostic strategy for caries detection in primary teeth.
atopic_dermatitis	interleukin (il)-13 is a pleiotropic t helper type 2 cytokine frequently associated with asthma and atopic dermatitis. il-13-mediated signalling is initiated by binding to il-13r alpha 1, which then recruits il-4r alpha to form a heterodimeric receptor complex. il-13 also binds to il-13r alpha 2, considered as either a decoy or a key mediator of fibrosis. il-13-neutralising antibodies act by preventing il-13 binding to 1l-13r alpha 1, il-4r alpha and/or il-13r alpha 2. tralokinumab (cat-354) is an il-13-neutralising human igg4 monoclonal antibody that has shown clinical benefit in patients with asthma. to decipher how tralokinumab inhibits the effects of il-13, we determined the structure of tralokinumab fab in complex with human il-13 to 2 a resolution. the structure analysis reveals that tralokinumab prevents il-13 from binding to both il-13r alpha 1 and il-13r alpha 2. this is supported by biochemical ligand receptor interaction assay data. the tralokinumab epitope is mainly composed of residues in helices d and a of il-13. it is mostly light chain complementarity-determining regions that are driving paratope interactions; the variable light complementarity-determining region 2 plays a key role by providing residue contacts for a network of hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge in the core of binding. the key residues within the paratope contributing to binding were identified as asp50, asp51, ser30 and lys31. this study demonstrates that tralokinumab prevents the il-13 pharmacodynamic effect by binding to il-13 helices a and d, thus preventing il-13 from interacting with 1l-13r alpha 1 and il-13r alpha 2.

smoking_cessation	objective-to evaluate longitudinal changes in 6 inflammatory markers that predict cardiovascular disease events among smokers making a quit attempt and to characterize their cross-sectional associations between smoking and smoking heaviness. approach and results-in a longitudinal cohort study of contemporary smokers (n=1652), we evaluated (1) independent associations of smoking heaviness markers (exhaled carbon monoxide, cigarettes/d, pack-years) with inflammatory markers (c-reactive protein, d-dimer, fibrinogen, urinary f-2 isoprostane: creatinine [f-2:cr] ratio, white blood cell [wbc] count, myeloperoxidase) and (2) the effects of smoking cessation and continued smoking on these inflammatory markers after 1 year, among the 888 smokers who made an aided quit attempt as part of a randomized comparative effectiveness trial or standard care. there were strong, independent associations between smoking heaviness markers and the f-2:cr ratio, wbc, and myeloperoxidase (all p-adj<0.001), but not high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, d-dimer, or fibrinogen. participants were mean (sd) 49.6 years old (11.6), 54% women, 34% non-white, and smoked 16.8 cigarettes/d (8.5) for 27.3 pack-years (18.6). after 1 year, the 344 successful abstainers gained more weight (4.0 [6.0] versus 0.4 [5.7] pounds; p<0.001) and had larger increases in insulin resistance scores (p=0.02) than continuing smokers. despite these increases, abstainers had significant decreases in f-2:cr ratio (p<0.001) and wbc counts (p<0.001). changes in other markers were not related to quitting. conclusions-smoking heaviness is associated with increased f-2:cr ratio, myeloperoxidase, and wbc counts. cessation improves the f-2:cr ratio and wbc counts independent of weight change, suggesting reduced inflammation related to less oxidant stress.
autism	recent research has demonstrated that some participants prefer to complete a larger series of responses in exchange for a longer duration of reinforcer access, rather than completing fewer tasks associated with smaller, but more frequent, reinforcer access. this review provides a summary of this line of research, examines variables contributing to participant preference and performance under different response-reinforcer arrangements, and discusses limitations and areas for future research.
digestive_health	the effects of the feeding system (ad libitum vs. restricted) and the restriction programs (daily vs. weekly base) were evaluated on 300 commercial crossbred rabbits housed individually from weaning (37 d) until slaughter (at 73 d and 80 d of age). during the first three weeks, restricted rabbits received from 85% to 100% of the ad libitum intake according to two feeding curves with daily (+4 g/d; d group) or weekly increments (+22 g/week on average; w group). in the restriction period, the feeding system affected cttad of crude protein (+2.4% in restricted compared ad libitum rabbits; p < 0.01). after restriction, dry matter (p=0.10), ether extract (p=0.03) and adf (p=0.05) mad were lower in previously restricted rabbits compared to those always fed ad libitum. during the first period, feed restriction reduced daily weight gain (-7.5%; p < 0.01), feed intake (-7.1%; p < 0.001), empty body lipid (-12.7%; p=0.03) and energy (-5.2%; p<0.01) contents compared to ad libitum feeding. in the second period, previously restricted rabbits showed higher daily weight gain (+8.7%; p=0.02), lower feed conversion (-6.0%; p=0.03), besides higher empty body lipid (+16.0%; p<0.01) and energy (+6.6%; p<0.01) contents compared to rabbits fed ad libitum. in the whole trial, feed restriction reduced mortality (20.7% vs. 8.7%; p<0.01) and tended (p < 0.10) to reduce feed intake (142 vs. 139 g/d), feed conversion (3.10 vs. 3.05) as well as n retention (53.6 g vs. 51.9 g). the restriction program had no effects during the restriction period. in the re-feeding period, rabbits submitted to the week-by-week restriction exhibited higher weight gain (p < 0.01) and feed intake (p = 0.02) and lower feed conversion (p=0.01) compared to those restricted on a daily base. in the whole trial, w rabbits showed higher feed consumption (p = 0.04) and n excretion (p = 0.05) than d rabbits. a later slaughter age increased final live weight (+8%; p < 0.001) and feed conversion (+11%; p < 0.001), dressing out percentages, dissectible fat, and hind leg muscle to bone ratio, empty body lipid (+13%; p = 0.02) and energy contents (+4.2%; p=0.03), besides body n retention (+11%) and excretion (+32%) (p < 0.001). in conclusion, regardless from the restriction program, a mild feed restriction (93% of ad libitum) during the first period improved rabbit health status and reduced environmental pollution in the fattening sector without impairing growth performance, slaughter results and carcass traits.

autism	autism is a global phenomenon. yet, there is a dearth of knowledge of how it is understood and its impact in low-income countries. we examined parents' and professionals' understanding of autism in one low-income country, nepal. we conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with parents of autistic and non-autistic children and education and health professionals from urban and rural settings (n=106), asking questions about typical and atypical development and presenting vignettes of children to prompt discussion. overall, parents of typically developing children and professionals had little explicit awareness of autism. they did, however, use some distinctive terms to describe children with autism from children with other developmental conditions. furthermore, most participants felt that environmental factors, including in-utero stressors and birth complications, parenting style and home or school environment were key causes of atypical child development and further called for greater efforts to raise awareness and build community capacity to address autism. this is the first study to show the striking lack of awareness of autism by parents and professionals alike. these results have important implications for future work in nepal aiming both to estimate the prevalence of autism and to enhance support available for autistic children and their families.
medicare	aimsto investigate the possible effects of the food and drug administration (fda) public health notifications in 2008 and 2011 regarding surgical trends in transvaginal mesh (tvm) placement for stress urinary incontinence (sui) and related mesh revision surgery in female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery (fpmrs) practice in tertiary care academic medical centers in the united states. methodssurgical volume for procedures performed primarily by fpmrs surgeons at eight academic institutions across the us was collected using current procedural terminology (cpt) codes for stress urinary incontinence repair and revision surgeries from 2007 to 2013. sas statistical software was used to assess for trends in the data. resultsthere was a decrease in the use of synthetic mesh sling for the treatment of sui at academic tertiary care centers over the past 7 years; however, this was not statistically significant. while the total number of surgical interventions for sui remained stable, there was an increase in the utilization of autologous fascia pubovaginal slings (afpvs). the number of mesh sling revision surgeries, including urethrolysis and removal or revision of slings, increased almost three-fold at these centers. conclusionsthese observed trends suggest a possible effect of the fda public health notifications regarding tvm on surgical practice for sui in academic centers, even though they did not specifically warn against the use of synthetic mesh for this indication. indications for surgery, complications, and outcomes were not evaluated during this retrospective study. however, such data may provide alternative insights into reasons for the observed trends. neurourol. urodynam. 36:1155-1160, 2017.

psoriatic_arthritis	noninvasive techniques for nail imaging would be useful for confirming diagnosis and monitoring treatment response at the microscopic level in patients with nail psoriasis. however, the use of ultrasound and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in nail evaluation is limited. optical coherence tomography (oct) produces high-resolution images of transversal tissue sections and represents an optimal approach to the study of the nail. this study used a multibeam oct instrument to produce speckled variance oct (sv-oct) blood-flow images, which were used to measure the degree of change over successive scans. nail changes, inflammation and response to therapy were evaluated in a 75-year-old female patient with psoriasis who had severe acrodermatitis continua of hallopeau of the hands, treated for 4 weeks with 40mg adalimumab (administered subcutaneously every other week) and 25mg prednisone (administered orally, daily). sv-oct provided a detailed assessment of the nail structures in relation to inflammation of psoriatic tissues. restoration of the normal anatomy of the nail apparatus was apparent following adalimumab treatment; sv-oct evaluation correlated with clinical appearance. sv-oct may have a diagnostic role and provide an objective tool to assess clinical and subclinical inflammation in nail psoriasis.
osteoporosis	chemical and enzymatic barriers in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract hamper the oral delivery of many labile drugs. the gi epithelium also contributes to poor permeability for numerous drugs. drugs with poor aqueous solubility have difficulty dissolving in the gi tract, resulting in low bioavailability. nanomedicine provides an opportunity to improve the delivery efficiency of orally administered drugs. solid lipid nanoparticles (slns) are categorized as a new generation of lipid nanoparticles consisting of a complete solid lipid matrix. slns used for oral administration offer several benefits over conventional formulations, including increased solubility, enhanced stability, improved epithelium permeability and bioavailability, prolonged half-life, tissue targeting, and minimal side effects. the nontoxic excipients and sophisticated material engineering of slns tailor the controllable physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles for gi penetration via mucosal or lymphatic transport. in this review, we highlight the recent progress in the development of slns for disease treatment. recent application of oral slns includes therapies for cancers, central nervous system-related disorders, cardiovascular-related diseases, infection, diabetes, and osteoporosis. in addition to drugs that may be active cargos in slns, some natural compounds with pharmacological activity are also suitable for sln encapsulation to enhance oral bioavailability. in this article, we systematically introduce the concepts and amelioration mechanisms of the nanomedical techniques for drug-and natural compound-loaded slns. copyright (c) 2017, food and drug administration, taiwan. published by elsevier taiwan llc.
smoking_cessation	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a complex disease, with both pulmonary and systemic manifestations. there is an increased risk of serious comorbidity and mortality. although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is most often progressive, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions significantly ameliorate the severity and impact of symptoms, and reduce the frequency of exacerbations. stopping smoking and pulmonary rehabilitation are key interventions. mild symptoms are managed with short-acting inhaled bronchodilators. one or two long-acting bronchodilators are added if symptoms persist. the role of inhaled corticosteroids is being questioned as they may not benefit all patients. optimal therapy includes reviewing patients' inhaler use, and ensuring they have a self-management plan that enables them to promptly start treatment of infection and exacerbations. in future, treatment is likely to combine a multidimensional management approach with tailored treatment and clinical phenotyping.
addiction	alcohol use disorder (aud) is a complex brain disorder with an array of persistent behavioral and neurochemical manifestations. both genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to the development of aud, and recent studies on alcohol exposure and subsequent changes in gene expression suggest the importance of epigenetic mechanisms. in particular, histone modifications and dna methylation have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and associated phenotypes of aud. given the therapeutic potential of epigenetic targets, this review aims to summarize the role of epigenetic regulation in our current understanding of aud by evaluating known epigenetic signatures of brain regions critical to addictive behaviors in both animal and human studies throughout various stages of aud. more specifically, the effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure, tolerance, and postexposure withdrawal on epigenetically induced changes to gene expression and synaptic plasticity within key brain regions and the associated behavioral phenotypes have been discussed. understanding the contribution of epigenetic regulation to crucial signaling pathways may prove vital for future development of novel biomarkers and treatment agents in ameliorating or preventing aud.
bipolar_disorder	the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders is multifactorial, including alterations in the immune system caused by exogenous or endogenous factors. epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that infections during the gestational period represent a risk factor to develop schizophrenia (sz) along lifetime. here, we tested the hypothesis that the antipsychotic paliperidone regulates immune-related brain effects in an experimental model of sz. a well described prenatal immune activation model of sz in mice by maternal injection of the viral mimetic poly(i:c) during pregnancy was used. young-adult offspring animals (60pnd) received paliperidone ip (0.05 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days. one day after last injection, animals were submitted to a cognitive test and brain frontal cortex (fc) samples were obtained for biochemical determinations. the adults showed an activated innate immune receptor tlr-3 signaling pathway, oxidative/nitrosative stress and accumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as nuclear transcription factors (i.e., nf kappa b) and inducible enzymes (i.e., inos) in fc. chronic paliperidone blocked this neuroinflammatory response possibly by the synergic activation and preservation of endogenous antioxidant/anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as nrf2 and ppar gamma pathways, respectively. paliperidone administration also stimulated the alternative polarization of microglia to the m2 anti-inflammatory profile. in addition, paliperidone treatment improved spatial working memory deficits of this sz-like animal model. in conclusion, chronic administration of paliperidone to young-adult mice prenatally exposed to maternal immune (mia) challenge elicits a general preventive antiinflammatory/antioxidant effect at both intracellular and cellular polarization (m1/m2) level in fc, as well as ameliorates specific cognitive deficits.(c) 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
mental_health	the reliability and validity of traditional taxonomies are limited by arbitrary boundaries between psychopathology and normality, often unclear boundaries between disorders, frequent disorder co-occurrence, heterogeneity within disorders, and diagnostic instability. these taxonomies went beyond evidence available on the structure of psychopathology and were shaped by a variety of other considerations, which may explain the aforementioned shortcomings. the hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology (hitop) model has emerged as a research effort to address these problems. it constructs psychopathological syndromes and their components/subtypes based on the observed covariation of symptoms, grouping related symptoms together and thus reducing heterogeneity. it also combines co-occurring syndromes into spectra, thereby mapping out comorbidity. moreover, it characterizes these phenomena dimensionally, which addresses boundary problems and diagnostic instability. here, we review the development of the hitop and the relevant evidence. the new classification already covers most forms of psychopathology. dimensional measures have been developed to assess many of the identified components, syndromes, and spectra. several domains of this model are ready for clinical and research applications. the hitop promises to improve research and clinical practice by addressing the aforementioned shortcomings of traditional nosologies. it also provides an effective way to summarize and convey information on risk factors, etiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology, illness course, and treatment response. this can greatly improve the utility of the diagnosis of mental disorders. the new classification remains a work in progress. however, it is developing rapidly and is poised to advance mental health research and care significantly as the relevant science matures.
bipolar_disorder	background: bipolar disorder (bd) is commonly associated with cognitive and functional impairments even during remission periods, and although a growing number of studies have demonstrated the benefits of psychotherapy as an add-on to pharmacological treatment, its effectiveness appears to be less compelling in severe presentations of the disorder. new interventions have attempted to improve cognitive functioning in bd patients, but results have been mixed. methods: the study consists of a clinical trial comparing a new structured group intervention, called ""cognitivebehavioral rehabilitation,""with treatment as usual (tau) for bipolar patients. the new approach is a combination of cognitive behavioral strategies and cognitive remediation exercises, consisting of 12 weekly group sessions of 90 min each. to be included in the study, patients must be diagnosed with bd type i or ii, aged 18-55 years, in full or partial remission, and have an iq of at least 80. a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, followed by mood, social functioning, and quality of life assessments will occur in three moments: pre and post intervention and 12 months later. the primary outcome of the study is to compare the time, in weeks, that the first full mood episode appears in patients who participated in either group of the study. secondary outcome will include improvement in cognitive functions. discussion: this is the first controlled trial assessing the validity and effectiveness of the new ""cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation""intervention in preventing new mood episodes and improving cognitive and functional impairments.
asthma	nineteen ent-kaurane diterpenes were isolated and identified from the barks of gochnatia decora (kurz) a. l cabrera (compositae), which has been used as an ethnic medicine for treating cough, asthma and wounds in southwestern china. among them, six compounds are previously undescribed ent-kaurenoic acids, and a known compound, 7 beta,15 beta-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid, was obtained for the first time from nature. based on its traditional effects in chinese folk, the potential anti-inflammatory activities of its methanol extracts (me) and isolated diterpenes were evaluated by the tests of the xyleneinduced ear swelling in mice, lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced nitric oxide (no) production in mouse macrophage cellular raw 264.7 and inhibition assay of neutrophil elastase, respectively, resulting that me performed obvious effect against mouse ear swelling with a dose-dependent inhibition in vivo, and nine compounds showed significant inhibition of no production in vitro, with ic50 values ranging from 0.042 to 8.22 mu m, while they also exhibited inhibition of neutrophil elastase at 100 mu m in vitro, speculating that those diterpenes may be the active substances correlated with their traditional efficacy.

bipolar_disorder	objectiveto identify risk factors for suicide attempts (sa) in individuals commencing treatment for a manic or mixed episode. methoda total of 3390 manic or mixed cases with bipolar disorder (bd) type i recruited from 14 european countries were included in a prospective, 2-year observational study. poisson regression models were used to identify individual and treatment factors associated with new sa events. two multivariate models were built, stratified for the presence or absence of prior sa. resultsa total of 302 sa were recorded prospectively; the peak incidence was 0-12 weeks after commencing treatment. in cases with a prior history of sa, risk of sa repetition was associated with younger age of first manic episode (p = 0.03), rapid cycling (p < 0.001), history of alcohol and/or substance use disorder (p < 0.001), number of psychotropic drugs prescribed (p < 0.001) and initiation of an anticonvulsant at study entry (p < 0.001). in cases with no previous sa, the first sa event was associated with rapid cycling (p = 0.02), lifetime history of alcohol use disorder (p = 0.02) and initiation of an anticonvulsant at study entry (p = 0.002). conclusionthe introduction of anticonvulsants for a recent-onset manic or mixed episode may be associated with an increased risk of sa. further bd studies must determine whether this link is causal.
children's_health	background: tobacco smoke exposure increases breathing problems of children. texas children 's health plan is a managed medicaid and children 's health insurance program (chip) managed care provider. the aim of this study is to determine associations among tobacco smoke exposure, asthma prevalence, and asthma health-care utilization. methods: texas children 's health plan conducts an annual survey of members who have a physician visit. questions were added to the survey in march 2010 about asthma and tobacco smoke exposure. survey results for children < 18 years of age were matched to health plan claims data for the 12 months following the date of the physician visit. results: a total of 22,470 parents of unique members/patients from birth to < 18 years of age participated in the survey. more whites than african americans or hispanics report that the child 's mother is a smoker (19.5% vs 9.1% and vs 2.3%, respectively; p < .001). compared with children whose mother does not smoke, parent report of asthma diagnosis and claims for dispensing of short-acting beta agonist medication are greater if the mother is a smoker (adjusted or, 1.20 [95% ci, 1.03-1.40] and 1.24 [95% ci, 1.08-1.42], respectively). in contrast to medicaid, in which there are no out-of-pocket costs, the chip line of business requires copays for ed visits. ed visits are influenced by maternal smoking only in the chip line of business (adjusted or, 4.40; 95% ci, 1.69-11.44). conclusion: maternal smoking increases risk for asthma diagnosis and prescription of asthma quick relief medication. maternal smoking predicted asthma-related ed visits only for the chip line of business.
autism	background: hyperekplexia, is a rare disorder characterized by excessive startle response to acoustic, visual, or other stimuli. it is inherited in autosomal recessive and dominant pattern. objective: to describe the clinical and genetic features of hyperekplexia in jordanian patients. methods: this retrospective study includes all patients with proved genetic diagnosis of hyperekplexia who presented to our clinic at the jordan university hospital from january 2001 through july 2015. results: a total of 16 children from 12 families were included. the total follow up period ranged from one to eleven years. the majority of the patients (13/16 = 81.3%) were initially misdiagnosed as epilepsy. all patients had excessive startle response since birth. tonic-apneic spells occurred in 15/16 = 93.8% patients. fourteen patients (45/16 = 87.5%) received clonazepam. stopping clonazepam by three years of age failed in 11/14 (78.6%) due to reappearance of tonic-apneic spells (8/14 = 57.1%), recurrent falling (10/14 = 71.4%) or due to both reasons (5/14 = 35.7%). delayed motor development occurred in 7/16 (43.8%), speech delay in 4/16 (25.0%), global developmental delay in 1/16 (6.3%), and autism spectrum disorder in 1/16 (6.3%) patient. the mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive in all 12/12 (100%) families. mutations in glra1 gene was present in 9/16 (56.3%); the most common mutation was in p.g254d (4/9; 44.5%). mutations in the glrb gene was present in 4/16 (25.0%) patients and the slc6a5 gene in 3/16 (18.8%) patients. conclusion: the clinical presentation of hyperekplexia in jordanian patients is manifested by tonic-apneic spells in all homozygous patients. the persistence of apneic spells and recurrent falls throughout childhood necessitate continuous treatment and surveillance.

atrial_fibrillation	objective. the objective of our study was to compare the image quality of cardiac ct images of mechanical valves in patients with irregular heart rates (hrs) using absolute-delay multiphase reconstruction versus relative-delay multiphase reconstruction. materials and methods. a total of 26 patients with 40 mechanical valves who had atrial fibrillation during ct were included. the image quality of the ct scans was assessed for the subvalvular and valvular regions on a 4-point scale. the paired t test or wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare image quality scores between the relative-delay and absolute-delay reconstruction techniques. the overall image quality score was determined as the mean of the valvular and subvalvular region scores. results. for valvular regions, the image quality scores were 2.93 +/- 0.73 (mean +/- sd) for the relative-delay reconstruction technique and 3.55 +/- 0.60 for the absolute-delay reconstruction technique (p < 0.0001). for subvalvular regions, the image quality scores were 2.8 +/- 2.80 +/- 0.79 and 3.35 +/- 0.66 for the relative- and absolute-delay reconstructions (p < 0.0001), respectively. the nondiagnostic image quality group consisted of relative-delay reconstruction images of three valves (7.5%); the image quality scores for the absolute-delay reconstruction images of all three valves were improved, and the absolute-delay reconstruction images of the three valves were of diagnostic quality (p < 0.0001). conclusion. absolute-delay multiphase reconstruction can improve ct image quality of mechanical valves in patients with an irregular hr compared with relative-delay reconstruction.
bipolar_disorder	this qualitative study assessed the experiences of assertive community treatment (act) team members regarding the integration of physical and mental health self-management for persons with serious mental illness. three focus groups elicited information from participants concerning barriers, strategies, and recommendations. findings from inductive analyses revealed six overarching themes: (1) collaboration with primary care, (2) improvements in engagement, (3) team-focused roles, (4) education and training, (5) recommendations for system level barriers, and (6) systems collaboration. participant recommendations suggest that act teams are well positioned to integrate mental and physical health treatment, but further research is needed to support integrated care.
rheumatoid_arthritis	c2 fixation is a demanding procedure, particularly in patients with variants of c1-c2 anatomy. the inferior articular process (iap) of the axis can be an alternative for screw placement. we report the results of a ct study of c2 iap anatomy and we present the clinical experience of 28 patients operated with this technique. anatomical study: 50 ct angiographies of the vertebral arteries (va) were used for this study and, therefore, 100 iaps were considered. we measured on the axial and sagittal planes the length, height and width of the facet, the distance between the anterior cortex and the va and the distance between the screw entry point and the va. we also measured the angle between the sagittal plane and the external tangent line of the va. clinical report: 28 patients were treated with c2 iap screws at the spine surgery department of the university hospital in lyon, france, from january 2014 to january 2016. anatomical study: the mean length of c2 iap was 12 +/- 2 mm, the mean distance between the anterior cortical layer and the va was 5.2 +/- 1.4 mm, and the mean angle we found was 0.2a degrees a +/- 5.3a degrees. clinical report: 16 of the 28 patients presented post-traumatic c1-c2 instability, 8 patients presented degenerative disease, 1 patient was treated for pseudoarthrosis, 1 for tumour, 1 for opll and 1 for rheumatoid arthritis. all the screws were correctly positioned and there was no va injury. iap screws can represent a safe alternative option for c2 fixation.
mental_health	on-call work is becoming an increasingly common work pattern, yet the human impacts of this type of work are not well established. given the likelihood of calls to occur outside regular work hours, it is important to consider the potential impact of working on-call on stress physiology and sleep. the aims of this review were to collate and evaluate evidence on the effects of working on-call from home on stress physiology and sleep. a systematic search of ebsco host, embase, web of science, scopus and science direct was conducted. search terms included: on-call, on call, standby, sleep, cortisol, heart rate, adrenaline, noradrenaline, nor-adrenaline, epinephrine, norepinephrine, nor-epinephrine, salivary alpha amylase and alpha amylase. eight studies met the inclusion criteria, with only one study investigating the effect of working on-call from home on stress physiology. all eight studies investigated the effect of working on call from home on sleep. working on-call from home appears to adversely affect sleep quantity, and in most cases, sleep quality. however, studies did not differentiate between night 's on-call from home with and without calls. data examining the effect of working on-call from home on stress physiology were not sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions.

atrial_fibrillation	while the etiology of depression is not fully understood, increasing evidence from animal models suggests a role for the ventral tegmental area (vta) in pathogenesis. in this paper, we investigate the potential role of vta mechanistic target of rapamycin 2 (torc2) signaling in mediating susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress (csds), a well-established mouse model of depression. utilizing genetic and viral knockout of rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of target of rapamycin), a requisite component of torc2, we demonstrate that decreasing rictor-dependent torc2 signaling in catecholaminergic neurons, or within the vta specifically, does not alter susceptibility to csds. opiate abuse and mood disorders are often comorbid, and previous data demonstrate a role for vta torc2 in mediating opiate reward. thus, we also investigated its potential role in mediating changes in opiate reward following csds. catecholaminergic deletion of rictor increases water, sucrose, and morphine intake but not preference in a two-bottle choice assay in stress-naive mice, and these effects are maintained after stress. vta-specific knockout of rictor increases water and sucrose intake after physical csds, but does not alter consummatory behavior in the absence of stress. these findings suggest a novel role for torc2 in mediating stress-induced changes in consummatory behaviors that may contribute to some aspects of mood disorders.

mental_health	child sexual abuse (csa) is a serious public health problem that increases risk for physical and mental health problems across the life course. young adolescents are responsible for a substantial portion of csa offending, yet to our knowledge, no validated prevention programs that target csa perpetration by youth exist. most existing efforts to address csa rely on reactive criminal justice policies or programs that teach children to protect themselves; neither approach is well validated. given the high rates of desistance from sexual offending following a youth 's first csa-related adjudication, it seems plausible that many youth could be prevented from engaging in their first offense. the goal of this article is to examine how school-based universal prevention programs might be used to prevent csa perpetrated by adolescents. we review the literature on risk and protective factors for csa perpetration and identify several promising factors to target in an intervention. we also summarize the literature on programs that have been effective at preventing adolescent dating violence and other serious problem behaviors. finally, we describe a new csa prevention program under development and early evaluation and make recommendations for program design characteristics, including unambiguous messaging, parental involvement, multisession dosage, skills practice, and bystander considerations.
digestive_health	a reliable, accurate noninvasive method for identifying patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) in the primary care setting is needed. a population-based case-finding instrument may assist managed care organizations in identifying candidates for disease management or quality improvement programs. our aim was to develop and validate a gerd case-finding instrument. a 12-item ""gerd screener"" was developed based on literature review and expert opinion with questions about heartburn and regurgitation frequency and severity and medication use, as well demographics and exclusion criteria. categorical and continuous scoring methods with and without medication use were developed a priori. using a telephone interview in a medical group, we identified and enrolled 100 subjects with a history of gerd-like symptoms and 103 controls. each subject completed the gerd screener, a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire, the digestive health symptom index (dhsi), and was evaluated independently by two gastroenterologists using a structured format. agreement by the two physicians that symptoms were consistent with gerd and required an intervention was considered the gold standard. in all, 70 subjects were classified as having gerd and 106 as controls using the gold standard (kappa = 0.73; 95% ci, 0.63-0.82). the scoring method for the screening instrument using a continuous measure of gerd symptoms (frequency and severity) and weighted medication use resulted in an area under roc of 0.89 (95% ci, 0.84-0.94). using a cutoff of >9 points, this measure was 83% sensitive and 83% specific. compared to the gold standard, the dhsi gerd subscale has an area under roc of 0.89 (95% ci, 0.84-0.94). the gerd screener was highly correlated with the dhsi gerd subscale, r = 0.78 (95% ci 0.72-0.83; p < 0.0001). in conclusion, the gerd screener has demonstrated construct, convergent, and predictive validity. it is shorter than existing validated instruments, practical, and easily administered, which may reduce the response and administrative burden. this may serve as a valuable case-finding instrument in primary-care and managed-care organizations wishing to implement programs to improve the quality and efficiency of care.
children's_health	objective: we examined the association between utilization of care for a dental problem (utilization-dp) and parent-reported dental problem (dp) urgency among children with dp by type of health care insurance coverage. methods: we used weighted 2008 national health interview survey data from 2,834 children, aged 2-17 years with at least one dp within the 6 months preceding survey. explanatory variables were selected based on andersen 's model of healthcare utilization. need was considered urgent if dp included toothache, bleeding gums, broken or missing teeth, broken or missing filling, or decayed teeth and otherwise as non-urgent. the primary enabling variable, insurance, had four categories: none, private health no dental coverage (phnd), private health and dental (phd), or medicaid/state children 's health insurance program (schip). predisposing variables included sociodemographic characteristics. we used bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify explanatory variables' association with utilization-dp. using logistic regression, we obtained adjusted estimates of utilization-dp by urgency for each insurance category. results: in bivariate analyses, utilization-dp was associated with both insurance and urgency. in multivariate analyses, the difference in percent utilizing care for an urgent versus non-urgent dp among children covered by medicaid/schip was 32 percentage points; phd, 25 percentage points; phnd, 12 percentage points; and no insurance, 14 percentage points. the difference in utilization by dp urgency was higher for children with medicaid/schip compared with either phnd or uninsured children. conclusion: expansion of medicaid/schip may permit children to receive care for urgent dps who otherwise may not, due to lack of dental insurance.
osteoarthritis	rheumatic and joint diseases, as exemplified by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, are among the most widespread painful and disabling pathologies across the globe. given the continuing rise in life expectancy, their prevalence is destined to grow. osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease, is, in particular, on its way to becoming the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020, with the rising incidence of obesity in addition to age being important factors. it is estimated that 25% of osteoarthritic individuals are unable to perform daily activities. accompanying osteoarthritis is rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic systemic disease that often causes pain and deformity. at least 50% of those affected are unable to remain gainfully employed within 10 years of disease onset. a growing body of evidence now points to inflammation, locally and more systemically, as a promoter of damage to joints and bones, as well as joint-related functional deficits. the pathogenesis underlying joint diseases remains unclear; however, it is currently believed that cross-talk between cartilage and subchondral boneand loss of balance between these two structures in joint diseasesis a critical element. this view is amplified by the presence of mast cells, whose dysregulation is associated with alterations of junction structures (cartilage, bone, synovia, matrix, nerve endings, and blood vessels). in addition, persistent activation of mast cells facilitates the development of spinal neuroinflammation mediated through their interaction with microglia. unfortunately, current treatment strategies for rheumatic and articular disease are symptomatic and do little to limit disease progression. research now should be directed at therapeutic modalities that target osteoarticular structural elements and thereby delaying disease progression and joint replacement.
asthma	glucocorticoids (gcs) control essential metabolic processes in virtually every cell in the body and play a vital role in the development of fetal tissues and organ systems. the biological actions of gcs are mediated via glucocorticoid receptors (grs), the cytoplasmic transcription factors that regulate the transcription of genes involved in placental and fetal growth and development. several experimental studies have demonstrated that fetal exposure to high maternal gc levels early in gestation is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including low birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction and anatomical and structural abnormalities that may increase the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and neuroendocrine disorders in adulthood. the response of the fetus to gcs is dependent on gender, with female fetuses becoming hypersensitive to changes in gc levels whereas male fetuses develop gc resistance in the environment of high maternal gcs. in this paper we review gr function and the physiological and pathological effects of gcs on fetal development. we propose that gc-induced changes in the placental structure and function, including alterations in the expression of gr mrna and protein levels, may play role in inhibiting in utero fetal growth.
medicare	public and private insurers are implementing payment mechanisms to improve coordination and reduce the cost of drug, hospital, and ancillary services for cancer patients. some target unnecessary hospitalization, while others create incentives for prescribing lower-cost chemotherapies and biologics. physician payment methods in oncology require a balance between incentives for cost control and incentives for patient access to expensive specialty drugs. none of the initiatives adopt bundled methods out of concern for shifting excessive financial risk onto physicians in the context of rapid pharmaceutical innovation. contexthigh-value oncology requires physicians to monitor and coordinate all aspects of care, educate and engage their patients, and adopt cost-effective drug treatments. however, oncology practices in the united states traditionally have been reimbursed based on the number of office visits performed and through cost-plus margins from prescription of expensive drugs. public and private payers now are experimenting with methods of payment that include monthly care management fees, annual bonuses, and incentives for conservative choice among alternative drug regimens. methodsthis paper uses case study methods to examine oncology payment initiatives at medicare, anthem, aetna, and unitedhealthcare, the nation 's largest public and private health insurance plans. findingsthe 4 insurers supplement traditional fee-for-service payment with payment methods designed to promote coordination of care and conservative use of health care resources. medicare, aetna, and unitedhealthcare reward oncology practices that reduce per-patient spending, targeting unnecessary patient visits to emergency departments and hospitals. anthem offers monthly payments to practices that adhere to lower-cost drug treatment pathways; aetna increases the percentage markup on low-cost generic chemotherapies but not on high-cost biologics; and unitedhealthcare removes the linkage between physician payment and spending on office-infused drugs. as a condition for receiving the new payments, each of the initiatives requires participating practices to report and, in some cases, improve performance on quality metrics. none of the initiatives bundles payment for oncology drugs together with payment for other oncology services, out of concern for shifting financial risk onto physicians and creating access barriers for patients. conclusionsthe emerging value-based methods of oncology payment supplement fee-for-service and cost-based reimbursements with per-month and per-episode payments, but none of the payers bundle spending on cancer drugs with payments for other services. payers recognize that bundled payment could create access barriers for patients and undermine innovation in effective but expensive new pharmaceuticals.
mental_health	homeless adults use emergency department (ed) services more frequently than other adults, but the relationships between homelessness, health status, outpatient service use, and ed utilization are poorly understood. data from the collaborative initiative to help end chronic homelessness (cich) were used to compare ed use among chronically homeless adults receiving comprehensive housing, case management, mental health, addiction, and primary care services through cich at 5 u.s. sites (n = 274) and ed use among comparison group clients receiving generally available community services (n = 116) at the same sites. multiple imputation was used to account for missing data and differential rates of attrition between the cohorts. longitudinal models were constructed to compare ed use between the 2 groups during the first year after initiation of cich services. a mediation analysis was performed to determine the relative contributions of being housed, the receipt of outpatient services, and health status to group differences in ed utilization. participants receiving cich services were significantly less likely to report ed use (odds ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [0.65, 0.93]) in the year after program entry. decreased ed use was primarily mediated by decreased homelessness-not by increased access to other services or health status. this suggests that becoming housed is a key driver of reduced ed utilization and that efforts to provide housing for homeless adults may result in significantly decreased ed use. further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of housing on health status and to develop services to improve health outcomes.
smoking_cessation	purpose reasons for the social gradient in cancer survival are not fully understood yet. previous studies were often only able to determine the socio-economic status of the patients from the area they live in, not from their individual socio-economic characteristics. methods in a multi-centre cohort study with 1633 cancer patients and 10-year follow-up, individual socio-economic position was measured using the indicators: education, job grade, job type, and equivalence income. the effect on survival was measured for each indicator individually, adjusting for age, gender, and medical characteristics. the mediating effect of health behaviour (alcohol and tobacco consumption) was analysed in separate models. results patients without vocational training were at increased risk of dying (rate ratio (rr) 1.5, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.1-2.2) compared to patients with the highest vocational training; patients with blue collar jobs were at increased risk (rr 1.2; 95% ci 1.0-1.5) compared to patients with white collar jobs; income had a gradual effect (rr for the lowest income compared to highest was 2.7, 95% ci 1.9-3.8). adding health behaviour to the models did not change the effect estimates considerably. there was no evidence for an effect of school education and job grade on cancer survival. conclusions patients with higher income, better vocational training, and white collar jobs survived longer, regardless of disease stage at baseline and of tobacco and alcohol consumption.
lymphoma	cd109 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that negatively regulates tgf-beta signaling. cd109 was originally identified in hematopoietic tumors; however, the significance of cd109 in hematopoietic malignancies remains unclear. here, we study the association of cd109 with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) prognosis. eighty-four dlbcl specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for cd109 expression, and 31 and 53 cases were classified into low- and high-cd109 expression groups, respectively. cd109 expression was not associated with overall survival using the kaplan-meier analysis and log-rank tests (p = 0.17); however, a significant association was observed between high-cd109 expression and low-1-year survival (p = 0.01). moreover, in combination with the revised international prognostic index (r-ipi), r-ipi-poor/cd109-high was associated with poorer prognosis compared with r-ipi-poor alone. we assessed tgf-beta signaling in cd109-depleted nalm6 cells (a human b-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cell line), and found prolonged smad2 phosphorylation compared with control cells after tgf-beta 1 stimulation, suggesting that cd109 attenuates tgf-beta 1 signaling in human b-cell tumors. these results suggest that cd109 is a putative biomarker for identifying a high-risk group among dlbcl patients.
autism	what is the degree to which knowledge influences visual perceptual processes? this question, which is central to the seeing-versus-thinking debate in cognitive science, is often discussed using examples claimed to be proof of one stance or another. it has, however, also been muddled by the usage of different and unclear definitions of perception. here, for the well-defined process of perceptual organization, i argue that including speed (or efficiency) into the equation opens a new perspective on the limits of top-down influences of thinking on seeing. while the input of the perceptual organization process may be modifiable and its output enrichable, the process itself seems so fast (or efficient) that thinking hardly has time to intrude and is effective mostly after the fact.
rheumatoid_arthritis	chitosan is a family of glucosamine and n-acetyl glucosamine polysaccharides with poorly understood immune modulating properties. here, functional u937 macrophage responses were analyzed in response to a novel library of twenty chitosans with controlled degree of deacetylation (dda, 60-98%), molecular weight (1 to >100 kda), and acetylation pattern (block vs. random). specific chitosan preparations (10 or 190 kda 80% block dda and 3, 5, or 10 kda 98% dda) either induced macrophages to release cxcl10 and il-ira at 5-50 mu g/ml, or activated the inflammasome to release il-1 beta and pge(2) at 50-150 mu g/ml. chitosan induction of these factors required lysosomal acidification. cxcl10 production was preceded by lysosomal rupture as shown by time-dependent co-localization of galectin-3 and chitosan and slowed autophagy flux, and specifically depended on ifn-beta paracrine activity and stat-2 activation that could be suppressed by pge2. chitosan induced a type i ifn paracrine response or inflammasome response depending on the extent of lysosomal rupture and cytosolic foreign body invasion. this study identifies the structural motifs that lead to chitosan-driven cytokine responses in macrophages and indicates that lysosomal rupture is a key mechanism that determines the endogenous release of either il-1ra or il-1 beta (c) 2017 the authors. published by elsevier ltd.
psoriasis	lately, important advances take place in dermatological treatment. phototherapy, as one of the oldest treatment modalities in the history of dermatology, does not fall behind these advances; on the contrary, it is still used widely in the treatment of many skin diseases with the advantages of being effective and safe. this article aims to give practical and basic information about artificial ultraviolet sources, dosimetry and calibration standards of these sources and ultraviolet treatment protocols, starting with the history of current phototherapy modalities.
crohn's_disease	background: a link between rosacea and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has been proposed with unknown mechanisms. epidemiologic evidence of this association needs to be examined. methods: in this nationwide cohort study, a total of 89,356 patients with rosacea and 178,712 matched patients without rosacea between 1997 and 2013 were identified in the taiwanese national health insurance research database. cumulative incidences of ibd were compared between these 2 cohorts. frailty cox proportional hazard model was used and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the risk factors for ibd. results: the 15-year cumulative incidences of ibd were 0.036% (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.00%-1.57%) and 0.019% (95% ci 0.00%-0.83%) in rosacea and nonrosacea cohorts, respectively (p = .05). rosacea (adjusted hazard ratio 1.94, 95% ci 1.04-3.63, p = .04) and male gender (adjusted hazard ratio 3.52, 95% ci 2.03-6.11, p < 01) were independently associated with ibd, after adjustment for major comorbidities. multivariate subgroup analyses revealed consistent results. the incidence rates of ibd decreased with increasing antibiotic use in patients with rosacea, but without statistical significance. limitation: information related to lifestyle, diet, alcohol, and smoking was not included in the database. conclusion: patients with rosacea may have an increased risk of ibd.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and psoriatic arthritis (psa) result in severe joint destruction and functional disability if left untreated. we aim to develop tools that help patients with ra and psa to understand and experience the impact of inflammatory joint disease on the integrity of their (juxta-articular) bone and increase adherence to medical treatment. in this study, we used high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (hr-pqct) to develop 3d prototypes of patients' finger joints. methods: hr-pqct (xtremect, scanco) measurements were performed in healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory joint disease, followed by a 3d print using the objet30 printer. healthy participants (n = 10), and patients (n = 15 with ra and 15 with psa) underwent a detailed, standardized interview with demonstration of printed joints. results: utilizing hr-pqct images of metacarpophalangeal (mcp) heads, high quality and exact 3d prints as prototypes were created. erosions in different sizes and the trabecular network printed in detail were visualized, demonstrating structural reduction in arthritic vs. healthy bone. after demonstration of 3d prints (healthy vs. erosive joint, visual and haptic) 26/39 (66%) participants (including healthy volunteers) were deeply affected, often quoting ""shock"". of the patients with ra and psa, 13/15 (86%) and 11/15 (73%), respectively, stated that they would rethink their attitude to medication adherence. more importantly, 21/24 patients with ra or psa (87.5%) expressed that they would have wished to see such 3d prints during their first disease-specific conversations. conclusion: using arthro-haptic 3d printed prototypes of joints may help to better understand the impact of inflammatory arthritides on bone integrity and long-term damage.
children's_health	vigabatrin is a highly effective antiseizure medication, but its use is limited due to concerns about retinal toxicity. one proposed mechanism for this toxicity is vigabatrin-mediated reduction of taurine. herein we assess plasma taurine levels in a retrospective cohort of children with epilepsy, including a subset receiving vigabatrin. all children who underwent a plasma amino acid analysis as part of their clinical evaluation between 2006 and 2015 at stanford children 's health were included in the analysis. there were no significant differences in plasma taurine levels between children taking vigabatrin (n = 16), children taking other anti-seizure medications, and children not taking any anti-seizure medication (n = 556) (analysis of variance [anova] p = 0.841). there were, however, age-dependent decreases in plasma taurine levels. multiple linear regression revealed no significant association between vigabatrin use and plasma taurine level (p = 0.87) when controlling for age. these results suggest that children taking vigabatrin maintain normal plasma taurine levels, although they leave unanswered whether taurine supplementation is necessary or sufficient to prevent vigabatrin-associated visual field loss. they also indicate that age should be taken into consideration when evaluating taurine levels in young children.
bipolar_disorder	introduction: the involvement of extreme sensory processing patterns, impulsivity, alexithymia, and hopelessness was hypothesized to contribute to the complex pathophysiology of major depression and bipolar disorder. however, the nature of the relation between these variables has not been thoroughly investigated. aims: this study aimed to explore the association between extreme sensory processing patterns, impulsivity, alexithymia, depression, and hopelessness. methods: we recruited 281 euthymic participants (mean age=47.4 +/- 12.1) of which 62.3% with unipolar major depression and 37.7% with bipolar disorder. all participants completed the adolescent/adult sensory profile (aasp), toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20), second version of the beck depression inventory (bdi-ii), barratt impulsivity scale (bis), and beck hopelessness scale (bhs). results: lower registration of sensory input showed a significant correlation with depression, impulsivity, attentional/motor impulsivity, and alexithymia. it was significantly more frequent among participants with elevated hopelessness, and accounted for 22% of the variance in depression severity, 15% in greater impulsivity, 36% in alexithymia, and 3% in hopelessness. elevated sensory seeking correlated with enhanced motor impulsivity and decreased non-planning impulsivity. higher sensory sensitivity and sensory avoiding correlated with depression, impulsivity, and alexithymia. limitations: the study was limited by the relatively small sample size and cross-sectional nature of the study. furthermore, only self-report measures that may be potentially biased by social desirability were used. conclusion: extreme sensory processing patterns, impulsivity, alexithymia, depression, and hopelessness may show a characteristic pattern in patients with major affective disorders. the careful assessment of sensory profiles may help in developing targeted interventions and improve functional/adaptive strategies.
autism	introduction: in the last years, ketogenic diet (kd) has been experimentally utilized in various childhood neurologic disorders such as mitochondriopathies, alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ahc), brain tumors, migraine, and autism spectrum disorder (asd). the aim of this review is to analyze how kd can target these different medical conditions, highlighting possible mechanisms involved.areas covered: we have conducted an analysis on literature concerning kd use in mitochondriopathies, ahc, brain tumors, migraine, and asd.expert commentary: the role of kd in reducing seizure activity in some mitochondriopathies and its efficacy in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is known. recently, few cases suggest the potentiality of kd in decreasing paroxysmal activity in children affected by ahc. a few data support its potential use as co-adjuvant and alternative therapeutic option for brain cancer, while any beneficial effect of kd on migraine remains unclear. kd could improve cognitive and social skills in a subset of children with asd.
medicare	background: diabetes is highly prevalent among medicare beneficiaries, resulting in costly health care utilization. strategies to improve health outcomes, such as disease self-management, could help reduce the increasing burden of diabetes. objectives: short-term benefits of diabetes self-management training (dsmt) are established; however, longer-term impacts among medicare beneficiaries are unknown. research design: claims-based observational study with 1-year follow-up beginning 6 months after diabetes diagnosis. subjects: twenty percent random sample of medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with diabetes during 2009-2011 who used dsmt (n = 14,680), matched to a nonuser comparison group. measures: we compared health service utilization and costs between dsmt users and nonusers. health service utilization included any utilization of the hospital or emergency department (ed) and any hospitalizations due to diabetes-related ambulatory care sensitive conditions as well as the number of hospitalizations and ed visits within the follow-up year. costs included all medicare parts a and b expenditures. results: multivariate regression results found that dsmt users had 14% reduced odds of any hospitalization, lower numbers of hospitalizations and ed visits (approximately 3 fewer per 100 for each), and approximately $830 lower medicare expenditures (95% ci, - $1198, - $470) compared with nonusers. odds of any hospitalization due to diabetes-related ambulatory care sensitive conditions and any ed visit were lower for dsmt users compared with nonusers, but the reductions were not statistically significant. conclusions: findings demonstrate benefits from dsmt use, including lower health service utilization and costs. the low cost of dsmt relative to the reduction in medicare expenditures highlights an opportunity to reduce the burden of diabetes on both individuals and the health care system.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: to evaluate computer-based computer tomography (ct)analysis (caliper) against visual ct scoring and pulmonary function tests (pfts) when predicting mortality in patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease (ctd-ild). to identify outcome differences between distinct ctd-ild groups derived following automated stratification of caliper variables. methods: a total of 203 consecutive patients with assorted ctd-ilds had ct parenchymal patterns evaluated by caliper and visual ct scoring: honeycombing, reticular pattern, ground glass opacities, pulmonary vessel volume, emphysema, and traction bronchiectasis. ct scores were evaluated against pulmonary function tests: forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide transfer coefficient, and composite physiologic index for mortality analysis. automated stratification of caliper-ct variables was evaluated in place of and alongside forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide in the ild gender, age physiology (ild-gap) model using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. results: cox regression analyses identified four independent predictors of mortality: patient age (p < 0.0001), smoking history (p = 0.0003), carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (p = 0.003), and pulmonary vessel volume (p < 0.0001). automated stratification of caliper variables identified three morphologically distinct groups which were stronger predictors of mortality than all ct and functional indices. the stratified-ct model substituted automated stratified groups for functional indices in the ild-gap model and maintained model strength (area under curve (auc) = 0.74, p < 0.0001), ild-gap (auc = 0.72, p < 0.0001). combining automated stratified groups with the ild-gap model (stratified ct-gap model) strengthened predictions of 1- and 2-year mortality: ild-gap (auc = 0.87 and 0.86, respectively); stratified ct-gap (auc = 0.89 and 0.88, respectively). conclusions: caliper-derived pulmonary vessel volume is an independent predictor of mortality across all ctd-ild patients. furthermore, automated stratification of caliper ct variables represents a novel method of prognostication at least as robust as pfts in ctd-ild patients.
anxiety	background and objectives: cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) highlight the role of cognitive biases for the development of the disorder. one of these biases, an inflated sense of responsibility has been associated with higher anger scores and latent aggression on self-report scales, especially in patients with compulsive checking. validity of self-report assessment is, however, compromised by inaccuracy, social desirability, and low metacognitive awareness of traits and behaviors in patients. the aim of the present study was to extend the research on latent aggression in individuals with ocd by using an indirect, implicit measure of aggression. methods: fifty-eight patients with ocd and 25 healthy controls were assessed with an aggressiveness implicit association test (iat), which is a reaction time task that assesses the strength of associations between the concept of ""aggressiveness"" and ""me"" compared to others. results: contrary to our expectation, ocd patients with checking symptoms showed a more peaceful implicit self-concept than healthy controls. this result was corroborated by negative correlations between checking symptoms and implicit aggressiveness in the ocd sample. limitations: no self-report measures on aggression or anger were included in the study. conclusions: in comparison to previous research using self-report measures, our study indicates that implicit aspects of aggression do indeed differ from controlled aspects in patients with checking compulsions. future research is necessary to better understand the role of aggressiveness in ocd and to derive implications for therapy.

osteoporosis	bone metabolism is affected by mechanical, genetic, and environmental factors and plays a major role in osteoporosis. nevertheless, the influence of environmental pollution on the occurrence of osteoporosis is still unclear and controversial. in this context, heavy metals are the most important pollutants capable to affect bone mass. the aim of this study was to investigate whether heavy metals accumulation in bone tissues could be related to the altered bone metabolism and architecture of osteoporotic patients. to this end, we analyzed 25 bone head biopsies osteoporotic patients and 25 bone head biopsies of osteoarthritic patients. moreover we enrolled 15 patients underwent hip arthroplasty for high-energy hip fracture or osteonecrosis of the femoral head as a control group. bone head biopsies were studied by bioquant-osteo software, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis. we found a prevalence of lead, cadmium and chromium accumulation in osteoporotic patients. noteworthy, high levels of sclerostin, detected by immunohistochemistry, correlate with the accumulation of heavy metal found in the bone of osteoporotic patients, suggesting a molecular link between heavy metal accumulation and bone metabolism impairment. in conclusion, the presence of heavy metals into bone shed new light on the comprehension of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis since these elements could play a non redundant role in the development of osteoporosis at cellular/molecular and epigenetic level. nevertheless, in vivo and in vitro studies need to better elucidate the molecular mechanism in which heavy metals can participate to osteoporosis.

smoking_cessation	background: previous research suggests exposure to nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). methods: using data from the united kingdom 's clinical practice research datalink, this study aimed to evaluate cvd events and survival among individuals who attempted smoking cessation with the support of nrt compared with those aided by smoking cessation advice only. we studied cvd outcomes over 4 and 52 weeks in 50,214 smokers attempting to quit-33,476 supported by smoking cessation advice and 16,738 with the support of nrt prescribed by their primary care physician. patients were matched (2 smoking cessation advice patients: 1 nrt patient) on demographic and clinical characteristics during a baseline year preceding their quit attempt. cox proportional hazard regression, conditional negative binomial regression model, and conditional logistic regression were used to analyze data. results: mean (standard deviation) population age was 47 (11.2) years; 51% were females. time to first diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (ihd) among nrt and smoking cessation advice patients was similar within the first 4 weeks, but shorter for nrt patients over 52 weeks (hazard ratio [hr]: 1.35, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.03-1.77). a similar trend was observed for cerebrovascular disease (hr: 1.54, 95% ci: 1.08-2.19). nrt patients with a prior diagnosis of ihd or cerebrovascular disease had a higher rate of primary or secondary care consultations for ihd or cerebrovascular disease by 52 weeks (rate ratio: 1.50, 95% ci: 1.14-1.99). patients prescribed nrt had a shorter survival time over 52 weeks, compared with those receiving advice only (hr: 1.39, 95% ci: 1.09-1.76). conclusion: our findings suggest that treatment with nrt over 4 weeks does not appear to have an impact on cardiovascular risks. however, a longer follow-up period of 52 weeks resulted in an increase in cardiovascular events for patients prescribed nrt, compared with those receiving smoking cessation advice only.
asthma	magnesium is an essential chemical element in all organisms, intervening in most cellular enzymatic reactions; thus, its importance in homeostasis and as a therapeutic tool in highly challenging patients such as pediatrics. the primary purpose of this paper was to review the role of magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant drug in pediatric anesthesia. this compound already has the scientific backing in certain aspects such as analgesia or muscle relaxation, but only theoretical or empirical backing in others such as organ protection or inflammation, where it seems to be promising. the multitude of potential applications in pediatric anesthesia, its high safety, and low cost make magnesium sulfate could be considered a super adjuvant.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: non-response to antidepressant treatment is a substantial problem in primary care, and many patients with depression require additional second-line treatments. this study aimed to examine the prevalence and patterns of antidepressant switching in the uk, and identify associated demographic and clinical factors. method: cohort analysis of antidepressant prescribing data from the clinical practice research datalink, a large, anonymised uk primary care database. the sample included 262,844 patients who initiated antidepressant therapy between 1 january 2005 and 31 june 2011. results: 9.3% of patients switched to a different antidepressant product, with most switches (60%) occurring within 8 weeks of the index date. the proportion switching was similar for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (9.3%, 9.8% and 9.2%, respectively). most switches were to an ssri (64.5%), and this was the preferred option regardless of initial antidepressant class. factors predictive of switching included male gender, age, and history of self-harm and psychiatric illness. conclusion: over one in every 11 patients who initiates antidepressant therapy will switch medication, suggesting that initial antidepressant treatment has been unsatisfactory. evidence to guide choice of second-line treatment for individual patients is currently limited. additional research comparing different pharmacological and psychological second-line treatment strategies is required in order to inform guidelines and improve patient outcomes.
osteoporosis	early detection of decalcification is vital in osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment. since calcium ions are the main factor in bone strength, decalcification degrees in bone can be classified through assessment of the variation in its mechanical response to applied load. in this paper, an innovative non-radiation, low cost method is proposed for assessment of bone decalcification which is capable of discrimination of low grade decalcification. this capability is due to employment of high resolution fiber optic sensor (fos) with the strain sensitivity of 27.8 pm mu epsilon(-1) that detects the decalcification through measurement of strain induced by loading. the sensor design procedure is based on genetic algorithm. by the means of mode field diameter (mfd) variation as a sensor indirect parameter, the common problems of intensity modulated optical sensors are overcome. moreover, the sensor operation is nearly independent of temperature variation and the compensation requirement is removed.

dementia	recent evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes (t2d) is associated with accelerated brain ageing, consistent with the observation of increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in affected individuals. even non-diabetic individuals with impaired fasting plasma glucose (ifg) levels have shown increased cerebral atrophy, compared to individuals with normal glucose levels. we tested whether longitudinal rates of age-related cortical thinning were associated with fasting plasma glucose levels in a large sample (n = 322) of early-old age individuals (60-66 years) who were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 t) on up to four occasions over 12 years. higher plasma glucose levels (measured on up to three occasions) were associated with increased cortical thinning in individuals with t2d as well as those with ifg, with a similar trend for individuals with normal fasting glucose (nfg) levels. across groups, a 1 mmol/l increase in plasma glucose (above 5 mmol/l in nfg and ifg and above 6.1 mmol/l in t2d) resulted in a 10-13% increase in annual cortical thinning. increased cortical thinning was detected in insular cortex, as well as posterior cingulate, parahippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. our results provide support for the idea that raised plasma glucose levels, even in the normal range, are associated with accelerated age-related cortical atrophy.
psoriatic_arthritis	the objective of this cross-sectional study was to define normal sex- and age-dependent values of intra-articular bone mass and microstructures in the metacarpal heads of healthy individuals by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (hr-pqct) and test the effect of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) on these parameters. human cadaveric metacarpal heads were used to exactly define intra-articular bone. healthy individuals of different sex and age categories and ra patients with similar age and sex distribution received hr-pqct scans of the second metacarpal head and the radius. total, cortical, and trabecular bone densities as well as microstructural parameters were compared between 1) the different ages and sexes in healthy individuals; 2) between metacarpal heads and the radius; and 3) between healthy individuals and ra patients. the cadaveric study allowed exact definition of the intra-articular (intracapsular) bone margins. these data were applied in measuring intra-articular and radial bone parameters in 214 women and men (108 healthy individuals, 106 ra patients). correlations between intra-articular and radial bone parameters were good (r=0.51 to 0.62, p<0.001). in contrast to radial bone, intra-articular bone remained stable until age 60 years (between 297 and 312mg ha/cm(3)) but decreased significantly (p<0.001) in women thereafter (237.5 +/- 44.3) with loss of both cortical and trabecular bone. similarly, ra patients showed significant (p<0.001) loss of intra-articular total (263.0 +/- 44.8), trabecular (171.2 +/- 35.6), and cortical bone (610.2 +/- 62.0) compared with sex- and age-adjusted controls. standard sex- and age-dependent values for physiological intra-articular bone were defined. postmenopausal state and ra led to significant decrease of intra-articular bone.

addiction	background: previous diffusion tensor imaging (dti) studies have consistently shown that subjects with cocaine use disorder (cocud) had altered white matter microstructure in the corpus callosum. it is believed that these alterations are due to preexisting factors, chronic cocaine use, or both. however, there is no published longitudinal dti study on human cocaine users yet which could shed light on the relationship between cocaine use and dti findings. methods: this study used a longitudinal design and dti to test if the white matter microstructure shows quicker alteration in cocud subjects than controls. dti data were acquired from eleven cocud subjects who participated a treatment study and eleven non-drug-using controls at baseline (scan 1) and after ten weeks (scan 2). the baseline fractional anisotropy (fa), a general measure of white matter microstucture, and the change in fa (delta fa, equals scan 1 fa minus scan 2 fa) were both compared between groups. results: the two groups did not show a difference in fa at baseline. the cocud subjects had significantly greater delta fa than the controls in the left splenium of the corpus callosum. in cocud subjects, greater fa in this region was associated with shorter lifetime cocaine use and greater number of positive cocaine urine samples collected during the treatment. conclusion: the finding in the left splenium is consistent with previous animal studies and provide indirect evidence about the effects of chronic cocaine use on white matter alterations. the subject sample size is small, therefore the results should be treated as preliminary.

dementia	we investigated the association between five factor model personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and risk of dementia, cognitive impairment not dementia (cind), and conversion from cind to dementia in a large national cohort. participants from the health and retirement study (n >10,000) completed a personality scale in 2006-2008 and their cognitive status was tracked for up to 8 years using the modified telephone interview for cognitive status (ticsm). adjusting for age, sex, education, race, and ethnicity, lower conscientiousness and agreeableness and higher neuroticism were independently associated with increased risk of dementia. these associations remained significant after adjusting for other risk factors for dementia, including income, wealth, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and blood biomarkers. these associations were not modified by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education, suggesting that the associations of personality with risk of dementia were similar across demographic groups. neuroticism and conscientiousness were also associated with risk of cind. low conscientiousness predicted conversion from cind to dementia. using brief assessments of personality and cognition, we found robust evidence that personality is associated with risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in a large national sample.

addiction	background: eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) is an evidence-based treatment for ptsd. however, it is unclear whether emdr shows the same effectiveness in patients with substance use disorders (sud) and comorbid ptsd. in this trial, we examine the effectiveness of emdr in reducing ptsd symptoms in patients with sud and ptsd. methods/design: we conduct a single-blinded rct among 158 patients with sud and comorbid ptsd admitted to a german addiction rehabilitation center specialized for the treatment of patients with sud and comorbid ptsd. patients are randomized to receive either emdr, added to sud rehabilitation and non-trauma-focused ptsd treatment (tau), or tau alone. the primary outcome is change from baseline in ptsd symptom severity as measured by the clinicianadministered ptsd scale at 6-month follow-up. secondary outcomes are change from baseline in substance use, addiction-related problems, depressive symptoms, dissociative symptoms, emotion dysregulation and quality of life. assessments are carried out by blinded raters at admission, at end of treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. we expect that emdr plus tau will be more effective in reducing ptsd symptoms than tau alone. mixed models will be conducted using an intention-to-treat and per-protocol approach. discussion: this study aims to expand the knowledge about the effectiveness of emdr in patients with sud and comorbid ptsd. the expected finding of the superiority of emdr in reducing ptsd symptoms compared to non-trauma-focused ptsd treatment may enhance the use of trauma-focused treatment approaches for patients with sud and co-morbid ptsd.
mental_health	as the classification of mental disorders advances towards a disease model as promoted by the national institute of mental health (nimh) research domain criteria (rdoc), there is hope that a more thorough neurobiological understanding of mental illness may allow clinicians and researchers to determine treatment efficacy with less diagnostic variability. this paradigm shift has presented a variety of ethical issues to be considered in the development of psychiatric drugs. these challenges are not limited to informed consent practices, industry funding, and placebo use. the consideration for alternative research models and quality of research design also present ethical challenges in the development of psychiatric drugs. the imperatives to create valid and sound research that justify the human time, cost, risk and use of limited resources must also be considered. clinical innovation, and consideration for special populations are also important aspects to take into account. based on the breadth of these ethical concerns, it is particularly important that scientific questions regarding the development of psychiatric drugs be answered collaboratively by a variety of stakeholders. as the field expands, new ethical considerations will be raised with increased focus on genetic markers, personalized medicine, patient-centered outcomes research, and tension over funding. we suggest that innovation in trial design is necessary to better reflect practices in clinical settings and that there must be an emphasized focus on expanding the transparency of consent processes, regard for suicidality, and care in working with special populations to support the goal of developing sound psychiatric drug therapies.

bipolar_disorder	aims: our survey has been aimed at identifying the society attitude towards people with mental illness in slovakia. method: selected group comprised 1,624 adult respondents with 18years of age as the bottom limit. we applied reduced 26-item community attitudes toward mentally ill scale (cami) to the survey of the society attitude towards people with mental illness. results: average score reached by the respondents reached 94.0800 points, indicating lower stigmatization rate than presumed. further investigation revealed prejudice and stigmatizing attitudes at significant part of the population. the survey confirmed statistically significant differences at the attitudes in the terms of gender (t=-6.559, p=.000), age within the categories ((2)=20.358, p=.000), education (f=9.137, p=.000), socio-economic status ((2)=50.487, p=.000) and occupation ((2)=47.989, p=.000). we also confirmed statistically significant relation between the attitude and age (-.085**, p=.001). conclusion: the survey confirmed rather neutral up to slightly positive attitude of the slovak population towards people with mental illness. existence of attitudes burdened with fear was revealed in some cases, indicating the need for continuous education of the society in this subject matter.
rheumatoid_arthritis	background: the selection of the most representative mass profiles, in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) serum samples was developed. this allows for selection and identification of potential biomarkers in ra serum samples. methods: the ra and controls samples were analyzed using maldi-tof. two different protein elution procedures utilizing ziptips (el and e2) were examined. the statistical evaluation of data was performed using different feature selection (fs) methods in combination with different classifiers, while identification of selected masses was performed using maldi-tof-tof. results: utilization of proposed statistical strategy allowed for the selection of different masses according to fs method and elution procedure. obtained masses were further subjected for targeted identification. the panel of proteins were identified as potential markers. the role of these proteins was discussed in relation to pathomechanism of ra. conclusion: application of advanced biostatistical analysis of obtained maldi-tof datasets, resulted with targeted selection of potential ra biomarkers. five proteins were identified due the el procedure, and six proteins were identified due the e2 procedure, respectively. the panel of identified proteins suggest that presented statistical methodology and proteomic strategy was correct and gave valid results. obtained results may contribute to development of clinically useful multicomponent diagnostic tool.

osteoarthritis	objective to determine (1) if bone bruise characteristics seen on magnetic resonance imaging are associated with patient-reported outcomes prior to and following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and (2) if the combined presence of bone bruises with articular cartilage pathology results in inferior 2- or 6-year outcomes. design bone bruise volume and severity were measured on 81 patients' preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the medial and lateral femoral condyle (mfc, lfc) and medial and lateral tibial plateau (mtp, ltp) using the costa-paz classification and a modified version of roemer and bohndorf 's technique. the relationships between bone bruise volume and severity with knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos) and international knee documentation committee (ikdc) scores were assessed, and pre- and postoperative koos and ikdc scores were compared between those with bone bruises either with or without combined local articular cartilage pathology. results all 81 patients had a bone bruise in at least 1 region and 70 (86%) had bone bruises in 2 regions. ltp bruises were the most common (76/81, 94%), followed by the lfc (66, 81%), mtp (46, 57%), and mfc (20, 25%). neither bone bruise volume nor severity was associated with inferior postoperative outcomes. the subset of 17 patients with bone bruises and combined articular cartilage pathology were 3.4 times more likely to be symptomatic at 6-year follow-up than those without articular cartilage pathology (p = 0.04). conclusions the volume and severity of preoperative bone bruises alone were not associated with 2- or 6-year outcomes; however, bone bruises combined with local articular cartilage pathology appear to be more symptomatic after acl reconstruction.
dementia	cognitive, behavioural, and functional assessment is crucial in longitudinal studies of neurodegenerative dementias (ndd). central issues, such as the definition of the study population (asymptomatic, at risk, or individuals with dementia), the detection of change/decline, and the assessment of relevant outcomes depend on quantitative measures of cognitive, behavioural, and functional status. currently, we are far from having available reliable protocols and tools for the assessment of dementias in europe. the main problems are the heterogeneity of the tools used across different european countries, the lack of standardisation of administration and scoring methods across centres, and the limited information available about the psychometric properties of many tests currently in widespread use. this situation makes it hard to compare results across studies carried out in different centres, thus hampering research progress, in particular towards the contribution to a ""big data"" common data set. we present here the results of a project funded by the joint program for neurodegenerative diseases (jpnd) and by the italian ministry of health. the project aimed at providing a consensus framework for the harmonisation of assessment tools to be applied to research in neurodegenerative disorders affecting cognition across europe. a panel of european experts reviewed the current methods of neuropsychological assessment, identified pending issues, and made recommendations for the harmonisation of neuropsychological assessment of neurodegenerative dementias in europe. a consensus was achieved on the general recommendations to be followed in developing procedures and tools for neuropsychological assessment, with the aim of harmonising tools and procedures to achieve more reliable data on the cognitive-behavioural examination. the results of this study should be considered as a first step to enhancing a common view and practise on ndd assessment across european countries.
ankylosing_spondylitis	gca is a common primary systemic vasculitis that results in granulomatous inflammation of medium to large arteries. both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms combine to drive intimal hyperplasia, luminal stenosis and ultimately occlusion. while the pathogenesis of gca is incompletely understood, the activation of resident adventitial dendritic cells via toll like receptors (tlrs) appears to be a crucial inciting event. here we explore the role of tlrs in the pathogenesis of gca, including their effects on dendritic cell and t cell activation and recruitment, putative infectious triggers for gca and the potential of tlr inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in gca.
hereditary_angioedema	background: hereditary angioedema caused by c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder. c1-inh-hae is characterized by edema-formation, which may occur in response to stress. the individual 's response to stress stimuli is partly genetically determined. activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis results in the release of cortisol. in turn, the secreted gluco-and mineralocorticoids affect the metabolism, as well as the cardiovascular and immune systems. we hypothesized that changes in serum cortisol level and polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor (gr) modify the individual sensitivity to stressor stimuli of c1-inh-hae patients. results: we compared the response to stress with rahe 's brief stress and coping inventory of 43 c1-inh-hae patients, 18 angioedema patients and 13 healthy controls. 139 c1-inh-hae patients and 160 healthy controls were genotyped for glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms bcli, n363s and a3669g. serum cortisol levels were determined during attacks and during symptom-free periods in 36 c1-inh-hae patients. the relationships between clinical, laboratory data and gr snps (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were assessed using anova. c1-inh-hae patients have decreased coping capabilities compared to healthy controls. cortisol levels were significantly higher during attacks than in symptom-free periods (p = 0.004). the magnitude of the elevation of cortisol levels did not show a significant correlation with any clinical or laboratory data. among the c1-inh-hae patients, the carriers of the a3669g allele had significantly lower cortisol levels, and increased body mass index compared with non-carriers. conclusions: the higher cortisol level observed during attacks may reflect the effect of a stressful situation (such as of the attack itself), on the patients' neuroendocrine system. in a3669g carriers, the lower cortisol levels might reflect altered feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, due to decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoids.
crohn's_disease	background: previous reports on racial disparities in the treatment of crohn 's disease [cd] in african american [aa] patients have shown differences in both medical and surgical treatments in this population. no study thus far has examined the effect of aa race on outcomes after surgery for cd. methods: utilizing the national surgical quality improvement program [nsqip] participant user file [puf] for the years 2005-2013, we examined the effect of aa race on postoperative complications in patients with cd undergoing intestinal surgery. results: aa patients had a significantly higher rate of complications overall compared to non-aa patients [23.5% vs 18.9%, p = 0.002]. postoperative sepsis [10.9% vs 6.6%, p < 0.001] and surgical site infection [17.6% vs 14.8%, p = 0.037] were most significant. after adjustment for age, sex, preoperative disease severity and lifestyle factors [smoking], race remained a statistically significant factor in postoperative complication rate. only after additional adjustment was made for comorbidities and american society of anesthesiologists class did race lose significance within our model. conclusion: african americans experience a greater amount of postoperative complications following surgery for crohn 's disease. preoperative disease management, addressing smoking status and control of comorbid disease are important factors in addressing the racial disparities in the surgical treatment of crohn 's disease.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	fibrotic diseases are not well-understood. they represent a number of different diseases that are characterized by the development of severe organ fibrosis without any obvious cause, such as the devastating diseases idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) and scleroderma. these diseases have a poor prognosis comparable with endstage cancer and are uncurable. given the phenotypic differences, it was assumed that the different fibrotic diseases also have different pathomechanisms. here, we demonstrate that many endstage fibrotic diseases, including ipf; scleroderma; myelofibrosis; kidney-, pancreas-, and heart-fibrosis; and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis converge in the activation of the ap1 transcription factor c-jun in the pathologic fibroblasts. expression of the related ap1 transcription factor fra2 was restricted to pulmonary artery hypertension. induction of c-jun in mice was sufficient to induce severe fibrosis in multiple organs and steatohepatosis, which was dependent on sustained c-jun expression. single cell mass cytometry revealed that c-jun activates multiple signaling pathways in mice, including pakt and cd47, which were also induced in human disease. alpha cd47 antibody treatment and vegf or pi3k inhibition reversed various organ c-jun-mediated fibroses in vivo. these data suggest that c-jun is a central molecular mediator of most fibrotic conditions.
dementia	purpose: characterized by a progressive onset of gait disturbances, dementia, and urinary incontinence, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (inph) is considered a rare, but under-diagnosed disease. non-invasive diagnostic markers are still insufficient to enable the diagnosis of inph with certainty and yet early treatment with ventriculo-peritoneal (vp) shunting can reverse symptoms and stop disease progression. vascular circulation abnormalities in inph may be reflected by changes in subfoveal and peripapillary choroidal thickness (ppcht). this study uses spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (sd-oct)-based measures of retinal and choroidal thickness to test this hypothesis and to assess ophthalmological non-invasive markers for inph. methods: twelve patients who displayed neurological and neuroradiological characteristics of inph were subject to a full ophthalmological examination including enhanced depth imaging (edi) sd-oct. of the 12 included inph patients, 6 had undergone vp shunting with beneficial outcome. parameters studied with edi sd-oct were macular retinal thickness (mt), subfoveal choroidal thickness (sfcht), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (rnfl), and ppcht. results were compared with 13 healthy, age-matched controls. results: macular thickness and rnfl and mt values of inph patients did not reflect atrophy. non-shunted inph patients showed significantly lowered median ppcht and sfcht values compared to healthy controls. shunted inph patients displayed a significantly higher median ppcht and sfcht compared to non-shunted inph patients. sfcht and ppcht values in shunted patients were not significantly different to values in healthy controls. conclusion: although limited by small sample size, sd-oct measures in this study reveal significant changes of choroidal thickness and support the hypothesis of choroidal susceptibility to hemodynamic alterations in inph. non-shunted inph patients in this study show choroidal thinning in combination with normal rnfl and mt values. in addition to neurological and neuroradiological exams, this pattern may aid in the challenging diagnosis of inph.
autism	background: individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) show a relative indifference to the human voice. accordingly, and contrarily to their typically developed peers, adults with autism do not show a preferential response to voices in the superior temporal sulcus; this lack of voice-specific response was previously linked to atypical processing of voices. in electroencephalography, a slow event-related potential (erp) called the fronto-temporal positivity to voice (ftpv) is larger for vocal than for non-vocal sounds, resulting in a voice-sensitive response over right fronto-temporal sites. here, we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of voice perception in children with and without asd. methods: sixteen children with autism and 16 age-matched typically developing children heard vocal (speech and non-speech) and non-vocal sounds while their electroencephalographic activity was recorded; overall iq was smaller in the group of children with asd. erp amplitudes were compared using non-parametric statistical tests at each electrode and in successive 20-ms time windows. within each group, differences between conditions were assessed using a non-parametric quade test between 0 and 400 ms post-stimulus. inter-group comparisons of erp amplitudes were performed using non-paired kruskal-wallis tests between 140 and 180 ms post-stimulus. results: typically developing children showed the classical voice-sensitive response over right fronto-temporal electrodes, for both speech and non-speech vocal sounds. children with asd did not show a preferential response to vocal sounds. inter-group analysis showed no difference in the processing of vocal sounds, both speech and non-speech, but significant differences in the processing of non-vocal sounds over right fronto-temporal sites. conclusions: our results demonstrate a lack of voice-preferential response in children with autism spectrum disorders. in contrast to observations in adults with asd, the lack of voice-preferential response was attributed to an atypical response to non-vocal sounds, which was overall more similar to the event-related potentials evoked by vocal sounds in both groups. this result suggests atypical maturation processes in asd impeding the specialization of temporal regions in voice processing.
addiction	night eating syndrome (nes) is commonly assessed using the night eating questionnaire (neq), a validated scale of symptom severity, which does not assess all diagnostic criteria. the night eating diagnostic questionnaire (nedq) assesses all diagnostic criteria, but has not been fully validated. the study purpose was to establish convergent validity for the nedq with the neq it was also expected that higher nedqscores would be associated with elevated depression, poorer sleep quality, ""food addiction,"" and bmi as in other studies of nes, students (n = 254) and community members (n = 468) were administered the neq nedq pittsburgh sleep quality index, zung self-report depression scale (sds), and the yale food addiction scale (yfas). convergent validity between the nedq and the neq was demonstrated; the scores were significantly positively correlated. there was good agreement between the nedqand the neq in diagnosis of nes; 56% of those diagnosed by the nedq met the threshold score on the neq while the other 44% did not. only 5 participants out of 33 who met the neq threshold score for nes did not meet the nedq diagnostic criteria. manova revealed that higher nedq was associated with higher sds and yfas scores and poorer sleep quality. full-syndrome nes by the nedq was associated with higher bmi in the community group unlike the student group. scores on all the other questionnaires were higher in the community group. the discrepancies between nedq and neq diagnosis may be due to differences in construction of the questionnaires and specifically due to the nedq being designed for diagnosis. the neq provides a convenient global score for nes severity, whereas the nedq which shows convergent validity with the neq provides clinically useful diagnostic categories.

atrial_fibrillation	objectives: this research article aims to measure the effects of group therapy on institutionalized elderly in terms of reducing depression and improving psychosocial functioning. methods: thirty elderly nursing home residents were recruited, and 16 of them elected to receive group treatment for depression and 14 declined treatment. the multidimensional observation scale for elderly subjects and the geriatric depression scale were given to both groups when group work began and again when it ended. results: clients who received group treatment experienced reductions in depression and their psychosocial functioning improved. conclusion: group work intervention was followed by reductions in the depression levels and improvements in their psychosocial functions among institutionalized elderly clients.
smoking_cessation	the link between second hand smoke exposure (shse) and health issues in children has been well established. the objective of this study was to determine if a short intervention implemented among pediatricians promotes improvement in the promotion of smoking cessation to caregivers and increase pediatricians' awareness of the smoking cessation trust (sct). pediatricians from 6 clinics were randomly assigned to the control or intervention group. all pediatricians received a survey to assess baseline knowledge, confidence and behaviors in smoking cessation promotion and utilization of the sct. pediatricians in intervention group received an educational lecture delivered by a physician. two months post intervention, pediatricians in the control and intervention group received a survey to assess changes from baseline. out of 36 general pediatricians, 27 completed the surveys for use in the analysis of this study (75%). intervention group made more referrals to the sct, compared to controls (p=0.048) and to baseline (p=0.0065). pediatricians in the intervention group were more confident in recommending the use of nrt (0.040) and schedule a follow up to discuss smoking cessation (p=0.029) after the intervention. the intervention group was more likely to refer caregivers to smoking cessation programs (p=0.027), discuss a child 's health risk from shse (0.031) and recommending the use of nrt to help quit (p=0.047) post intervention. the results from this study indicate that a short intervention can increase confidence and behavior in various parameters of smoking cessation promotion and significantly improve the rate in which pediatricians refer smoking caregivers to the sct.
anxiety	objectives to determine whether treating conditions having medically unexplained symptoms is associated with lower physician satisfaction and higher ascribed patient responsibility, and to determine whether higher ascribed patient responsibility is associated with lower physician satisfaction in treating a given condition. methods we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1504 us primary care physicians. respondents were asked how responsible patients are for two conditions with more-developed medical explanations (depression and anxiety) and two conditions with less-developed medical explanations (chronic back pain and fibromyalgia), and how much satisfaction they experienced in treating each condition. we used wald tests to compare mean satisfaction and ascribed patient responsibility between medically explained conditions and medically unexplained conditions. we conducted single-level and multilevel ordinal logistic models to test the relation between ascribed patient responsibility and physician satisfaction. results treating medically unexplained conditions elicited less satisfaction than treating medically explained conditions (wald p < 0.001). physicians attribute significantly more patient responsibility to the former (wald p < 0.005), although the magnitude of the difference is small. across all four conditions, physicians reported experiencing less satisfaction when treating symptoms that result from choices for which patients are responsible (multilevel odds ratio 0.57, p = 0.000). conclusions physicians experience less satisfaction in treating conditions characterized by medically unexplained conditions and in treating conditions for which they believe the patient is responsible.
atrial_fibrillation	some researchers have hypothesised that meteorological factors may have an impact on acute cerebrovascular diseases. the aim of this study was to determine an impact of some meteorological factors on occurrence of acute cerebrovascular events in the middle-aged kaunas population. kaunas stroke register data were used. data on meteorological factors for the time period from 2000 to 2010 were obtained from the lithuanian hydrometeorological service kaunas meteorological station. we analysed 4038 cases with stroke. ischemic strokes composed 80.4% and haemorrhagic strokes-19.6%. according to poisson regression analysis, significant negative correlation between ischemic, haemorrhagic and all types of stroke and ambient air temperature was found (beta coefficient -0.007, -0.016, -0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). results of arima showed that ambient temperature of the day of stroke onset was associated with the occurrence of ischemic, haemorrhagic and all types of stroke: when temperature was lower, the risk of stroke was higher (-0.006, -0.003, -0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). low temperature on the event day and 1 and 2 days before the event was associated with higher incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in women. low ambient temperature on the event day increased incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in subjects 55-64 years. high wind speed on the event day was associated with higher incidence of ischemic stroke in older subjects. meteorological factors may have some impact on the risk of acute cerebrovascular events. health care providers should focus on preventive measures, which can reduce these risks.
dementia	mutations in tdp-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), a fatal paralytic disease characterized by degeneration and premature death of motor neurons. the contribution of mutant tdp-43-mediated damage within motor neurons was evaluated using mice expressing a conditional allele of an als-causing tdp-43 mutant (q331k) whose broad expression throughout the central nervous system mimics endogenous tdp-43. tdp-43(q331k) mice develop age-and mutant-dependent motor deficits from degeneration and death of motor neurons. cre-recombinase-mediated excision of the tdp-43(q331k) gene from motor neurons is shown to delay onset of motor symptoms and appearance of tdp-43-mediated aberrant nuclear morphology, and abrogate subsequent death of motor neurons. however, reduction of mutant tdp-43 selectively in motor neurons did not prevent age-dependent degeneration of axons and neuromuscular junction loss, nor did it attenuate astrogliosis or microgliosis. thus, disease mechanism is non-cell autonomous with mutant tdp-43 expressed in motor neurons determining disease onset but progression defined by mutant acting within other cell types.
osteoarthritis	the effect of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (gtps) on gluteus medius (gmed) and minimus (gmin) activation in post-menopausal women is unknown. the aim of this study was to compare segmental muscle activation and variability of the gmed, gmin and tensor fascia latae (tfl) during gait in postmenopausal women with and without gtps. intramuscular electrodes were inserted into segments of gmin (x2) and gmed (x3) and a surface electrode placed on tfl. ten control participants and 8 with gtps completed six walking trials. peak amplitude, average amplitude and time to peak from each phase of the gait cycle (0-30%, 30%- toe off (to), total stance and swing) were compared between groups using independent t-tests and effect-size (es) calculations. variability of muscle activation was calculated using the mean coefficient of variation (cv). reversal of anterior gmin electromyographic burst pattern and greater average muscle activity was found in the gtps group compared to controls: 0-to for anterior gmin (p < 0.05), anterior and middle gmed (p < 0.01); 0-30% for posterior gmin (p < 0.01) and gmed (p < 0.05). no significant differences were identified in tfl. overall, this study found increased segmental gluteal muscle activation, decreased hip abduction strength, and reduced variability in muscle activation in post-menopausal women with gtps, compared with controls.

autism	previous research shows inconsistency in clinician-assigned diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (asd). we conducted an exploratory study that examined the concordance of diagnoses between a multidisciplinary assessment team and a range of independent clinicians throughout australia. nine video-taped autism diagnostic observation schedule (ados) assessments were collected from two australian sites. twenty-seven australian health professionals each observed two video-recordings and rated the degree to which the individual met the dsm-5 criteria for asd. there was 100% agreement on the diagnostic classification for only 3 of the 9 video clips (33%), with the remaining 6 clips (66%) reaching poor reliability. in addition, only 24% of the participating clinicians achieved 'good' or 'excellent' levels of agreement (cohen 's kappa >0.6) with the original asd assessment. these findings have implications for clinical guidelines for asd assessments.
bipolar_disorder	background: to compare outcomes for individuals with major depressive disorder (mdd) with or without subthreshold hypomania (mixed features) in naturalistic settings. methods: using the optum research database (1/1/2009-10/31/2014), a retrospective analysis of individuals newly diagnosed with mdd was conducted. continuous enrollment for 12-months before and after the initial mdd diagnosis was required. mdd with subthreshold hypomania (mixed features) (mdd-mf) was defined based on hypomania diagnosis within 30 days after an mdd diagnosis during the one-year follow-up period, in the absence of bipolar i diagnoses. psychiatric medication use, healthcare utilization, and costs during the one-year follow-up period were compared using multivariate logistic and gamma regressions, controlling for baseline differences. results: of 130,626 mdd individuals, 652 (0.5%) met the operational definition of mdd-mf. compared to the mdd-only group, the mdd-mf group had more suicidality (2.0% vs. 0.5%), anxiety disorders (46.8% vs. 34.0%), and substance use disorders (15.5% vs. 6.1%, all p < 0.001). more individuals with mdd-mf were treated with antidepressants (83.6% vs. 71.6%), mood stabilizers (50.5% vs. 2.7%), atypical antipsychotics (39.0% vs. 5.5%), and polypharmacy with multiple drug classes (72.1% vs. 22.7%, all p < 0.001). individuals with mdd-mf had higher hospitalizations rates (24.2% vs. 10.5%) and total healthcare costs (mean: $15,660 vs. $10,744, all p < 0.001). limitations: the commercial claims data used were not collected for research purposes and may over- or under-represent certain populations. no specific claims-based diagnostic code for mdd with mixed features exists. conclusions: greater use of mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, polypharmacy, and healthcare resources provides evidence of the complexity and severity of mdd-mf. identifying optimal treatment regimens for this population represents a major unmet medical need.
psoriatic_arthritis	after approval of the use of ustekinumab for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, patients with psoriatic arthritis have treated with this drug in daily clinical practice. the aims of this study were to describe baseline characteristics and evolution of a cohort of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treated with ustekinumab and to compare differences between patients who discontinued treatment and those who maintained. a retrospective multicenter observational study including patients who had received ustekinumab for a minimum of 3 months from 2009 to 2015 was performed. the baseline characteristics of the cohort of patients, the main indication for treatment, number and percentage of patients who maintained and discontinued treatment, reasons for discontinuation and differences between patients who discontinued and maintained ustekinumab were evaluated. fifty-eight patients were included. the main indication was dermatological (72.4% of cases), and treatment with ustekinumab was maintained in most patients (62.1% of cases) with low discontinuation by side effects and rheumatological lack of efficacy. discontinuation of ustekinumab was correlated with more number of obese patients, less presence of plaque psoriasis and more number of previous biological therapies. ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in the management of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in daily clinical practice in our cohort of patients.
stress_management	this is the first study to ascertain the value of multidisciplinary team (mdt) meetings within an early pregnancy assessment unit (epau). our national telephone survey identified that in the united kingdom, overall 37% of epau utilise regular mdt meetings. secondary and tertiary hospitals are just as likely to hold regular mdt meetings. the participants in our interview study expressed the principal benefits of regular mdt meetings as communication, education and effective stress management. the perceived additional benefits included improved care quality, better patient experience and enhanced team cohesion. during the meetings, at least, one representative from every tier of staffing was present. the caseload of the mdt meeting comprised ectopic pregnancies and pregnancies of unknown location. we propose a number of research studies, which would build on this study. such efforts will help enhance the effectiveness of the mdt-based epau service.
anxiety	backgroundpain acceptance involves willingness to experience pain and engaging in valued activities while pain is present. though pain acceptance could limit both headache-related disability and pain interference in individuals with migraine, few studies have addressed this issue. this study evaluated whether higher levels of total pain acceptance and its two subcomponents, pain willingness and activity engagement, were associated with lower levels of headache-related impairment in women who had both migraine and overweight/obesity. methodsin this cross-sectional study, participants seeking weight loss and headache relief in the women 's health and migraine trial completed baseline measures of pain acceptance (chronic pain acceptance questionnaire [cpaq]), headache-related disability (headache impact test-6), and pain interference (brief pain inventory). migraine headache frequency and pain intensity were assessed daily via smartphone diary. using cpaq total and subcomponent (pain willingness and activity engagement) scores, headache frequency, pain intensity, and body mass index (bmi) as predictors in linear regression, headache-related disability, and pain interference were modeled as outcomes. resultson average, participants (n=126; age=38.58.2 years; bmi=35.3 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2)) reported 8.4 +/- 4.7 migraine days/month and pain intensity of 6.0 +/- 1.5 on a 0-10 scale on headache days. after correcting for multiple comparisons (adjusted =.008), pain willingness was independently associated with both lower headache-related disability (p<.001; =-0.233) and pain interference (p<.001; =-0.261). activity engagement was not associated with headache-related disability (p=.128; =-0.138) and pain interference (p=.042; =-0.154). cpaq total score was not associated with headache-related disability (p=.439; =0.066) and pain interference (p=.305; =0.074). pain intensity was significantly associated with outcomes in all analyses (ps<.001; s 0.343-0.615). conclusionshigher pain willingness, independent of degree of both migraine severity and overweight, is associated with lower headache-related disability and general pain interference in treatment-seeking women with migraine and overweight/obesity. future studies are needed to clarify direction of causality and test whether strategies designed to help women increase pain willingness, or relinquish ineffective efforts to control pain, can improve functional outcomes in women who have migraine and overweight/obesity.
dementia	with degradation in quality of life, threat of brain disorders has become a serious concern from past few decades. dementia is one such abnormality which includes a group of symptoms that deteriorate cognitive functions of the brain. the use of neuroimaging techniques has revealed the abnormal anatomy of corpus callosum (cc) for diagnosing various brain disorders. this paper focuses on classification of magnetic resonance (mr) images of dementia using cc features. cc is segmented from each mid-sagittal brain mr image using k-means clustering algorithm and then used for feature extraction. significant features between demented and normal groups are identified using statistical analysis. depending upon the statistical significance, hybrid feature vectors are designed for male and female dataset. support vector machine (svm) and back propagation neural network (bpnn) classifiers are trained and tested using the designed feature vectors. considering the sexual dimorphism of cc structure, feature classification is performed separately for male and female data. this paper reports the highest classification accuracy of 97% for male data and 95% for female data.
osteoarthritis	in this paper we report the differentiating properties of platelet-rich plasma releasates (prpr) on human chondrocytes within elastomeric polycaprolactone triol-citrate (pclt-ca) porous scaffold. human-derived chondrocyte cellular content of glycosaminoglycans (gags) and total collagen were determined after seeding into pclt-ca scaffold enriched with prpr cells. immunostaining and real time pcr was applied to evaluate the expression levels of chondrogenic and extracellular gene markers. seeding of chondrocytes into pclt-ca scaffold enriched with prpr showed significant increase in total collagen and gags production compared with chondrocytes grown within control scaffold without prpr cells. the mrna levels of collagen ii and sox9 increased significantly while the upregulation in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (comp) expression was statistically insignificant. we also report the reduction of the expression levels of collagen i and iii in chondrocytes as a consequence of proximity to prpr cells within the scaffold. interestingly, the pre-loading of prpr caused an increase of expression levels of following extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins: fibronectin, laminin and integrin beta over the period of 3 days. overall, our results introduce the pclt-ca elastomeric scaffold as a new system for cartilage tissue engineering. the method of prpr cells loading prior to chondrocyte culture could be considered as a potential environment for cartilage tissue engineering as the differentiation and ecm formation is enhanced significantly.
anxiety	background: the objective of this research was to develop a caregiver-reported clinical outcome assessment (coa) measure designed to assess observable behaviors of children, ages 4 to 12 years, with autism spectrum disorder (asd) for supporting labeling claims of treatment benefit. methods: development of the measure included a review of the literature and existing instruments, conceptual disease model development, concept elicitation focus groups, item generation, and cognitive debriefing interviews. results: predominant characteristics and behaviors of asd identified by the literature and instrument reviews included sociability, communication deficits, stereotypy, inattention and hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, and familial impact. in each of the 10 instruments reviewed, evidence of content validity was limited or nonexistent. predominant themes arose across 8 major categories during concept elicitation. a total of 27 concepts were identified through focus group feedback and formed the basis for item development and cognitive pre-testing. revisions to the items yielded a final version of a daily diary containing 21 items assessing observable behaviors and characteristics of asd in children 4 to 12 years old. conclusions: the observable behaviors of asd scale (obas) was developed as a self-administered, caregiver-reported measure containing 8 predominant themes. items are scored on one of two 5-point ordinal categorical response scales, and the recall period for each item is the past 24 hours. this research provides evidence that the obas is content valid for assessing treatment benefit, which was found to be lacking in other instruments.
stress_management	brain food, e.g. l-tryptophan, antioxidative substances, b vitamins and magnesium are thought to be beneficial for obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. in the present pilot study we hypothesised that a specific amino acid mixture with micronutrients improves the cardiometabolic situation of chronically stressed persons. cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were analysed as per protocol in 32 patients. chronic stress disorders in the same patients were assessed by a psychological neurological questionnaire (pnf). after dietary intervention a reduction of the fasting serum insulin concentrations occurred in the treatment group. an association was found between pnf values, insulin concentrations at baseline and an insulin reduction after 12weeks. the results support the use of our specific dietary supplement for improved stress management and a decrease in metabolic dysfunction.
hereditary_angioedema	introduction: hereditary angioedema due to c1 inhibitor (c1-inh) deficiency (c1-inh-hae) is a rare disorder, characterized by episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal edema with unpredictable location and clinical severity. it belongs to the bradykinin-mediated angioedemas requiring specific treatment. excessive bradykinin release, the culprit behind the onset of symptoms, can be prevented by the supplementation of deficient proteins or by the inhibition of kallikrein, as well as by blocking the effects of bradykinin on its receptor with the administration of a bradykinin b2 receptor antagonist. areas covered: human plasma-derived c1-inh has been used for decades to replenish the deficient protein and lately, recombinant human c1-inh (rhc1-inh), conestat alfa (ruconest) has become available for this purpose. three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, one open label, and three open-label extension studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of rhc1-inh administered for the management of edematous episodes occurring in adolescent patients, or adult patients with c1-inh-hae regardless of the location of edema and with repeated dosing. moreover, a pilot study has shown rhc1-inh promising also for the prophylaxis of edematous attacks. expert opinion: the introduction of rhc1-inh has expanded the therapeutic options available for the management of c1-inh-hae, and advanced the individualized therapy for patients with this disease.
ankylosing_spondylitis	to describe the variability in rheumatology visits and referrals to other medical specialties of patients with spondyloarthritis (spa) and to explore factors that may influence such variability. nation-wide cross-sectional study performed in 2009-2010. randomly selected records of patients with a diagnosis of spa and at least one visit to a rheumatology unit within the previous 2 years were audited. the rates of rheumatology visits and of referrals to other medical specialties were estimated-total and between centres-in the study period. multilevel regression was used to analyse factors associated with variability and to adjust for clinical and patient characteristics. 1168 patients' records (45 centres) were reviewed, mainly ankylosing spondylitis (55.2 %) and psoriatic arthritis (22.2 %). the patients had incurred in 5908 visits to rheumatology clinics (rate 254 per 100 patient-years), 4307 visits to other medical specialties (19.6 % were referrals from rheumatology), and 775 visits to specialised nurse clinics. an adjusted variability in frequenting rheumatology clinics of 15.7 % between centres was observed. this was partially explained by the number of faculties and trainees. the adjusted intercentre variability for referrals to other specialties was 12.3 %, and it was associated with urban settings, number of procedures, and existence of spa dedicated clinics; the probability of a patient with spa of being referred to other specialist may increase up to 25 % depending on the treating centre. frequenting rheumatology clinics and referrals to other specialists significantly varies between centres, after adjustment by patient characteristics.
osteoporosis	background observational studies on osteoporotic fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes indicate their increased incidence compared to those without diabetes, but results are inconsistent. currently, type 2 diabetes is not considered as an independent risk factor for low-energy fractures in elder subjects. the aim of the study was to assess the association between type 2 diabetes and risk for hip and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. materials and methods we searched medline, web of science and cochrane databases for articles published before september 2013. studies assessing fractures in women aged >50 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, regardless of the diabetes treatment, were deemed eligible. to estimate fracture risk meta-analysis in a random effect model was performed. the results were shown by the odds ratio (or) and 95 % confidence interval (ci). heterogeneity was tested using a q-cochrane test (significance was analyzed with p < 0.10) and i-2 measure. results a total of 15 observational studies (11 cohort and 4 cross-sectional, 263.006 diabetics and 502.115 controls) were included. thirteen papers provided information on the incidence of hip fractures, and seven on vertebral ones. the meta-analysis revealed type 2 diabetes was associated with higher risk for hip fracture (or 1.296, 95 % ci (1.069-1.571), but not vertebral fracture (or = 1.134, 95 % ci (0.936-1.374). there was significant heterogeneity between hip fracture studies. american origin was identified as a potential source of such heterogeneity. conclusions the results of our meta-analysis indicate there is an increased risk for hip fracture in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.
atrial_fibrillation	purpose the aim of this prospective study was to compare in non-asian subjects the pharmacokinetics (pk), pharmacodynamics (pd), safety, and tolerability of two short-acting cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic antagonists, landiolol and esmolol, after administration of three different bolus dosages. materials and methods we conducted a single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized study in three cross-over periods with 12 healthy subjects (7 women and 5 men, mean age of 24.5 +/- 6.9 years) each receiving three doses of landiolol (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg bw) either in a newly developed concentrate i.v. formulation (rapibloca (r) 20 mg/2 ml concentrate) or a lyophilized formulation, or three doses of esmolol (0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg bw) in an i.v. formulation (brevibloca (r) 100 mg/10 ml). pk and pd parameters, safety, and tolerability were assessed. findings results of the two landiolol formulations were reported previously and were similar. for the landiolol concentrate formulation and esmolol, maximum blood concentrations were rapidly reached (mean t(max) ranged between 1.8 and 3.0 min for landiolol and 1.8 to 2.4 min for esmolol). the parent drugs disappeared very fast from the blood stream, with a t(1/2) of 3.2 +/- 1.2 (sd) minutes and 3.7 +/- 2.1 (sd) minutes for the low doses of landiolol and esmolol, respectively. despite comparable injection rates (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg/15 s for landiolol and esmolol, respectively), the onset of significant heart rate reduction occurred earlier in response to landiolol (1 min) than in response to esmolol (2 min). in addition, significantly lower heart rate values were obtained at every dose level of landiolol, in comparison to esmolol (p < 0.05). both compounds reduced the systolic blood pressure to a comparable degree. especially at the highest dose, the duration of blood pressure reduction was longer under esmolol compared to landiolol. seven mild to moderate adverse events occurred after administration of landiolol, and five occurred after administration of esmolol. no serious adverse events were reported in this study.
addiction	purpose brief intervention to reduce cannabis is a promising technique that could be adapted for use in primary care, but it has not been well studied in this setting. we tested the efficacy of a brief intervention conducted by general practitioners among cannabis users aged 15 to 25 years. methods we performed a cluster randomized controlled trial with 77 general practitioners in france. the intervention consisted of an interview designed according to the frames (feedback, responsibility, advice, menu, empathy, self-efficacy) model, while the control condition consisted of routine care. results the general practitioners screened and followed up 261 young cannabis users. after 1 year, there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in the median number of joints smoked per month among all users (17.5 vs 17.5; p=.13), but there was a difference in favor of the intervention among nondaily users (3 vs 10; p=.01). after 6 months, the intervention was associated with a more favorable change from baseline in the number of joints smoked (-33.3% vs 0%, p=.01) and, among users younger than age of 18, smoking of fewer joints per month (12.5 vs 20, p=.04). conclusions our findings suggest that a brief intervention conducted by general practitioners with french young cannabis users does not affect use overall. they do, however, strongly support use of brief intervention for younger users and for moderate users.
smoking_cessation	the role of the endocannabinoid system in nicotine addiction is being increasingly acknowledged. acute inhibition of anandamide (aea) degradation efficiently reduces nicotine withdrawal-induced affective symptoms in rats and fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah), the degradation enzyme of aea, has been proposed as a possible treatment against nicotine addiction. however, it is unclear whether chronic inhibition of aea during nicotine abstinence will have beneficial or deleterious affective side-effects. using a rat model of nicotine addiction, we found that, during abstinence, rats injected daily with a faah inhibitor (urb597) developed a depressive-like phenotype. our results show that in the nicotine abstinent rats, urb597 induced low saccharin consumption, persistent immobility in the forced swim test and increased corticosterone levels in response to stress. in addition, urb597decreased cb1 receptor binding and activity in the habenula, a key structure in the control of nicotine-related emotional states. in contrast, non-treated abstinent rats showed increased cb1 receptor activity and behaviors comparable to controls. no faah inhibition-induced alterations were observed in animals that had a previous history of saline self-administration. taken together, our results suggest that chronic faah inhibition prevents the homeostatic adaptations of habenular cb1 receptor function that are necessary for the recovery from nicotine dependence.

ankylosing_spondylitis	tumor necrosis factor-alpha(tnf-alpha) blockers are a popular therapeutic choice in a number of inflammatory diseases. thus far, five tnf-alpha blockers have been approved for clinical use (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab. and certolizumab). despite being considered relatively safe, serious side effects associated with immune suppression have been reported, including central and peripheral nervous system (cns) demyelinating disorders. it is still elusive whether these events are mere coincidence or a side effect of anti-tnf-alpha use. in this paper, we review the published case reports of cns demyelination associated with anti-tnf-alpha therapy and present the follow-up of our 4 previously reported patients who developed neurologic symptoms suggestive of cns demyelination after having received anti-tnf-alpha treatment. we also discuss the possible role of tnf-alpha blockers in demyelination.
autism	epidemiological studies show that maternal immune activation (mia) during pregnancy is a risk factor for autism. however, mechanisms for how mia affects brain development and behaviors in offspring remain poorly described. to determine whether placental interleukin-6 (il-6) signaling is required for mediating mia on the offspring, we generated mice with restricted deletion of the receptor for il-6 (il-6rot) in placental trophoblasts (cyp19-cre(+);ll6ra(fl/fl)), and tested offspring of cyp19-cre(+);ll6ra(fl/fl) mothers for immunological, pathological and behavioral abnormalities following induction of mia. we reveal that mia results in acute inflammatory responses in the fetal brain. lack of il-6 signaling in trophoblasts effectively blocks mia-induced inflammatory responses in the placenta and the fetal brain. furthermore, behavioral abnormalities and cerebellar neuropathologies observed in mia control offspring are prevented in cyp19-cre(+);ll6ra(fl/fl)l offspring. our results demonstrate that il-6 activation in placenta is required for relaying inflammatory signals to the fetal brain and impacting behaviors and neuropathologies relevant to neurodevelopmental disease.

asthma	background: the mechanism of t(h)2/t(h)17-predominant and t(h)2/t(h)17-low asthma is unknown. objective: we sought to study the immune mechanism of t(h)2/t(h)17-predominant and t(h)2/t(h)17-low asthma. methods: in a previously reported cohort of 60 asthmatic patients, 16 patients were immunophenotyped witht(h)2/t(h)17-predominant asthma and 22 patients with t(h)2/t(h)17-low asthma. we examined bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid leukocytes, cytokines, mediators, and epithelial cell function for these asthma subgroups. results: patients with t(h)2/t(h)17-predominant asthma had increased il-1 beta, il-6, il-23, c3a, and serum amyloid a levels in bal fluid, and these correlated with il-1 beta and c3a levels. t(h)2/t(h)17 cells expressed higher levels of the il-1 receptor and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. anakinra, an il-1 receptor antagonist protein, inhibited balt(h)2/t(h)17 cell counts. t(h)2/t(h)17-low asthma had 2 distinct subgroups: neutrophilic asthma (45%) and pauci-inflammatory asthma (55%). this contrasted with patients with t(h)2/t(h)17-predominant and t(h)2-predominant asthma, which included neutrophilic asthma in 6% and 0% of patients, respectively. bal fluid neutrophils strongly correlated with bal fluid myeloperoxidase, il-8, il-1a, il-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and gm-csf levels. sixty percent of the patients with neutrophilic asthma had a pathogenic microorganism in bal culture, which suggested a subclinical infection. conclusion: we uncovered a critical role for the il-1 beta pathway in patients with t(h)2/t(h)17-predminant asthma. a subgroup of patients with t(h)2/t(h)17-low asthma had neutrophilic asthma and increased bal fluid il-1 alpha, il-6, il-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and gm-csf levels. il-1 alpha was directly involved in il-8 production and likely contributed to neutrophilic asthma. sixty percent of neutrophilic patients had a subclinical infection.
smoking_cessation	background: smoking is an important risk factor for mental health-related problems. numerous studies have supported a bi-directional association between cigarette smoking and depression. despite the advances in understanding the comorbidity between both problems, the most effective psychological treatment that simultaneously targets smoking and depressive symptomatology remains unclear. the objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral intervention for smoking cessation with components of behavioral activation for managing depressed mood. method: a single blind, three-arm, superiority randomized controlled trial is proposed. participants will be smokers over 18 years old, who smoke at least 8 cigarettes per day. participants will be randomized to one of three conditions, using a 2: 2: 1 allocation ratio: 1) standard cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment; 2) standard cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment plus behavioral activation; or 3) a three-month delayed treatment control group. the primary outcome measures will be biochemically verified point-prevalence abstinence (carbon monoxide in expired air) and significant change from baseline in depressive symptoms to the end of treatment, and at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. discussion: this study aims to assess the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention with behavioral activation components for smoking cessation and depressive symptoms, compared to a standard cognitive-behavioral intervention to quit smoking. as the relation between depressive symptoms, even at subclinical levels, and quitting smoking difficulties is well known, we expect that such intervention will allow obtaining higher abstinence rates, lower relapse rates, and mood improvement.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: interstitial lung disease (ild) is frequent complication of systemic sclerosis (ssc) and mixed connective tissue disease (mctd). the disease is heterogeneous, and its outcome is unpredictable. some patients have severe and progressive deterioration of ild, which is the leading cause of mortality. we aimed to determine whether serum levels of krebs von den lungen-6 (kl-6) and surfactant protein-d (sp-d) correlate with ssc/mctd-associated ild activity. methods: we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 40 patients with ssc/mctd-associated ild: 29 patients with ssc and 11 patients with mctd. measurement of serum kl-6 and sp-d levels, pulmonary function tests, and high-resolution computed tomography (hrct) performed in parallel were reviewed. results: serum kl-6 correlated positively with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (dlco) (% predicted) and disease extent on hrct, and the changes in serum levels of kl-6 were significantly related to the changes in forced vital capacity (fvc) in ssc/mctd-associated ild. on the other hand, multivariate logistic regression analyses with calculation of the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve suggested that a higher serum level of sp-d was a significant predictor of fvc decline in ssc/mctd-associated ild. conclusions: our study suggests that serum kl-6 can be a useful monitoring tool of ssc/mctd-associated ild activity. in contrast, serum sp-d may be a significant predictor of potential fvc decline in the short term.
children's_health	background the nurse-family partnership (nfp) is a home visiting program serving first-time, low-income mothers, with an area of focus on healthy early childhood development. previous foundational trials of program effect on breastfeeding and immunizations have shown a mix of neutral and positive results. the present evaluation investigates these effects following program scale-up, using a large contemporary cohort of clients. methods nurse-family partnership client breastfeeding and immunization status were compared to national survey of children 's health data and national immunization survey data, respectively. sample differences in demographic covariates were adjusted using logistic regression. results nurse-family partnership clients were significantly more likely to have ever breastfed (adjusted prevalence ratio [apr: 1.20 (1.17, 1.23)] and maintain breastfeeding at 6 [apr: 1.17 (1.10, 1.24)] and 12 [apr: 1.39 (1.25, 1.53)] months, but less likely to exclusively breastfeed at 6 months [apr: 0.84 (0.70, 0.95)] nfp clients were significantly more likely to be up-to-date on immunizations at 6 [apr: 1.23 (1.22, 1.25)], 18 [apr: 1.33 (1.30,1.35)], and 24 [apr: 1.15 (1.14, 1.16)] months of age than the reference cohort, with no significant difference at 12 months. discussion nurse-family partnership clients had more beneficial breastfeeding and immunization outcomes than children of mothers with demographically similar profiles. however, exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months lags behind the reference sample and represents a potential area for further improvement.
atrial_fibrillation	background: hypertension and chronic kidney disease (ckd) are common conditions and both are major risk factors for cardiovascular events. the objectives were 1) to study the prevalence of ckd in hypertensive patients and 2) to study the association of ckd with cardiac and vascular complications in a multicenter, nation-wide fashion. methods: this cross-sectional study evaluated patients aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with hypertension and who had been treated for at least 12 months at 831 public hospitals in thailand during the 2012 study period. outcome measurements included calculated glomerular filtration rate (gfr) and cardiac and vascular complications that included coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. multivariable modeling was conducted to determine independent factors associated with increased risk of cardiac and vascular complications. results: a total of 28770 patients were enrolled. average age was 62.8 years and 37% were male. prevalence of ckd stage 3 and 4-5 was 33.2 and 4.3%, respectively. prevalence of cardiac and vascular complications was 10. 5% (5% having coronary artery disease, 3.9% stroke, 1.7% heart failure, and 1.2% atrial fibrillation). ckd was an independent risk factor associated with each of the complications and overall cardiac and vascular complications with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.4 for ckd stage 3 and 1.9 for ckd stage 4-5. conclusion: prevalence of ckd stage 3-5 in hypertensive population was 37.5%. ckd is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiac and vascular outcome.
anxiety	neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic pain condition occurring after damage in the nervous system and is refractory to the currently available treatments. major challenges include elucidating its mechanisms and developing new medications to treat it. nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity involves aberrant excitability in spinal dorsal horn (sdh) neurons as a consequence of dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons and of hyperactivity of glial cells, especially microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system. evidence of this is found using animal models to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuropathic pain. the pathologically altered somatosensory signals in the sdh then convey to the brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (acc). in these regions, nerve injury produces pre- and postsynaptic long-term plasticity, which contributes to negative emotions and anxiety associated with chronic pain conditions. furthermore, recent evidence also indicates that the descending projection pathways from the acc directly and indirectly to the sdh (the top-down corticospinal network) regulate nociceptive sensory transmission in the sdh. thus, understanding a possible connection between the sdh and acc, including a neuron-microglia interaction, may provide us with insights into the mechanisms used to amplify pain signals related to neuropathic pain and clues to aid the development of new therapeutic agents for the management of chronic pain.
dementia	objective: to evaluate a modified extended timed up and go (extended-tug) assessment against a panel of validated clinical assessments, as an indicator of parkinson 's disease (pd) severity and cognitive impairment. methods: eighty-seven participants with idiopathic pd were sequentially recruited from a movement disorders clinic. an extended-tug assessment was employed which required participants to stand from a seated position, walk in a straight line for 7 m, turn 180 and then return to the start, in a seated position. the extended-tug assessment duration was correlated to a panel of clinical assessments, including the unified parkinson 's disease rating scale (mds-updrs), quality of life (pdq-39), scales for outcomes in parkinson 's disease (scopa-cog), revised addenbrooke 's cognitive index (ace-r) and barratt 's impulsivity scale 11 (bis-11). results: extended-tug time was significantly correlated to mds-updrs iii score and to scopa-cog, ace-r (p < 0.001) and pdq-39 scores (p < 0.01). generalized linear models determined the extended-tug to be a sole variable in predicting ace-r or scopa-cog scores. patients in the fastest extended-tug tertile were predicted to perform 8.3 and 13.4 points better in the scopa-cog and ace-r assessments, respectively, than the slowest group. patients who exceeded the dementia cut-off scores with these instruments exhibited significantly longer extended-tug times. conclusions: extended-tug performance appears to be a useful indicator of cognition as well as motor function and quality of life in pd, and warrants further evaluation as a first line assessment tool to monitor disease severity and response to treatment. poor extended-tug performance may identify patients without overt cognitive impairment form whom cognitive assessment is needed.

autism	across three experiments, we examined the efficacy of three cues from the human body-body orientation, head turning, and eye-gaze direction-to shift an observer 's attention in space. using a modified posner cueing paradigm, we replicate the previous findings of gender differences in the gaze-cueing effect whereby female but not male participants responded significantly faster to validly cued than to invalidly cued targets. in contrast to the previous studies, we report a robust cueing effect for both male and female participants when head turning direction was used as the central cue, whereas oriented bodies proved ineffectual as cues to attention for both males and females. these results are discussed with reference to the time course of central cueing effects, gender differences in spatial attention, and current models of how cues from the human body are combined to judge another person 's direction of attention.
ankylosing_spondylitis	aims. to compare the efficacy and the safety of low-dose (3.5 mg/kg) or standard-dose (5 mg/kg) of infliximab (ifx) for induction and maintenance treatment in chinese patients with intestinal behcet 's disease (bd), and to identify potential predictors to corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 30. methods. a prospective trial was conducted in 20 patients with moderate-to-severe active intestinal bd, followed up for 30 weeks. ileocolonoscopic examinations were done at baseline and week 14. a logistic regression model was used to assess the predictors of corticosteroid-free remission at week 30. results. as the primary end point, steroid-free remission at week 30 was observed in 40% and 60% of patients who received low and standard doses of ifx, respectively (p >0.371). as the secondary end point, the mucosal healing (mh) rates at week 14 were found to be 60% for both low and standard doses of ifx. the clinical response rates at week 14 and 30 were also similar in both groups. only mh at week 14 predicted steroid-free clinical remission at week 30. conclusions. low-dose of ifx is effective and safe for induction and maintenance therapy in patients with active intestinal bd. mh at week 14 predicted clinical remission at week 30.
medicare	objectives this study evaluated the contributions of obesity and changes in body mass index (bmi) in mid-life to long-term heart failure (hf) risk independent of cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) levels. background obesity and low crf are well-established risk factors for hf. however, given the inverse association between crf and obesity, the independent contributions of bmi toward hf risk are not fully understood. methods we included 19,485 participants from the cooper center longitudinal study who survived to receive medicare coverage, from 1999 to 2009. crf was estimated in metabolic equivalents (mets) according to balke treadmill time. associations of bmi and bmi change with hf hospitalization after age 65 were assessed by applying a proportional hazards recurrent events model to the failure time data. results after 127,110 person-years of follow-up, we observed 1,038 hf hospitalization events. higher mid-life bmi was significantly associated with greater risk of hf hospitalization after adjusting for established hf risk factors (hazard ratio [hr]: 1.19; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.12 to 1.26 per 3 kg/m(2) higher bmi). this association was attenuated after adjusting for crf (hr: 1.10; 95% ci: 1.03 to 1.17 per 3 kg/m(2) higher bmi). crf accounted for 47% of the hf risk associated with bmi. bmi change was not significantly associated with risk of hf in older age after adjustment for crf change. conclusions higher bmi-associated risk of hf is explained largely by differences in crf levels. furthermore, bmi change is not significantly associated with hf risk after adjusting for crf changes. these findings highlight the importance of crf in mediating bmi-associated hf risk.

kidney_health	the kidneys exhibit age-associated deterioration in function via a loss of 20% to 25% kidney mass, particularly from the renal cortex and increased fibrosis. oxidative stress has been found to mediate age-associated renal cell injury and cell death, particularly apoptosis. oxidative stress results from an imbalance between the levels of free radicals generated during aerobic metabolism, inflammation, and infection and the safe breakdown of these species by endogenous and exogenous scavengers. other factors may influence these pathologies. for example, growth hormone and caloric restriction have been shown to influence life span, although neither method of prolonging life is likely to find general acceptance in humans. some genetic knockout models offer promise; for example, knockout of the p66 isoform of the shc gene in mice increases life span by 30%, but appetite, size, and fertility are retained. whether the increase in life span is via increased kidney health is not yet clear, but decreasing the age-related renal pathologies will no doubt aid in increasing life span and health in general. this review looks at the role and modulation of factors that influence life span, in particular modulation of oxidative stress, with particular relevance to age-related renal pathologies.

children's_health	this study investigated the role of self-esteem, social (need to belong, loneliness, competitiveness, and shyness), and health (smoking, drinking) behaviors in hungarian adolescents' psychosomatic symptoms. our sample of 490 students (ages 14-19 years) from debrecen (hungary) completed the questionnaires. besides descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression analyses were applied to test interrelationships. frequency analysis revealed that fatigue was the most commonly experienced psychosomatic symptom in this sample, followed by sleeping problems and (lower) back pain. girls reported experiencing more symptoms. multiple regression analyses suggested that (1) need to belong, shyness, and competitiveness may serve as social behavioral risk factors for adolescents' psychosomatic symptomatology, whereas (2) self-esteem may play a protective role. the role of social and health behaviors was modified when analyzed by gender: the psychosomatic index score was positively related to smoking and shyness among girls, and need to belong among boys. self-esteem provided protection for both sexes. conclusion: we conclude that problems with social relationships (namely, unmet need to belong, competitiveness, and shyness) may lead to psychosomatic health complaints, whereas self-esteem may serve as a protection. findings suggest that social skills training and strengthening self-esteem should be an important part of children 's health promotion programs in schools to improve their psychosomatic health and well-being.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: the sacroiliac joint and spine are seen on abdominal computed tomography (ct) and may show structural lesions as part of spondyloarthritis. purpose: to determine the prevalence of ct features of spondyloarthritis in patients with crohn 's disease (cd). material and methods: a retrospective study of structural lesions of spondyloarthritis on abdominal ct was performed. the sacroiliac joints and spine of 120 patients were studied: study group i consisted of 40 patients with known cd and inflammatory back pain, group ii involved 40 patients with cd without inflammatory back pain, and group iii consisted of 40 patients without known joint or inflammatory bowel disease. recorded ct features included sclerosis, erosions or ankylosis of the sacroiliac joint, enthesopathy, spinal syndesmophytes, and costovertebral joint lesions. results: ct showed structural lesions of the sacroiliac joints in 19/40 (48%) patients with cd and inflammatory back pain (sclerosis [n=14; 35%], erosions [n=14; 35%], ankylosis [n=3; 8%]), in 8/40 (8%) patients with cd without inflammatory back pain (sclerosis [n=3; 8%], erosions [n=4; 10%], ankylosis [n=3; 8%]), and in 3/40 (8%) patients without known joint or bowel disease (sclerosis [n=2; 5%], ankylosis [n=1; 3%]). syndesmophytes were exclusively seen in group i (n=6; 15%). conclusion: ct of the abdomen in patients with cd and inflammatory back pain shows structural lesions of the sacroiliac joint, entheses, or spine in almost half of the patients. awareness and knowledge of these findings may guide the referring clinician to further clinical evaluation, imaging, and biomarker evaluation of the disease.
anxiety	background and objectives: cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) and acceptance and commitment therapy (act) have both garnered empirical support for the effective treatment of social anxiety disorder. however, not every patient benefits equally from either treatment. identifying moderators of treatment outcome can help to better understand which treatment is best suited for a particular patient. methods: forty-nine individuals who met criteria for social anxiety disorder were assessed as part of a randomized controlled trial comparing 12 weeks of cbt and act. pre-treatment avoidance of social situations (measured via a public speaking task and clinician rating) was investigated as a moderator of post-treatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up social anxiety symptoms, stress reactivity, and quality of life. results: public speaking avoidance was found to be a robust moderator of outcome measures, with more avoidant individuals generally benefitting more from cbt than act by 12-month follow-up. in contrast, clinician-rated social avoidance was not found to be a significant moderator of any outcome measure. limitations: results were found only at 12-month follow-up. more comprehensive measures of avoidance would be useful for the field moving forward. conclusions: findings inform personalized medicine, suggesting that social avoidance measured behaviorally via a public speaking task may be a more robust factor in treatment prescription compared to clinician-rated social avoidance. published by elsevier ltd.
bipolar_disorder	objective: to use receiver-operating characteristics analysis to identify multilevel diagnostic likelihood ratios and provide a framework for the diagnosis of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) in children (5-10 years old) and adolescents (11-18 years old) in an outpatient setting. method: caregiver, teacher, and youth reports from the achenbach system of empirically based assessment (aseba) were obtained for 299 children and 321 adolescents with multiple imputation of missing data. the reference standard was diagnosis of adhd based on case history and a semistructured diagnostic interview masked to the aseba measurements. results: in children, caregiver-reported attention problems (area under the curve [auc] = 0.74) outperformed all other subscales of the caregiver and teacher measures (aucs <= 0.72). in the older sample, caregiver- and teacher-reported attention problems (caregiver auc = 0.73; teacher auc = 0.61) were best at identifying adhd. inclusion of caregiver and teacher reports significantly (p <.001 for all comparisons) increased prediction of adhd diagnosis, whereas youth self-report did not. conclusion: caregiver-reported attention problems were more useful than teacher-reports and self-report in identifying adhd. combining caregiver and teacher reports improved identification. multilevel likelihood ratios are provided to facilitate routine clinical use.
kidney_health	background: we quantified the impact of lifestyle and dietary modifications on chronic kidney disease (ckd) by estimating population-attributable fractions (pafs). study design: observational cohort study. setting & participants: middle-aged adults with type 2 diabetes but without severe albuminuria from the ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget; n = 6,916). factors: modifiable lifestyle/dietary risk factors, such as physical activity, size of social network, alcohol intake, tobacco use, diet, and intake of various food items. outcomes: the primary outcome was ckd, ascertained as moderate to severe albuminuria or >= 5% annual decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) after 5.5 years. the competing risk for death was considered. paf was defined as the proportional reduction in ckd or mortality (within 5.5 years) that would occur if exposure to a risk factor was changed to an optimal level. results: at baseline, median urinary albumin-creatinine ratio and egfr were 6.6 (iqr, 2.9-25.0) mg/mmol and 71.5 (iqr, 58.1-85.9) ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. after 5.5 years, 704 (32.5%) participants developed albuminuria, 1,194 (55.2%) had a >= 5% annualegfrdecline, 267 (12.3%) had both, and 1,022 (14.8%) had died. being physically active every day has pafs of 5.1%(95% ci, 0.5%-9.6%) for ckd and 12.3%(95% ci, 4.9%-19.1%) for death. among food items, increasing vegetable intake would have the largest impact on population health. considering diet, weight, physical activity, tobacco use, and size of social network, exposure to less than optimum levels gives pafs of 13.3% (95% ci, 5.5%-20.9%) for ckd and 37.5% (95% ci, 27.8%-46.7%) for death. for the 17.8 million middle-aged americans with diabetes, improving 1 of these lifestyle behaviors to the optimal range could reduce the incidence or progression of ckd after 5.5 years by 274,000 and the number of deaths within 5.5 years by 405,000. limitations: ascertainment of changes in kidney measures does not precisely match the definitions for incidence or progression of ckd. conclusions: healthy lifestyle and diet are associated with less ckd and mortality and may have a substantial impact on population kidney health. am j kidney dis. 68(1): 29-40.

dementia	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is a common form of dementia in aged people, which is defined by two pathological characteristics: beta-amyloid protein (a beta) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. although the mechanisms of ad development are still being debated, a series of evidence supports the idea that metals, such as copper, iron, zinc, magnesium and aluminium, are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. in particular, the processes of a beta deposition in senile plaques (sp) and the inclusion of phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (nfts) are markedly influenced by alterations in the homeostasis of the aforementioned metal ions. moreover, the mechanisms of oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, neurotoxicity, autophagy and apoptosis mediate the effects of metal ions-induced the aggregation state of a beta and phosphorylated tau on ad development. more importantly, imbalance of these mechanisms finally caused cognitive decline in different experiment models. collectively, reconstructing the signaling network that regulates ad progression by metal ions may provide novel insights for developing chelators specific for metal ions to combat ad.

autism	modeling brain disorders has always been one of the key tasks in neurobiological studies. a wide range of organisms including worms, fruit flies, zebrafish, and rodents have been used for modeling brain disorders. however, whether complicated neurological and psychiatric symptoms can be faithfully mimicked in animals is still debatable. in this review, we discuss key findings using non-human primates to address the neural mechanisms underlying stress and anxiety behaviors, as well as technical advances for establishing genetically-engineered non-human primate models of autism spectrum disorders and other disorders. considering the close evolutionary connections and similarity of brain structures between non-human primates and humans, together with the rapid progress in genome-editing technology, non-human primates will be indispensable for pathophysiological studies and exploring potential therapeutic methods for treating brain disorders.
atopic_dermatitis	a new in vitro model based on the electrical resistance properties of the skin barrier has been established in this laboratory. the model utilises a tape stripping procedure in dermatomed pig skin that removes a specific proportion of the stratum corneum, mimicking impaired barrier function observed in humans with damaged skin. the skin penetration and distribution of chemicals with differing physicochemical properties, namely; benzoic acid, 3-aminophenol, caffeine and sucrose has been assessed in this model. although, skin penetration over 24 h differed for each chemical, compromising the skin did not alter the shape of the time course profile, although absorption into receptor fluid was higher for each chemical. systemic exposure (receptor fluid, epidermis and dermis), was marginally higher in compromised skin following exposure to the fast penetrant, benzoic acid, and the slow penetrant sucrose. the systemically available dose of 3-aminophenol increased to a greater extent and the absorption of caffeine was more than double in compromised skin, suggesting that molecular weight and log p-ow are not the only determinants for assessing systemic exposure under these conditions. although further investigations are required, this in vitro model may be useful for prediction of dermal route exposure under conditions where skin barrier is impaired.

asthma	piper nigrum l. fruits are not only a prized spice, but also highly valued therapeutic agent that heals many ailments including asthma, cold and respiratory problems. herein, we have investigated structural features and in vivo antitussive activity of three fractions isolated from piper nigrum fruits. the water extract (pn-we) upon fractionation with etoh yielded two fractions: a soluble fraction (pn-esf) and a precipitated (pn-epf) one. the existence of a pectic polysaccharide with arabinogalactan type ii side chains (147 kda) in pn-epf and piperine in pn-esf were revealed. moreover, oligosaccharides providing fine structural details of side chains were generated from pn-epf and then characterized. the parental water extract (pn-we) that contained both pectic polysaccharide and piperine, after oral administration (50 mg kg(-1) body weight) to guinea pigs, showed antitussive activity comparable to codeine phosphate (10 mg kg(-1) body weight). the etoh precipitated fraction (pn-epf) containing pectic polysaccharide showed comparatively higher antitussive activity than etoh soluble fraction (pn-esf) that contained piperine, but their potencies are lower than the parental water extract. significantly, the specific airway smooth muscle reactivity of all three fractions remained unchanged. finally, pectic polysaccharide-piperine combination in parental extract synergistically enhances antitussive effect in guinea pigs.

osteoporosis	prior studies suggest that increased urine albumin is associated with a heightened fracture risk in women, but results in men are unclear. we used data from osteoporotic fractures in men (mros), a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged 65 years, to evaluate the association of increased urine albumin with subsequent fractures and annualized rate of hip bone loss. we calculated albumin/creatinine ratio (acr) from urine collected at the 2003-2005 visit. subsequent clinical fractures were ascertained from triannual questionnaires and centrally adjudicated by review of radiographic reports. total hip bmd was measured by dxa at the 2003-2005 visit and again an average of 3.5 years later. we estimated risk of incident clinical fracture using cox proportional hazards models, and annualized bmd change using ancova. of 2982 men with calculable acr, 9.4% had acr 30mg/g (albuminuria) and 1.0% had acr 300mg/g (macroalbuminuria). during a mean of 8.7 years of follow-up, 20.0% of men had an incident clinical fracture. in multivariate-adjusted models, neither higher acr quintile (p for trend 0.75) nor albuminuria (hr versus no albuminuria, 0.89; 95% ci, 0.65 to 1.20) was associated with increased risk of incident clinical fracture. increased urine albumin had a borderline significant, multivariate-adjusted, positive association with rate of total hip bone loss when modeled in acr quintiles (p=0.06), but not when modeled as albuminuria versus no albuminuria. macroalbuminuria was associated with a higher rate of annualized hip bone loss compared to no albuminuria (-1.8% more annualized loss than in men with acr <30mg/g; p<0.001), but the limited prevalence of macroalbuminuria precluded reliable estimates of its fracture associations. in these community-dwelling older men, we found no association between urine albumin levels and risk of incident clinical fracture, but found a borderline significant, positive association with rate of hip bone loss.

psoriatic_arthritis	objective. an international task force has recommended that disease remission or minimal disease activity (mda) be the target of treatment for psoriatic arthritis (psa) and that remission or mda should be attained within 6 months of initiating medication. the aim of this study was to establish the proportion of patients with psa who achieve mda after 6 months of methotrexate (mtx) treatment. methods. patients who initiated mtx and were naive to biologics between 2004 and 2014 were included. the primary outcome was the achievement of mda after 6 months of mtx, defined as the presence of at least 5 out of the following 7: tender joint count <= 1, swollen joint count (sjc) <= 1, psoriasis area severity index (pasi) <= 1 or body surface area <= 3%, tender entheseal points <= 1, health assessment questionnaire score <= 0.5, patient global disease activity visual analog scale (vas) score <= 20, and patient pain vas <= 15. of 204 patients identified, 167 were treated with mtx for at least 3 months and had sufficient data for analysis at 6 months. results. at 6 months, 29 patients (17.4%) achieved mda; 97 patients (58.1%) achieved an sjc <= 1 and 138 (82.6%) a pasi <= 1. only 22 (13.2%) achieved the patient global disease activity criterion. lower back pain and dactylitis were associated with a lower probability of achieving mda. conclusion. mtx use achieves mda by 6 months in < 20% of patients. this compares unfavorably with data for tumor necrosis factor inhibitor use.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: to determine the association of new-onset atrial fibrillation with outcomes, including icu length of stay and survival. design: retrospective cohort of icu admissions. we found atrial fibrillation using automated detection (>= 90 s in 30 min) and classed as new-onset if there was no prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. we identified determinants of new-onset atrial fibrillation and, using propensity matching, characterized its impact on outcomes. setting: tertiary care academic center. patients: a total of 8,356 consecutive adult admissions to either the medical or surgical/trauma/burn icu with available continuous electrocardiogram data. interventions: none. measurements and main results: from 74 patient-years of every 15-minute observations, we detected atrial fibrillation in 1,610 admissions (19%), with median burden less than 2%. most atrial fibrillation was paroxysmal; less than 2% of admissions were always in atrial fibrillation. new-onset atrial fibrillation was sub clinical or went undocumented in 626, or 8% of all icu admissions. advanced age, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis were the strongest predictors of new-onset atrial fibrillation. in propensity-adjusted regression analyses, clinical new-onset atrial fibrillation was associated with increased hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% ci, 1.01-2.63) and longer length of stay (2.25 d; ci, 0.58-3.92). new-onset atrial fibrillation was not associated with survival after hospital discharge (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% ci, 0.76-1.28 and hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% ci, 0.67-1.83, respectively, for subclinical and clinical new-onset atrial fibrillation). conclusions: automated analysis of continuous electrocardiogram heart rate dynamics detects new-onset atrial fibrillation in many icu patients. though often transient and frequently unrecognized, new-onset atrial fibrillation is associated with poor hospital outcomes.
osteoporosis	background: teriparatide (recombinant human parathyroid hormone 1-34) is increasingly used for the treatment of severe osteoporosis because it stimulates bone formation and may potentially enhance fracture healing. the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of teriparatide versus a bisphosphonate on radiographic outcomes in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (ovcf). methods: a total of 98 patients undergoing non-operative treatment for recent single-level ovcf were reviewed retrospectively. thirty-eight patients were treated by a once-daily subcutaneous injection of 20 micrograms of teriparatide (tpd group), whereas 60 patients received 35 mg of alendronate weekly (bp group). except for these medications, the same treatment protocol was applied to both groups. the radiographic assessments included union status, vertebral kyphosis, and mid-vertebral body height. the rates of fracture site surgical intervention were also compared between the two groups. the mean follow-up period was 27 months (median 22.5, range 2 - 75 months). results: cox regression analysis showed that tpd reduced the time-to-union (adjusted relative hazard ratio: 1.86, 95% c.i.: 1.21 - 2.83). the union rate at six months after treatment was 89% in the tpd group and 68% in the bp group; the surgical intervention rate was significantly higher in the tpd group (p = 0.026, adjusted odds ratio: 8.15, 95% c.i.: 2.02 - 43.33). the change in local kyphosis was 4.6 degrees in the tpd group and 3.8 degrees in the bp group (p = 0.495, paired t-test). the change of mid-vertebral body height was 4.4 mm in the tpd group and 3.4 mm in the bp group (p = 0.228, paired t-test). fracture site surgical interventions were not required in the tpd group; however, two patients in the bp group eventually underwent surgical treatment for symptomatic non-union or vertebral collapse. conclusions: this retrospective study suggests that teriparatide may enhance fracture healing and improve the union rate in ovcf.
healthy_sleep	rationale: despite substantial public interest, few recommendations on the promotion of good sleep health exist to educate health care providers and the general public on the importance of sleep for overall health. objectives: the aim of this american thoracic society (ats) statement is to provide a review of the current scientific literature to assist health care providers, especially pulmonologists and sleep physicians, in making recommendations to patients and the general public about the importance of achieving good quality and adequate quantity of sleep. methods: ats members were invited, based on their expertise in sleep medicine, and their conclusions were based on both empirical evidence identified after comprehensive literature review and clinical experience. main results: we focus on sleep health in both children and adults, including the impact of occupation on sleep, the public health implications of drowsy driving, and the common sleep disorders of obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. this ats statement also delineates gaps in research and knowledge that should be addressed and lead to new focused research priorities to advance knowledge in sleep and sleep health. conclusions: good quality and quantity of sleep are essential for good health and overall quality of life; therefore a strong recommendation was made for the implementation of public education programs on the importance of sleep health.
smoking_cessation	objective: fixed incentives have been largely unsuccessful in improving adherence to antiretroviral medication. therefore, we evaluate whether small incentives based on behavioral economic theory can increase adherence to antiretroviral medication among treatment-mature adults in kampala, uganda. design: a randomized control trial design tests whether providing small incentives based on either attending timely clinic visits (intervention group 1) or achieving high medication adherence (intervention group 2) can increase antiretroviral adherence. antiretroviral adherence is measured by medical event monitoring system (mems) caps. methods: overall, 155 hiv-infected men and women age 19-78 were randomized into one of two intervention groups and received small prizes of us $ 1.50 awarded through a drawing conditional on either attending scheduled clinic appointments or achieving at least 90% antiretroviral adherence. the control group received the usual standard of care. results: preliminary results based on pooling the intervention groups showed individuals receiving incentives were 23.7 percentage points more likely to achieve 90% antiretroviral adherence compared with the control group [95% confidence interval (ci), 6.7-40.7%]. specifically, 63.3% (95% ci, 52.9-72.8%) of participants in the pooled intervention groups maintained at least 90% mean adherence during the first 9 months of the intervention, compared with 39.6% (95% ci, 25.8-54.7%) in the control group. conclusion: small prize incentives resulted in a statistically significant increase in antiretroviral adherence. although more traditional fixed incentives have not produced the desired results, these findings suggest that small incentives based on behavioral economic theory may be more effective in motivating long-term adherence among treatment-mature adults. copyright (c)2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
anxiety	purpose of study: elderly peoples' values and preferences for end-of-life care have not yet known in details. the aim of the present study was to investigate the end-of-life wishes and decision making among japanese elderly people who required home care services. the study was designed to qualitative research strategies, using face to face interview data recorded in nursing care records, with a focus on advance care planning. design and methods: a total of 102 elderly people (47 males, 55 females) of 6 home care support offices in hyogo prefecture participated. results and implications: we finally extracted the following 5 themes: anxiety about the future, abandonment of control, clinging to current daily life, precarious mutual support, delegating decision-making. while elderly people living at home generally feel anxious and fearful about the future, they seemed to try to avoid thinking too seriously about possible complications in their life. they also tend to leave end-of-life decision to someone else, and their decisions tend to change as they advance in age and as their condition deteriorates. our findings suggest that medical professionals and care managers always support their patients' decisions, allowing for the views of the informal caregivers on whom elderly people rely for decision-making.

autism	searching for effective biomarkers is one of the most challenging tasks in the research field of autism spectrum disorder (asd). magnetic resonance imaging (mri) provides a non-invasive and powerful tool for investigating changes in the structure, function, maturation, connectivity, and metabolism of the brain of children with asd. here, we review the more recent mri studies in young children with asd, aiming to provide candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of childhood asd. the review covers structural imaging methods, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional mri, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. future advances in neuroimaging techniques, as well as cross-disciplinary studies and large-scale collaborations will be needed for an integrated approach linking neuroimaging, genetics, and phenotypic data to allow the discovery of new, effective biomarkers.
osteoporosis	background: bisphosphonate therapy may have actions beyond bone, including effects on cardiovascular, immune and muscle function. we tested whether bisphosphonate treatment is associated with improved outcomes in older people undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. methods: analysis of prospectively collected, linked routine clinical datasets. participants were divided into never users of bisphosphonates, use prior to rehabilitation only, use after rehabilitation only, and current users (use before and after rehabilitation). we calculated change in 20-point barthel scores during rehabilitation, adjusting for comorbid disease and laboratory data using multivariable regression analysis. cox regression analyses were performed to analyse the association between bisphosphonate use and time to death or hospitalisation. results: 2797 patients were included in the analysis. current bisphosphonate users showed greater improvement in barthel score during rehabilitation than non-users (5.0 points [95% ci 4.3-5.7] vs 3.8 [95% ci 3.6-3.9]), but no difference compared to those receiving bisphosphonates only after discharge (5.1 [95% ci 4.6-5.5]). previous bisphosphonate use was significantly associated with time to death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.41 [95% ci 1.15-1.73]) but less strongly with time to combined endpoint of hospitalisation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.18 [95% ci 0.98-1.48]). use after discharge from rehabilitation was associated with reduced risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.64 [95% ci 0.55-0.73]; hazard ratio per year of bisphosphonate prescription 0.98 [95% ci 0.97-0.99]). conclusion: bisphosphonate use is unlikely to be causally associated with improved physical function in older people, but continuing use may be associated with lower risk of death.

atrial_fibrillation	introduction: an increasing number of patients with congenital heart disease are now surviving into adulthood. this has also led to the emergence of complications from the underlying congenital heart disease, related surgical interventions, and associated combordities. while the prevalence of particular arrhythmias with specific congenital heart disease has been previously described, a detailed analysis of all lesions and a large number of comorbidities has not been previously published. methods: admissions with congenital heart disease were identified in the national inpatient sample. associated comorbidities were also identified for these patients. univariate analysis was done to compare those risk factors associated with specific arrhythmias in the setting of congenital heart disease. next, regression analysis was done to identify what patient characteristics and comorbidities were associated with increased risk of specific arrhythmias. results: a total of 52,725,227 admissions were included in the analysis. of these, 109,168 (0.21%) had congenital heart disease. of those with congenital heart disease, 27,088 (25%) had an arrhythmia at some point. the most common arrhythmia in those with congenital heart disease was atrial fibrillation, which was noted in 86% of those with arrhythmia followed by atrial flutter which was noted in 20% of those with congenital heart disease. the largest burden of arrhythmia was found to be in those with tricuspid atresia with a 51% prevalence of arrhythmia in this group followed by ebstein anomaly which had an arrhythmia prevalence of 39%. increasing age, male gender, double outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular septal defect, heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, transposition of the great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition, and tetralogy of fallot were frequently noted to be independent risk factors of specific arrhythmias. conclusion: approximately, 25% of adult admissions with congenital heart disease are associated with arrhythmia. the burden of arrhythmia varies by the specific lesion and other risk factors as well. understanding of these can help in risk stratification and can help devise strategies to lower this risk.
addiction	this study evaluated the effects of inhalation of lavender essential oil on vital signs in open heart surgery icu. the main complaint of patients after open-heart surgery is dysrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension due to stress and pain. due to the side effects of chemical drugs, such as opioids, use of non-invasive methods such as aromatherapy for relieving stress and pain parallel to chemical agents could be an important way to decrease the dose and side effects of analgesics. in a multicenter, single-blind trial, 40 patients who had open-heart surgery were recruited. inclusion criteria were full consciousness, lack of hemorrhage, heart rate >60 beats/min, systolic blood pressure >100 mmhg, and diastolic blood pressure >60 mmhg, not using beta blockers in the operating room or icu, no history of addiction to opioids or use of analgesics in regular, spontaneous breathing ability and not receiving synthetic opioids within 2 h before extubation. ten minutes after extubation, the patients >vital signs [including bp, hr, central venous pressure (cvp), spo2, and rr] were measured. then, a cotton swab, which was impregnated with 2 drops of lavender essential oil 2%, was placed in patients' oxygen mask and patients breathed for 10 min. thirty minutes after aromatherapy, the vital signs were measured again. main objective of this study was the change in vital sign before and after aromatherapy. statistical significance was accepted for p < 0.05. there was a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (p 0.001 <), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.001), and heart rate (p = 0.03) before and after the intervention using paired t-test. although, the results did not show any significant difference in respiratory rate (p = 0.1), spo2 (p = 0.5) and cvp (p = 0.2) before and after inhaling lavender essential oil. therefore, the aromatherapy could effectively reduce blood pressure and heart rate in patients admitted to the open heart surgery icu and can be used as an independent nursing intervention in stabilizing mentioned vital signs. the limitations of our study were sample size and lack of control group. randomized clinical trials with larger sample size are recommended.
crohn's_disease	surgical site infection (ssi) is the most common complication following surgical procedures. this study aimed to determine risk factors associated with ssi in patients with crohn 's disease (cd) complicated with gastrointestinal fistula. this was a retrospective review of patients who underwent surgical resection in gastrointestinal fistula patients with cd between january 2013 and january 2015, identified from a prospectively maintained gastrointestinal fistula database. demographic information, preoperative medication, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcome data were collected. univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out to assess possible risk factors for ssi. a total of 118 patients were identified, of whom 75.4% were men, the average age of the patients was 34.1 years, and the average body mass index (bmi) was 18.8 kg/m(2). the rate of ssi was 31.4%. on multivariate analysis, preoperative anemia (p = 0.001, or 7.698, 95% ci 2.273-26.075), preoperative bacteria present in fistula tract (p = 0.029, or 3.399, 95% ci 1.131-10.220), and preoperative enteral nutrition (en) < 3 months (p < 0.001, or 11.531, 95% ci 3.086-43.079) were predictors of ssi. notably, preoperative percutaneous abscess drainage was shown to exert protection against ssi in fistulizing cd (p = 0.037, or 0.258, 95% ci 0.073-0.920). preoperative anemia, bacteria present in fistula tract, and preoperative en < 3 months significantly increased the risk of postoperative ssi in gastrointestinal fistula complicated with cd. preoperative identification of these risk factors may assist in risk assessment and then to optimize preoperative preparation and perioperative care.
crohn's_disease	psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that is increasingly being recognized as a systemic inflammatory disorder. psoriatic arthritis is a well-known comorbidity of psoriasis. a rapidly expanding body of literature in various populations and settings supports additional associations between psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, kidney disease, malignancy, infection, and mood disorders. the pathogenesis of comorbid disease in patients with psoriasis remains unknown; however, shared inflammatory pathways, cellularmediators, genetic susceptibility, and common risk factors are hypothesized to be contributing elements. as additional psoriasis comorbidities continue to emerge, education of health care providers is essential to ensuring comprehensive medical care for patients with psoriasis.
addiction	increased obesity rates, an evolving food supply and the overconsumption of energy dense foods has led to an increase in research exploring addictive eating behaviours. this study aimed to investigate food addiction in a sample of australian adults using the revised yale food addiction survey (yfas) 2.0 tool and how it is associated with dietary intake, personality traits and mental health issues. australian adults were invited to complete an online survey that collected information including: demographics, dietary intake, depression, anxiety, stress and personality dimensions including impulsivity, sensation seeking, hopelessness and anxiety sensitivity. a total of 1344 individuals were recruited with the samples comprising 75.7% female, mean age 39.8 +/- 13.1 years (range 18-91 years) and body mass index bmi 27.7 +/- 9.5. food addiction was identified in 22.2% of participants using the yfas 2.0 tool, which classified the severity of food addiction as ""mild"" in 0.7% of cases, ""moderate"" in 2.6% and ""severe"" in 18.9% of cases. predictors of severe food addiction were female gender (odds ratio (or) 3.65 95% ci 1.86-7.11) and higher levels of soft drink or 1.36 (1.07-1.72), confectionary consumption and anxiety sensitivity 1.16 (1.07-1.26). overall people with ""severe"" (or 13.2, 5.8-29.8) or extremely severe depressive symptoms (or 15.6, range 7.1-34.3) had the highest odds of having severe food addiction. the only variable that reduced the odds of having severe food addiction was vegetable intake. the current study highlights that addictive food behaviours are associated with a complex pattern of poor dietary choices and a clustering with mental health issues, particularly depression.
addiction	background: addictions to psychoactive substances such as tobacco and others have been widely investigated, and recently interest has been developing in potential nonsubstance- addictive behaviors (eg, gambling, buying, or playing video games). methodology: in the current study, we sought to develop a questionnaire obtained from the yale addictive food questionnaire arabic version, and compare it with a gold standard tool, which is the semi- structured icd10 diagnostic- based interview. we also sought to determine the prevalence of some addictive behaviors in a sample of 100 participants displaying any addictive behaviors drawn from 2 governorates in egypt (cairo and aswan). a null hypothesis was postulated that there is no difference within the sociodemographic variables with regard to the type of the nonchemical addictive behaviors. results: the questionnaire sensitivity was 86% with a plausible specificity of 50%, making it a very good screening tool. about 81% of the participants (n= 81) showed addiction- like attitude toward the concerning behaviors. conclusions: besides the usual psychoactive substance dependence, there are wide ranges of behaviors that cause a lot of psychological burden and unfortunately are not under the spotlight of medical services.
atrial_fibrillation	direct-acting oral anticoagulants (doacs) have been introduced as alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of venous thromboembolism. many patients undergoing major gastrointestinal resections or bypass receive anticoagulants for various indications, including the treatment of thrombotic complication of surgery and prevention of visceral vessels events recurrence. doacs have a wide therapeutic range that allows fixed dosing determined based on studies conducted in healthy subjects with normal absorptive capacity. patients with significantly altered gastrointestinal tracts were not included in the phase ii and iii studies that assessed doac efficacy and safety. the aim of this article is to review clinical data on doacs use in patients with major surgical resection or bypass. medline and embase were searched to identify studies and case reports of doac use in this population. prescribing information for the four approved doacs was also reviewed. the only types of available literature identified were case series and isolated case reports. patients who underwent major distal intestinal resection were successfully anticoagulated with rivaroxaban, dabigatran was not effective. there is uncertainty about the efficacy of rivaroxaban and dabigatran in patients requiring anticoagulation after roux-en-y gastric bypass. avoidance of rivaroxaban therapy in patients undergoing gastrectomy is advised data are lacking regarding anticoagulation using apixaban and edoxaban in patients with major gastrointestinal resection or bypass is lacking. clinicians should be aware of these limitations when using doacs in this group of patients.
bipolar_disorder	the neural extracellular matrix (ecm) plays an important role in regulation of perisomatic gabaergic inhibition and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex. decreased labeling of perineuronal nets, a form of ecm predominantly associated with parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the brain, has been observed in post-mortem studies of schizophrenia patients, specifically, in brain areas such as prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. moreover, glial ecm in the form of dandelion clock-like structures was reported to be altered in schizophrenia patients. here, we verified whether similar abnormalities in neural ecm can be reproduced in a rat model of schizophrenia, in which animals received sub chronic administration of ketamine to reproduce the aspects of disease related to disrupted signaling through n-methyld-aspartate receptors. our study focused on two schizophrenia-related brain areas, namely the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) and hippocampus. semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate investigate ecm expression using wisteria floribunda agglutinin (wfa) and cs56 antibody, both labeling distinct chondroitin sulfate epitopes enriched in perineuronal nets and glial ecm, respectively. our analysis revealed that ketaminetreated rats exhibit reduced number of wfa-labeled perineuronal nets, and a decreased intensity of parvalbumin fluorescence in mpfc interneurons somata. moreover, we found an increased expression of cs56 immunoreactive form of ecm. importantly, the loss of perineuronal nets was revealed in the mpfc, and was not detected in the hippocampus, suggesting regional specificity of ecm alterations. these data open an avenue for further investigations of functional importance of ecm abnormalities in schizophrenia as well as for search of treatments for their compensation.

atopic_dermatitis	background: atopic dermatitis (ad) is an inflammatory skin disorder with severe pruritus. despite advancements in medicine, therapeutic treatments for ad are still limited. eupatilin (5,7-dihydroxy-30,40,6-trimethoxyflavone) is one of the lipophilic flavonoids from artemisia umbelliformis lam. and artemisia genipiweber. objective: although it has been reported to act a role in improving inflammation, its action on ad is uncertain. in this study, we examined the role of eupatilin on ad-like skin lesions in nc/nga mice. methods: 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene was repeatedly applied to the ear of nc/nga mice to produce ad-like skin lesions. eupatilin (1%, once a day for 5 consecutive days/week) was applied topically for four weeks for the evaluation of its therapeutic effects. results: 1% eupatilin cream significantly reduced the clinical severity score of ad-like lesions, compared to the vehicle (p<0.005). a histopathological analysis revealed that % eupatilin cream significantly decreased the mast cell infiltration as well as inflammatory cell infiltration, compared to the vehicle (p<0.005). we showed that 1% eupatilin cream significantly reduced the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4, and interleukin-19, but not interferon-gamma, compared to the vehicle (p<0.005). conclusion: considering the therapeutic reaction of eupatilin on ad-like lesions as in this study, the substance has a promising to be an adjuvant topical agent for the control of ad.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: psoriatic arthritis is associated with psychosocial morbidity and decrease in quality of life. psychiatric comorbidity also plays an important role in the impairment of quality of life and onset of fatigue. objectives: this study aimed to assess the prevalence of fatigue in psoriatic arthritis patients and to correlate it to quality of life indexes, functional capacity, anxiety, depression and disease activity. patients and methods: this cross-sectional study was performed on outpatients with psoriatic arthritis. functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (facit-f; version 4) was used to measure fatigue; 36-item short form health survey (sf-36) and psoriasis disability index (pdi) to measure quality of life; health assessment questionnaire (haq) to assess functional capacity; hospital anxiety and depression (had) scale to measure anxiety and depression symptoms; psoriasis area and severity index (pasi), bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai) and clinical disease activity index (cdai) to evaluate clinical activity. results: in all, 101 patients with mean age of 50.77 years were included. the mean pdi score was 8.01; pasi score, 9.88; basdai score, 3.59; haq score, 0.85; had-anxiety (had a) score, 7.39; had depression (had d) score, 5.93; facit-fatigue scale (facit-fs) score, 38.3 and cdai score, 2.65. facit-fs was statistically associated with pasi (r(s)-0.345, p < 0.001), pdi (r(s)-0.299, p < 0.002), haq (r(s)-0.460, p < 0.001), had a (r(s)-0.306, p=0.002) and had d (r(s)-0.339, p < 0.001). the correlations with cdai and basdai were not confirmed. there was statistically significant correlation with all of the domains of sf-36 and facit-f (version 4). conclusion: prevalence of fatigue was moderate to intense in < 25% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. fatigue seems to be more related to the emotional and social aspects of the disease than to joint inflammatory aspects, confirming that the disease 's visibility is the most disturbing aspect for the patient and that ""skin pain"" is more intense than the joint pain.
medicare	introduction: this study aimed to determine the relationship between patients presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ped) and potential tobacco smoke exposure (tse)-related illnesses. methods: a retrospective review of electronic medical records of pediatric emergency department patients (n = 116,084) was conducted. sociodemographic characteristics, tse-related illnesses, and tse documentation were extracted. logistic regression analyses were performed. results: more than one fifth (21.7%) of patients had tserelated illnesses. patients who were younger, male, non-white, or hispanic; had medicaid/medicare insurance, had low triage acuity; or were admitted to any non-intensive care unit or intensive care unit were significantly more likely to have tse-related illnesses. twenty-eight percent of patients with tse documentation had positive tse status. although regression models for positive tse indicated similar findings, no difference was found based on ethnicity. discussion: pediatric emergency departments, especially those that care for large numbers of children, should offer tobacco interventions that target at-risk populations and caregivers who are most likely not receiving interventions in other health care settings.
mental_health	this study investigated the influences of retirement transition, age, and gender on aspects of daily experiences in adults (aged 50-75 years) who stayed working (n=138) and who transitioned into retirement (n=72). data derived from the first and second waves of the daily diary study of the national survey of midlife in the united states. participants completed telephone interviews about their experiences across eight consecutive days. findings showed a significant interaction effect of retirement transition and age on daily stressors. gender did not significantly moderate the associations between retirement transition and daily experiences. these findings suggest that retirement transition must be considered in the context of life course influences, especially age, to better determine the quality of daily experiences of midlife and older adults, and these life course influences should be considered in programs and services aimed to help adults navigate the retirement experiences.
children's_health	purpose: although previous studies demonstrate associations between adverse perinatal outcomes and developmental disabilities (dds), study of population impacts is limited. methods: we computed relative risks adjusted (arrs) for sociodemographic factors and component and summary population attributable fractions (pafs) for associations between very low birth weight (vlbw, all preterm births), moderately low birth weight (mlbw) + preterm, mlbw at term, and normal birth weight (nbw) + preterm and seven dds (cerebral palsy [cp], autism spectrum disorder [asd], intellectual disability [id], behavioral-conduct disorders, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder [adhd], learning disability [ld], and other developmental delay) among children aged 3-17 years in the 2011 2012 national survey of children 's health. results: vlbw-preterm, mlbw-preterm and nbw-preterm were strongly to moderately associated with cp (arrs: 43.5, 10.1, and 22, respectively; all significant) and also associated with id, asd, ld, and other developmental delay (arr ranges: vlbw-preterm 2.8-5.3; mlbw-preterm 1.9-2.8; and nbw-preterm 1.6-2.3). summary pafs for preterm birth and/or lbw were 55% for cp, 10%-20% for asd, id, ld, and other developmental delay, and less than 5% for adhd and behavioral-conduct disorders. findings were similar whether we assessed dds as independent outcomes or within mutually exclusive categories accounting for dd co-occurrence. conclusions: preterm birth has a sizable impact on child neurodevelopment. however, relative associations and population impacts vary widely by dd type.

bipolar_disorder	ankyrin 3 (ank3) has been implicated as a genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder (bd), however the resulting pathophysiological and treatment implications remain elusive. in a preclinical systems biological approach, we aimed to characterize the behavioral and proteomic effects of ank3 haploinsufficiency and chronic mood-stabilizer treatment in mice. psychiatric-related behavior was evaluated with the novelty-suppressed feeding (nsf) paradigm, elevated plus maze (epm) and a passive avoidance task (pat). tandem mass spectrometry (mse) was employed for hippocampal proteome profiling. a functional enrichment approach based on protein protein interactions (ppis) was performed to outline which biological processes in the hippocampus were affected by ank3 haploinsufficiency and lithium treatment. proteomic abundance changes as detected by mse or highlighted by ppi network modelling were followed up by targeted selected reaction monitoring (srm). increased psychiatric-related behavior in ank3+/- mice was ameliorated by lithium in all assessments (nsf, epm, pat). mse followed by modular ppi clustering and functional annotation enrichment pointed towards kinesin-related axonal transport and glutamate signaling as mediators of ank3+/- pathophysiology and lithium treatment. srm validated this hypothesis and further confirmed abundance changes of ank3 interaction partners. we propose that psychiatric-related behavior in ank3+/- mice is connected to a disturbance of the kinesin cargo system, resulting in a dysfunction of neuronal ion channel and glutamate receptor transport. lithium reverses this molecular signature, suggesting the promotion of anterograde kinesin transport as part of its mechanism of action in ameliorating ank3-related psychiatric-related behavior.

osteoarthritis	we characterize brucella infection in a wild southern sea otter (enhydra lutris nereis) with osteolytic lesions similar to those reported in other marine mammals and humans. this otter stranded twice along the central california coast, us over a 1-yr period and was handled extensively at two wildlife rehabilitation facilities, undergoing multiple surgeries and months of postsurgical care. ultimately the otter was euthanized due to severe, progressive neurologic disease. necropsy and postmortem radiographs revealed chronic, severe osteoarthritis spanning the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left hind fifth digit. numerous coccobacilli within the joint were strongly positive on brucella immunohistochemical labelling, and brucella sp. was isolated in pure culture from this lesion. sparse brucella-immunopositive bacteria were also observed in the cytoplasm of a pulmonary vascular monocyte, and multifocal granulomas were observed in the spinal cord and liver on histopathology. findings from biochemical characterization, 16s ribosomal dna, and bp26 gene sequencing of the bacterial isolate were identical to those from marine-origin brucellae isolated from cetaceans and phocids. although omp2a gene sequencing revealed 100% homology with marine brucella spp. infecting pinnipeds, whales, and humans, omp2b gene sequences were identical only to pinniped-origin isolates. multilocus sequence typing classified the sea otter isolate as st26, a sequence type previously associated only with cetaceans. our data suggest that the sea otter brucella strain represents a novel marine lineage that is distinct from both brucella pinnipedialis and brucella ceti. prior reports document the zoonotic potential of the marine brucellae. isolation of brucella sp. from a stranded sea otter highlights the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when handling sea otters and other marine mammals as part of wildlife conservation and rehabilitation efforts.
osteoarthritis	few studies have identified the effects of arthroscopic surgery on the clinical outcomes when open wedge high tibial osteotomy (owhto) and arthroscopic surgery were performed together. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of arthroscopic surgery in patients who had varus osteoarthritic knee and were treated with owhto combined with arthroscopic surgery. among the 98 knees (88 patients) who underwent owhto between january 2008 and march 2013, 79 knees (71 patients) with more than 2 years of follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. the patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (24 knees) underwent only owhto and group 2 (55 knees) underwent owhto combined with arthroscopic surgery. for clinical evaluation, the range of motion (rom), pain visual analog scale, knee society knee score, knee society function score, and complication were used. for radiologic evaluation, kellgren-lawrence grade, mechanical femorotibial angle, and posterior tibial slope were used. the average follow-up period was 29.1 months. group 2 showed a significant increase in the rom at the last follow-up (133.2 +/- 6.0 degrees) compared with the preoperative time point (128.3 +/- 7.7 degrees) (p < 0.001). in the comparison of radiologic parameters between groups 1 and 2, there was no significant difference. in the minimum 24-month follow-up, when owhto combined with arthroscopic surgery was performed, arthroscopic surgery helped increase the rom of patients with mechanical symptoms. however, the amount of the rom increase of 4.9 degrees was of unknown clinical significance.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal disorder for which there is no cure. while the disease is by definition idiopathic, accumulating evidence, including familial aggregation of cases and the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in the context of a number of rare genetic disorders, indicates that genetic factors contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of ipf. several disease-associated genetic variants, both rare and common, have been identified in familial and sporadic ipf. while the full clinical implications of these genetic associations remain to be elucidated, observational studies suggest that genotype influences the development of the disease and its outcome. available data indicate that genetics has the potential to identify individuals at risk of ipf, classify patients more precisely, clarify the key pathways involved in disease pathogenesis and eventually develop more effective targeted therapies. considerable research is required before a comprehensive disease fingerprint of ipf can be delivered. nevertheless, the application of rapidly evolving molecular biology and genomic technologies combined with appropriate bioinformatic methodology offers an unprecedented and realistic opportunity to achieve this goal.
rheumatoid_arthritis	purpose of review methotrexate (mtx) is the most widely used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (dmard) in paediatric rheumatology and the mainstay in the therapy of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia). despite its common use, about 30% of children fail to respond to this medicine that results in potentially irreversible joint damage. recent findings no clinical biomarker that would predict the outcome of mtx therapy exists. results of several studies focused on gene polymorphisms and outcome of this dmard therapy have been published, but no reliable genetic marker useful to tailor the therapy has been discovered so far. the results of the first genome-wide association study in this field have recently revealed new genetic candidates from outside the metabolic pathway of mtx that may be associated with the efficacy of treatment. summary however promising, those outcomes need validation in independent prospective cohorts before we can claim that clinically useful biomarker predicting mtx treatment response is discovered.
atrial_fibrillation	backgroundmost studies of brain white matter (wm) in posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) have focused on combat trauma, and often were confounded by neurological and substance dependence comorbidity. this study used tract-based spatial statistics (tbss) and probabilistic tractography to characterize wm microstructure in a mixed-sex community sample of ptsd patients exposed to diverse and multiple traumas, and in trauma-exposed normal comparison (tenc) subjects. methodstbss compared diffusion measures between 20 adults with dsm-iv ptsd and 17 tenc, using a whole-brain voxel-wise approach. probabilistic tractography using freesurfer 's tracula was employed to measure diffusion tensor imaging (dti) metrics within anatomically defined pathways. dti metrics were compared between groups and correlated with ptsd symptom severity and trauma load. resultscontrolling for age, sex, and motion, ptsd subjects had significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (fa) in a left frontal lobe cluster compared with tenc, at p < .05, family-wise error corrected. tractography identified significant group differences in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ilf), including lower fa and higher radial diffusivity in ptsd compared with tenc. within the ptsd group, fa values were not correlated with symptom severity or trauma load. results remained significant after removing participants using psychotropic medication or those with comorbid major depression. conclusionsptsd patients had reduced wm integrity in left hemisphere frontal wm and temporal-occipital wm tracts, compared to trauma-exposed controls. reduced frontal fa is consistent with compromised top-down attentional control and emotion regulation in ptsd, while reduced ilf fa may be related to sensory processing and gating abnormalities in this disorder.
stress_management	in recent years, aromatherapy has become increasingly popular for clinical treatment and therapeutic management of both acute and chronic stress. it targets distinct and unique neurobiological characteristics of the olfactory system, which is tightly linked to emotions and information processing as well as the autonomous nervous system. yet, depending on the mode of application, aromatherapeutic interventions show varying degrees of therapeutic effectiveness. in a series of five experiments, the effects of a new mode of aromatherapeutic application (inhaler) was investigated, which is specifically designed to directly stimulate the olfactory system and to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. overall, the application of the inhaler showed consistent and large psychological and physiological effects. it also clearly outperformed other stress management techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation, bach flowers or passive resting periods (natural control). the effects occurred shortly after very few inhalations, drastically reduced stress related biomarkers (i.e. blood pressure, heart rate and cortisol) and considerably enhanced well-being. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
anxiety	this pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an internet support group (isg) for parents of children with nf1. eligible parents were recruited by email and completed baseline questionnaires assessing social support, self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety. the isg involved eight weekly 90-min chat sessions and a discussion forum open 24 h/day for 8 weeks. follow-up measures were completed immediately post-intervention and 3 months later. parents from 33 families (29 mothers, 4 fathers) completed baseline measures. over half of parents (52 %) rated their child 's disease severity as mild, 33 % moderate, and 15 % severe. among 21 parents who completed post-intervention measures, ratings of perceived emotional (p = .0008) and informational (p = .0003) support increased. there were no significant changes in self-efficacy, depression, or anxiety (ps >.05). the mean satisfaction rating was moderately high (7.6/10; range 4-10). some parents commented that the chat sessions were at inconvenient times, which may have limited participation. preliminary evidence in this small sample of parents suggests that isgs may be a feasible and potentially efficacious method of providing support to parents of children with nf1. having multiple weekly chat sessions held at various days and times may improve accessibility and participation. clinicians are encouraged to help parents access online support resources.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	this study aimed to explore the different pathogeneses of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (cpfe) from emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. the levels of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (tgf-beta(1)), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), krebs von den lungen-6 (kl-6), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 (timp-1), cytokeratin 19 fragment (cyfra21-1), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (scc), and the telomerase activity in peripheral blood were measured in 38 cpfe patients, 50 pulmonary emphysema patients, and 34 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) patients. the results demonstrated that the levels of vegf and tgf-beta 1 in ipf patients were significantly higher than those in emphysema patients (p0.05). the levels of kl-6 and cyfra21-1 in ipf patients were significantly higher than those in emphysema and cpfe patients (p0.05). among the three groups, the levels of scc, mmp-9, timp-1, mmp-9/timp-1 ratio, and telomerase activity were not different (p >0.05). our study showed that vegf, tgf-beta(1), kl-6, and cyfra21-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. the lower levels of kl-6 and cyfra21-1 in cpfe patients may be one of the reasons why these patients develop emphysema on the basis of fibrosis.
bipolar_disorder	maternal weight before and during pregnancy is associated with offspring neurobehaviour in childhood. we investigated maternal weight prior to and during pregnancy in relation to neonatal neurobehaviour. we hypothesized that maternal obesity and excessive gestational weight gain would be associated with poor neonatal attention and affective functioning. participants (n = 261) were recruited, weighed and interviewed during their third trimester of pregnancy. pre-pregnancy weight was self-reported and validated for 210 participants, with robust agreement with medical chart review (r = 0.99). neurobehaviour was measured with the nicu network neurobehavioural scale (nnns) administered on days 2 and 32 postpartum. maternal exclusion criteria included severe or persistent physical or mental health conditions (e.g. chronic disease or diagnoses of bipolar disorder or psychotic spectrum disorders), excessive substance use, and social service/foster care involvement or difficulty understanding english. infants were from singleton, full-term (37-42 weeks gestation) births with no major medical concerns. outcome variables were summary scores on the nnns (n = 75-86). for women obese prior to pregnancy, those gaining in excess of institute of medicine guidelines had infants with poorer regulation, lower arousal and higher lethargy. there were no main effects of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index on neurobehaviour. women gaining above institute of medicine recommendations had neonates with better quality of movement. additional studies to replicate and extend results past the neonatal period are needed. results could support underlying mechanisms explaining associations between maternal perinatal weight and offspring outcomes. these mechanisms may inform future prevention/intervention strategies.

atopic_dermatitis	allergic rhinitis is a common chronic disorder characterized by immunoglobulin e-mediated inflammation. to identify new genes associated with this trait, we performed genome-and epigenome-wide association studies and linked marginally significant cpgs located in genes or its promoter and snps located 1 mb from the cpgs, by identifying cis methylation quantitative trait loci (mqtl). this approach relies on functional cellular aspects rather than stringent statistical correction. we were able to identify one gene with significant cis-mqtl for allergic rhinitis, caudal-type homeobox 1 (cdx1). we also identified 11 genes with marginally significant cis-mqtls (p < 0.05) including one with both allergic rhinitis with or without asthma (rnf39). moreover, most snps identified were not located closest to the gene they were linked to through cis-mqtls counting the one linked to cdx1 located in a gene previously associated with asthma and atopic dermatitis. by combining omics data, we were able to identify new genes associated with allergic rhinitis and better assess the genes linked to associated snps.
asthma	background: it is accepted that t regulatory cells (treg) control different types of immune responses. in connection with this role, we have recently described an important increase in cd4+, cd25(high), foxp3+ lymphocytes in the airway system of horses coursing with an exacerbation of severe equine asthma (ea). to explore the potential role of this population in the resolution of ea inflammation, we used a murine experimental model in which airway neutrophilic inflammation, which is similar to that observed in ea, is induced in mice by continual exposure to aspergillus fumigatus contaminated hay. this model has the advantage that in mice we may induce a reduction of the treg population using low doses of cyclophosphamide (cy). results: the results indicated that the percentage of treg cells increased with allergen exposure, as in horses; and animals partially depleted of treg cells by treatment with cy showed increased airway inflammation, demonstrated by an increased percentage of neutrophils and specific immunoglobulins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf). furthermore, a histopathologic study of animals that were pretreated with cy before antigenic challenge showed higher cellular infiltration in the lung and deeper remodeling changes in the bronchi, including epithelial and goblet cell hyperplasia as well as airway smooth muscle hypertrophy. conclusion: in this murine model of ea, the reduced number and function of treg induced by low doses of cy, which directly correlates with increased airway inflammation and lung infiltration, indicates that treg may play a major role in the regulation and resolution of ea.
addiction	little is known about the mechanisms of smartphone features that are used in sealing relationships between psychopathology and problematic smartphone use. our purpose was to investigate two specific smartphone usage types process use and social use for associations with depression and anxiety; and in accounting for relationships between anxiety/depression and problematic smartphone use. social smartphone usage involves social feature engagement (e.g., social networking, messaging), while process usage involves non-social feature engagement (e.g., news consumption, entertainment, relaxation). 308 participants from amazon 's mechanical turk intemet labor market answered questionnaires about their depression and anxiety symptoms, and problematic smartphone use along with process and social smartphone use dimensions. statistically adjusting for age and sex, we discovered the association between anxiety symptoms was stronger with process versus social smartphone use. depression symptom severity was negatively associated with greater social smartphone use. process smartphone use was more strongly associated with problematic smartphone use. finally, process smartphone use accounted for relationships between anxiety severity and problematic smartphone use.

osteoarthritis	high concentrations of cryoprotective agents are required for cryopreservation techniques such as vitrification. glycerol is a common cryoprotective agent used in cryopreservation protocols but this agent is toxic at high concentrations. this work is an attempt to mitigate the toxic effects of high concentrations of glycerol on intact chondrocytes in human knee articular cartilage from total knee arthroplasty patients by simultaneous exposure to glycerol and a variety of additive compounds. the resulting cell viability in the cartilage samples as measured by membrane integrity staining showed that, in at least one concentration or in combination, all of the tested additive compounds (tetramethylpyrazine, ascorbic acid, chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine sulphate) were able to reduce the deleterious effects of glycerol exposure when examination of membrane integrity took place on a delayed time frame. the use of additive compounds to reduce cryoprotectant toxicity in articular cartilage may help improve cell recovery after cryopreservation.

smoking_cessation	the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based behavioral medicine interventions into real world practice has been limited. the purpose of this paper is to discuss specific limitations of current behavioral medicine research within the context of the re-aim framework, and potential opportunities to increase public health impact by applying novel intervention designs and data collection approaches. the most framework has recently emerged as an alternative approach to development and evaluation that aims to optimize multicomponent behavioral and bio-behavioral interventions. smart designs, imbedded within the most framework, are an approach to optimize adaptive interventions. in addition to innovative design strategies, novel data collection approaches that have the potential to improve the public-health dissemination include mhealth approaches and considering environment as a potential data source. finally, becoming involved in advocacy via policy related work may help to improve the impact of evidence-based behavioral interventions. innovative methods, if increasingly implemented, may have the ability to increase the public health impact of evidence-based behavioral interventions to prevent disease.
atopic_dermatitis	the skin-associated chemokine ccl27 and its receptor ccr10 mediate the immune response of skin-homing t cells. the ccl27 secreted from keratinocytes was reportedly involved in inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis. however, whether ionizing radiation increases the levels of ccl27 secretion still remains unclear. in hacat cells, a human keratinocyte cell line, ccl27 secretion was markedly increased after x-ray irradiation. we further found that irradiation boosted the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros), which was concomitant with the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). moreover, alteration of ros in irradiated hacat cells correlated with tnf-alpha secretion, indicating a positive loop of tnf-alpha secretion and ros generation. this positive loop regulated the secretion of ccl27 from irradiated cells. we therefore concluded that the cross talk between tnf-alpha and ros after keratinocytes was exposed to radiation, triggered ccl27 secretion for subsequent inflammation response.
stress_management	introduction: with the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, more health care services are offering support such as therapeutic patient education (tpe). by acquiring certain skills, the patient takes an active role in the day-to-day management of his/her disease. however, it may be difficult for these patients to continue working. so how do tpe providers handle occupational health issues in their education systems? methods: this descriptive study examines the occupational health component of ile-de-france tpe programmes for two conditions: chronic low back pain and adult asthma. data were obtained from the cart'ep (r) website and via telephone interviews with eighteen tpe programme coordinators, conducted according to an interview guide results: analysis of the results, combining statistical and content analysis, shows that the approach to occupational health in terms of skills, content and tpe practices was different for these two conditions. asthma tpe programmes tend to stress management of asthma attacks, avoidance of risky situations and knowledge of occupational trigger factors. low back pain tpe programmes, on the other hand, prioritize continued employment as the main objective, and emphasize the use of adaptation behaviours (reducing fears and beliefs). conclusion: as current educational formats largely neglect occupational health, occupational health physicians could possibly be enlisted to help make tpe programmes more effective in this domain.
ankylosing_spondylitis	the objective of the study was to analyze the impact of tnf antagonists (tnfa) on the total cholesterol and triglycerides on ankylosing spondylitis (as) and psoriatic arthritis (psa). in this single-centre observational study of as and psa patients, differences in triglyceride and total cholesterol levels and frequency of hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia at 3 and 6 months were analysed in patients treated and not treated with tnfa. general estimation equations and linear regression analysis were used to investigate associations between disease activity and lipid levels and to identify predictors of change. one hundred fifty-seven patients treated, and 157 not treated with tnfa, were included in the study. a transient increase in cholesterol level from baseline to 3 months in tnfa-treated patients was the only statistically significant effect (p < 0.001). persistent percentages of hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia from baseline were significantly higher in not treated than in tnfa-treated patients (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). inverse associations between changes in cholesterol level and bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (p = 0.011) and crp (p < 0.001), but not disease activity score in 28 joints (p = 0.095) were found in the whole group. in as and psa patients treated with tnfa, mild and transient changes in cholesterol but not in triglyceride levels were associated with changes in disease activity.
medicare	backgroundthe role of local therapy, in the form of radiation therapy (rt) or radical prostatectomy(rp), and its association on outcomes is not well established in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. methodsusing the national cancer database (ncdb), we evaluated patterns of care and outcomes among patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer from 2004 to 2013 treated with local therapy (rp, intensity-modulated radiation therapy [imrt], or 2d/3d-conformal radiation therapy [crt]). the association between local therapy, co-variates, and outcomes was assessed in a multivariable cox proportional hazards model and propensity score (ps) matching was performed to balance confounding factors. survival was estimated using the kaplan-meier method. resultsamong the 1,208,180 patients in the ncdb with prostate cancer, 6,051 patients met the inclusion criteria. no local therapy was used in 5,224 patients, while 622 (10.3%), 52 (0.9%), 153 (2.5%) patients received rp, imrt, and 2d/3d-crt, respectively. use of local therapy was associated with younger age (70), lower co-morbidity score, lower t-stage, gleason score <8, node-negative status, private, and medicare insurance, higher income quartile, and treatment at comprehensive or academic/research programs (p<0.05). five-year overall survival for patients receiving local therapy was 45.7% versus 17.1% for those not receiving local therapy (p<0.01). in multivariate analysis, rp (hr=0.51; 95%ci, 0.45-0.59, p<0.01) and imrt (hr=0.47; 95%ci, 0.31-0.72, p<0.01) were independently associated with superior overall survival. after ps-matching, the use of local therapy (rp or imrt) remained significantly associated with overall survival (hr=0.35; 95%ci, 0.30-0.41, p<0.01). conclusionsthe use of rp and imrt, to treat the primary disease, was associated with improvements in overall survival for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. we have identified patient-specific variations in the use of local therapy that may be tested in subsequent prospective clinical trials to improve patient outcomes in this setting. prostate 77: 559-572, 2017.

dementia	this study aimed to determine whether the markers of assimilation of problematic experiences in dementia scale (maped) can be used to identify whether the way in which participants talk about dementia changed during the group. all eight sessions of a livdem group, which were attended by participants were recorded and transcribed. an initial analysis identified 160 extracts, which were then rated using the maped system. inter-rater reliability was 61% and following a resolution meeting, 35 extracts were discarded, leaving 125 extracts with an agreed marker code. all of the participants were identified as producing a speech marker relating to dementia, and these varied between 0 (warding off) to 6 (problem solution). examples of these markers are provided. the proportion of emergence markers (indicating the initial stages of assimilation) compared to later markers changed significantly between the first four sessions and the final sessions. this difference was still significant even when the markers produced by the most verbal participant, graham, were excluded. the use of process measures within psychotherapy complements more conventional outcome measures and has both theoretical and clinical implications.
smoking_cessation	a 60-year-old man presented with an 18-month history of gradually worsening cough and a 12-month history of dyspnea on exertion. high-resolution computed tomography showed bilateral uniform ground grass opacity in the lower lung fields, partially resolved by smoking cessation. a tentative diagnosis of desquamative interstitial pneumonia (dip) was made. video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed and pathological analysis showed peribronchiolar fibrosis with intra-alveolar macrophage infiltration. elemental analysis detected aluminum and iron in the upper lobe and only iron in the lower lobe. thus, a definitive diagnosis of mixed dust pneumoconiosis with dip-like reaction was made. dip-like reaction is known to be a reactive change caused by exposure to tobacco smoke as well as by inhalation of inorganic particles. obtaining a detailed medical history including occupational and environmental risk factors is important to distinguish cases of dip-like reaction due to exposure to inorganic particles from the usual cases related to smoking, and thus provide suitable treatment.

autism	scope: the 'predictive adaptive response' hypothesis suggests that the in utero environment when mismatched with the post-natal environment can influence later life health. underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but may involve gene transcription changes regulated via epigenetic mechanisms. methods and results: in a 2 x 2 factorial design, female c57bl/6 mice were randomised to low or normal folate diets (0.4 mg/2 mg folic acid/kg diet) prior to and during pregnancy and lactation with offspring randomised to high-or low-fat diets at weaning. genome-wide gene expression and promoter dna methylation were measured using microarrays in adult male livers. maternal folate depletion and high fat intake post-weaning influenced gene expression (1859 and 1532 genes, respectively) and promoter dna methylation (201 and 324 loci, respectively) but changes in expression and methylation were poorly matched for both dietary interventions. expression of 642 genes was altered in response to both maternal folate depletion and post-weaning high fat feeding, treatments imposed separately. in addition, there was evidence that the combined dietary insult (i.e. maternal folate depletion followed by high fat post-weaning) caused the largest expression change for most genes. conclusion: our observations align with, and provide evidence in support of, a potential underlying mechanism for the 'predictive adaptive response' hypothesis.
crohn's_disease	bacterial colonization of the gut shapes both the local and the systemic immune response and is implicated in the modulation of immunity in both healthy and disease states. recently, quantitative and qualitative changes in the composition of the gut microbiota have been detected in crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis, reinforcing the hypothesis of dysbiosis as a relevant mechanism underlying inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) pathogenesis. humans and microbes have coexisted and co-evolved for a long time in a mutually beneficial symbiotic association essential for maintaining homeostasis. however, the microbiome is dynamic, changing with age and in response to environmental modifications. among such environmental factors, food and alimentary habits, progressively altered in modern societies, appear to be critical modulators of the microbiota, contributing to or co-participating in dysbiosis. in addition, food constituents such as micronutrients are important regulators of mucosal immunity, with direct or indirect effects on the gut microbiota. moreover, food constituents have recently been shown to modulate epigenetic mechanisms, which can result in increased risk for the development and progression of ibd. therefore, it is likely that a better understanding of the role of different food components in intestinal homeostasis and the resident microbiota will be essential for unravelling the complex molecular basis of the epigenetic, genetic and environment interactions underlying ibd pathogenesis as well as for offering dietary interventions with minimal side effects.
lymphoma	radiation-induced cardiovascular disease is well described as a late effect in cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. advancements in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have led to an increasing number of cancer survivors with resultant long-term side effects related to their cancer treatments. in this review, we describe the short- and long-term cardiovascular consequences of mediastinal radiotherapy and discuss the optimal cardiovascular assessments and diagnostic tools in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.
mental_health	aimsto identify trajectories of heroin use in australia, predictors of trajectory group membership and subsequent outcomes among people with heroin dependence over 10-11 years. designlongitudinal cohort study. settingsydney, australia. participantsa total of 615 participants were recruited between 2001 and 2002 as part of the australian treatment outcome study (66.2% male; mean age 29years). the predominance of the cohort (87.0%) was recruited upon entry to treatment (maintenance therapies, detoxification and residential rehabilitation), and the remainder from non-treatment settings (e.g. needle and syringe programmes). this analysis focused upon 428 participants for whom data on heroin use were available over 10-11 years following study entry. measurementsstructured interviews assessed demographics, treatment history, heroin and other drug use, overdose, criminal involvement, physical health and psychopathology. group-based trajectory modelling was used to: (i) identify trajectory groups based on use of heroin in each year, (ii) examine predictors of group membership and (iii) examine associations between trajectory group membership and 10-11-year outcomes. findingssix trajectory groups were identified [bayesian information criterion (bic)=-1927.44 (n=4708); -1901.07 (n=428)]. one in five (22.1%) were classified as having no decrease in heroin use, with the probability of using remaining high during the 10-11 years (>0.98 probability of use in each year). one in six (16.1%) were classified as demonstrating a rapid decrease to maintained abstinence'. the probability of heroin use among this group declined steeply in the first 2-3years and continued to be low (<0.01). the remaining trajectories represented other fluctuating patterns of use. few baseline variables were found to predict trajectory group membership, but group membership was predictive of demographic, substance use and physical and mental health outcomes at 10-11 years. conclusionslong-term trajectories of heroin use in australia appear to show considerable heterogeneity during a decade of follow-up, with few risk factors predicting group membership. just more than a fifth continued to use at high levels, while fewer than a fifth become abstinent early on and remained abstinent. the remainder showed fluctuating patterns.
bipolar_disorder	this study aimed to determine the prevalence and the clinical correlates of adverse childhood experiences (aces) among 158 inpatient youths with two types of severe psychiatric disorders. aces were retrospectively collected with the aces scale and the list of threatening experiences questionnaire in 77 patients hospitalized for a catatonic syndrome (average age 15.2 years) and 81 for a manic or mixed episode (average age 15.7 years). aces were frequent in youths suffering from bipolar disorder type i (bd-i) (58 %) and from catatonia (57 %), with around one quarter exposed to severe abuse (i.e., physical/sexual/emotional abuse or physical/emotional neglect). youths with bd-i were more likely to be exposed to family violence compared to those with catatonia. youths who had been exposed to aces did not exhibit a more severe presentation or a poorer response to treatment compared to others, either in the bipolar group or in the catatonic group.
hereditary_angioedema	hereditary angioedema (hae) is a rare disease associated with either a quantitative or qualitative deficiency in c1-inhibitor (c1-inh) or normal c1-inh. hae with normal c1-inh is associated in 20% of cases with mutations in the gene for factor xii (fxii) or fxii-hae. a recent review described 41 families, including 14 german and 15 spanish families. we have constructed a register of french patients and their characteristics. a national survey was launched through the french national center of reference for angioedema (creak) to study the clinical, biological and therapeutic characteristics of patients with hae linked to a mutation of fxii gene. fifty-seven patients were identified from 24 different families. in most cases they were young women (mean age at diagnosis: 31 years, mean age at first symptom: 21 years, female/male ratio: 76%). twenty-one per cent of the patients experienced angioedema attacks only during pregnancy or when on oestrogen contraception. sixty-three per cent had attacks at all times, but they were more severe during these same periods. male carriers of the mutation were more frequently asymptomatic than females (p=0003). c1-inh concentrate and icatibant were both effective for treating attacks. the prophylactic use of tranexamic acid led to a 64% decrease in the number of attacks. this is one of the largest series reported of hae patients with fxii mutation. the therapeutic management appeared to be identical to that of hae with c1-inh deficiency.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	fibrosis is the formation of excessive fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue, which occurs in reparative process or in response to inflammation. fibrotic diseases are characterized by abnormal excessive deposition of fibrous proteins, such as collagen, and the disease is most commonly progressive, leading to organ disfunction and failure. although fibrotic diseases evolve in a similar way in all organs, differences may occur as a result of structure and function of the specific organ. in liver fibrosis, the gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring the progression of the disease is biopsy, which is invasive and cannot be repeated frequently. for this reason there is currently a great interest in identifying non-invasive biomarkers for liver fibrosis. in this paper, we develop for the first time a mathematical model of liver fibrosis by a system of partial differential equations. we use the model to explore the efficacy of potential and currently used drugs aimed at blocking the progression of liver fibrosis. we also use the model to develop a diagnostic tool based on a combination of two biomarkers.
lymphoma	background: ovarian tumours are a leading cause of death in ghana. even though geographical and racial differences exist in the frequency, types and age distribution of primary ovarian tumours, information about the clinical and pathological characteristics of ovarian tumours in ghana and its neighboring countries is scanty. we determined the frequency, age distribution, histopathological types and clinical features of primary ovarian tumours diagnosed at the korle-bu teaching hospital in ghana to aid in the management of patients. method: all pathology records of ovarian tumours diagnosed from january 2001 to december 2010 were reviewed. histopathologically, tumours were classified according to the then world health organization 1999 classification. biographical and clinical data of patients were also collected and entered into epi-info to determine the frequency, age distribution and other clinical features of the types of ovarian tumour. results: seven hundred and six ovarian tumours were studied. germ cell tumours were the most common (41.9%), with mean age of occurrence being 30.7 years (sd 12.7), they were dominated by mature teratomas (39.2%). surface epithelial tumours were second, and commonly occurred in women aged 35-44years, 77 (26.8%). sex cord stromal tumours followed with mean age of occurrence of 40.2 years (sd 17.9). the most common malignant tumours were surface epithelial (52.1%) dominated by serous carcinomas with mean age 50.1 years. most patients (47.7%) presented within 1 month of onset of symptoms, feeling a lower abdominal mass (38.5%). conclusion: the most common primary ovarian tumours in this study are germ cell tumours, dominated by mature teratomas. adenocarcinomas are mostly serous and occur in younger women compared to findings of other western studies. the single most common malignant ovarian tumour in children and adolescents is burkitt lymphoma. patients who develop ovarian tumours have no specific symptoms or signs at presentation, to aid early diagnosis.
atrial_fibrillation	this study aimed to examine the discrete impacts of peak oxygen consumption (vo2) and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels on future heart failure (hf) events in sinus rhythm (sr) and atrial fibrillation (af). a total of 1447 patients who underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing and whose bnp values were determined simultaneously were analysed (sr, n = 1151 and af, n = 296). hf events were defined as hf hospitalization or hf death. over a mean follow-up period of 1472 days, 140 hf events were observed. a high bnp value (dichotomized by median value) was independently associated with hf events in sr (hr 8.08; 95 % ci 4.02-16.26; p < 0.0001), but not in af patients (hr 1.97; 95 % ci 0.91-4.28; p = 0.087) with a significant interaction between the rhythms. by contrast, low-peak vo2 was independently associated with hf events in both rhythms (af; hr 5.81; 95 % ci 1.75-19.30; p = 0.004, sr; hr 2.04; 95 % ci 1.19-3.49; p = 0.009), with a marginal interaction between them. in bivariate cox models, low-peak vo2 had much stronger predictive power for hf events than high-bnp in af, whereas high-bnp was more powerful than low-peak vo2 in sr. the prognostic value of bnp and peak vo2 for future hf events seemed to be different between sr and af.
dementia	objectiveswhile cognitive impairment is frequently reported in hiv-positive individuals and has historically been associated with poorer functional outcomes, the associations between cognitive impairment and patient-reported outcome measures (proms) in contemporary cohorts are unclear. methodswe tested cognitive function using a computerized battery (cogstate) in 290 hiv-positive and 97 hiv-negative individuals aged 50 years participating in the pharmacokinetic and clinical observations in people over fifty (poppy) study. participants completed questionnaires detailing physical and mental health [short form health survey (sf-36)], cognitive function [european aids clinical society (eacs) questions], activities of daily living [lawton instrumental activities of daily living (iadl)], depression [patient depression questionnaire (phq-9) and centres for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d)], falls and sexual desire. cognitive impairment was defined using the frascati criteria, global deficit score (gds) and multivariate normative comparison (mnc). in the hiv-positive group, the classification performances of the different definitions of cognitive impairment and dichotomized questionnaire results were calculated. resultsthe prevalence of cognitive impairment in the hiv-positive group was 34.5% (gds), 30.0% (frascati) and 22.1% (mnc), with only 2% diagnosed with hiv-associated dementia. in general, the associations between cognitive impairment and proms were weak regardless of the definition used: mean c-statistics were 0.543 (gds), 0.530 (mnc) and 0.519 (frascati). associations were similar using the global t-score to define cognitive impairment. summary health scores (sf-36) were lower, but only significantly so for those with cognitive impairment identified using mnc, for both mental health (61.4 vs. 75.8; p = 0.03) and physical health (60.9 vs. 75.0; p = 0.03). conclusionsthe associations between cognitive impairment and proms were weak, possibly because impairment was mild and therefore largely asymptomatic. further work is needed to elucidate the clinical implications of cognitive impairment in hiv-disease.
children's_health	background: studies indicate that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) is associated with adverse respiratory and allergy outcomes. exposure to pah may impair the immune function of the foetus and, subsequently, be responsible for an increased susceptibility of children to allergic diseases. objectives: the aim of the present study was to assess the association between mother 's exposure to pah during pregnancy and allergy diseases in their infants. we also assessed the above associations using measured pah exposure in children 's urine during the first two years of life. methods: the current analysis was restricted to 455 mothers and their children from lodz district. the women were interviewed three times during the pregnancy in order to collect demographic, socio-economic and medical history data. children 's health status was assessed at the age of 10-18 months and repeated at two years of age. the associations between dependent dichotomous variables and urine concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-hp) were analysed using logistic regression. results: we showed that higher urine concentrations of 1-hp in mothers at 20-24 weeks of pregnancy increased the risk of more frequent respiratory infections (p = 0.02) in children during their first year of life. higher 1-hp concentrations in children 's urine increased the risk of food allergy (p = 0.002) in children during their first two years of life. conclusions: this study suggests awareness of environmental factors, which may affect children 's health since pah showed to be a risk factor for airway infections and food allergy in children after adjustment for other risk factors.

osteoarthritis	introduction rotational acetabular osteotomy (rao), a joint-conserving surgery in which the femoral head coverage by autologous cartilage is improved to achieve joint stability, is one of the most common joint-conserving surgeries for acetabular dysplasia of the hip in adult patients. favorable outcome of rao for pre- and initial coxarthrosis has been reported with middle-to long-term observation; however, surgery should be selected for advanced coxarthrosis. the objective of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes and radiological arthritis changes in patients who were treated with rao and could be followed for 15 years or longer, and to investigate the joint conservation rate by preoperative arthritis stage. patients and methods the subjects were 156 patients (178 joints) treated with rotational acetabular osteotomy alone between january 1989 and june 2000. of those, 106 patients (115 joints) were retrospectively investigated. the mean age at the time of surgery was 41.4 years (14-60 years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 20 years and 4 months (15-26 years and 7 months). results there were no significant differences in the harris hip score among the three groups before surgery; however, the score was significantly lower in the advanced than pre/initial coxarthrosis cases at final follow-up. the joint conservation rate with the end point defined as time of total hip arthroplasty was 70.4% at 20 years after surgery. by stage, joint conservation rates were 88.9, 78.9, and 59.3% in pre-, initial, and advanced coxarthrosis cases, respectively, demonstrating a significantly lower rate in the advanced coxarthrosis cases (p = 0.034). the mean time to conversion was 23, 14.5, and 13.7 years in the pre-, initial, and advanced coxarthrosis cases, respectively. conclusion the outcome of rotational acetabular osteotomy in most hips with pre-or initial coxarthrosis was satisfactory. rotational acetabular osteotomy is an effective surgery for treating symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip in selected patients.
healthy_sleep	background: adolescents are prone to sleep problems that have unique developmental aspects and contribute to physical, emotional, and behavioural problems. aims: this study evaluated an individualized, multicomponent intervention that considered developmental factors, and promoted age-appropriate autonomy in three adolescent females with disrupted sleep. method: adolescents recorded sleep data on daily logs. a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design was used to evaluate a cognitive-behavioural intervention including sleep hygiene training, bedtime routine development, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training, stimulus control, sleep restriction, bedtime fading, and problem-solving, along with clinically indicated individualization. results: outcomes demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements and decreased variability in sleep parameters following intervention. each participant 's sleep log data indicated improvement in, or maintenance of, adequate total sleep time (tst), decreased sleep onset latency (sol), improved sleep efficiency (se), improvement in time of sleep onset, and decreased or continued low frequency of night awakenings (na). anecdotally, adolescents and parents reported improvement in daytime functioning, coping, and sense of wellbeing. conclusions: these cases highlight the potential for cognitive-behavioural interventions to facilitate healthy sleep in adolescents with challenging sleep problems.
osteoporosis	the aim of this study was to investigate the association of different dental prophylactic modalities and osteoradionecrosis (orn) and determine the risk of orn under different timing periods of scaling, with the use chlorhexidine mouth rinse after surgery and with different strategies of fluoride gel application in head and neck cancer (hnc) participants. a cohort of 18,231 hnc participants, including 941 orn patients and 17,290 matched control cases, were enrolled from a longitudinal health insurance database for catastrophic illness patients (lhid-cip) in taiwan. based on different dental prophylactic modalities before radiotherapy, including chlorhexidine mouth rinse, scaling, and fluoride gel, all hnc subjects were stratified into different groups. the cox proportional hazard regression was used to compare orn incidences under different dental prophylactic modalities. the results revealed that scaling and chlorhexidine mouth rinse were significantly related to orn risk (p = 0.004 and p < 0.0001). chlorhexidine mouth rinse was highly correlated to orn occurrence (hazard ratio [hr], 1.83-2.66), as exposure increased the risk by 2.43-fold among oral cancer patients, regardless of whether they had received major oral surgery or not. oral cancer patients receiving scaling within 2 wk before radiotherapy increased their incidence of orn by 1.28-fold compared with patients who had not undergone scaling within 6 mo. there is no significance of fluoride application for dental prophylaxis in increasing orn occurrence. in conclusion, dental prophylaxis before radiotherapy is strongly correlated to orn in hnc patients. chlorhexidine exposure and dental scaling within 2 wk before radiotherapy is significantly related to orn risk, especially in oral cancer patients. the use of 1.1% naf topical application did not significantly increase the risk of orn in hnc patients. an optimal dental prophylaxis protocol to reduce orn should concern cancer location, cautious prescription of chlorhexidine mouth rinse, and proper timing of scaling.
addiction	objectivedesire thinking is a voluntary cognitive process involving verbal and imaginal elaboration of a desired target. recent research has revealed that desire thinking may play a significant role in the escalation of craving. the goal of this study was to explore the effect of a desire thinking induction on craving in a sample of patients with alcohol use disorder. methodsten patients with alcohol use disorder were exposed to a brief exposure to alcohol-related thoughts plus desire thinking induction versus brief exposure to alcohol-related thoughts plus distraction. resultsthe induction of desire thinking led to a significant increase in distress and urge to use alcohol when compared to a behavioural assessment test and a distraction task. the clinical implications for the treatment of alcohol use disorder are discussed. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
bipolar_disorder	despite being the object of a thriving field of clinical research, the investigation of intrinsic brain network alterations in psychiatric illnesses is still in its early days. because the pathological alterations are predominantly probed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), many questions about the electrophysiological bases of resting-state alterations in psychiatric disorders, particularly among mood disorder patients, remain unanswered. alongside important research using electroencephalography (eeg), the specific recent contributions and future promise of magnetoencephalography (meg) in this field are not fully recognized and valued. here, we provide a critical review of recent findings from meg resting-state connectivity within major depressive disorder (mdd) and bipolar disorder (bd). the clinical meg resting-state results are compared with those previously reported with fmri and eeg. taken together, meg appears to be a promising but still critically underexploited technique to unravel the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal (both hyper- and hypo-) connectivity patterns involved in mdd and bd. in particular, a major strength of meg is its ability to provide source-space estimations of neuromagnetic long-range rhythmic synchronization at various frequencies (i.e., oscillatory coupling). the reviewed literature highlights the relevance of probing local and interregional rhythmic synchronization to explore the pathophysiological underpinnings of each disorder. however, before we can fully take advantage of meg connectivity analyses in psychiatry, several limitations inherent to meg connectivity analyses need to be understood and taken into account. thus, we also discuss current methodological challenges and outline paths for future research. meg resting-state studies provide an important window onto perturbed spontaneous oscillatory brain networks and hence supply an important complement to fmri-based resting-state measurements in psychiatric populations.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. the purpose of this study is to characterize sacroiliac joints (sijs) findings at ct of patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (dish), a condition characterized (using the resnick classification criteria) by ossification of at least four contiguous vertebrae in the thoracic spine and preserved disk space, but without radiographic evidence of intraarticular sij abnormalities. materials and methods. pelvic ct examinations of 104 patients with dish (fulfilling the resnick criteria on spinal ct) and 106 age-and sex-matched control subjects whose entire spine lacked ct evidence of dish (total, 149 men and 61 women; mean [+/- sd] age, 72.3 +/- 8.7 years) were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of intra-and extraarticular bridging osteophytes, spurs, subchondral cystlike changes, erosions, and sclerosis of sijs. excluded were patients with known ankylosing spondylitis or inflammatory-related diseases. data were analyzed using multivariate anova to examine the degree of difference between patients with dish and control subjects. logistic regression analysis was used to generate odds ratios to examine their discriminatory ability. roc analysis was then applied to examine the sensitivity and specificity of the results. results. the frequency of anterior bridging, posterior bridging, entheseal bridging, and joint ankylosis was significantly higher among patients with dish compared with control subjects (48% vs 9%, 20% vs 1%, 34% vs 4%, and 23% vs 0%, respectively; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). conclusion. intraarticular ankylosis seen at ct, an entity not included in the resnick classification criteria, is common among patients with dish, which implies that the radiologic classification criteria for dish need to be revised.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective: the aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (mets) and degree of cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk in patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa). material and methods: we performed a cross-sectional study on 102 adult patients with psa and a control group of 102 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). mets was diagnosed according to the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel iii (ncep-atp iii) and international diabetes federation (idf) criteria. the framingham risk scores of 10-year risk of cvds and coronary heart disease (chd) were also calculated. results: the prevalence of mets was higher in patients with psa than in those with ra, according to the ncep-atp iii (40.6% vs. 24.7%, respectively; p= 0.019) and idf (46.8% vs. 27.9%, respectively; p= 0.05) criteria. the prevalence of mets was higher in female patients with psa (p= 0.009) than in male patients. a significantly increased prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was determined in patients with psa (p= 0.019). no significant difference existed between the two groups with respect to 10-year cvd (p= 0.333) and chd (p= 0.798) risks. additionally, there were no significant differences between the clinical subtypes of psa with regard to mets (p= 0.229). conclusion: mets prevalence increased in patients with psa compared with those with ra, whereas the risks were similar for cvds and chd. for this reason, optimal protection measures should be taken and guidelines should be applied to achieve adequate metabolic control in patients with psa.
osteoarthritis	objective: several studies on knee osteoarthritis suggest that the intra-articular administration of hyaluronic acid products may be a relevant option in the management of patients with persistent pain. the aim of this study is to report the data of efficacy of us-guided hyalone (r)/hyalubrix (r) 60 injections in a large population of patients with hip osteoarthritis, repeated at least 2 times per year for up to seven years. patients and methods: this is a prospective, post-marketing, cohort study. data were collected from the antiage registry. values of lequesne index, pain vas, nsaids intake, global medical and patients assessments were evaluated every six months from the baseline to the end of the follow-up, seven years later. the inclusion criteria were: age >= 18 years, symptomatic hip osteoarthritis of at least 1-year duration, and up to 84 months of follow-up. all the patients received hyaluronic acid injections at least every six months, using ultrasound guidance to ensure accurate placement. results: 1022 patients were included in the study. the patients were categorized by age classes, gender, and body mass index (bmi). all the groups show a statistically significant reduction at all time points compared to baseline values of lequesne index, pain vas, nsaids intake, global medical and patients assessments. there are slight differences in the subgroups of overweighted, obese and over 70 years patients. conclusions: our study supports the clinical efficacy and safety of hyalone (r)/hyalubrix (r) 60 in patients affected by osteoarthritis. this is the first study, reporting on a large cohort of patients in different categories with a long follow-up on seven years. the data confirm the proper use of ultrasound-guided viscosupplementation (vs) as background therapy in the management of hip osteoarthritis.
autism	objective: this study aimed to investigate face scan paths and face perception abilities in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) and how these might relate to emotion recognition abilities in this population. method: the authors investigated facial emotion recognition, face scan paths, and face perception in 29 children with nf1 compared to 29 chronological age-matched typically developing controls. correlations between facial emotion recognition, face scan paths, and face perception in children with nf1 were examined. results: children with nf1 displayed significantly poorer recognition of fearful expressions compared to controls, as well as a nonsignificant trend toward poorer recognition of anger. athough there was no significant difference between groups in time spent viewing individual core facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, and nonfeature regions), children with nf1 spent significantly less time than controls viewing the face as a whole. children with nf1 also displayed significantly poorer face perception abilities than typically developing controls. facial emotion recognition deficits were not significantly associated with aberrant face scan paths or face perception abilities in the nf1 group. conclusions: these results suggest that impairments in the perception, identification, and interpretation of information from faces are important aspects of the social-cognitive phenotype of nf1.
mental_health	depression is a significant mental health concern. there are numerous depression questionnaires, several of which can be scored onto the patient reported outcomes measurement information system (promisa (r)) depression metric. this study expands the unified metric by linking depression subscales from the adult self-report (asr) and the brief symptom inventory (bsi) to it. an online sample of 2009 men who have sex with men (msm) was recruited. item factor analysis was used to evaluate the dimensionality of the aggregated measures and confirm the statistical assumptions for linking. then, linking was conducted using equipercentile and item response theory (irt) methods. equipercentile linking considered varying degrees of post-smoothing. irt-based linking used fixed-anchor calibration and separate calibration with stocking-lord linking constants. all three scales were broadly unidimensional. this msm sample had slightly higher average depression scores than the general population (mean = 54.4, sd = 9.6). both linking methods provided robust, largely comparable results. subgroup invariance held for age, race, and hiv status. given the broad comparability across methods, the crosswalk between raw sum scores and the unified t-score metric used fixed-anchor irt-based methods. promis provides a unified, interpretable metric for depression reporting. the results of this study allow the depression subscales from the asr and bsi to be rescored onto the unified metric with reasonable caution. this will benefit epidemiological projects aggregating data across various measures or time points.
lymphoma	recent experiences indicate that, as already reported for other types of cancer, circulating tumor cells (ctcs) may play a role also in non small cell lung cancer (nsclc) for diagnosis, therapy monitoring and prognostic purposes. ctcs evaluation could be particularly relevant in this clinical setting not only for the objective difficulty in obtaining tumor tissue, but also because of the lack of reliable tumor markers. in the current review, we will focus on the possible applications of ctcs in nsclc patients.

stress_management	introduction: familiarity with coping strategies is essential for stress management during pregnancy. the revised prenatal coping inventory (nu-pci) was developed to assess coping strategies during pregnancy. aim: this study aimed to assess the factor structure and psychometric properties of the persian version of the nu-pci. materials and methods: after forward-backward translation, the nu-pci was administered to 210 pregnant women who were enrolled in two teaching referral clinics in the north of the islamic republic of iran (babol). the participants completed the persian nu-pci and ways of coping questionnaire (wcq), which was used to determine the validity of the persian nu-pci. to test construct validity of the persian nu-pci, a principal components factor analysis was performed. results: principal components analysis with varimax rotation showed a best fitting 3-factor structure similar to the original with three coping subscales: planning-preparation, avoidance, and spiritual-positive coping. the persian nu-pci was internally consistent and within the acceptable range (alpha=0.89-0.97). the alpha coefficients for the nu-pci and the subscales of planning-preparation, avoidance, and spiritual-positive coping were high. test-retest coefficients for the nu-pci and subscales were 0.98-0.99. the nu-pci and its subscales correlated with the wcq in the entire sample and within each trimester. conclusion: the persian version of the nu-pci and the subscales of planning-preparation, avoidance, and spiritual-positive coping represent the first reliable standardized tool for measuring coping strategies during pregnancy in the islamic republic of iran. therefore, it can be applied as a quick and accurate preliminary screening tool for evaluating coping strategies throughout pregnancy in clinics and other medical and research settings.
kidney_health	kidney disease disparately affects those of african descent. age trends have generally been established for kidney function in the overall us population, but the contribution of age at the time of immigration for african immigrants is unknown. to examine the independent and joint effects of age and age at the time of immigration, and kidney function. estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) was calculated for 93 african immigrants (60 % male; mean age = 33.5). hierarchical regression and post hoc analyses revealed a significant age x age at the time of immigration interaction after accounting for traditional risk factors among those who immigrated at age a parts per thousand currency sign21. younger age at the time of immigration to the us may exacerbate an inverse relationship between age and kidney function in a self-identified healthy african immigrant sample. investigation of biopsychosocial factors associated with kidney health among african immigrants is warranted.
children's_health	body mass index classification, physical activity (pa), and sedentary behaviors were compared in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (asd) to typically developing adolescents. participants included 42,747 adolescents (asd, n = 915) from the 2011-2012 national survey of children 's health. after controlling for covariates, adolescents were more likely to be overweight and obese, and less likely to engage in regular pa versus typically developing adolescents (p 's < 0.05). increased odds for overweight and obesity were attenuated after adjustment for pa. higher autism severity was associated with increased odds of overweight and obesity and decreased odds of pa, sport, and club participation. these findings suggest adolescents with asd are in need of targeted programs to decrease obesity and increase physical activity.
medicare	major health policy creation or changes, including governmental and private policies affecting health care delivery are based on health care reform(s). health care reform has been a global issue over the years and the united states has seen proposals for multiple reforms over the years. a successful, health care proposal in the united states with involvement of the federal government was the short-lived establishment of the first system of national medical care in the south. in the 20th century, the united states was influenced by progressivism leading to the initiation of efforts to achieve universal coverage, supported by a republican presidential candidate, theodore roosevelt. in 1933, franklin d. roosevelt, a democrat, included a publicly funded health care program while drafting provisions to social security legislation, which was eliminated from the final legislation. subsequently, multiple proposals were introduced, starting in 1949 with president harry s truman who proposed universal health care; the proposal by lyndon b. johnson with social security act in 1965 which created medicare and medicaid; proposals by ted kennedy and president richard nixon that promoted variations of universal health care. presidential candidate jimmy carter also proposed universal health care. this was followed by an effort by president bill clinton and headed by first lady hillary clinton in 1993, but was not enacted into law. finally, the election of president barack obama and control of both houses of congress by the democrats led to the passage of the affordable care act (aca), often referred to as "" obamacare"" was signed into law in march 2010. since then, the aca, or obamacare, has become a centerpiece of political campaigning. the republicans now control the presidency and both houses of congress and are attempting to repeal and replace the aca.
ankylosing_spondylitis	psoriatic arthritis is a part of the family of diseases referred to as spondyloarthropathies, a diverse group of chronic inflammatory disorders with common clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. peripheral arthritis is the most common symptom of psoriatic arthritis and patients also frequently experience involvement of the entheses, spine, skin, and nails. due to the diverse clinical spectrum of disease severity, tissues affected, and associated comorbidities, the treatment of psoriatic arthritis can be challenging and it is necessary to mitigate risks associated with both the disease and its treatment. these risks include disease-specific, treatment-related, and psychological risks. disease-specific risks include those associated with disease progression that can limit functional status and be mitigated through early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. risks also arise from comorbidities that are associated with psoriatic arthritis such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and gastrointestinal inflammation. patient outcomes can be affected by the treatment strategy employed and the pharmacologic agents administered. additionally, it is important for physicians to be aware of risks specific to each therapeutic option. the impact of psoriatic arthritis is not limited to the skin and joints and it is common for patients to experience quality-of-life impairment. patients are also more likely to have depression, anxiety, and alcoholism. this article reviews the many risks associated with psoriatic arthritis and provides guidance on mitigating these risks.
healthy_sleep	the present study was undertaken to investigate the influence of apneas on rem-elicited dream reports, and to examine the influence of clinically successful treatment of the apneas on dreaming. thirty-three volunteers suffering from sleep apnea syndrome (sas) slept during two nights in the sleep laboratory. sixteen were treated with nasal continuous positive air pressure (cpap) during the first night and 17 during the second. there was a total of 150 awakenings. 78 from rem sleep without apneas, and 72 from rem sleep with apneas. after apneas, dream recall tended to be higher (60% vs. 72%, p = 0.09) and dream reports were significantly longer (16 words vs. 24 words, p = 0.05), than after healthy sleep. no systematic incorporation of the apnea stimulus into the dream reports could be demonstrated. dreams after apneas were found to be significantly more negative than dreams after healthy sleep (p < 0.01). this suggests that rem-elicited dreams are basically resistant to powerful internal stimulation. the stress caused by the apneas exerted only a very global emotional influence on manifest dreaming.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	a corona is a layer of macromolecules formed on a nanoparticle surface in vivo. it can substantially change the biological identity of nanomaterials and possibly trigger adverse responses from the body tissues. dissecting the role of the corona in the development of a particular disease may provide profound insights for understanding toxicity of nanomaterials in general. in our present study, we explored the capability of different silica nanoparticles (sinps) to induce silicosis in the mouse lung and analyzed the composition of coronas formed on these particles. we found that sinps of certain size and surface chemistry could specifically recruit transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf-beta 1)intotheircorona, which subsequently induces the development of lung fibrosis. once embedded into the corona on sinps, tgf-beta l was remarkably more stable than in its free form, and its fibrosis-triggering activity was significantly prolonged. our study meaningfully demonstrates that a specific corona component on a certain nanoparticle could initiate a particular pathogenic process in a clinically relevant disease model. our findings may shed light on the understanding of molecular mechanisms of human health risks correlated with exposure to small-scale substances.
bipolar_disorder	risperidone and one of its active metabolites, paliperidone, are widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia. we used a patch-clamp study to investigate the effects of paliperidone on herg potassium channels expressed in hek cells. western blot analyses were used to study the effects of risperidone and paliperidone on herg and herg 3.1 isoform channel trafficking. risperidone and paliperidone inhibited the herg tail currents in a concentration-dependent manner with ic50 values of 0.16 and 0.57 mu m, respectively. the block of herg currents by paliperidone was voltage-dependent, increasing over a range of voltages for channel activation. a fast application of paliperidone inhibited the herg current elicited by a 5-s depolarizing pulse to +60 mv to fully inactivate the herg currents, suggesting an inactivated state block. a fast application of paliperidone during repolarization reversibly inhibited the herg tail currents in a concentration-dependent manner with a ic50 value of 1.26 mu m. kinetic analysis of paliperidone interaction with the open state of the herg channels showed that the rate constants of association (k (+1)) and dissociation (k (-1)) for paliperidone were 0.45 mu m-1 s(-1) and 1.07 s(-1), respectively. paliperidone shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of the herg currents in a hyperpolarizing direction and also produced a use-dependent block. risperidone and paliperidone had no effect on herg and herg 3.1 channel trafficking to the cell membrane. our results indicated that paliperidone inhibited the herg current by preferentially interacting with the open and inactivated states of the channel, but not by disruption of herg channel protein trafficking.
anxiety	background: adolescent behaviour is strongly linked to emotions. the aim of this study is 1) analyse the differences between young offenders and non-offenders in emotional instability, anger, aggressive behaviour, anxiety and depression, and also the differences according to sex; and 2) compare the relation between emotional instability and anxiety, depression and aggressive behaviour mediated or modulated by anger in both groups. method: participants are 440 adolescents, both male and female (15-18 years old). 220 were young offenders from four different correctional centres of the valencia region. the other 220 participants were randomly chosen from ten public and private schools in the valencia metropolitan area. in the schools the instruments were applied collectively in the classroom, with a 50 minutes maximum duration. in the youth detention centre the application was carried out in small groups. results: the structural equation model (sem) carried out on each group, young offenders and non-offenders show a relation between the assessed variables. emotional instability appears strongly related with anger in both samples, but anger just predicts depression and aggressive behaviour in the offender population. conclusions: the results give relevant information for treatment and prevention of aggressive behaviour and delinquency in teenagers through emotional regulation.
children's_health	children from wealthier families are more likely to have health insurance than children from poorer families on average. however, the relationship between family income and health insurance is non-linear, as children near the federal poverty line (fpl) are less likely to be insured than children from both wealthier families (who obtain health insurance from the private market) and poorer families (who obtain government-funded health insurance). this health insurance dip has persisted even as medicaid has been expanded to cover those above the fpl. one explanation for this is that families who are far below the poverty line are better connected to the welfare system, and consequently, are more likely to enroll in medicaid. this study uses data from the 2001-2013 current population surveys and finds that (1) controlling for many of the determinants of eligibility, those on other forms of government assistance are more likely to have health insurance, and (2) the relationship between family income and children 's health insurance status is strictly increasing after controlling for enrollment in other welfare programs.

lymphoma	anaplastic large cell lymphoma (alcl) is one of the most common peripheral t-cell lymphomas, and the incidence is higher in blacks than non-hispanic whites. alk-positive and alk-negative alcl are distinct subtypes that have different characteristics and clinical outcomes. breast implant associated alcl is a rare lymphoma that has a good survival outcome, and a recent study showed that total capsulectomy is essential for treatment. brentuximab vedotin (bv) is a standard treatment for relapsed/refractory alcl. the response rate is high at 80-90%; however, once the disease progresses in patients on bv, survival outcome is very poor, with a median overall survival of less than two months.
autism	the current study examined the relationship between early language ability and autistic-like traits in adulthood, utilising data from 644 participants from a longitudinal study of the general population. language performance at 2 years was measured with the language development survey (lds), and at 20 years the participants completed the autism-spectrum quotient (aq). vocabulary size at 2 years was negatively associated with total aq score, as well as scores on the communication, and social skills subscales. adults who had been late talkers were also more likely to have 'high' scores on the communication subscale. this is the first study to show an association between early language ability and autistic-like traits in adulthood.
lymphoma	background: malignancy is the most common etiology of acquired fistulae between the tracheobronchial tree and esophagus. the majority are due to either primary bronchial or esophageal carcinoma, and are typically observed in adult population. the occurrence of tracheoesophageal fistula (tef) in patients with hodgkin lymphoma is a rare phenomenon. observation: we report a rare case of hodgkin lymphoma with tef in a 10-year-old girl at presentation. she also developed pulmonary tuberculosis later during the follow up. she was fed through a nasogastric tube to avoid aspiration through the fistulous tract. she did well with chemotherapy and anti-tubercular therapy. conclusions: our case suggests tef in hodgkin lymphoma at the time of diagnosis is a rare complication in pediatric age group. lymphoma-related tef require far less active intervention, as against esophageal or bronchial malignancy related tef.
lymphoma	how epstein-barr virus (ebv) affects the clinical outcome of ebv-positive diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) remains largely unknown. the viral oncogene lmp1 is at the crux of tumorigenesis and cell survival. therefore, we examined the association between lmp1(high) cells drug resistance. we first assessed slamf1 as a surrogate marker for lmp1(high) cells. lmp1 and its target gene ccl22 were highly expressed in slamf1high farage cells. these cells survived longer following treatment with a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (chop). genes associated with interferon-alpha, allograft rejection, nf-kappa b and stat3 were also overexpressed in the surviving farage cells. specifically, chop treatment increased il10, lmp1 and pstat3 expression levels in a dose-dependent fashion. addition of exogenous il4 greatly increased the levels of lmp1 and pstat3, which rendered the farage cells more resistant to chop by up-regulating the anti-apoptotic genes bcl-xl and mcl1. the farage cells were sensitive to velcade and stat3, 5, and 6 inhibitors. inhibition of nf-kappa b and stat3, in combination with chop, decreased lmp1 levels and effectively induced cell death in the farage cells. we suggest that lmp1(high) cells are responsible for the poor drug response of ebv+ dlbcl and that perturbation of the nf-kappa b and stat signaling pathways increases toxicity in these cells.
atrial_fibrillation	postoperatory atrial fibrillation (af) is a common complication after cardiac surgery. among others cardiac structural changes, epicardial adiposity (ea) and inflammation could be associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including af. because there are not enough studies on the association between epicardial fat and inflammation in af, this paper assesses the association between structural changes in human right atrial appendages (raa) in patients with and without af with focus on ea and inflammation. raa specimens from 20 coronary patients (ages 60 +/- 10 years) were divided in 2 groups including patients with and without postoperatory af. histological, immunohistochemical (imh) and morphometrical methods were used for assessing ea, myocardial fatty infiltration, epicardial inflammatory foci, cardiomyocytes size and vacuolation and extent of interstitial fibrosis. atrial changes were found in most patients from both groups, having higher proportions in postoperatory af patients. ea extent and myocardial fatty infiltration were twofold to threefold higher in patients with postoperatory af and associated epicardial mononuclear inflammation. raa structural changes can indicate the susceptibility to develop postoperatory af. currently, ea and inflammation have recently emerged as new independent af risk factors. so, we proposed to study raa structural changes, including ea, epicardial inflammatory foci in relation with postoperatory af frequency.
mental_health	little is known about the offending behavior and recidivism factors of latinos by nativity (u.s. born, foreign-born). the present study focused on latinos in community corrections (n = 201) in miami, florida, and examined differences in criminal activity, drug use, and mental health by nativity. data were collected utilizing convenience sampling between june 2014 and december 2015. the research question was: what are the offending, drug use, and mental health histories of latinos involved in community corrections? participants were mostly male (n = 120; 59.7%), white (n = 105; 52.2%), and cuban (n = 97; 48.3%). u.s. born community corrections clients (n = 141) were more likely to report more lifetime and recent criminal activity; and more likely to report lifetime and recent drug use behavior than foreign-born latinos (n = 60). no differences were found in recent mental health. correctional healthcare should tailor services such as substance abuse treatment differently toward u.s. born and foreign-born latinos.
bipolar_disorder	bipolar disorder (bd) is a unique mood disorder defined by periods of depression and mania. the defining diagnosis of bd is the presence of mania/hypomania, with symptoms including hyperactivity and risk-taking. since current treatments do not ameliorate cognitive deficits such as risky decision-making, and impulsivity that can negatively affect a patient 's quality of life, better treatments are needed. here, we tested whether acute treatment with brexpiprazole, a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator with partial agonist activity at d-2/3 and 5-ht1a receptors, would attenuate the bd mania-relevant behaviors of the dopamine transporter (dat) knockdown mouse model of mania. the effects of brexpiprazole on dat knockdown and wild-type littermate mice were examined in the behavioral pattern monitor (bpm) and iowa gambling task (igt) to quantify activity/exploration and impulsivity/risk-taking behavior respectively. dat knockdown mice exhibited hyper-exploratory behavior in the bpm and made fewer safe choices in the igt. brexpiprazole attenuated the mania-like hyper-exploratory phenotype and increased safe choices in risk-preferring dat knockdown mice. brexpiprazole also reduced safe choices in safe-preferring mice irrespective of genotype. finally, brexpiprazole reduced premature (impulsive-like) responses in both groups of mice. consistent with earlier reports, dat knockdown mice exhibited hyper-exploratory, risk-preferring, and impulsive-like profiles consistent with patients with bd mania in these tasks. these behaviors were attenuated after brexpiprazole treatment. these data therefore indicate that brexpiprazole could be a novel treatment for bd mania and/or risk-taking/impulsivity disorders, since it remediates some relevant behavioral abnormalities in this mouse model.
osteoporosis	this review summarises aspects of vitamin d metabolism, the consequences of vitamin d deficiency, and the impact of vitamin d supplementation on musculoskeletal health in older age. with age, changes in vitamin d exposure, cutaneous vitamin d synthesis and behavioural factors (including physical activity, diet and sun exposure) are compounded by changes in calcium and vitamin d pathophysiology with altered calcium absorption, decreased 25-oh vitamin d [25(oh) d] hydroxylation, lower renal fractional calcium reabsorption and a rise in parathyroid hormone. hypovitaminosis d is common and associated with a risk of osteomalacia, particularly in older adults, where rates of vitamin d deficiency range from 10-66%, depending on the threshold of circulating 25(oh) d used, population studied and season. the relationship between vitamin d status and osteoporosis is less clear. while circulating 25(oh) d has a linear relationship with bone mineral density (bmd) in some epidemiological studies, this is not consistent across all racial groups. the results of randomized controlled trials of vitamin d supplementation on bmd are also inconsistent, and some studies may be less relevant to the older population, as, for example, half of participants in the most robust meta-analysis were aged under 60 years. the impact on bmd of treating vitamin d deficiency (and osteomalacia) is also rarely considered in such intervention studies. when considering osteoporosis, fracture risk is our main concern, but vitamin d therapy has no consistent fracture-prevention effect, except in studies where calcium is coprescribed (particularly in frail populations living in care homes). as a j-shaped effect on falls and fracture risk is becoming evident with vitamin d interventions, we should target those at greatest risk who may benefit from vitamin d supplementation to decrease falls and fractures, although the optimum dose is still unclear.
mental_health	american researchers have led the world in developing, evaluating, and disseminating evidence-based psychiatric rehabilitation practices for people with serious mental illness. paradoxically, however, the usa lags behind most industrialized nations in providing access to high-quality mental health and psychiatric services. this essay examines several evidence-based practices developed in the usa, the spread of these practices, the barriers to ensuring availability to people who could benefit from these services, and some promising directions for overcoming the barriers. factors influencing the growth and sustainment of effective client-centred practices include the availability of adequate and stable funding, committed leadership, and the influence of vested interests. two strategies for promoting the spread and sustainment of well-implemented evidence-based practices are the adoption of fidelity scales and learning communities.
osteoarthritis	background: there is a dearth of literature examining the causes of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (fai) and when such morphology appears. the purpose of the current study was to analyze how the ossific portion of the proximal femur develops over time with respect to standard cam-type fai parameters. methods: a collection of 193 femurs from cadavers aged 4 to 21 years were evaluated. the age, sex, ethnicity, and status of the proximal femoral physes (open or closed) of each were recorded. each specimen was digitally photographed in standardized anteroposterior and modified axial positions. from these photographs, the anterior offset, anterior offset ratio (aor), and alpha-angle were determined. a cam lesion was defined as an alpha-angle >55 degrees on the lateral view. results: the mean age of the specimens was 17.5 +/- 4.2 years. the majority were male (69%) and african american (79%) with closed physes (78%). there were significant differences among discrete age groups with respect to alpha-angle (p = 0.01), anterior offset (p < 0.01), and aor (p < 0.01). in addition, younger femurs with open physes had a significantly higher mean alpha-angle (p < 0.01), lower mean anterior offset (p < 0.01), and higher mean aor (p < 0.01) compared with older ones with closed physes. specimens defined as having a cam deformity had a statistically higher alpha-angle (p < 0.01) and lower anterior offset (p < 0.01), but there was no difference in aor values compared with specimens without a cam lesion (p = 0.1). conclusions: the apparent decline in alpha-angles as age increases indicates that the traditional alpha-angle in younger patients measures a different anatomic parameter (ossified femur excluding the cartilaginous portion) than in older patients (completely ossified femur). this suggests that the bony alpha-angle is inappropriate in the evaluation of cam lesions in the immature physis. the aor, rather than the anterior offset, may be more accurate in the evaluation of the growing proximal femur. clinical relevance: this study provides novel insight into, and enhances the understanding of, the development of cam-type fai.
lymphoma	introduction: diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) is the most common histotype in non hodgkin lymphoma, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. the standard treatment for elderly fit dlbcl patients is rituximab-chop; in unfit and frail patients, chemotherapy at reduced intensity should be considered.areas covered: in this article, we will review use of standard therapies and new drugs investigated such as immonomudulating agents (imids), bruton tyrosine kinase (btk), in fit, unfit, frail and very elderly dlcbl patients.expert commentary: r-chop21 in fit dlbcl patients is still the standard of care, while in elderly unfit patients a reduction of doses of cytotoxic drugs or schemes that avoid antracycline should be considered. the comprensive geriatric assesment based in age, comorbidities and functional abilities of daily living is an important tool in elderly, in order to discriminate between fit, unfit or frail patients. novel drugs represent valid therapeutic options in relapsed/refractory setting so continued participation in clinical trials should be encouraged.
lymphoma	introduction: pediatric patients with hodgkin lymphoma (hl) have several risk factors for venous thromboembolism (vte). although these patients are occasionally treated with thromboprophylaxis, no guidelines are implemented in sweden. scarce data from adult patients indicate an increased risk of vte, but pediatric data is largely missing. given the favorable overall survival of hl, there should reasonably be more focus on preventing complications. materials and ethods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study, including all patients registered in the childhood cancer registry under the age of 18 years diagnosed with hl between january 2005 and december 2015 in sweden. results: data was retrieved from the medical records of all 163 patients (100%) at six swedish pediatric cancer centers. the incidence of vte was 7.7% (symptomatic vte 3.9%). the median follow-up was 3.4 years (range 0.3-10.5). only five patients (3.1%) were treated with thromboprophylaxis. all vte events occurred in the older age category (11-17 years) and all but one (92.7%) had a mediastinal mass. while the vte did not significantly affect the treatment of hl, it caused increased morbidity and 2/12 developed a post-thrombotic syndrome. no significant risk factors for vte were identified. conclusions: vte is a relatively common complication of hl and its treatment, causing increased acute and long-term morbidity. however, due to limited number of events we could not demonstrate risk-factors for vte that would identify patients who might benefit from thromboprophylaxis.

osteoporosis	alendronate therapy has been associated with serious side effects. altering the alendronate concentration and combining with high-frequency loading as mechanical intervention was explored in this animal study as a treatment for osteoporosis. the bone anabolic potency of high-frequency loading was overruled by the different alendronate dosages applied in the present study. further exploration of reduced hormonal therapy associated with mechanical interventions in osteoporosis treatment should be sought. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of alendronate (aln) administration at two different dosages, associated or not with high-frequency (hf) loading, on the bone microstructural response. sixty-four female wistar rats were used, of which 48 were ovariectomized (ovx) and 16 were sham-operated (shovx). the ovx animals were divided into three groups: two groups were treated with alendronate, at a dosage of 2 mg/kg (aln((2))) or at a reduced dosage of 1 mg/kg (aln((1))) three times per week. a third ovx group did not receive pharmaceutical treatment. all four groups were mechanically stimulated via whole body vibration (wbv) at hf (up to 150 hz) or left untreated (shwbv). aln and hf were administered for 6 weeks, starting at 10-week post-(sh)ovx. tibia bone structural parameters were analyzed using ex vivo microcomputed tomography. trabecular bone loss and structural deterioration resulting from ovariectomy were partially restored by aln administration, demonstrated by the improvement of trabecular patter factor (tb.pf), trabecular separation (tb.sp), and structure model index (smi) of the aln groups compared to that of the ovx group, regardless of the applied dosage [aln((2)) or aln((1))] or mechanical loading regime (shwbv or wbv). however, a significant positive effect of the aln((1)) administration on trabecular (decrease of tb.sp and smi) and cortical bone (increase of cortical thickness) microarchitecture compared to that of the ovx status group was observed for both loading regimes was not seen for aln((2)). furthermore, hf loading resulted in cortical bone changes, with an increased trabeculary area and endocortical perimeter. finally, the benefits of a combined therapy of aln with hf loading could not be discerned in the present experimental conditions. the bone anabolic potency of hf loading was overruled by the aln dosages applied in the present study. further altering the aln dosage combined with robust mechanical stimuli needs to be considered in osteoporosis research and eventually therapy.
mental_health	permanent supportive housing (psh) is an evidence-based health intervention for persons experiencing homelessness, but the impact of individual mechanisms within this intervention on health requires further research. this study examines the longitudinal impact of the mechanism of supportive housing within a peer-delivered psh model on overall health and mental health (as measured by psychological distress and self-report of bothersome symptoms) outcomes in an ethnically diverse population. the 237 participants in the study included persons who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and who also had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. sixty-one percent of all participants received supportive housing. all 3 outcomes were significantly associated with quality of life indicators, recovery, and social connectedness. in addition, overall health was significantly associated with employment, age, and psychological distress. psychological distress was associated with gender, type of housing, and history of violence or trauma. experiencing bothersome symptoms was associated with drug use, history of violence or trauma, and psychological distress. longitudinal models of these 3 outcomes showed that supportive housing was significantly associated with good to excellent health 6 months after baseline (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval [1.12, 8.66]). the models also demonstrated that the supportive housing and comparison groups experienced decreased psychological distress after baseline. the results of this study demonstrate the importance of supportive housing within the context of psh, particularly for the overall health of participants, and the positive overall impact of psh on mental health in a diverse population.
psoriatic_arthritis	malignancy is a major cause of death in patients with inflammatory disease. the risk of individual malignancies is altered in some inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. this study aimed to examine malignancy incidence in patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa), a related inflammatory disease. institutional cancer registry and medical record linkage systems were retrospectively reviewed in a population-based incidence cohort of 217 patients with psa and 434 age- and sex-matched comparators. malignancy rates were compared using adjusted cox models. incidence of overall malignancy (excluding nmsc; hazard ratio (hr) 1.64; 95 % confidence interval (ci) 1.03-2.61) and breast cancer (hr 3.59; 95 % ci 1.22-10.61), but not nmsc (hr 1.23; 95 % ci 0.72-2.09), were significantly elevated in the psa cohort. age and female sex were similar predisposing risk factors in both cohorts. the overall incidence of malignancy, as well as the risk of breast cancer, was higher in patients with psa than in the general population.
children's_health	background: vitamin and mineral deficiencies affect more than two million people worldwide. in 2011, based on recent scientific evidence and the low effectiveness of current strategies, the world health organization recommended home fortification of foods with multiple micronutrients in powder (mnp) as a new strategy to prevent and control anaemia during childhood. this systematic review assessed adherence to and acceptability of home fortification with multiple micronutrients in powder (mnp) in complementary feeding. methods: adherence was assessed based on number or percentage of prescribed sachets that were consumed, and acceptability was assessed according to perceptions of caregivers and children about mnp. results: in summary, the studies indicated that home fortification with mnp has good adherence, ranging from 50 % to over 90 % of the prescribed sachets and that mnp was well accepted by caregivers. caregivers reported side effects in 3 % to 32 % of children taking mnp in many studies; diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation were the most common. conclusions: home fortification with mnp has good adherence and acceptability in infants, with higher adherence in non-daily or flexible administration regimens. characteristics of the target population and increased diarrhoea burden should be considered for planning public health programs with long term use of mnp. acceptability of the mnp is satisfactory, when the use and perceived beneficial effects on children 's health are considered.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	introduction: patients with non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) and interstitial lung disease (ild) are at high risk of acute exacerbation of ild (ae-ild) when treated with systemic chemotherapy. standard treatment for nsclc complicated by ild has not been established. purpose and methods: to examine whether the type of ild categorized by the official ats/ers/jrs/alat statement as ""idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) by high-resolution computed tomography (hrct)"" could predict chemotherapy-induced ae-ild in nsclc patients with ild, we retrospectively reviewed all patients with nsclc complicated by ild who had received chemotherapy at our institute from january 2007 until december 2013. patients' characteristics, pathology and clinical staging of lung cancer, chemotherapy, type of ild and ae-ild during chemotherapy were evaluated. ild was classified according to the statement as follows: usual interstitial pneumonia (uip), possible uip, and inconsistent with a uip pattern. results: a total of 46 patients had pre-existing ild and received chemotherapy. the mean age was 73 years (range 46-83 years). fifteen (32.6%) of 46 patients with ild developed chemotherapy-induced ae-ild, which was seen more frequently in patients with ild with a uip pattern or possible uip pattern than in patients with a pattern inconsistent with uip (80% versus 9.7%, p<0.001). multivariate analyses including age, sex, performance status and radiographic patterns of ild showed that the presence of a uip or possible uip pattern was an independent risk factor for chemotherapy-induced ae-ild. conclusions: ild with a uip pattern or possible uip pattern by the classification could be a risk factor for ae-ild in nsclc patients with ild.
osteoarthritis	malocclusion caused by abnormal jaw development or muscle overuse during mastication results in abnormal mechanical stress to the tissues surrounding the temporomandibular joint (tmj). excessive mechanical stress against soft and hard tissues around the tmj is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including osteoarthritis (oa). oa-related fibrosis is a possible cause of joint stiffness in oa. however, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fibrosis around the tmj remain to be clarified. here, we established a cell line of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (flss) derived from the mouse tmj. then, we examined whether the rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase (rock)/actin/myocardin-related transcription factor (mrtf) gene regulatory axis positively regulates the myofibroblast (mf) differentiation status of flss. we found that i) flss extensively expressed the mf markers -smooth muscle actin (-sma) and type i collagen; and ii) an inhibitor against the actin-polymerizing agent rock, y-27632; iii) an actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin b; iv) an inhibitor of the mrtf/serum response factor-regulated transcription, ccg-100602, clearly suppressed the mrna levels of -sma and type i collagen in flss; and v) an mf differentiation attenuator fibroblast growth factor-1 suppressed filamentous actin formation and clearly suppressed the mrna levels of -sma and type i collagen in flss. these results strongly suggest that the rock/actin/mrtf axis promotes the fibrogenic activity of synoviocytes around the tmj. our findings partially clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of tmj-oa and may aid in identifying drug targets for treating this condition at the molecular level.
atrial_fibrillation	backgroundlittle is known about the comparative effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants (noac) compared to warfarin in chinese atrial fibrillation (af) patients. our aim was to compare the ischemic stroke risk reduction and incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ich) of warfarin in relation to quality of anticoagulation control (as reflected by time in therapeutic range [ttr]), and to dabigatran and rivaroxaban in a real-world cohort of chinese af patients. hypothesisnoac, rather than warfarin, is preferred in chinese af patients. methodsof 2099 patients studied (73.1 12.3 years, female: 44.6%, cha(2)ds(2)-vasc 3.7 1.9 and has-bled 2.0 +/- 1.0) with nonvalvular af, 963 patients (45.9%) were on warfarin (only 16.3% had ttr 65%), 669 patients were on rivaroxaban, and 467 patients were on dabigatran. resultsafter a mean follow-up of 21.7 +/- 13.4 months, there were 156 ischemic strokes (annual incidence of 4.10%/year), with the incidence of ischemic stroke being highest in patients on warfarin with ttr <65% (5.24%/year), followed by those on rivaroxaban (3.74%/year), and those on warfarin with ttr 65% (3.35%/year), whereas patients on dabigatran had the lowest incidence of ischemic stroke (1.89%/year). the incidence of ich was lowest in patients on dabigatran (0.39%/year) compared with those on rivaroxaban (0.52%/year) and warfarin, with ttr <65% (0.95%/year) and ttr 65% (0.58%/year). patients on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily had similar ischemic stroke risk (1.93%/year) and ich risk (0.21%/year) compared to dabigatran. conclusions in chinese af patients, the benefits of warfarin therapy for stroke prevention and ich reduction depend on ttr. of the treatments compared, dabigatran, as well as rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, was associated with lowest ischemic stroke and ich rates.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective: unusual or unexpected effect of treatment background: ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a chronic inflammatory disease that predominantly affects the axial skeleton. the ability of anti-tnf-alpha agents to reduce disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axspa), including as, has been demonstrated in multiple randomized trials and several meta-analyses. reports on the efficacy of rituximab in treatment of as have described good results. we report on a patient with as who failed anti-tnf-a therapy but showed good clinical improvement with rituximab therapy. case report: a 38-year-old male patient was diagnosed with as and showed poor response to sulfasalazine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). infliximab was initiated with marked improvement as per the bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai). due to disease flare, the patient was switched to etanercept. he subsequently acquired papillary thyroid cancer and etanercept was discontinued. he underwent a total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy. for his ongoing active disease, nsaids and sulfasalazine were resumed with a lack of response (basdai= 7.1). rituximab was started and resulted in significant improvement (basdai=2.3). conclusions: rituximab can be a potential target therapy for patients who start to lose response to tnf-inhibitors or for those who develop solid malignancies. further placebo-controlled studies are required.
lymphoma	to determine prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of steroid-induced hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies we performed retrospective analysis of patients who were hospitalized on any of the four hematology services or bone marrow transplant service and who received systemic steroids during a 2-month period. mean glucoses for days 1-4 and maximum glucose were calculated and the total daily steroid dose was converted to equivalent dose of dexamethasone. hyperglycemia was defined as any glucose >9.917 mmol/l during days 1-4. we examined associations between variables using spearman 's correlations and multivariable linear regression 168 patients were included in the analysis. mean age was 57.1 +/- 14.4 years with 59% males and 90% caucasians. the prevalence of hyperglycemia was 39%. eight patients received intravenous insulin. in patients without diabetes, steroid dose equivalent to >12 mg dexamethasone and longer acting steroids caused greater degree of hyperglycemia compared to a dose < 12 mg. maximum glucose was a predictor of hospital length of stay among patients without diabetes (but not those with diabetes), and with acute leukemia or stem cell transplant (but not other hematologic malignancies). there were no significant differences in in mortality or other outcomes between the groups with and without hyperglycemia hyperglycemia is common in patients with hematologic malignancies, which require frequent corticosteroids. higher steroid dose and long-acting steroids caused a greater degree of hyperglycemia. maximum glucose was a predictor of length of stay but this was only significant for patients without diabetes, those with acute hematologic malignancy or stem cell transplant.
atrial_fibrillation	background: direct-acting oral anticoagulants (doacs) are used in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (svt) and cirrhosis, but evidence for safety and efficacy in this setting is limited. our aim was to identify indications and reasons for starting or switching to doacs and to report adverse effects, complications and short-term outcome. methods: data collection including demographic information, laboratory values, treatment and complications through the vascular liver disease interest group consortium. results: forty-five centres (90%) of the consortium completed the initial ecrf. we report here a series of 94 patients from 17 centres. thirty-six patients (38%) had cirrhosis. child-pugh score was 6 (range 5-8), and meld score 10.2 (range 6-19). indications for anticoagulation were splanchnic vein thrombosis (75%), deep vein thrombosis (5%), atrial fibrillation (14%) and others (6%). doacs used were rivaroxaban (83%), dabigatran (11%) and apixaban (6%). patients were followed up for a median duration of 15 months (cirrhotic) and 26.5 months (non-cirrhotic). adverse events occurred in 17% of patients and included one case of recurrent portal vein thrombosis and five cases of bleeding. treatment with doacs was stopped in three cases. the major reasons for choosing doacs were no need for monitoring or inadequacy of inr to guide anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients. renal and liver function did not change during treatment. conclusions: a consistent number of patients with svt and/or cirrhosis are currently treated with doacs, which seem to be effective and safe. these data provide a basis for performing randomized clinical trials of doacs vs. low molecular weight heparin or vitamin k antagonists.
hereditary_angioedema	vibratory angioedema (va) is a rare, inherited type of physical urticaria characterized by acute onset of mucosal and / or cutaneous edema that is triggered by vibration. we report a case of a 63-year-old woman with va elicited by use of mechanized (vibratory) dental equipment. to our knowledge, this is the first report of va induced by mechanical dental equipment.
atrial_fibrillation	selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) have been reported to be potentially associated with an increased risk of bleeding. a meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted to quantify this risk. case-control and cohort studies investigating bleeding risk under ssri therapy were retrieved by searching the medline, pascal, google scholar and scopus databases. case-control studies were included if they reported bleeding incidents with and without the use of ssris and cohort studies were included if they reported the rate of bleeds among ssri users and non-users. the main outcome was severe bleeding, whatever the site. only data concerning ssri belonging to the atc class no6ab were used. for both case control and cohort studies, we recorded the adjusted effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (ci). pooled adjusted odds ratio (or) estimates were computed for case-control and cohort studies using an inverse-variance model. meta-analysis of the adjusted ors of 42 observational studies showed a significant association between ssri use and the risk of bleeding [or 1.41 (95% ci 1.27-1.57), random effect model, p < 0.0001]. the association was found for the 31 case-control studies (1,255,073 patients), with an increased risk of 41% of bleeding [or 1.41 (95% ci 1.25-1.60)1, as, well as for the 11 cohort studies including 187,956 patients [or 1.36 (95% c11.12-1.64)]. subgroup analyses showed that the association remained constant whatever the characteristics of studies. this meta-analysis shows an increased risk of bleeding of at least 36% (from 12% to 64%) based on the high-level of observational studies with ssris use.

asthma	the roots of abrus precatorius (ap, fabaceae) have traditionally been used in vietnam and china for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as stomatitis, asthma, bronchitis, and hepatitis. therefore, in this study, we isolated 4-methoxylonchocarpin (ml), an anti-inflammatory compound present in ap, and studied its anti-inflammatory effects in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis. in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated macrophages, ml was found to inhibit nuclear factor (nf)-kappa b activation and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and interleuldn (il)-6 expression by inhibiting lps binding to toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) in vitro. oral administration of ml in mice with tnbs-induced colitis suppressed colon shortening and colonic myeloperoxidase activity. ml treatment significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor (nf)-kappa b and phosphorylation of transforming growth factor (beta-activated kinase 1 in the colon. treatment with ml also inhibited tnbs-induced expression of il -1 beta(3, il-17a, and tnf. while ml reduced the tnbs-induced expression of m1 macrophage markers such as arginase-2 and tnf, it was found to increase the expression of m2 macrophage markers such as arginase- and il-10. in conclusion, oral administration of ml attenuated colitis in mice by inhibiting the binding of lps to tlr4 on immune cells and increasing the polarization of m1 macrophages to m2 macrophages.

osteoporosis	purpose osteoporosis and fragility fractures have consequences both at the individual level and to the overall health care system. although dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) is the reference standard for assessing bone mineral density (bmd), other, simpler tools may be able to screen bone quality provisionally and signal the need for intervention. we hypothesized that the second metacarpal cortical percentage (2mcp) calculated from standard radiographs of the hand or wrist would correlate with hip bmd derived from dxa and could provide a simple screening tool for osteoporosis. methods two hundred patients who had hand or wrist radiographs and hip dxa scans within 1 year of each other were included in this series. mid-diaphyseal 2mcp was calculated as the ratio of the cortical diameter to the total diameter. we assessed the correlation between 2mcp and total hip bmd. subjects were stratified into normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic cohorts based on hip t scores, and thresholds were identified to optimize screening sensitivity and specificity. results second metacarpal cortical percentage correlated significantly with bmd and t scores from the hip. a 2mcp threshold of less than 60% optimized sensitivity (88%) and specificity (60%) for discerning osteopenic subjects from normal subjects, whereas a threshold of less than 50% optimized sensitivity (100%) and specificity (91%) for differentiating osteoporotic from normal subjects. conclusions by demonstrating that global bmd may be assessed from 2mcp, these data suggest that radiographs of the hand and wrist may have a role in accurately screening for osteopenia and osteoporosis. this simple investigation, which is already used ubiquitously for patients with hand or wrist problems, may identify patients at risk for fragility fractures and allow for appropriate referral or treatment. copyright 2017 by the american society for surgery of the hand. all rights reserved.)
atrial_fibrillation	background: the cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. specifically, obesity rates have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality rates of heart failure. therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality rates following a first-time diagnosis of heart failure in denmark between 1995 and 2012. methods: we included all danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-time in-hospital diagnosis of heart failure. data were collected from 3 nationwide danish registries. annual incidence rates of heart failure and 1-year standardized mortality rates were calculated under the assumption of a poisson distribution. results: we identified 210 430 individuals with a first-time diagnosis of heart failure between 1995 and 2012; the annual incidence rates per 10 000 person-years declined among older individuals (rates in 1995 versus 2012: 164 versus 115 in individuals >74 years, 63 versus 35 in individuals 65-74 years, and 20 versus 17 in individuals 55-64 years; p< 0.0001 for all) but increased among the younger (0.4 versus 0.7 in individuals 18-34 years, 1.3 versus 2.0 in individuals 35-44 years, and 5.0 versus 6.4 in individuals 45-54 years; p< 0.0001 for all). the proportion of patients with incident heart failure <= 50 years of age doubled from 3% in 1995 to 6% in 2012 (p< 0.0001). sex-and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios for 2012 versus 1996 were 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.71; p50 years of age, and 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.33-1.73; p< 0.0001) among individuals50 years), but increased among younger (<= 50 years) individuals. these observations may portend a rising burden of heart failure in the community.
atrial_fibrillation	this article presents a case example of an individual with current major depression engaging in a positive mental imagery intervention, specifically a computerized cognitive training paradigm involving repeated practice in generating positive imagery in response to ambiguous scenarios. the patient 's reported experience of the intervention suggests the potential of the positive imagery intervention to ""brighten"" everyday life via promoting involuntary ""flashes"" of positive mental imagery in situations related to the scenarios, with associated beneficial effects on positive affect, future expectations, and behavior. enhancing this aspect of the training-i.e., involuntary positive imagery in contexts where it is adaptive-may hold particular promise for reducing anhedonic symptoms of depression. developing simple computerized interventions to increase the experience of positive mental imagery in everyday life could therefore provide a useful addition to the drive to improve treatment outcomes.

asthma	acidic mammalian chitinase (amcase) has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions including asthma, allergic inflammation and food processing. amcase is most active at ph 2.0, and its activity gradually decreases to up to ph 8. here we analyzed chitin degradation by amcase in weak acidic to neutral conditions by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis established originally for oligosaccharides analysis. we found that specific fragments with slower-than-expected mobility as defined by chitin oligosaccharide markers were generated at ph 5.0 similar to 8.0 as by-products of the reaction. we established an improved method for chitin oligosaccharides suppressing this side reaction by pre-acidification of the fluorophore-labeling reaction mixture. our improved method specifically detects chitin oligosaccharides and warrants quantification of up to 50 nmol of the material. using this strategy, we found that amcase produced dimer of n-acetyl-n-glucosamine (g1cnac) at strong acidic to neutral condition. moreover, we found that amcase generates (gicnac)(2) as well as (gicnac)(3) under physiological conditions.

atrial_fibrillation	haemodynamic responses to spreading depolarizations (sds) have an important role during the development of secondary brain damage. characterization of the haemodynamic responses in larger brains, however, is difficult due to movement artefacts. intrinsic optical signal (ios) imaging, laser speckle flowmetry (lsf) and electrocorticography were performed in different configurations in three groups of in total 18 swine. sds were elicited by topical application of kcl or occurred spontaneously after middle cerebral artery occlusion. movement artefacts in ios were compensated by an elastic registration algorithm during post-processing. using movement-compensated ios, we were able to differentiate between four components of optical changes, corresponding closely with haemodynamic variations measured by lsf. compared with ecog and lsf, our setup provides higher spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a better signal-to-noise ratio. using ios alone, we could identify the different zones of infarction in a large gyrencephalic middle cerebral artery occlusion pig model. we strongly suggest movement-compensated ios for the investigation of the role of haemodynamic responses to sds during the development of secondary brain damage and in particular to examine the effect of potential therapeutic interventions in gyrencephalic brains.
osteoporosis	recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) is a potent mitogen for mesenchymal cells that accelerates bone union and repair when applied locally at defect sites. however, because bfgf diffuses rapidly from bone defect sites, repeated dosing is required for sustained therapeutic effect. we previously fused the collagen-binding domain (cbd) and polycystic kidney disease (pkd) domain of clostridium histolyticum class ii collagenase (colh) to bfgf and demonstrated that the fusion protein markedly enhances bone formation when loaded onto collagen materials used for grafting. however, systemic injection of a fusion protein consisting of parathyroid hormone (pth) and a cbd was shown to accelerate bone formation in an osteoporosis model more rapidly than treatment with a pth-pkd-cbd fusion protein. here, we compared the biological properties of two collagen-binding forms of bfgf, bfgf-cbd and bfgf-pkd-cbd. both fusion proteins promoted the in vitro proliferation of periosteal mesenchymal cells, indicating that they had biological activity similar to that of native bfgf. in vivo periosteal bone formation assays in rat femurs showed that both bfgf-cbd and bfgf-pkd-cbd induced periosteal bone formation at higher rates than collagen sheet alone and bfgf. however, bfgf-pkd-cbd markedly enhanced bone formation and had higher collagen-binding ability than bfgf-cbd in in vitro protein release assays. taken together, these results suggest that the pkd domain increases the retention of bfgf at graft sites by enhancing collagen-binding affinity. therefore, bfgf-pkd-cbd-collagen composite appears to be a promising material for bone repair in the clinical setting. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
osteoarthritis	introduction. osteoarthritis (oa) is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal system 's ailments. in the prevention of the disease and in its comprehensive treatment, proper health-related behavior becomes an extremely important factor for maintaining an optimal health condition. the aim of the study is to assess the relationship between the reported pain and the disability level, and the health-related behaviors undertaken by oa patients as well as their acceptance of the disease. materials/methods. the study group consisted of 198 patients with diagnosed oa, according to acr criteria (1988). the method used in the study employed a pain vas (0-10), health assessment questionnaire disability index (haq di 0-3), acceptance of illness scale (ais 8-40) and health and behavior inventory (izz 24-120). results. the average age among respondents with oa has been 59.16 years of age (+/- 15.87), duration of disease 5.5 years (+/- 4.32). pain experienced both during movement (r(s) = 0.319, p < 0.001) and at rest (r(s) = 0.382, p < 0.001) correlated positively with physical disability (haq di). studies indicated a positive linear correlation between the age and physical disability (r(s) = 0.200, p = 0.005). acceptance of the disease (ais) depends mostly on age (r(s) = -0.325, p < 0.001), on pain in motion (r(p) = -0.209, p < 0.001) and at rest (r(p) = -0.218, p < 0.001) and on the disability levels (r(p) = -0.353, p < 0 : 001). analysis of the health-related behaviors (izz) indicates that the average severity of declared behavior is statistically significant with physical disability (haq di) (p = 0.029). conclusions. the acceptance of illness is significantly reduced with age and progressive levels of disability as well as with the severity of pain. the progressive levels of disability and the younger age of the respondents motivate them to engage in health beneficial behavior.
dementia	background: an increasingly older population, improved diagnostics and treatment increase the number of older cancer survivors, thus more than 60% of those affected by cancer are over the age of 65. symptom relief and the prevention of functional impairment are important tasks for home care nursing, considering that patients can live a long time with their cancer disease and related side effects. the aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which cancer patients over the age of 65 reported access to information and counselling from home care nursing services, including those offered by the cancer coordinator. methods: a cross-sectional survey was used. the survey consisted of 174 cancer patients from two regions in norway living at home (101 women; 66-92 years). the questionnaire contained questions of various sequences including information and advices given and data on access to and use of home health care services. the questions focused on the extent to which home health care services provided the following: 1) information about the disease and treatment, 2) information about consequences and complications of the cancer disease, 3) nutritional advice and 4) advice on physical activity. demographic, clinical and organizational variables were used. spss program version 22 was employed to perform descriptive and inferential statistics including correlation and logistic regression analysis. for ethical reasons, patients who were dying, delirious or with presence of cognitive impairment (any kind of dementia) were excluded. results: the results showed that a majority (67-77%) of the respondents reported low levels of information and counselling offered. low levels represents in this study medium, small and very small degree (likert scale). women, those above 85 years of age and patients with a gynecological or hematological cancer diagnosis experienced less access to information and counselling. respondents facing availability of a cancer coordinator reported significantly higher access to information about the disease and treatment (p = 0.03), nutritional advice (p = 0.04) and advice on physical activity (p = 0.04) compared to those who only had contact with a home health care nurse or home health care assistant. conclusions: the results indicated that the availability of a cancer coordinator facilitated personalized information and counselling for older cancer patients.
stress_management	this study assessed the effects of a psycho-educational intervention on direct care workers' person-centredness during morning care to residents with dementia. a controlled pretest-posttest study was conducted in four aged-care facilities with 56 direct care workers (female, mean age 44.72 +/- 9.02). two experimental facilities received a psycho-educational intervention comprising person-centred care competences and stress management skills; control facilities received an education-only intervention, without stress support. in total, 112 video-recorded morning care sessions were coded using the global behaviour scale. both groups reported significantly higher scores on eight of 11 items of the global behaviour scale and on the global behaviour scale total score at posttest (f=10.59; p=0.02). global behaviour scale total score improvements were higher for the experimental group, with values close to significance (f=3.90; p=0.054). the findings suggest that a psycho-educational intervention may increase care workers' person-centredness. further research is needed to explore the long-term sustainability and extent of its benefits on workers and residents.
kidney_health	renal ischemia-reperfusion (i/r) is one of the main causes of the acute kidney injury (aki) that usually occurs during clinical surgery. autophagy plays an important role in recovery from acute ischemic kidney injury. microrna-21 (mir-21) was reported to inhibit autophagy in several diseases. however, the molecular mechanism of mir-21 on autophagy during renal i/r is still unclear. for the in vitro study, nrk-52e cells were transfected with mir-21 mimics and subjected to i/r. results showed that mir-21 mimics inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in nrk-52e cells. expression of beclin-1 and lc3-ii was induced, and p62 was decreased by i. mir-21 mimics inhibited this induction. rt-pcr and western blotting assay showed that mir-21 mimics inhibited the protein level of rab11a, but not the mrna level. a luciferase activity assay showed that mir-21 directly targeted rab11a rab11a overexpression attenuated the effect of mir-21 mimics and i/r on cell viability and cell apoptosis. the expression of beclin-1 and lc3-ii was increased, and p62 was decreased by rab11a overexpression. for the in vivo assay in a rat i/r model, the mir-21 level was increased during renal i/r injury. pre-treatment with mir-21 inhibitor injection attenuated the renal injury, and enhanced expression of lc3-ii and beclin-1. the results showed that mir-21 inhibited autophagy by targeting rab11a in renal i/r, indicating that rab11a might be a new medical target for the treatment of renal i/r.

osteoporosis	aims few data regarding prevalence of and risk factors for poor bone health in aging individuals with long-standing t1d are available. in this study, we aim to describe the prevalence of bone fragility and to identify factors associated with low bone density in individuals with long-term t1d. methods we examined the prevalence of non-vertebral fractures in 985 subjects enrolled in the joslin 50-year medalist study and measured bone mineral density (bmd) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and radius in a subset (65 subjects, mean age 62.6 years, duration 52.5 years, hba1c 7.1%) with no significant clinical or demographic differences from the rest of the cohort. results medalists have low prevalence of fractures (0.20% hip and 0.91% wrist) and normal z-score values (spine +1.15, total hip +0.23, femoral neck -0.01, radius +0.26; p >0.05 for differences vs. 0 at all sites). a significant relationship was found between lower bmd and higher total cholesterol, triglycerides and ldl levels, but not hba1c. low bmd at the femoral neck was associated with cardiovascular disease after adjustment for confounding factors: prevalence risk ratio of cvd [95% ci] 4.6 [1.2-18.1], p = 0.03. no other diabetic vascular complication was found to be associated with low bmd. conclusions these are the first data regarding bone health in aging individuals who have had diabetes for 50 or more years. the low rates of non-vertebral fractures and the normal z-score suggest the long t1d diabetes duration did not increase the risk of bone fractures in medalists compared to non-diabetic peers. additionally, the association with cardiovascular disease demonstrates the bmd differences in groups are likely not due to glycemic control alone.
atrial_fibrillation	objectives: the mobiguide project aimed to establish a ubiquitous, user-friendly, patient-centered mobile decision-support system for patients and for their care providers, based on the continuous application of clinical guidelines and on semantically integrated electronic health records. patients would be empowered by the system, which would enable them to lead their normal daily lives in their regular environment, while feeling safe, because their health state would be continuously monitored using mobile sensors and self-reporting of symptoms. when conditions occur that require medical attention, patients would be notified as to what they need to do, based on evidence-based guidelines, while their medical team would be informed appropriately, in parallel. we wanted to assess the system 's feasibility and potential effects on patients and care providers in two different clinical domains. materials and methods: we describe mobiguide 's architecture, which embodies these objectives. our novel methodologies include a ubiquitous architecture, encompassing a knowledge elicitation process for parallel coordinated workflows for patients and care providers; the customization of computer interpretable guidelines (cigs) by secondary contexts affecting remote management and distributed decision-making; a mechanism for episodic, on demand projection of the relevant portions of cigs from a centralized, backend decision-support system (dss), to a local, mobile dss, which continuously delivers the actual recommendations to the patient; shared decision-making that embodies patient preferences; semantic data integration; and patient and care provider notification services. mobiguide has been implemented and assessed in a preliminary fashion in two domains: atrial fibrillation (af), and gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). ten af patients used the af mobiguide system in italy and 19 gdm patients used the gdm mobiguide system in spain. the evaluation of the mobiguide system focused on patient and care providers' compliance to cig recommendations and their satisfaction and quality of life. results: our evaluation has demonstrated the system 's capability for supporting distributed decision making and its use by patients and clinicians. the results show that compliance of gdm patients to the most important monitoring targets-blood glucose levels (performance of four measurements a day: 0.87 +/- 0.11; measurement according to the recommended frequency of every day or twice a week: 0.99 +/- 0.03), ketonuria (0.98 +/- 0.03), and blood pressure (0.82 +/- 0.24) - was high in most gdm patients, while compliance of af patients to the most important targets was quite high, considering the required ecg measurements (0.65 +/- 0.28) and blood-pressure measurements (0.75 +/- 1.33). this outcome was viewed by the clinicians as a major potential benefit of the system, and the patients have demonstrated that they are capable of self-monitoring - something that they had not experienced before. in addition, the system caused the clinicians managing the af patients to change their diagnosis and subsequent treatment for two of the ten af patients, and caused the clinicians managing the gdm patients to start insulin therapy earlier in two of the 19 patients, based on system 's recommendations. based on the end-of-study questionnaires, the sense of safety that the system has provided to the patients was its greatest asset. analysis of the patients' quality of life (qol) questionnaires for the af patients was inconclusive, because while most patients reported an improvement in their quality of life in the euroqol questionnaire, most af patients reported a deterioration in the afeqt questionnaire. discussion: feasibility and some of the potential benefits of an evidence-based distributed patient guidance system were demonstrated in both clinical domains. the potential application of mobiguide to other medical domains is supported by its standards-based patient health record with multiple electronic medical record linking capabilities, generic data insertion methods, generic medical knowledge representation and application methods, and the ability to communicate with a wide range of sensors. future larger scale evaluations can assess the impact of such a system on clinical outcomes. conclusion: mobiguide 's feasibility was demonstrated by a working prototype for the af and gdm domains, which is usable by patients and clinicians, achieving high compliance to self-measurement recommendations, while enhancing the satisfaction of patients and care providers.

hereditary_angioedema	background: the 17-alpha-alkylated derivatives of testosterone are often used for the prevention of oedematous episodes in hereditary angioedema with c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae). however, these agents can have many adverse effects, including erythrocytosis and polyglobulia. our aim was to investigate occurrence of erythrocytosis and polyglobulia after long-term danazol prophylaxis in c1-inh-hae. methods: during the initial stage of our retrospective study, we explored whether c1-inh-hae is associated with susceptibility to erythrocytosis and/or polyglobulia. in the second stage, we analyzed the haematological parameters of 39 c1-inh-hae patients before, as well as after treatment with danazol for 1, 3, or 5 years. in the third stage, we studied the incidence of erythrocytosis and of polyglobulia after dosing with danazol for more than 5 years. results: we did not find any significant difference between c1-inh-hae patients not receiving danazol and healthy controls as regards the occurrence of erythrocytosis or polyglobulia. the haematological parameters did not change after treatment with danazol for 1, 3, or 5 years. platelet count was an exception-it decreased significantly (p = 0.0115) versus baseline, but within the reference range. treatment-related polyglobulia did not occur. we observed erythrocytosis in a single female patient after 1-year-and in three female patients after more than 5-year long-treatment with danazol. erythrocytosis did not require intervention or the discontinuation of danazol therapy. conclusions: we conclude that neither erythrocytosis, nor polyglobulia occurs more often in c1-inh-hae patients than in healthy individuals; it can be observed only sporadically even after treatment with danazol.
mental_health	this study presents the findings from in-depth interviews with 24 people from 15 families in norway who lost their young son or daughter in a traffic accident. their grief has several dimensions: the loss of a young life, the loss of life quality, the effect on family events and their meaning, and the new responsibilities brought onto family members. for each young fatality, many relatives and friends are affected with a wide range of emotional and socioeconomic consequences. parents report that grief is more overwhelming during the first few years and never disappears, while over the years they slowly learn to cope with it. here we especially highlight the role of traffic authorities and what professional actors can do to meet the bereaved with empathy and minimize negative effects.
children's_health	against a backdrop of non-ideal political and legal conditions, this article examines the health capability paradigm and how its principles can help determine what aspects of health care might legitimately constitute positive health care rights-and if indeed human rights are even the best approach to equitable health care provision. this article addresses the long american preoccupation with negative rights rather than positive rights in health care. positive health care rights are an exception to the overall moral range and general thrust of u.s. legal doctrine. some positive rights to health care have arisen from u.s. constitutional eighth amendment cases and federal and state laws like medicare, medicaid, the state children 's health insurance program, the emergency medical treatment and active labor act, and the patient protection and affordable care act. finally, this article discusses some of the difficulties inherent in implementing a positive right to health care in the u.s.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	interstitial lung disease (ild) is a group of disorders that are often characterized by fibrosis of the lung parenchyma, typically causing increased dyspnea, functional limitation, and early mortality. approximately 5-25% of ild patients cannot be provided with a confident diagnosis despite an exhaustive search for potential etiologies and a multidisciplinary review. this can occur due to an incomplete acquisition of diagnostic studies, conflicting or overlapping features, or non-classifiable histological findings. the clinical features of unclassifiable ild have been described in several recent studies, showing that this population includes a heterogeneous collection of patients that have similar characteristics compared to mixed ild cohorts. pharmacotherapy for patients with unclassifiable ild is typically guided by a multidisciplinary review that considers the most likely diagnosis and anticipated disease behaviour. the objective of this review is to summarize recent studies related to unclassifiable ild, with a focus on its prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes. limitations in the literature are identified, including the inconsistent terminology and lack of a precise definition of unclassifiable ild.
medicare	since 2009, the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) has distributed quality star ratings for medicare advantage ( ma) contracts to better inform medicare-eligible individuals of ma plan quality. this paper examines the extent to which the quality star rating scheme affected insurer behavior in the ma market. we identify the causal effect of 2009 star ratings on 2010 ma premiums using a regression discontinuity design that exploits plausibly random variation around threshold values underlying the star rating calculations. we find that contracts with higher star ratings in 2009 significantly increased their average 2010 monthly premiums relative to contracts just below the respective threshold values, with increases of more than $26 per month among 3.5- and 4-star contracts. we present additional evidence that the estimated premium increases in 2010 are not purely the result of demand shifts in the prior year. furthermore, the 2009 star ratings have a significant effect on plan mix, where 3-star contracts disproportionately dropped their $0 premium plans while 2.5-, 3.5-, and 4-star contracts disproportionately expanded plans into new markets, particularly plans with positive monthly premiums. broadly, our analysis reveals a relatively large supply-side response to published quality ratings, suggesting some level of caution as policy makers extend quality rating systems into new health-care markets.
osteoarthritis	background: detailed pain mapping of extent and distribution in individuals with patellofemoral pain (pfp) within and around a complex structure such as the knee has yet to be explored. methods: perceptions of on-going pain from adolescents and young adults (n = 35) with long-standing (>10 months) pfp were collected on high-resolution 3d digital body-schema of the knees. location, area of pain, pain intensity, laterality, worse side of knee pain, symptom duration, and symmetry in bilateral knee pain were recorded. a threshold for naturally occurring variations in symmetrical knee pain drawings were collected from 18 healthy controls and used in combination with the development a symmetry index (0-1) to create a fuzzy rule for classifying symmetrical and non-symmetrical pfp patterns as compared to a pfp expert. the symmetry index was computed and tested using a correlation coefficient alone or in combination with the jaccard index and the true and false positive rates (tpr and fpr, respectively) determined. results: the peripatellar region was the common report of pain location however, novel and nonconforming pfp patterns were identified and the majority of individuals (22 of 27) with bilateral pfp expressed highly-symmetric mirror-image pain. individuals with symptom duration of 5 years or more had a greater area of pain, compared to those with symptoms for less than 5 years. the total area of pain was correlated to symptom duration for those with extended symptoms durations and a progression towards an ""o"" shaped pattern emerged. a tpr of 100% for identifying symmetrical knee pain patterns was found however the expert pfp tended to be stricter, as reflected in fpr of 20%. conclusions: a high proportion of pfp patterns or symptoms occur in mirrored locations and are exceptionally symmetrical, and long duration of symptoms appear to converge to an 'o' shape. classifying symmetrical pain patterns is subjective however simple fuzzy rules and correlations can be used to increase objectivity. this study highlights a gap in knowledge of pfp symptom presentation, reveals what may be a natural progression of symptoms, and provides valuable clinical insight for both pain management and treatment.
addiction	the effective elements of 12-step largely align with principles of professional treatment and with recovery models. professional addiction workers should review their own barriers to promoting alcoholics anonymous to clients.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	imaging techniques for detection of molecular and cellular processes that precede or accompany lung diseases are needed. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play key roles in the development of pulmonary pathology. the objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of in vivo mmp-targeted molecular imaging for detection of lung inflammation and remodeling. methods: lung-specific il-13 trans genic (club cell 10-kda protein [cc10]-il-13 tg) mice and wild-type littermates were used in this study. lung structure, gene expression, and mmp activity were assessed by histology, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and zymography. mmp activation was imaged by in vivo small-animal spect/ct followed by ex vivo planar imaging. signal specificity was addressed using a control tracer. the correlation between in vivo mmp signal and gene expression was addressed. results: cc10-il-13 tg mice developed considerable pulmonary tissue remodeling and inflammation. cd68, mmp-12, and mmp-13 were significantly higher in cc10-il-13 tg lungs. on in vivo small-animal spect/ct and ex vivo planar images, the mmp signal was significantly higher in the lungs of cc10-il-13 tg mice than wild-type animals. furthermore, a nonbinding analog tracer showed significantly lower accumulation in cc10-il-13 tg lungs relative to the specific tracer. there was a significant correlation between small-animal spect/ct-derived mmp signal and cd68 expression in the lungs (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). conclusion: small-animal spect/ct-based mmp-targeted imaging of the lungs is feasible and reflects pulmonary inflammation. if validated in humans, molecular imaging of inflammation and remodeling can potentially help early diagnosis and monitoring of the effects of therapeutic interventions in pulmonary diseases.
atopic_dermatitis	background: atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic skin disease which has been known to negatively influence the mental health of patients. however, only a few studies have explored the prevalence of psychiatric problems among ad patients, particularly among adolescents. in this study, we aimed to assess the association of ad with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors among adolescents by analyzing data from the 2013 korean youth risk behavior survey, a nationwide web-based survey. methods: data from 72,435 adolescent middle and high school students in korea were analyzed. students self-reported ad diagnosed by a doctor and yes-or-no answers to questions about depressive symptoms and suicide ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts were analyzed. relationships between ad and depressive symptoms or suicidal behaviors were tested by logistic regression models after controlling for potential confounding factors. results: the proportion of adolescents who had ad was 6.8%. the proportion of adolescents reporting depressive feelings was 31.0%, suicide ideation was 16.3%, suicide planning was 5.8%, and suicide attempts was 4.2%. compared to adolescents without ad, adolescents with ad were significantly more likely to experience depressive feelings (odds ratio [or]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [cl]: 1.19-1.36), suicide ideation (or: 1.34, 95% cl: 1.24-1.45), suicide planning (or: 1.46, 95% cl: 1.32-1.65), and suicide attempts (or: 1.51, 95% cl: 1.33-1.72). in the multivariate model, the relationships between ad and suicide ideation (or: 1.26, 95% cl: 1.16-1.36), suicide planning (or: 1.28, 95% cl: 1.14-1.44), and suicide attempt (or: 1.29, 95% cl: 1.13-1.49) were statistically significant. conclusion: adolescents who have ad are associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms and suicidal behaviors. adolescent ad patients may need interventions from clinicians and caregivers that use a holistic approach to prevent psychological comorbidities, although further research is needed to clarify this relationship.
autism	many clinical and molecular features of the fragile x syndrome, a common form of intellectual disability and autism, can be modeled by deletion of the fmr1 protein (fmrp) in mice. previous studies showed a decreased expression of several components of the gabaergic system in fmr1 knockout mice. here, we used this mouse model to investigate the functional consequences of fmrp deletion on hippocampal gabaergic inhibition in the ca1-region of the hippocampus. whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated a significantly reduced amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eipscs) and a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous ipscs. in addition, miniature ipscs were reduced in amplitude and frequency and decayed significantly slower than mipscs in controls. quantitative real-time pcr revealed a significantly lower expression of alpha 2, beta 1 and delta gaba(a) receptor subunits in the hippocampus of the juvenile mice (p22) compared to wild-type littermates. correspondingly, we found also at the protein level reduced amounts of alpha 2, beta 1 and delta subunits in fmr1 knockout mice. overall, these results demonstrate that the reduction in several components of the gabaergic system is already present at young age and that this reduction results in measurable abnormalities on gabaa receptor mediated phasic inhibition. these abnormalities might contribute to the behavioral and cognitive deficits of this fragile x mouse model.

ankylosing_spondylitis	the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of specific exercise types on pulmonary functions, aerobic and functional capacity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as). a systematic search of cochrane database of systematic review, medline (ebsco), physiotherapy evidence database (pedro), cinahl (ebsco), pubmed, amed, embase (ovid) was conducted in january 2016. the outcome measures were spirometric measurements, chest expansion, 6 minute walk distance (6mwd), pvo(2), bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (basfi) and bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai). the search strategy was applied with limitation of date and language and this initial electronic search resulted in 143 relevant studies. after duplicates were removed, the titles and abstracts of 52 articles were screened. of these, 14 full-text articles met initial criteria and were retrieved for review, with eight studies meeting final inclusion criteria. both specific and conventional exercise groups showed significant improvements in basdai and basfi scores (p < 0.05) in patients with as, although there was no significant difference between two exercise groups. as for pulmonary functions, the specific exercise groups have greater improvements than conventional group in spirometric measurement, chest expansion (p0.05). specific exercises are an effective adjuvant therapy to enhance cardiopulmonary functions in patients with as; therefore, it is assumed that in addition to the medical treatments, specific exercise therapy might reduce the cardiopulmonary complications related with as.
anxiety	aims. adults who experienced the 1992 and 2008 armed conflicts in the republic of georgia were exposed to multiple traumatic events and stressors over many years. the aim was to investigate what coping strategies are used by conflict-affected persons in georgia and their association with mental disorders. method. a cross-sectional survey was conducted with 3600 adults, representing internally displaced persons (idps) from conflicts in the 1990s (n = 1200) and 2008 (n = 1200) and former idps who returned to their homes after the 2008 conflict (n = 1200). post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and coping strategies were measured using the trauma screening questionnaire, patient health questionnaire-9, generalised anxiety and adapted version of the brief coping inventory, respectively. descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were used. results. coping strategies such as use of humour, emotional support, active coping, acceptance and religion were significantly associated with better mental health outcomes. coping strategies of behavioural and mental disengagement, denial, venting emotions, substance abuse and gambling were significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. the reported use of coping strategies varied significantly between men and women for 8 of the 15 strategies addressed. conclusions. many conflict-affected persons in georgia are still suffering mental health problems years after the conflicts. a number of specific coping strategies appear to be associated with better mental health and should be encouraged and supported where possible.
bipolar_disorder	objectives: to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of metabolic syndrome (mets) and its components among patients with psychiatric disorders. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted among adult patients with psychiatric disorders at major hospitals in saudi arabia. after measurements were recorded for all mets components, demographic and clinical information was obtained mainly by reviewing the patients' medical charts. results: the prevalence rate of mets among the 992 study participants was 41.2%, high triglycerides was 32.8%, large waist circumference was 42.2%, high blood pressure was 42.5%, high fasting blood sugar was 47.8%, and low hdl cholesterol was 52.5%. participants with mets were more likely to be older, illiterate, divorced or widowed, have a higher number of children, older age of onset of psychiatric illness, longer duration of psychiatric disease, no previous psychiatric hospitalization, and have a history of diabetes and hypertension. after adjusting for significant demographic and clinical characteristics, none of the psychiatric diagnoses and treatments was independently associated with mets, except the use of mirtazapine and venlafaxine. conclusions: the prevalence of mets and its components among patients with psychiatric disorders is alarming irrespective of their diagnoses. thus, metabolic screening especially among high risk groups is critical.

atopic_dermatitis	ambient air pollution is becoming more severe worldwide, posing a serious threat to human health. fine airborne particles of particulate matter (pm2.5) show higher cytotoxicity than other coarse fractions. indeed, pm2.5 induces cardiovascular or respiratory damage; however, few studies have evaluated the detrimental effect of pm2.5 to normal human skin. we used a next-generation sequencing-based (rna-seq) method with transcriptome and gene ontology (go) enrichment analysis to determine the harmful influences of pm2.5 on human normal epidermal keratinocytes. david analysis showed that the most significantly enriched go terms were associated with epidermis-related biological processes such as ""epidermis development (go: 0008544)"" and ""keratinocyte differentiation (go: 0030216)"", suggesting that pm2.5 has some deleterious effects to the human epidermis. in addition, ingenuity pathway analysis predicted inflammation-related signaling as one of the major pm2.5-induced signaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokines as upstream regulators with symptoms similar to psoriasis as downstream effects. pm2.5 caused considerable changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and psoriatic skin disease-related genes, might lead to epidermal dysfunctions. our results might help to understand the mechanism of air pollution-induced skin barrier perturbation and contribute to the development of a new strategy for the prevention or recovery of the consequent damage.

medicare	backgroundthe development of antibiotic resistance by bacteria is of global concern. inappropriate prescribing has the potential to exacerbate this issue. we aimed to examine the patterns of prescribing of antimicrobial medicines by dental practitioners in australia from 2001 to 2012. methodsdata were collected from medicare australia on prescriptions from dental practitioners dispensed to concessional beneficiaries between 2001 and 2012. we examined patterns of use over time. resultsthere was an overall increase in number of prescriptions and in dispensed use (standardized by dose and population) of antibiotics and antifungals for the concessional population over the 12-year period. the use of dentally prescribed antibiotics increased 50%. amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic accounting for 66% of all prescriptions in 2012. generally, there was preferential prescribing of the highest dose formulations. the use of the two antifungals increased 30% over the study period with a preference for amphotericin b (74%) rather than nystatin. conclusionsthese data show a concerning increase in prescribing of antibiotics and antifungals by dentists in australia. it would appear that australian dentists may not be prescribing these medicines appropriately; however, further research is needed to understand prescribing behaviours and decision-making by dentists.
psoriatic_arthritis	the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of caffeine on the symptoms of methotrexate (mtx) intolerance in patients with ra. the follow-up patients with ra seen over a period of 11 months were included in this work. the degree of mtx intolerance, if present, was classified as 'moderate' and 'severe'. those with intolerance were advised caffeine (coffee or dark chocolate) synchronised with the mtx dose. the effect was assessed as 'very good', 'good' or 'none'. among 855 patients seen during this period, 313 (36.6 %) did not have any mtx intolerance, 542 (63.4 %) patients had some degree of mtx intolerance, 422 (77.8 %; 49.3 % of the total patients) had 'minimal' intolerance not requiring any intervention. the remaining 120 (22.1 %) of the 542 (14 % of the total 855) patients had 'moderate' or 'severe' mtx intolerance. among these, 55 % had complete relief of symptoms and were able to continue taking the advised dose of mtx; 13.3 % had partial improvement and continued taking mtx but only with antiemetics; 7.5 % were minimally better but were somehow managing; 10 % were complete caffeine failure without any relief; 14.2 % did not like caffeine (coffee or dark chocolate) and did not want to take it. caffeine relieved the symptoms of mtx intolerance in 55 % and partial relief in 13 % of the patients. a significant number of patients did not like to take caffeine (coffee or dark chocolate). it is of note that northern part of india is primarily a tea-drinking population where coffee is not a favourite drink.
asthma	background: biomass burning has been shown to be amajor source of poor indoor air quality (iaq) in developing and higher income countries across the world. specifically, wood burning for cooking and heating contributes to high indoor concentrations of fine (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 mu m; pm2.5) and coarse (particles with aerodynamic diameters <10 mu m and n-2.5 mu m; pmc) particulate matter. endotoxin, predominantly found within the coarse fraction of airborne particulate matter, is associated with proinflammatory effects and adverse outcomes among susceptible populations. the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of air filter interventions in reducing indoor pm2.5, pmc, and pmc-associated endotoxin concentrations in homes using a wood stove for primary heating. results: homes (n= 48) were randomized to receive in-roomair filtration units with either a high efficiency filter (i.e. active) or a lower efficiency fiberglass filter (i.e., placebo). the active filter intervention showed a 66% reduction in indoor pm2.5 concentrations (95% ci: 42.2% to 79.7% reduction) relative to the placebo intervention. both the active and the placebo filters were effective in substantially reducing indoor concentrations of pmc (63.3% and 40.6% average reduction for active and placebo filters, respectively) and pmc-associated endotoxin concentrations (91.8% and 80.4% average reductions, respectively). conclusions: these findings support the use of high efficiency air filtration units for reducing indoor pm2.5 in homes using a wood stove for primary heating. we also discovered that using lower efficiency, lower cost filter alternatives can be effective for reducing pmc and airborne endotoxin in homes burning biomass fuel.

lymphoma	introduction: due to recent advancements in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of b-cell malignancies, there has been an explosion of innovative agents in development. the purpose of this review is to efficiently summarize novel therapies with activity in indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma (inhl) targeting surface antigens, signaling pathways, and the tumor microenvironment.areas covered: a literature search was performed to identify preclinical data and clinical trials focused on the use of targeted therapies in inhl subtypes including follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. classes reviewed include monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunomodulatory agents, b-cell receptor pathway inhibitors, bcl-2 inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, chromatin and epigenetic modulating agents, and car t-cells.expert commentary: opinions regarding strategies to address the prioritization of novel agents entering clinical development, the determination of rational combination therapy, the development of novel endpoints to expedite clinical development, and the movement towards novel consolidative approaches with immuno- and cellular therapy in an attempt to provide curative treatment options are provided. also, the economic impact of indefinite therapy is discussed.
dementia	cerebral microbleeds (cmbs) are mri markers attributed to the most common cerebral angiopathies in the elderly and in patients with dementia: hypertensive and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. cmb detection in asymptomatic persons may help identify those at risk for dementia and may influence preventive strategies and design of clinical trials testing treatments for dementia. we studied the association of cmb with risk of incident dementia in community dwelling individuals. a total of 1296 dementia-free framingham heart study participants (mean age 72 years; 54% women) with available brain mri and incident dementia data during a mean follow-up period of 6.7 years were included. using cox proportional hazards models, we related cmb presence to incident dementia. multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, apoe status, and education, with additional models adjusting for vascular risk factors and mri markers of ischemic brain injury. cmbs were observed in 10.8% and incident dementia in 85 participants (6.6% over study period). participants with any cmb had 1.74 times higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio [hr] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.00-3.01), whereas those with deep and mixed cmb had a three-fold increased risk (hr 2.99, 95% ci 1.52-5.90). the associations were independent of vascular risk factors, and for deep and mixed cmb also independent of mri markers of ischemia (hr 2.44, 95% ci 1.22-4.88). purely lobar cmbs were not associated with incident dementia. our findings support a role for hypertensive vasculopathy and the interplay of hypertensive and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in risk of dementia and suggest that cmb presence can identify individuals at risk of dementia.

osteoporosis	there are care gaps in the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis after a fragility fracture. the joint commission is considering adoption of core measures. we compared compliance between two secondary fracture prevention programs in our institution. incorporating strengths of both may provide the best outcomes for secondary fracture prevention. purpose there are significant care gaps in the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis after occurrence of fragility fracture. the joint commission is considering adoption of a core measure set on osteoporosis-associated fractures, including laboratory assessment, bone density testing, and osteoporosis pharmacologic therapy. we compared compliance to these proposed measures between two secondary fracture prevention programs in patients hospitalized for acute fracture in an open medical system. methods we conducted a retrospective, single center medical records review of a nurse practitioner-led fracture liaison service (fls), a physician-led fracture prevention program (fpp), and a historical time without any secondary fracture prevention program (usual care) for baseline care. primary outcomes were the completion of five laboratory tests (calcium, 25-hydroxy vitamin d, renal function, liver function, and complete blood count), order placement and completion of dual x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) scan within 3 months, prescription of osteoporosis medication within 3 months, and medication adherence at 6 months after hospital discharge. results completion of all five laboratory tests was higher in fpp versus fls (84.7 vs. 36.9%, p < 0.001). dxa scan completion was higher in fpp than fls but not statistically significant (66.7 vs. 54.9%, p = 0.11). medication prescription at 3 months and adherence at 6 months were significantly higher in fpp versus fls (65.3 vs. 24.0%, p < 0.001 and 70.8 vs. 27.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). conclusion incorporating strengths of both fls (care coordination) and fpp (physician direction) may provide the best outcomes for secondary fracture prevention by ensuring laboratory and dxa testing and initiating osteoporosis medication.
crohn's_disease	introduction: we assess the ability of low-dose hybrid iterative reconstruction (ir) and 'pure' model-based ir (mbir) images to maintain accurate hounsfield unit (hu)-determined tissue characterization. methods: standard-protocol (sp) and low-dose modified-protocol (mp) cts were contemporaneously acquired in 34 crohn 's disease patients referred for ct. sp image reconstruction was via the manufacturer 's recommendations (60% fbp, filtered back projection; 40% asir, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction; sp-asir40). mp data sets underwent four reconstructions (100% fbp; 40% asir; 70% asir; mbir). three observers measured tissue volumes using hu thresholds for fat, soft tissue and bone/contrast on each data set. analysis was via spss. results: inter-observer agreement was strong for 1530 datapoints (rs >0.9). mp-mbir tissue volume measurement was superior to other mp reconstructions and closely correlated with the reference sp-asir40 images for all tissue types. mp-mbir superiority was most marked for fat volume calculation close sp-asir40 and mp-mbir bland-altman plot correlation was seen with the lowest average difference (336 cm(3)) when compared with other mp reconstructions. conclusions: hounsfield unit-determined tissue volume calculations from mpmbir images resulted in values comparable to sp-asir40 calculations and values that are superior to mp-asir images. accuracy of estimation of volume of tissues (e.g. fat) using segmentation software on low-dose ct images appears optimal when reconstructed with pure ir.
ankylosing_spondylitis	in asia, enthesitis-related arthritis (era) is the most frequent category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. era has a strong association with human leucocyte antigen (hla)-b27 and subclinical gut inflammation. in an hla-b27 transgenic rat model, the presence of bacteroides bacteria in the gut appears to cause spondyloarthropathy (spa). thus, we studied gut microbiota in children with era. stool specimens from 33 patients with era and 14 age-matched healthy controls were studied; none had any gastrointestinal symptom, or had received a drug known to affect gut motility or microbiota in the preceding 6 weeks. from each specimen, a cdna library for the v3 region of bacterial 16s rrna was subjected to high-throughput, massively parallel sequencing. relationship of the specimens was studied using principal co-ordinate analysis (pcoa), and abundances of various bacterial taxa and alpha diversity were compared between groups. in eight patients, a repeat faecal specimen was studied after 12 weeks of probiotic therapy. the 55 specimens yielded a median (range) of 397 315 ( 102 093-1 502 380) high-quality reads each. in pcoa, gut microbiota from era showed a wider dispersion than those from controls. in patients, families bacteroidaceae and enterobacteriaceae were more abundant and prevotellaceae were less abundant than in controls. also, genera bacteroides, entercoccus and klebsiella were over-represented and genus prevotella was under-represented in era patients. probiotic therapy led to a non-significant increase in prevotellaceae. patients with era have a dysbiosis in the gut, with increased abundance of bacteroides and reduction of prevotella. probiotic supplementation in a subset of patients did not reverse these changes significantly.
ankylosing_spondylitis	to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab on severe and frequent recurrent anterior uveitis in patients with hla-b27-positive ankylosing spondylitis. in this study, 15 eyes of 12 hla-b27-positive as patients with resistant anterior uveitis who received 50 mg of subcutaneous golimumab (gol) per month due to frequent uveitis recurrences were analyzed retrospectively between may 2013 and october 2015. assessment criteria were uveitis activity, the number of recurrence of uveitis, visual acuity, systemic corticosteroid, or other drug requirement for maintenance of remission of au. twelve patients (15 eyes) with hla-b27-positive ankylosing spondylitis and anterior uveitis have been treated with golimumab 50 mg/month. remission of uveitis was observed in 12 eyes out of 15. malign hypertension developed in one subject after the second dose of golimumab therefore the treatment was stopped and this subject was excluded from the study. median follow-up time was 11 months (interquartile range: 8-18). no uveitic reaction was seen except in the patient who stopped treatment. no topical or systemic steroid necessity was needed except in two cases with oral 4 mg systemic maintenance. visual acuity was significantly increased (p = 0.002). golimumab may be a new and effective choice for maintaining remission and the prevention of recurrences of severe, resistant anterior uveitis in patients with hla-b27-positive ankylosing spondylitis.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. the effect of a disease can be categorized by a standardized reference system: the international classification of functioning, disability and health (icf). the objective was to map the effect of psoriatic arthritis (psa) from the patient 's perspective to the icf. methods. a systematic literature review was performed. qualitative publications reporting domains of impact important for patients with psa were identified using the following terms: (""psoriatic arthritis"") and (""quality of life"" or ""impact""). meaningful concepts were extracted from the publications, grouped into domains and linked to the icf categories. the number of concepts linked to each icf category and to each icf level was calculated. the number of concepts not linkable was also calculated. results. eleven studies (13 articles) were included in the analysis. twenty-five domains of impact were cited, of which the ability to work/volunteer and social participation were the most cited (both by 10 studies). in total, 258 concepts were identified, of which 217 could be linked to 136 different icf categories; 41 concepts, mostly personal factors, could not be precisely linked. the most represented icf component was activities and participation (42.6%) rather than body structures (10.3%) or body functions (29.4%). ten studies (90.9%) reported impairments in the ability to work/volunteer and social participation, and 7 (63.6%) reported leisure activities, family and intimacy, pain, skin problems, and body image. conclusion. psa widely affects all aspects of patients' lives, in particular aspects related to activities and participation. the icf is a useful approach for the classification of disease effect.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. to compare baseline disease activity and treatment effectiveness in biologic-naive patients with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axspa) and ankylosing spondylitis (as) who initiate tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (tnfi) treatment and to study the role of potential confounders (e.g., hla-b27 status). methods. observational cohort study based on prospectively registered data in the nationwide danbio registry. we used kaplan-meier plots, cox, and logistic regression analyses to study the effect of diagnosis (nr-axspa vs as) and potential confounders (sex/age/start yr/hla-b27/disease duration/tnfi-type/smoking/baseline disease activity) on tnfi adherence and response [e.g., bath ankylosing spondylitis activity index (basdai) 50%/20 mm]. results. the study included 1250 tnfi-naive patients with axspa (29% nr-axspa, 50% as, 21% lacked radiographs of sacroiliac joints). patients with nr-axspa were more frequently women (50%/27%) and hla-b27-negative (85/338 = 25%), compared to as (81/476 = 17%; p < 0.01). at tnfi start patients with nr-axspa had higher visual analog scale scores [median (quartiles)] for pain: 72 mm (55-84)/65 mm (48-77); global: 76 mm (62-88)/68 mm (50-80); fatigue: 74 mm (55-85)/67 mm (50-80); and basdai: 64 (54-77)/59 (46-71); all p < 0.01. however, patients with nr-axspa had lower c-reactive protein: 7 mg/l (3-17)/11 mg/l (5-22); and bas metrology index: 20 (10-40)/40 (20-50); all p0.05). hla-b27 negativity was associated with poorer treatment adherence [hla-b27 negative/positive, nr-axspa: hr 1.74 (1.29-2.36), as: hr 2.04 (1.53-2.71), both p < 0.0001]; and lower response rates (nr-axspa: 18/61 = 30% vs 93/168 = 55%; as: 17/59 = 29% vs 157/291 = 54%, both p < 0.05). conclusion. in this nationwide cohort, patients with nr-axspa had higher subjective disease activity at start of first tnfi treatment, but similar outcomes to patients with as after confounder adjustment. hla-b27 positivity was associated with better outcomes irrespective of axspa subdiagnosis.
osteoarthritis	the aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of pre-emptive, early, and delayed pulsed electromagnetic field (pemf) treatment on cartilage and subchondral trabecular bone in knee osteoarthritis (oa) rats induced by low-dose monosodium iodoacetate (mia). seventy-five 12-week-old male sprague-dawley rats were assigned to five groups: oa (n = 30), pre-emptive pemf (n - 10), early pemf (n - 10), delayed pemf (n - 10), and control (n - 15). osteoarthritis was induced by injecting 0.2 mg mia in rat 's right knee joint. control rats received a single sterile saline injection in the right knee. male rats received pre-emptive (n = 10, day 0-end of week 4), early (n = 10, end of week 4-end of week 8), or delayed (n = 10, end of week 8-end of week 12) pemf treatment (75 hz, 1.6 mt). after 4, 8, and 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed at each time point and right knees were harvested. after sacrifice, micro-computed tomography, histology, and biomarker analyses were performed. we found pre-emptive pemf treatment preserved subchondral trabecular bone microarchitecture and prevented subchondral bone loss in mia-induced oa rat model. early and delayed pemf treatment maintained subchondral trabeculae. pemf treatment increased bone and cartilage formation, and decreased bone and cartilage resorption. pre-emptive and early pemf treatment had moderate effects on cartilage degradation. time point of treatment initiation is crucial for treating oa. pemf might become a potential biophysical treatment modality for osteoarthritis.

smoking_cessation	background: the objective of this study is to assess anxiety, depression and panic disorders among patients diagnosed with copd and to investigate their correlation with disease severity, quality of life as well as tobacco use. methods: an observational study was performed between january and september 2014 among 60 patients diagnosed with copd. copd staging according to gold criteria, while anxiety and depression were assessed using hospital anxiety and depression scale and panic attacks were evaluated based on icd 10 criteria. results: almost 40% of the sample were smokers, the medium packs-years was 34.3 and the medium fagerstrom score was 7.5. overall, mean modified medical research council dyspnea scale (mmrc) was 2.86, mean copd assessment test (cat) score was 21.75 and study participants had 1.93 copd exacerbations/year. mean distribution of anxiety and depression symptoms scores among copd subjects was 10.65 +/- 3.5 and 9.93 +/- 3.8, respectively. smokers and ex-smokers had similar scores with regard to anxiety, depression or the presence of panic attacks. the results of the bivariate correlations indicated associations between anxiety, depression, panic attacks and disease severity, as well as poor quality of life of patients with copd, regardless of their current tobacco use status. conclusions: in conclusion, the results of this study indicate that anxiety, depression and panic attacks were constant characteristics among copd patients-regardless of their current tobacco use.
smoking_cessation	whetherwell-documented patterns of mental health comorbidity with adolescent combustible cigarette use extend to e-cigarette use is unclear. demonstrating associations between e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use with mental health symptomatology across adolescence may be important for promoting accurate perceptions of populations at risk for and potential consequences of tobacco product use. adolescents (n = 2460; mean age at baseline = 14.1; 53.4% female; 44.1% hispanic) who had never previously used combustible or e-cigarettes were assessed at baseline, and 6-and 12-month follow-ups in los angeles, ca (2013-2014). logistic regression was used to examine associations between baseline depressive symptoms and onset of e-cigarette and cigarette single product and dual use at follow-ups. latent growth modeling was used to examine associations between sustained use of either product (vs. non-use) and changes in depressive symptoms over 12-months. higher baseline depressive symptoms predicted subsequent onset of cigarette (or = 1.024, 95% c.i. = 1.009-1.055), e-cigarette (or = 1.015, c.i. = 1.003-1.023), and dual use of both products (or = 1.021, c.i. = 1.003-1.043). sustained use of e-cigarettes over the 12-month observation (vs. non-use) was associated with a greater rate of increase in depressive symptoms over time (b = 1.272, se = 0.513, p = 0.01). among those who sustained use of e-cigarettes, higher frequency of use was associated with higher depressive symptoms at the final follow-up (b = 1.611, p = 0.04). a bi-directional association of depressive symptoms with e-cigarette use onset across mid adolescence was observed. further research on the causal nature, etiological underpinnings, and intervention implications of mental health and tobacco product use comorbidity is warranted.

anxiety	panic patients experience recurrent panic attacks. two main neurochemical hypotheses have been proposed to explain this vulnerability. the first suggests that panic patients have deficient serotonergic inhibition of neurons localized in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain that organizes defensive reactions to cope with proximal threats as well as of sympathomotor control areas of the rostral ventrolateral medulla that generate neurovegetative symptoms of the panic attack. the second proposes that endogenous opioids buffer panic attacks in normal subjects, and their deficit results in heightened sensitivity to suffocation and separation anxiety in panic patients. experimental results obtained in rat models of panic indicate that serotonin interacts synergistically with endogenous opioids in the dorsal periaqueductal gray through 5-ht1a and mu-opioid receptors to inhibit proximal defense and, supposedly, panic attacks. these findings allow reconciliation of the serotonergic and opioidergic hypotheses of panic pathophysiology. they also indicate that endogenous opioids are likely to participate in the panicolytic action of antidepressants and suggest that exogenous opioids may be useful for treating panic patients resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy.

bipolar_disorder	the gut microbiome is emerging as an important factor in regulating mental health yet it remains unclear what the target should be for psychiatric treatment. we aimed to elucidate the complement of the gutmicrobiome community for individuals with bipolar disorder relative to controls; and test for relationships with burden of disease measures. we compared the stool microbiome from individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 115) and control subjects (n = 64) using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequence analysis. analysis of molecular variance (amova) revealed global community case-control differences (amova p = 0.047). operational taxonomical unit (otu) level analysis revealed significantly decreased fractional representation (p < 0.001) of faecalibacterium after adjustment for age, sex, bmi and false discovery rate (fdr) correction at the p < 0.05 level. within individuals with bipolar disorder, the fractional representation of faecalibacterium associated with better self-reported health outcomes based on the short form health survey (sf12); the patient health questionnaire (phq9); the pittsburg sleep quality index (psqi); the generalized anxiety disorder scale (gad7); and the altman mania rating scale (asrm), independent of covariates. this study provides the first detailed analysis of the gut microbiome relationships with multiple psychiatric domains from a bipolar population. the data support the hypothesis that targeting the microbiome may be an effective treatment paradigm for bipolar disorder.

addiction	high online engagement is common among adolescents. besides concerns, not all highly involved adolescents online develop maladaptive patterns of use. the focus of the present qualitative study was to explore the experiences of highly engaged adolescents with signs of internet addictive behaviors. we aimed to uncover the processes differentiating high online engagement, and formulate a typology of users. semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 72 adolescents (m-age = 15.7 years; sd = 0.6) living in greece, spain, iceland and poland. interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. a typology of highly engaged adolescents emerged based on three processes: satisfying needs across contexts (online-offline), experiencing personal gains and losses and self-regulating use. four distinct user profiles emerged, ranging from adaptive (juggling it all, coming full cycle) to maladaptive (stuck online, killing boredom). the developed typology can help parents, teachers and professionals better understand the ways high engagement is experienced within a developmental context. such knowledge can inform the development of prevention and supportive services. implications for assessment and intervention are discussed for each profile.

smoking_cessation	objective: disparities in tobacco use persist despite successful policies reducing use within the united states. in particular, the prevalence of tobacco use in rural and certain minority communities is significantly higher compared to that of their counterparts. in this work, we examine the impact of rurality, mental health, and racial discrimination on tobacco use. methods: data come from the 2003 california health interview survey (n = 42,044). modified poisson regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, birth origin, education, income, insurance, and marital status. results: compared to urban residents, rural residents had a significantly higher risk for smoking after adjustment (rr = 1.10, 95% ci: 1.01-1.19). those who reported having experienced racial discrimination also had a significantly greater risk for smoking compared to those who did not (rr = 1.17, 95% ci: 1.07-1.27). additionally, those who reported higher stress had a significantly greater risk for smoking (rr = 1.61, 95% ci: 1.07-1.67). there was evidence of interaction between rurality and race/ethnicity, and rurality and gender (p < .05). conclusion: residing in rural areas was associated with an increased risk for smoking, above and beyond sociodemographics. there were no significant differences across rural-urban environments for the relationship between stress and tobacco use-an indication that the impact of stress and discrimination is not buffered or exacerbated by environmental characteristics potentially found in either location. mechanisms that explain rural-urban tobacco use disparities need to be explored, and smoking cessation programs and policies should be tailored to target these factors within rural communities.
asthma	background: pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (pavms) are present in approximately 15-50% individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (hht). they may be isolated but more often are multiple. the goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of pavms on lung mechanical properties. methods: we reviewed the files of all adult patients (age >= 18 years) referred to our center for evaluation of hht between 2005 and 2013. the diagnosis of hht was based on the curacao criteria and/or the presence of a pathogenic mutation. exclusion criteria included: chronic cardiac or lung disease (i.e. asthma or copd), suspicion of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography, current or past smoking (>10 pack-years), history of thoracic surgery, previous treatment of pavms by embolotherapy, lung infection or thromboembolic disease in the past 3 months, pregnancy and obesity (bmi >30 kg/m(2)). chest high resolution ct-scan and pulmonary function tests were performed the same day in all patients as part of our routine work-up. results: one hundred and fifty five patients with hht were included (age: 44.4 +/- 16.7 yrs - mean +/- sd -; males: 39%). eighty eight patients had no pavm, 45 had 1-3 pavms and 22 had at least 4 pavms. thirty eight patients had unilateral pavms and 29 bilateral pavms. we found no statistical relationship between the number, the size and the laterality of pavms and results of lung flows and volumes. conclusion: we found no evidence that pavms have a significant influence on lung mechanical properties as measured using routine pulmonary function tests in adult patients with hht, even in case of numerous, macroscopic or bilateral malformations.
stress_management	lesbian women engage in more hazardous drinking than heterosexual women yet we know relatively little about what explains this disparity. in the present study, race, socioeconomic status (ses), minority stress, general psychological processes, and distress were examined as pathways to hazardous drinking among young (18-35 years) black and non-hispanic white lesbian women. we used the psychological mediation framework adaptation of minority stress theory and the reserve capacity model as theoretical underpinnings of the conceptual model in the current study. self-identified lesbian participants (n = 867) completed a onetime online survey that assessed race, ses, perceived sexual minority discrimination, proximal minority stress (concealment, internalized homophobia, lack of connection to lesbian community), rumination, social isolation, psychological distress, drinking to cope, and hazardous drinking. cross-sectional results demonstrated that being black was associated with hazardous drinking via sequential mediators of rumination, psychological distress, and drinking to cope. ses was associated with hazardous drinking via sequential mediators of sexual minority discrimination, proximal minority stress, rumination, social isolation, psychological distress, and drinking to cope. understanding these pathways can aid researchers and clinicians studying and working with lesbians who are at risk for hazardous drinking.
dementia	the discovery that expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat within a noncoding region of the c9orf72 gene causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia raised questions about c9orf72 protein function and potential disease relevance. the major predicted structural feature of the c9orf72 protein is a denn (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells) domain. as denn domains are best characterized for regulation of specific rab gtpases, it has been proposed that c9orf72 may also act through regulation of a gtpase target. recent genetic and cell biological studies furthermore indicate that the c9orf72 protein functions at lysosomes as part of a larger complex that also contains the smith-magenis chromosome region 8 (smcr8) and wd repeat-containing protein 41 (wdr41) proteins. an important role for c9orf72 at lysosomes is supported by defects in lysosome morphology and mtor complex 1 (mtorc1) signaling arising from c9orf72 ko in diverse model systems. collectively, these new findings define a c9orf72-containing protein complex and a lysosomal site of action as central to c9orf72 function and provide a foundation for the elucidation of direct physiological targets for c9orf72. further elucidation of mechanisms whereby c9orf72 regulates lysosome function will help to determine how the reductions in c9orf72 expression levels that accompany hexanucleotide repeat expansions contribute to disease pathology.
lymphoma	peripheral t-cell lymphomas (ptcls) are aggressive non-hodgkin lymphomas with generally poor outcomes following standard therapy. few candidate therapeutic targets have been identified to date. retinoic acid receptor alpha (rara) is a transcription factor that modulates cell growth and differentiation in response to retinoids. while retinoids have been used to treat some cutaneous t-cell lymphomas (ctcls), their mechanism of action and the role of rara in ctcl and other mature t-cell lymphomas remain poorly understood. after identifying a ptcl with a rara(r394q) mutation, we sought to characterize the role of rara in t-cell lymphoma cells. overexpressing wild-type rara or rara(r394q) significantly increased cell growth in rara(low) cell lines, while rara knockdown induced g1 arrest and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinases cdk2/4/6 in rara(high) cells. the retinoids, am80 (tamibarotene) and all-trans retinoic acid, caused dose-dependent growth inhibition, g1 arrest, and cdk2/4/6 down-regulation. genes down-regulated in transcriptome data were enriched for cell cycle and g1-s transition. finally, rara overexpression augmented chemosensitivity to retinoids. in conclusion, rara drives cyclin-dependent kinase expression, g(1)-s transition, and cell growth in t-cell lymphoma. synthetic retinoids inhibit these functions in a dose-dependent fashion and are most effective in cells with high rara expression, indicating rara may represent a therapeutic target in some ptcls.
smoking_cessation	background: translation of knowledge and skills from classroom settings to clinical practice is a major challenge in healthcare training, especially for behavioral interventions. for example, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (sbirt) is a highly-promoted approach to identifying and treating individuals at risk for alcohol or drug problems, yet effective, routine use of sbirt has lagged. objective: the objective of this paper is to describe the development, pilot testing, and trial protocol of a mobile app based on the theory of planned behavior (tpb) to promote sbirt skill translation and application. methods: intended for use after classroom training occurs, the mobile app has three primary functions designed to increase behavioral intent to deliver sbirt: (1) review skills (ie, address knowledge and beliefs about sbirt), (2) apply skills with patients (ie, build confidence and perceived behavioral control), and (3) report performance data (ie, increase accountability and social norms and/ or influence). the app includes depression and anxiety screening tools due to high comorbidity with substance use. a randomized controlled trial (rct) is in progress among health and social service learners (n= 200) recruited from 3 universities and 6 different training programs in nursing, social work, internal medicine, psychiatry, and psychology. participants are randomized to sbirt classroom instruction alone or classroom instruction plus app access prior to beginning their field placement rotations. tpb-based data are collected via qualtrics or via the mobile app pre-post and sbirt utilization, weekly for 10 weeks. key outcomes include the frequency of and self-reported confidence in delivery of sbirt. results: beta testing with advanced practice nursing students (n= 22) indicated that the app and its associated assessment tools were acceptable and useful. the system usability scale (sus) mean was 65.8 (n= 19), which indicated that the sbirt app was acceptable but could benefit from improvement. indeed, modifications were implemented prior to starting the trial. enrollment of trial participants began in september 2016. results are expected by december 2017. conclusions: this report describes the process of tpb-based app development and testing, and the protocol for a rct to determine the effectiveness of the app in enhancing skill translation. if effective, this approach could improve sbirt implementation, fidelity, and clinical outcomes.
atrial_fibrillation	to evaluate the feasibility of performing comprehensive cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) guided electrophysiological (ep) interventions in a porcine model encompassing left atrial access. after introduction of two femoral sheaths 14 swine (41 +/- 3.6 kg) were transferred to a 1.5 t mr scanner. a three-dimensional whole-heart sequence was acquired followed by segmentation and the visualization of all heart chambers using an image-guidance platform. two mr conditional catheters were inserted. the interventional protocol consisted of intubation of the coronary sinus, activation mapping, transseptal left atrial access (n = 4), generation of ablation lesions and eventually ablation of the atrioventricular (av) node. for visualization of the catheter tip active tracking was used. catheter positions were confirmed by passive real-time imaging. total procedure time was 169 +/- 51 minutes. the protocol could be completed in 12 swine. two swine died from av-ablation induced ventricular fibrillation. catheters could be visualized and navigated under active tracking almost exclusively. the position of the catheter tips as visualized by active tracking could reliably be confirmed with passive catheter imaging. comprehensive cmr-guided ep interventions including left atrial access are feasible in swine using active catheter tracking. aeuro cent comprehensive cmr-guided electrophysiological interventions including la access were conducted in swine. aeuro cent active catheter-tracking allows efficient catheter navigation also in a transseptal approach. aeuro cent more mr-conditional tools are needed to facilitate left atrial interventions in humans.
mental_health	objective: to investigate quality of life (qol) and psychosocial well-being in youth with neuromuscular disorders (nmds) who are wheelchair users. data sources: medline, embase, cinahl, and psycinfo (january 2004 april 2016) and reference lists of retrieved full-text articles. study selection: peer-reviewed studies were included when data describing self-reported qol and psychosocial well-being could be separately understood for those using wheelchairs and 12 to 22 years of age. there were 2058 records independently screened, and potentially eligible articles were obtained and examined by all reviewers. twelve observational and 3 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. data extraction: population representativeness, measurement tools, and outcomes, where possible, with comparison groups. two reviewers independently appraised studies for risk of bias to internal validity and generalizability. data synthesis: heterogeneity of measurement and reporting precluded meta-analysis. data were cross-sectional only. compared with same-age typically developing peers, physical qol was scored consistently and significantly lower in youth with nmds, whereas psychosocial qol was not. psychosocial qol was highest in youth nonambulant since early childhood and in those recruited via single tertiary specialist clinics. mental health and social participation could not be compared with same-age populations. conclusions: despite low physical qol, psychosocial qol in youth with nmds appeared comparable with same-age peers. the psychosocial well-being of younger adolescents on degenerative disease trajectories appeared most compromised; however, the longitudinal effects of growing up with a nmd on mental health and social participation are unknown. interpretation was hampered by poor description of participant age, sex and physical ability; lack of population-based recruitment strategies; and inconsistent use of age-appropriate measures. understanding of self reported qol and psychosocial well-being in youth with nmds transitioning to adulthood is limited.
crohn's_disease	crohn 's disease is one of the major subtypes of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease and is characterized by chronic transmural intestinal inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract anywhere from mouth to the anus, with a predilection for the small bowel. cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography plays a key role in confirming diagnosis, identifying and managing complications, assessing disease severity, and identifying response to medical therapy. this review will focus on the role of radiologists in the diagnosis and assessment of crohn 's disease. additionally, a review of current medical therapy approaches, available medications, and side effects will be discussed. the review will also highlight key complications of medical therapy and associated diseases that should be evaluated by the radiologist with cross-sectional imaging.
osteoporosis	bone status impairment represents a complication of generalized forms of epidermolysis bullosa (eb); however, the prevalence and the main determinants of this event in localized forms remain poorly defined. birmingham epidermolysis bullosa severity (bebs) score and 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels are strongly associated with low bone mass, suggesting that vitamin d may play a potential beneficial role in bone health. further longitudinal studies are needed in order to confirm this hypothesis. bone status impairment represents a complication of generalized forms of eb; thus, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of low bone mass, to examine mineralization differences in various eb subtypes and to identify the most important determinants of bone impairment in children with either generalized or localized eb. an observational study of 20 children (11 males; mean age +/- standard deviation, 11.7 +/- 3.9 years) with eb was performed. clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, x-ray of the left hand and wrist for bone age, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans of the lumbar spine were obtained. areal bone mineral density (abmd z-scores) and bone mineral apparent density were related to the bebs score. areal bmd z-score (mean -1.82 +/- 2.33, range, -7.6-1.7) was reduced (<-2 sd) in 8 patients (40%), whereas abmd z-score adjusted for bone age was low in 7 patients (35%). bebs score and 25-hydroxyvitamin d serum levels were the most important elements associated with abmd (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.016, respectively). a significant correlation between the abmd z-score and area of skin damage, insulin-like growth factor-1, c-reactive protein, and sodium serum levels was also found. low abmd can be considered a systemic complication of eb, primarily associated with bebs score and 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels. therefore, longitudinal evaluation of bone status is ongoing in these patients to define whether vitamin d supplementation would prevent, or at least reduce, bone status impairment.
atrial_fibrillation	background: prior studies have shown a treatment gap in oral anticoagulation (oac) use among patients with atrial fibrillation yet have incompletely characterized factors associated with failure to treat and subsequent outcomes in contemporary practice. methods: using data collected between june 2010 and august 2011 from 174 ambulatory care sites in the outcomes registry for better informed treatment of atrial fibrillation, we identified factors associated with absence of oac via stratified logistic regression. using weighted cox regression, we assessed the association between oac non-use and subsequent outcomes over 2.5 years. results: among 9553 patients, 2202 (23.0%) were not on oac. among oac nonrecipients, 1846 (83.8%) had a cha(2)ds(2)-vasc score >= 2. factors independently associated with oac non-use included atrial fibrillation type (paroxysmal odds ratio [or] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.54-0.99; persistent or 0.14, 95% ci 0.10-0.21; permanent or 0.35, 95% ci 0.25-0.49; reference = new-onset), left atrial diameter enlargement (mild or 0.80, 95% ci 0.66-0.97; moderate 0.58, 95% ci 0.47-0.73; severe 0.53, 95% ci 0.42-0.68; reference = normal diameter), and age >80 years (or 1.04, 95% ci 1.02-1.08). untreated patients had a higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [hr] 1.22, 95% ci 1.05-1.41), a lower bleeding risk (adjusted hr 0.35, 95% ci 0.15-0.81), and a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk of stroke/non-central nervous system embolism/transient ischemic attack than those treated (adjusted hr 1.18, 95% ci 0.91-1.54). conclusions: a majority of atrial fibrillation patients not treated with an oac in current community practice meet guideline indications for treatment. atrial fibrillation burden, chronicity, and comorbidity are associated with nontreatment. untreated patients are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. published by elsevier inc.
osteoporosis	given the limitations of current therapeutic options for postmenopausal osteoporosis, there is a need for alternatives with minimal adverse effects. in this study, we evaluated the effects of icaritin (ict), a natural prenylflavonoid, on osteoclastogenesis both in vitro and in an ovariectomized (ovx) rat model and investigated its underlying molecular mechanism(s) of action. ict inhibited osteoclast formation in two osteoclast precursor models, raw 264.7 mouse monocyte cell line and human pbmc. ict also inhibited sealing zone and resorption pit formation in a dose-dependent manner. mechanistically, ict inhibited rankl-induced nf-b and mapk/ap-1 pathways to suppress gene expression of nuclear factor of activated t cells (nfat)c1, the master transcription regulator of osteoclast differentiation. ict, by inhibiting the traf6/c-src/pi3k pathway, suppressed nadph oxidase-1 activation to attenuate intracellular ros production and downregulate calcineurin phosphatase activity. as a result, nfatc1 nuclear translocation and activity was suppressed. crucially, ict promoted proteasomal degradation of traf6, the critical adaptor protein that transduces rankl/rank signaling, and the inhibitory effect of ict on osteoclastogenesis was reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor mg 132. ict administration inhibited ovx-induced bone loss and resorption by suppressing osteoclast formation and activity. consistent with cellular studies, ict downregulated traf6 and nfatc1 protein expression in cd11b(+)/gr-1(-/low) osteoclast precursors isolated from ovx rats. put together, we present novel findings that ict, by downregulating traf6, coordinates inhibition of nf-b, mapk/ap-1, and ros signaling pathways to reduce expression and activity of nfatc1. these results demonstrate the potential of ict for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and point to traf6 as a promising target for novel anti-osteoporotic drugs.

atrial_fibrillation	study objectiveto evaluate the time to achieve therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) values and occurrence of bleeding based on standard unfractionated heparin (ufh) weight-based dosing recommendations compared with an aggressive weight-based ufh dosing strategy using higher maximum doses and infusion rates in both obese and nonobese patients who presented with non-st-segment elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina (nstemi/ua) or atrial fibrillation. designretrospective cohort study. settingacademic medical center. patientsa total of 197 adults were included who were admitted for nstemi/ua, atrial fibrillation, or other cardiac indications and received at least 6 hours of a continuous ufh infusion. of those patients, 71 were treated with standard ufh dosing (60-unit/kg bolus [or maximum 4000 units] followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/hour [or maximum 1000 units/hr]) between september 2013 and february 2014, and 126 patients received an aggressive ufh dosing strategy (60-unit/kg bolus [or maximum 10,000 units] followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/hr [or maximum 2250 units/hr]) between october 2014 and march 2015. patients in the standard dosing and aggressive strategy cohorts were further classified by body mass index status (normal, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese) and weight status. measurements and main resultsa time-to-event analysis for achievement of therapeutic aptt range (60-80 sec) was assessed. a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with the aggressive strategy achieved a therapeutic aptt within 6 hours (23% vs 11%, p=0.043). the delay or failure to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation was particularly evident in obese patients in the standard dosing group. the mean sd initial infusion rate was 10.8 +/- 1.4 units/kg/hour in the standard dosing group versus 12 +/- 0.02 units/kg/hour in the aggressive strategy group (p=<0.0005). the occurrence of supratherapeutic aptt values and the highest aptt achieved were similar between the two dosing groups (p=0.817 and p=0.348, respectively). no bleeding events were reported in either group. conclusionpatients who had higher ufh maximum bolus doses and infusion rates achieved therapeutic anticoagulation more rapidly, without increased bleeding, and these doses can be adjusted for obese as well as nonobese patients. however, despite use of the higher doses, only 23% of patients achieved therapeutic aptt values within 6 hours, suggesting that an even higher bolus dose and infusion rate may still be warranted.
atrial_fibrillation	background: ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax are approved for treating cll patients in the united states. however, there is no guidance as to their optimal sequence. patients and methods: we conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of cll patients treated with kinase inhibitors (kis) or venetoclax. we examined demographics, discontinuation reasons, overall response rates (orr), survival, and post-ki salvage strategies. primary endpoint was progression-free survival (pfs). results: a total of 683 patients were identified. baseline characteristics were similar in the ibrutinib and idelalisib groups. orr to ibrutinib and idelalisib as first ki was 69% and 81%, respectively. with a median follow-up of 17 months (range 1-60), median pfs and os for the entire cohort were 35 months and not reached. patients treated with ibrutinib (versus idelalisib) as first ki had a significantly better pfs in all settings; front-line [ hazard ratios (hr) 2.8, ci 1.3-6.3, p = 0.01], relapsed-refractory (hr 2.8, ci 1.9-4.1, p < 0.001), del17p (hr 2.0, ci 1.2-3.4, p = 0.008), and complex karyotype (hr 2.5, ci 1.2-5.2, p = 0.02). at the time of initial ki failure, use of an alternate ki or venetoclax had a superior pfs when compared with chemoimmunotherapy. furthermore, patients who discontinued ibrutinib due to progression or toxicity had marginally improved outcomes if they received venetoclax (orr 79%) versus idelalisib (orr 46%) (pfs hr.6, ci. 3-1.0, p = 0.06). conclusions: in the largest real-world experience of novel agents in cll, ibrutinib appears superior to idelalisib as first ki. furthermore, in the setting of ki failure, alternate ki or venetoclax therapy appear superior to chemoimmunotherapy combinations. the use of venetoclax upon ibrutinib failure might be superior to idelalisib. these data support the need for trials testing sequencing strategies to optimize treatment algorithms.
asthma	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), the by-products of incomplete combustion of organic materials, are commonly found on particulate matter (pm) and have been associated with the development of asthma and asthma exacerbation in urban populations. we examined time spent in the home and outdoors as predictors of exposures to airborne pahs and measured urinary 1-hydroxypyrene-glucuronide (1-ohpg) as internal dose of pahs in 118 children aged 5-12 years from baltimore, md. during weeklong periods (saturday-saturday) in each of four seasons: daily activities were assessed using questionnaires, indoor air nicotine and pm concentrations were monitored, and urine specimens were collected on tuesday (day 3) and saturday (day 7) for measurement of 1-ohpg. time spent in non-smoking homes was associated with significantly decreased 1-ohpg concentration in urine (beta =-0.045, 95% ci (-0.076, -0.013)), and secondhand smoke (shs) exposures modified these associations, with higher urinary 1-ohpg concentrations in children spending time in smoking homes than non-smoking homes (p-value for interaction = 0.012). time spent outdoors was associated with increased urinary 1-ohpg concentrations (beta = 0.097, 95% ci (0.037, 0.157)) in boys only. our results suggest that shs and ambient (outdoor) air pollution contribute to internal dose of pahs in inner city children.
migraine	background: migraine is one of the most common and disabling of all medical conditions, affecting 16% of the general population, causing huge socioeconomic costs globally. current available treatment options are inadequate. serotonin is a key molecule in the neurobiology of migraine, but the exact role of brain serotonergic mechanisms remains a matter of controversy. methods: we systematically searched pubmed for studies investigating the serotonergic system in the migraine brain by either molecular neuroimaging or electrophysiological methods. results: the literature search resulted in 59 papers, of which 13 were eligible for review. the reviewed papers collectively support the notion that migraine patients have alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission. most likely, migraine patients have a low cerebral serotonin level between attacks, which elevates during a migraine attack. conclusion: this review suggests that novel methods of investigating the serotonergic system in the migraine brain are warranted. uncovering the serotonergic mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology could prove useful for the development of future migraine drugs.
smoking_cessation	purpose: cardiac rehabilitation (cr) is a program of structured exercise and interventions for coronary risk factor reduction that reduces morbidity and mortality rates following a major cardiac event. although a dose-response relationship between the number of cr sessions completed and health outcomes has been demonstrated, adherence with cr is not high. in this study, we examined associations between the number of sessions completed within cr and patient demographics, clinical characteristics, smoking status, and socioeconomic status (ses). methods: multiple logistic regression and classification and regression tree (cart) modeling were used to examine associations between participant characteristics measured at cr intake and the number of sessions completed in a prospectively collected cr clinical database (n = 1658). results: current smoking, lower ses, nonsurgical diagnosis, exerciselimiting comorbidities, and lower age independently predicted fewer sessions completed. the cart analysis illustrates how combinations of these characteristics (ie, risk profiles) predict the number of sessions completed. those with the highest-risk profile for nonadherence (72 years old, not current smoker, higher ses, surgical diagnosis) completed 27 sessions on average. conclusions: younger individuals, as well as those who report smoking or economic challenges or have a nonsurgical diagnosis, may require additional support to maintain cr session attendance.
osteoporosis	dysregulated rest-activity rhythm (rar) patterns have been associated with several health conditions in older adults. this study showed that later acrophase was associated with a modestly greater risk of falls but not fractures in elderly men. associations between dysregulated rar patterns and osteoporosis risk warrant further investigation. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between rest-activity rhythm (rar) patterns and risk of falls/fractures in older men. we hypothesized that dysregulated rar would be associated with incident falls/fractures. we used wrist-worn actigraphy to measure rar over 4.8 +/- 0.8 24-h periods in men (a 67 years) enrolled in the multicenter outcomes of sleep disorders in men (mros sleep) study (n = 3001). men were contacted every 4 months to report occurrence of falls/fractures. rar parameters included amplitude (difference between peak and nadir activity in counts/minute), mesor (activity counts/minute), acrophase (time of day of peak activity), and pseudo-f statistic (rhythm robustness) and were evaluated as continuous variables with associations reported per sd increase/decrease in models adjusted for confounders. logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood (odds ratio, or) of recurrent falls in the year after the visit. proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk (hazard ratio, hr) of fractures. one year after the visit, 417 men (14%) had recurrent (a 2) falls. later acrophase (or 1.18, 95% ci 1.06-1.32) was associated with a modestly greater likelihood of falls. in 8.6 years (sd 2.6 years) of >97% complete follow-up, 256 men (8.53%) had a major osteoporotic fracture, 85 (2.8%) had a clinical spine fracture, and 110 (3.7%) had a hip fracture. no consistent, significant associations were observed between rar patterns and fractures. later acrophase was associated with a modestly greater risk of falls; this association did not translate into a higher fracture risk in this cohort of elderly men.
smoking_cessation	the majority of adults seeking substance use disorder treatment also smoke. smoking is associated with greater substance use disorder severity, poorer treatment outcome, and increased mortality among those with substance use disorders. yet, engaging this population in smoking cessation treatment is a significant challenge. the aim of this study was to examine perceived barriers to smoking cessation among treatment-seeking adults with alcohol or opioid use disorder. additionally, we examined whether anxiety sensitivity - a known risk factor for barriers to smoking cessation in the general population - was associated with more barriers to smoking cessation in this sample. a sample of 208 adults was recruited for a one-time study and completed self-report measures of anxiety sensitivity and perceived barriers to smoking cessation. results indicated that the most common barriers were anxiety (82% of the sample), tension/irritability (76%), and concerns about the ability to maintain sobriety from their primary substance of abuse (64%). those who reported more barriers also reported lower confidence in the ability to change their smoking behavior. higher anxiety sensitivity was associated with more perceived barriers to smoking cessation, even when controlling for cigarette dependence severity. these results suggest that there are several perceived barriers to smoking cessation among treatment-seeking adults with substance use disorders. in addition to psychoeducational interventions aimed to modify negative beliefs about smoking cessation, anxiety sensitivity may be a promising therapeutic target in this population.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: inhalation of environmental (nano) particles (np) as well as persistent herpesvirus- infection are potentially associated with chronic lung disease and as both are omnipresent in human society a coincidence of these two factors is highly likely. we hypothesized that np-exposure of persistently herpesvirus- infected cells as a second hit might disrupt immune control of viral latency, provoke reactivation of latent virus and eventually lead to an inflammatory response and tissue damage. results: to test this hypothesis, we applied different np to cells or mice latently infected with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) which provides a small animal model for the study of gammaherpesvirus-pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, np-exposure induced expression of the typically lytic viral gene orf50 and production of lytic virus. in vivo, lytic viral proteins in the lung increased after intratracheal instillation with np and elevated expression of the viral gene orf50 could be detected in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage. gene expression and metabolome analysis of whole lung tissue revealed patterns with striking similarities to acute infection. likewise, np-exposure of human cells latently infected with epstein-barr-virus also induced virus production. conclusions: our results indicate that np-exposure of persistently herpesvirus-infected cells - murine or human - restores molecular signatures found in acute virus infection, boosts production of lytic viral proteins, and induces an inflammatory response in the lung - a combination which might finally result in tissue damage and pathological alterations.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: to investigate the effect of the operator knowing the real-time contact force (cf) on the efficacy of pulmonary vein antrum isolation (pvai). methods: fifty patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (af) or short lasting persistent af were randomized to cf guided pvai (n = 25) or conventional pvai (n = 25). in the cf guided group, cf between 10 and 40 g was aimed at. efficacy of pvai was measured as reduction in af burden (afb) and time to af recurrence detected by implantable cardiac monitor (icm), inserted three months before pvai. blanking period was three months and follow-up 12 months. results: all pulmonary veins were isolated in the cf guided group and all but one in the conventional group. mean cf was 25 g in the cf guided group and 24 g in the conventional group (p = 0.75). compared to pre-ablation, median [iqr] relative reduction in afb 3-12 months after ablation was 100 [99- 100]% in the cf guided group (p< 0.001) and 99.4 [25- 100]% in the conventional group (p< 0.001), not different between groups (p = 0.09). nine patients (36%) had af recurrence in the cf guided group and 13 (52%) in the conventional group (p = 0.21, log-rank test). cf differed between operators. when adjusted for operator by regression analysis, patients without recurrent af had lower proportion of ablation time with cf < 10 g than recurrent patients (p = 0.034). no complications occurred. conclusions: operator knowledge of real-time cf had no significant effect on afb reduction or time to af recurrence. larger trials should be done to study benefit of real-time cf.
osteoarthritis	the incorporation of fluorine atoms into functional molecules is of wide interest in synthetic organic chemistry as well as cognate disciplines. in particular, in medicinal chemistry, there is a strong desire to positively influence the physicochemical molecular properties of drug compounds by introducing fluorine into biologically active molecules. here, we present targeted fluoro positioning as the key design principle of converting a weak matrix metalloproteinase-13 (mmp-13) inhibitor into a very potent (ic50=6nm) and highly selective (selectivity factors of >1000 over mmp-1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14) inhibitor with excellent plasma and microsomal stability, and no binding to the herg channel (herg: human ether-a-go-go related gene).
addiction	glutamate transporters (eaat) have been implicated in the drug addiction behavior. we determined whether eaat type 3 (eaat3) played a role in morphine addiction. six-to eight-week-old eaat3 knockout (eaat3(-/-)) mice and their wild-type littermates received 3 intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg morphine, each on an alternative day, to induce conditioned place preference (cpp). two days after the place preference returned to baseline, mice received 2.5 mg/kg morphine to induce reinstatement. some mice received intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg riluzole, an eaat activator, 30 min before morphine or saline injection. hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area were harvested for western analysis 24 h after the last dose of morphine was injected. morphine induced cpp in wild-type and eaat3(-/-)mice. gender is not a statistically significant factor to influence this behavior. this conditioned behavior extinguished after morphine administration was stopped for 8-9 days in wild-type mice, while this extinction occurred 6 days after discontinuation of morphine injection in eaat3(-/-)mice. a small dose of morphine similarly reinstated the conditioned behavior in the wild-type and eaat3(-/-)mice. riluzole abolished morphine-induced cpp during the initial place preference. morphine increased eaat3 expression in the plasma membrane of medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area but did not affect eaat3 expression in the hippocampus. these results suggest that eaat3 delays the extinction of morphine-induced cpp. eaat activation may prevent the formation of morphine-induced cpp. (c) 2016 ibro. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
autism	when upper and lower regions from different emotionless faces are aligned to form a facial composite, observers 'fuse' the two halves together, perceptually. the illusory distortion induced by task-irrelevant ( 'distractor') halves hinders participants' judgements about task-relevant ('target') halves. this composite-face effect reveals a tendency to integrate feature information from disparate regions of intact upright faces, consistent with theories of holistic face processing. however, observers frequently perceive emotion in ostensibly neutral faces, contrary to the intentions of experimenters. this study sought to determine whether this 'perceived emotion' influences the composite-face effect. in our first experiment, we confirmed that the composite effect grows stronger as the strength of distractor emotion increased. critically, effects of distractor emotion were induced by weak emotion intensities, and were incidental insofar as emotion cues hindered image matching, not emotion labelling per se. in experiment 2, we found a correlation between the presence of perceived emotion in a set of ostensibly neutral distractor regions sourced from commonly used face databases, and the strength of illusory distortion they induced. in experiment 3, participants completed a sequential matching composite task in which half of the distractor regions were rated high and low for perceived emotion, respectively. significantly stronger composite effects were induced by the high-emotion distractor halves. these convergent results suggest that perceived emotion increases the strength of the composite-face effect induced by supposedly emotionless faces. these findings have important implications for the study of holistic face processing in typical and atypical populations.
atrial_fibrillation	in 2013-2014, malformed young satsuma mandarin (citrus unshiu marc.) fruits were found in xunwu county, jiangxi province, china. common disease symptoms include slightly curled and backward-twisted spring leaves, cracked and deformed leaf edges, thickly grown spring twigs with twisted and slightly bent shoots, and malformed young fruits where groovelike depression forms from the upper portion and resembles a pumpkin. on the basis of the morphological characteristics, sequencing results and phylogenetic analysis of the infected plant, we identified the disease as citrus yellow vein clearing, which is caused by citrus yellow vein clearing virus (cyvcv). to our knowledge, this study is the first to report cyvcv infecting satsuma mandarin.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective to investigate the usefulness of diffusion weighted imaging (dwi) by comparing with clinical features, blood parameters and traditional short tau inversion recovery (stir) sequence in detecting spinal and sacroiliac (si) joint inflammation in axial spondyloarthritis (axspa) patients. methods one hundred and ten axspa patients were recruited. clinical, radiological and blood parameters were recorded. dwi and stir mri were performed simultaneously and results were scored according to the spondyloarthritis research consortium of canada (sparcc) for comparison. apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) values were also calculated. results dwi did not correlate with clinical parameters or blood parameters. it also had lowered sensitivity. when compared with stir sequence, it correlated well with stir sequence at the si joint level (cc 0.76, p< 0.001), but weakly at the spinal level (cc 0.23, p=0.02). at the si joint level, the presence of inflammation on both stir sequence and dwi was associated with an increase in maximum (b=0.24, p=0.02 in stir; b=0.37, p< 0.001 in dwi) and mean adc values (b=0.17, p=0.003 in stir; b=0.15, p=0.01 in dwi). maximum (b=0.19, p=0.04) and mean spinal adc values (b=0.18, p=0.01) were also positively associated with dwi detected spinal inflammation. presence of modic lesions showed positive correlation with stir sequence (b=7.12, p=0.01) but not spinal adc values. conclusion despite dwi correlates with stir sequence, it has lower sensitivity. however, adc values appear to be independent of modic lesions and may supplement stir sequence to differentiate degeneration.
medicare	dialysis vascular access management in the united states changed significantly after national kidney foundation-kidney disease outcome quality initiative (nkf-kdoqi) clinical practice guidelines were first published in 1997. the centers for medicare and medicaid service adopted these guidelines and in collaboration with the end-stage renal disease networks established the fistula first breakthrough initiative (ffbi) in 2003 to improve the rate of arteriovenous fistula use over arteriovenous graft and central venous catheter in the dialysis population. the implementation of guidelines and ffbi has led to a significant increase in the arteriovenous fistula use in the prevalent dialysis population. the guidelines are criticized for being opinion based and often impractical. over the past 2 decades, the patient population undergoing dialysis has become older with complex comorbidities and challenges for creating an ideal vascular access. advancing knowledge about access pathophysiology, improved treatment options, and improved process of care with team approach model point toward diminishing relevance of few of the existing guidelines. moreover, several guidelines remain controversial and may be leading to clinical decisions that may be unfavorable to the patients. the review discusses the historical aspect of vascular access care in the united states and evolution of current practice standards and controversies surrounding few of these guidelines in the current time. published by elsevier inc.
addiction	in mammals, centromere definition involves the histone variant cenp-a (centromere protein a), deposited by its chaperone, hjurp (holliday junction recognition protein). alterations in this process impair chromosome segregation and genome stability, which are also compromised by p53 inactivation in cancer. here we found that cenp-a and hjurp are transcriptionally up-regulated in p53-null human tumors. using an established mouse embryonic fibroblast (mef) model combining p53 inactivation with e1a or hras-v12 oncogene expression, we reproduced a similar up-regulation of hjurp and cenp-a. we delineate functional cde/chr motifs within the hjurp and cenpa promoters and demonstrate their roles in p53-mediated repression. to assess the importance of hjurp up-regulation in transformed murine and human cells, we used a crispr/cas9 approach. remarkably, depletion of hjurp leads to distinct outcomes depending on their p53 status. functional p53 elicits a cell cycle arrest response, whereas, in p53-null transformed cells, the absence of arrest enables the loss of hjurp to induce severe aneuploidy and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death. we thus tested the impact of hjurp depletion in pre-established allograft tumors in mice and revealed a major block of tumor progression in vivo. we discuss a model in which an ""epigenetic addiction"" to the hjurp chaperone represents an achilles' heel in p53-deficient transformed cells.
atrial_fibrillation	context: recent upsurge in referral of patients with compromised left ventricular (lv) function for cardiac surgery has led to an increasing use inotropes to achieve improvement of tissue perfusion in the perioperative period. aims and objectives: to compare the hemodynamic effects and immediate postoperative outcomes with levosimendan and dobutamine in patients with moderate to severe lv dysfunction undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (opcab). settings and design: university teaching hospital, randomized control study. materials and methods: eighty patients were randomly divided into two groups of 40 each. group i received levosimendan at 0.1 mg/kg/min and group ii received dobutamine at 5 mg/kg/min. hemodynamic data were noted at 30 min, during obtuse marginal grafting, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery. heart rate (hr), mean arterial pressure (map), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp), cardiac index (ci), systemic vascular resistance index (svri) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (pvri), left ventricular stroke work index (lvswi) and right ventricular stroke work index (rvswi), mixed venous oximetry (svo2), and lactate were measured. statistical analysis used: chi-square and student 's t-test. results: the hr, map, pcwp, svri, and pvri were lower in group i when compared to group ii. group i patients showed a statistically significant increase in lvswi, rvswi, and ci, when compared to group ii. comparatively, group i patients maintained higher svo2and lower lactate levels. duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (icu), and hospital stay were lower in group i. conclusions: levosimendan was associated with statistically significant increase in indices of contractility (ci, lvswi, and rvswi) and decrease in pcwp during and after opcab. levosimendan group had lower incidence of atrial fibrillation, shorter length of icu, and hospital stay.
smoking_cessation	background: a better understanding of whether nurses' own smoking behaviours influence their engagement with smoking cessation interventions is needed. aim: to establish whether the smoking status of nurses is associated with their professional smoking cessation practices. methods: twelve electronic databases covering english and spanish language publications from 01 jan, 1996 to 25 mar, 2015 were systematically searched. studies were included if they reported nurses' smoking cessation practices in relation to their personal smoking habits. proportions of nurses' smoking status and smoking cessation practices were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis. results: fifteen studies were included in this systematic review. levels of reportedsmoking cessation interventions were generally low across the studies. the meta-analyses suggested that nurses' personal smoking status was not associated significantly with nurses always asking patients about their smoking, but nurses who smoked were 13% less likely to advise their patients to quit and 25% less likely to arrange smoking cessation follow-up. more intense interventions (assessing motivation and assisting) were not significantly associated with the smoking status of the nurse. conclusions: the smoking status of nurses appears to have a negative impact in the delivery of smoking cessation practices. the overall level of nurses' engagement with the delivery of smoking cessation interventions requires attention if nurses are to be effective agents of smoking cessation. crown copyright (c) 2016 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
osteoporosis	mechanical unloading leads to bone loss and disuse osteoporosis partly due to impaired osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells (bmscs). however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not fully understood. in this study, we demonstrated that cyclic mechanical stretch (cms) promotes osteoblastogenesis of bmscs both in vivo and in vitro. besides, we found that hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway was activated in this process. inhibition of which by either knockdown of sonic hedgehog (shh) or treating bmscs with hh inhibitors attenuated the osteogenic effect of cms on bmscs, suggesting that hh signaling pathway acts as an endogenous mediator of mechanical stimuli on bmscs. furthermore, we demonstrated that shh expression level was regulated by dna methylation mechanism. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assay showed that dna methyltransferase 3b (dnmt3b) binds to shh gene promoter, leading to dna hypermethylation in mechanical unloading bmscs. however, mechanical stimulation down-regulates the protein level of dnmt3b, results in dna demethylation and shh expression. more importantly, we found that inhibition of dnmt3b partly rescued bone loss in hu mice by mechanical unloading. our results demonstrate, for the first time, that mechanical stimulation regulates osteoblastic genes expression via direct regulation of dnmt3b, and the therapeutic inhibition of dnmt3b may be an efficient strategy for enhancing bone formation under mechanical unloading.
atrial_fibrillation	multiple studies have shown the efficacy and potentially curative effect of catheter ablation (ca). however, ca is always accompanied by a considerable recurrence rate for atrial fibrillation (af). we hypothesized that pre-procedure assessments of baseline left atrial appendage emptying flow velocity (laafv) and n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) levels would help identify abnormal atrial substrate and offer preliminary evidence regarding susceptibility to af recurrence in patients with paroxysmal or persistent af, respectively. in 120 patients with af (paroxysmal, 55; persistent, 65), transesophageal echocardiography was performed with assessment of laafv and nt-probnp was measured before the first af ablation. after 12 months of follow-up, 16 patients (29.1%) in the paroxysmal af and 23 patients (35.4%) in the persistent af experienced recurrence of af. in roc analysis, a nt-probnp value of ae291 pg/ml in the paroxysmal af and ae368 pg/ml in the persistent af discriminated afr and non-afr with the greatest sensitivity and specificity. in multivariate regression analysis, laafv (or 0.88, 95% ci 0.79-0.98, p = 0.023) was identified as an independent predictor of afr in the paroxysmal af population post-ca after adjustment for other risk factors; however, in the persistent af population, laafv (or 0.81, 95% ci 0.68-0.94, p = 0.007) and a nt-probnp value ae368 pg/ml (or 18.29, 95% ci 1.32-252.84, p = 0.030) were identified as independent predictors for rhythm outcome compared to other parameters. in patients with persistent af, elevated plasma nt-probnp concentrations combined with low laafv were associated with rhythm outcome after af ablation; however, laafv was the only independent predictor of ca efficacy in patients with paroxysmal af.
atrial_fibrillation	background: mild traumatic brain injury (mtbi) represents 70-80% of all treated brain injuries. a considerable proportion of mtbi patients experience post-concussion symptoms for a prolonged period after mtbi, and these symptoms are diagnosed as persistent post-concussion syndrome (ppcs). ppcs is defined as a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms. however, memory and executive dysfunction seems to be one of the most debilitating symptoms. recently, non-invasive brain stimulation has been studied as a potential treatment method for traumatic brain injury (tbi) patients. therefore, our primary goal is to verify the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) in patients with ppcs who demonstrate cognitive deficits in long-term episodic memory, working memory, and executive function following mtbi. methods/design: this is a randomized crossover trial of patients with a history of mtbi with cognitive deficits in memory and executive function. thirty adult patients will be randomized in a crossover manner to receive three weekly sessions of anodal tdcs (2ma) at left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left temporal cortex, and sham stimulation that will be performed at 7-day intervals (washout period). the clinical diagnosis of ppcs will be determined using the rivermead post-concussion symptoms questionnaire. patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assessed with a neuropsychological evaluation. a new battery of computerized neuropsychological tests will be performed before and immediately after each stimulation. statistical analysis will be performed to determine trends of cognitive improvement. discussion: there is paucity of studies regarding the use of tdcs in tbi patients, and although recent results showed controversial data regarding the effects of tdcs in such patients, we will address specifically patients with ppcs and mtbi and no brain abnormalities on ct scan other than subarachnoid hemorrhage. moreover, due to the missing information on literature regarding the best brain region to be studied, we will evaluate two different regions to find immediate effects of tdcs on memory and executive dysfunction.
smoking_cessation	tobacco smoking was one of the risk factors for upper aerodigestive tract cancer, but exclusive quantification of the impact of cigarette smoking on laryngeal cancer had not been investigated. a meta-analysis of researches that had reported quantitative estimates of cigarette smoking and risk of laryngeal cancer by march 2016 was performed. pooled estimates of relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals were obtained and summarized. sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were implemented to find out sources of research heterogeneity and the effect of potential confounders. publication bias was investigated and corrected if found to be present through egger 's and begg 's test, and trim and fill algorithm. thirty researches based on a total of 14,292 cases from three cohort and fifteen case-control studies were included and pooled estimate for the correlation between cigarette smoking and the risk of laryngeal cancer was 7.01 (95% confidence interval 5.56-8.85), with moderate heterogeneity across the researches (i (2) = 56.7%, p = 0.002). the rrs were 5.04 (95% ci 3.09-8.22) for cohort studies (p = 0.121), 7.59 (95% ci 5.86-9.82) for case-control studies (p = 0.005). the risk kept elevated within the first fifteen years of quitting smoking(rr 3.62, 95% ci 1.88-7.00) but dropped in the 16 years and more after smoking cessation(rr 1.88, 95% ci 1.16-3.05). individuals who smoked with 40 or more pack-years had nine times the risk of laryngeal cancer(rr 9.14; 95% ci 6.24-13.39). subjects who smoked 30 or more cigarettes a day had sevenfolds the risk of laryngeal cancer (rr 7.02; 95% ci 4.47-11.02) and who smoked 40 or more years had five times the risk versus never smokers (rr 5.76; 95% ci 3.69-8.99). evidence of publication bias was not detected for the correlation between current cigarette smoking and risk of laryngeal cancer (p = 0.225 with begg 's test, p = 0.317 with egger 's test). the results demonstrated strong correlation referring to dose-response and time-response between cigarette smoking and risk of laryngeal cancer for both men and women. the probability of developing laryngeal cancer was decreased by quitting smoking, particularly among former cigarette smokers who had stopped smoking for 15 or more years. the subgroup analysis demonstrated that study type influenced the rrs estimates of the studies.
rheumatoid_arthritis	the study was aimed at identification by proteomics and validation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) of potential urinary biomarkers for lupus nephritis. study subjects comprised 88 systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) patients and 60 controls (rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus and healthy individuals). based on the sle disease activity index (sledai), patients were classified as active renal (ar), active non-renal (anr) or inactive disease (id). urinary proteins from a group of patients with ar or id were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms/ms). the selected biomarkers were validated by elisa using samples from all patients and controls. ar patients were followed-up for 12 months after start of therapy. three urinary proteins, alpha-1 anti-chymotrypsin (act), haptoglobin (hap) and retinol binding protein (rbp), were detected in patients with ar and not id. upon validation, act levels were higher in ar patients than the other groups (p < 0001) and showed good correlation with renal sledai (r=0577, p < 0001) as well as sledai (r=0461, p10-fold higher in ar than other groups (p < 0001) and correlated well with renal sledai (r=0594, p < 0001) and sledai (r=0371, p < 001). rbp levels were also higher in ar patients than in other groups (p < 005), except diabetes, and showed moderate correlation with renal sledai (r=0284, p < 0008) and sledai (r=0316, p < 0003). upon follow-up with treatment, levels of all three proteins declined at 6 and 12 months (p < 001). multiple logistic regression identified act as the best marker to differentiate ar from anr. urinary hap, act and rbp are potential biomarkers for lupus nephritis activity.
crohn's_disease	background fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) represents a new therapeutic option that has been studied in two randomized-controlled trials in ulcerative colitis patients. our study aimed to identify patients' views on the use of this novel therapeutic approach. methods using an anonymous questionnaire, we obtained data from 574 inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients on their knowledge and willingness to undergo fmt. results a large proportion of ibd patients (53.5%) are unaware that fmt is a therapeutic option in clostridium difficile infection and potentially ibd. more responders preferred fmt (31.5%) to a study with a new medication (28.9%), although the difference was not significant (p = 0.37), and the preferred way of transplantation was colonoscopy (49.7%). in all, 38.3% preferred a family member as a donor, but there was fear about the procedure (41.5% mentioned fear of infectious diseases, 26.5% expressed disgust). the knowledge of successful fmt treatment in other patients was important for 82.2% of responders and for 50.7%, a discussion with a specialist would likely change their opinion about fmt. conclusion fmt represents a therapeutic procedure that is of interest for ibd patients. as fmt has been receiving increasing interest as an alternative treatment in ibd and more studies on fmt in ibd are being carried out, it is important to learn about the knowledge, attitude, and preferences of patients to provide better education to patients on this topic. however, there are reservations because of the fact that data on the benefits of fmt in ibd are controversial and several limitations exist on the use of fmt in ibd. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
atrial_fibrillation	study design. a retrospective cohort study at a single institution. objective. to determine the effect of preoperative depression on hospital consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems (hcahps) survey scores in a lumbar fusion population. summary of background data. hcahps surveys are used to assess the quality of the patient experience, and directly influences reimbursement for hospital systems and spine surgeons nationwide. untreated depression has been linked to worse functional outcomes in spine surgery. we, however, aimed to elucidate whether hcahps survey responses were different in depressed patients. methods. prospectively collected functional outcome data including patient health questionnaire 9, euroqol five dimensions, and pain disability questionnaire were analyzed preoperatively. preoperative patient health questionnaire 9 scores of greater than or equal to 10 (moderate to severe depression) defined our depressed cohort of patients. hcahps responses were obtained for each individual, allowing for real-world analysis of outcomes in this population. results. in our 237 patient cohort, depressed patients were younger, female; were on full disability; and had lower scores on euroqol five dimensions and pain disability questionnaire preoperatively. approximately 73.2% of depressed patients felt doctors treated them with respect, compared to 88.8% of patients without depression (p = 0.005). also, depressed patients felt nurses treated them with less respect (p = 0.014) and that physicians did not listen to them as carefully (p = 0.029). multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients with preoperative depression had higher odds of patients feeling less respected by both physicians and nurses. multivariate analysis also revealed that depression was an independent predictor of lower patient satisfaction with nursing response to their needs. conclusion. in patients undergoing lumbar fusion, preoperative depression was shown to have negative effect on patient experience measured by the hcahps survey. these results suggest that depression may be a modifiable risk factor for poor hospital experience.
asthma	backgroundpeanut allergy in children is often associated with allergies to tree nuts and/or legumes. the aim of this study was to analyze in cluster a cohort of children allergic to peanuts and assessed for cross-reactivity to nuts and legumes and to identify different phenotypes. methodswe included retrospectively 317 children with peanut allergy evaluated at the allergy unit of the saint vincent hospital of lille in the last 12 years. a complete workup for peanut allergy and nuts and legumes was carried out for each patient. a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method was used to search for clusters of individuals in the evaluated cohort. resultscross-allergy to tn and/or other legumes was identified in 137 patients (43.2%), atopic dermatitis being a major risk factor (adjusted or = 16 [95% ci: 7.4-37]; p < 0.001). three phenotypes emerged from cluster analysis. cluster 1 (72 patients) is characterized by high level of rara h 2, low threshold reactive doses for peanut and high proportion of asthma; cluster 2 (93 patients) is characterized by high threshold reactive doses for peanut and the lowest proportion of cross-allergy to tn and/or legumes; cluster 3 (152 patients) has a high risk of cross-allergy to tn and/or legumes and most patients suffer from eczema. conclusionsthe three phenotypes highlighted by this study could be useful to identify children with high risk of cross-allergic reaction to tns and legumes early after pa diagnosis.
children's_health	this essay explores the social processes surrounding the creation of knowledge about children 's medicine in early modern england. looking first at printed volumes on children 's health by male authors, the essay shows that the men who were the first to print texts about children 's medicine recommended, replicated and authorized women 's knowledge in the field, even as they also constructed women as subordinate observers. the essay then takes up the question of how women constructed authority for themselves in domestic medicine by looking at the affinities of women 's knowledge practices with learned medicine, particularly their investment in observation and proof. the essay concludes with an examination of rickets, which exemplifies the key role of women in knowledge formation around children 's diseases. it shows how women 's experiential knowledge and domestic practices provided a largely unacknowledged influence on one of the first learned texts on rickets, a treatise of the rickets (1651).
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	previous studies have reported that patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occasionally develop lung cancer (lc). however, in connective tissue disease (ctd)-related interstitial lung disease (ild), there are few data regarding the lc development. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of lc development in patients with ctd-ild. a retrospective review of our database of 562 patients with ild between 2000 and 2014 identified 127 patients diagnosed with ctd-ild. the overall and cumulative incidences of lc were calculated. in addition, the risk factors and prognostic impact of lc development were evaluated. the median age at the ild diagnosis was 63 years (range 37-84 years), and 73 patients (57.5%) were female. the median follow-up period from the ild diagnosis was 67.4 months (range 10.4-322.1 months). during the period, 7 out of the 127 patients developed lc (overall incidence 5.5%). the cumulative incidences at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.0%, 1.8%, and 2.9%, respectively. the risk of lc development was significantly higher in patients with higher smoking pack-year (odds ratio [or] 1.028; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.008-1.049; p=0.007) and emphysema on chest high-resolution computed tomography (or 14.667; 95% ci 2.871-74.926; p=0.001). the median overall survival time after developing lc was 7.0 months (95% ci 4.9-9.1 months), and the most common cause of death was lc, not ild. according to the cox proportional hazard model analysis with time-dependent covariates, patients who developed lc showed significantly poorer prognosis than those who did not (hazard ratio 87.86; 95% ci 19.56-394.67; p<0.001). in ctd-ild, clinicians should be careful with the risk of lc development in patients with a heavy smoking history and subsequent emphysema. although not so frequent, the complication could be a poor prognostic determinant.
hereditary_angioedema	background: angioedema is a condition that can cause cutaneous and mucosal edema of practically any part of the body. isolated edema of the intestines is a rather rare manifestation, but it can cause important morbidity. hereditary angioedema as well as certain medications can give rise to intestinal angioedema. we have seen a rise in frequency of intestinal angioedema since the advent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. ultrasound of the abdomen is an inexpensive, safe, and easy tool that can help in the differential diagnosis. case report: we describe the case of a 25-year-old woman who presented with acute abdominal pain. she was diagnosed with intestinal angioedema due to hereditary angioedema type i. why should an emergency physician be aware of this?: misdiagnosis can lead to administering the wrong treatment or even unnecessary surgical interventions. intestinal angioedema is best treated with purified c1-inhibitor, icatibant, or ecallantide. fresh frozen plasma is to be avoided because it carries the risk of worsening the symptoms.

osteoporosis	objective: to identify a genetic basis for markedly reduced bone density and multiple fractures in an adult patient with hypophosphatemia and hypercalciuria. subjects: a 54-year-old vietnamese man, his unaffected two daughters and wife. methods: we performed biochemical studies and sequenced the slc34a3 gene using genomic dna from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. results: biochemical evaluation of the proband revealed hypophosphatemia with increased renal phosphate wasting, hypercalciuria, low serum parathyroid hormone (fth) and an elevated serum 1,25(oh)2d level. mutation analysis of slc34a3 gene revealed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for two nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions: a novel c.571g >a (p.g191s) damaging mutation and the previously reported c.200g>a (p.r67h) polymorphism, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of late-onset hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (hhrh). his wife and older daughter both carried the p.r67h polymorphism, while his younger daughter was compound heterozygous for p.r67h and p.g191s. conclusions: hhrh is an uncommon autosomal recessive disease that generally manifests in childhood as rickets or nephrolithiasis, but an adult onset phenotype may occur in heterozygous carriers of slc34a3 mutations. the severe presentation of this proband in adulthood with marked nephrolithiasis, multiple fractures and low bone density emphasizes the importance of measuring the serum phosphorus level in patients with suspected but unexplained osteoporosis and/or recurrent renal stones. the recognition of late-onset hhrh facilitates timely institution of appropriate therapy.

atopic_dermatitis	the aim of this article is to study t-helper (th) cell differentiation in the progression of acute, subacute, and chronic atopic dermatitis. skin biopsies from 48 patients with acute, subacute, and chronic atopic dermatitis were studied using immunohistochemistry with antibodies to tarc/ccl17, ctack/ccl27, and rantes/ccl5. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied in 17 patients using flow cytometry to measure the content of th1/th2 cells and th17/treg cells. levels of interferon (ifn)-gamma, interleukin (il)-4, il-17a, and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta 1 were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). distinctive expressions of t-cell-specific chemokines tarc/ccl17, ctack/ccl27, and rantes/ccl5 were observed at different stages of atopic dermatitis, which were consistent with the differentiation of the th cell subsets, th2/th1, and th17/treg. th2 and th17 were acute-phase subsets, while th1 and treg were chronic-phase subsets. at an early stage of atopic dermatitis, th17 and th2 cells were found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by th1 cells, treg cells, and eosinophils; in late-stage or subacute and chronic atopic dermatitis, th17 and th2 cell numbers decreased. the levels of the ifn-gamma and tgf-beta 1 increased during the progression of atopic dermatitis from acute to chronic forms. the levels of il-17a and il-4 decreased during the progression of atopic dermatitis from acute to chronic forms. the differentiation of th subsets at distinct phases in atopic dermatitis may form the basis for further studies on the classification or control of this increasingly common clinical condition.
kidney_health	news media raise public awareness about health and can influence public policy agenda. recently, nephrologists have sought to make prevention and early detection of chronic kidney disease (ckd) a health care priority. we assessed the extent and manner in which australian television news and newspapers cover ckd prevention or early detection. electronic news databases for print media and television programs were searched (may 2005 to march 2007) for items referring to ckd prevention or early detection. we analyzed all relevant items for spokes people, main news frame, focus of responsibility, proposed solutions, and trigger/reason for publication. of 2,439 newspaper articles and 10,430 television broadcasts retrieved, only 214 articles (8.77%) and 7 broadcasts (0.06%) were eligible. kidney transplantation dominated ckd-related news. lay person or high-profile advocates were virtually absent. risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality conferred by ckd were not emphasized by news reports; instead, ckd received peripheral mention as a secondary consequence of diabetes or obesity. few reports cited the economic consequences of ckd. the media focused on lifestyle causes and solutions, whereas nonlifestyle causes and screening and prevention strategies were rarely mentioned. kidney health professionals need to actively engage with the media in efforts to amplify desired messages on ckd prevention or early detection. medical journals, research institutions, universities, hospitals, and advocacy groups should issue press releases that highlight newsworthy aspects of this topic. extending news media coverage can help exert an influence on health policies and agenda setting and increase public awareness to improve prevention and early detection of ckd.
dementia	objective: to examine how the duration of time delay between wechsler memory scale (wms) logical memory i and logical memory ii (lm) affected participants' recall performance. method: there are 46,146 total logical memory administrations to participants diagnosed with either alzheimer 's disease (ad), vascular dementia (vad), or normal cognition in the national alzheimer 's disease coordinating center 's uniform data set. results: only 50% of the sample was administered the standard 20-35 min of delay as specified by wms-r and wms-iii. we found a significant effect of delay time duration on proportion of information retained for the vad group compared to its control group, which remained after adding lmi raw score as a covariate. there was poorer retention of information with longer delay for this group. this association was not as strong for the ad and cognitively normal groups. a 24.5-min delay was most optimal for differentiating ad from vad participants (47.7% classification accuracy), an 18.5-min delay was most optimal for differentiating ad versus normal participants (51.7% classification accuracy), and a 22.5-min delay was most optimal for differentiating vad versus normal participants (52.9% classification accuracy). conclusions: considering diagnostic implications, our findings suggest that test administration should incorporate precise tracking of delay periods. we recommend a 20-min delay with 18-25-min range. poor classification accuracy based on lm data alone is a reminder that story memory performance is only one piece of data that contributes to complex clinical decisions. however, strict adherence to the recommended range yields optimal data for diagnostic decisions.
crohn's_disease	focal small bowel lesions present a diagnostic challenge for both the radiologist and gastroenterologist. both the detection and characterization of small bowel masses have greatly improved with the advent of multidetector ct enterography (md-cte). as such, md-cte is increasingly utilized in the workup of occult gastrointestinal bleeding. in this article, we review the spectrum of focal small bowel masses with pathologic correlation. adenocarcinoma, the most common primary small bowel malignancy, presents as a focal irregular mass occasionally with circumferential extension leading to obstruction. small bowel carcinoid tumors most commonly arise in the ileum and are characterized by avid enhancement and marked desmoplastic response of metastatic lesions. aneurysmal dilatation of small bowel is pathognomonic for lymphoma and secondary findings of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly should be sought. benign small bowel masses such as leiomyoma and adenoma may be responsible for occult gastrointestinal bleeding. however, primary vascular lesions of the small bowel remain the most common cause for occult small bowel gastrointestinal bleeding. the arterial phase of contrast obtained with cte aids in recognition of the vascular nature of these lesions. systemic conditions such as peutz-jeghers syndrome and crohn 's disease may be suggested by the presence of multiple small bowel lesions. lastly, potential pitfalls such as ingested material should be considered when faced with focal small bowel masses.
ankylosing_spondylitis	anti-inf-alpha therapies are used in the treatment of different inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, paradoxical effects may occur during treatment. in other words, these drugs can induce or unmask diseases similar to those they were intended to treat. etanercept is the main anti-inf-alpha agent associated with the development of paradoxical ibd; this drug, moreover, has no proven usefulness in the treatment of the disease. this association, which is not coincidental and meets the criteria for a temporal causal association, is infrequent and is seen particularly in patients with spondyloarthritis. restarting treatment with etanercept may induce new intestinal symptoms. there are no endoscopic, histopathologic or clinical differences between primary and secondary ibd, and both are diagnosed in the same way. the most frequent presentation is crohn disease. when a paradoxical event occurs, etanercept is usually replaced with infliximab, which has not been associated with disease recurrence.

stress_management	this article describes and evaluates initial steps of a gender-sensitive, youth-friendly group intervention model designed for teenage girls and young women who experience stress-related or psychosomatic problems. fifty-four young women (16-25 years of age) participated in a gender-sensitive physiotherapy stress management course at a youth health center. inclusion criteria were self-defined stress-related problems and a wish to participate in the group intervention. measurements of aspects of body perception, self-image, multiple somatic problems, and mental health symptom areas were assessed both before and after intervention with the body perception questionnaire ad modum schioler, social analysis of social behavior, and adult self-report scale. significant positive changes were found in aspects of body perception, self-image, and mental health and somatic symptoms. the changes were most significant in lower internalization of anxiety and depression symptoms. symptoms such as headaches and sleeping problems decreased. participants were more satisfied with their bodies and more able to listen to body signals. among cognitive issues, significant change occurred in thought problems, but not in attention problems. the intervention model needs further evaluation in controlled trials, but is promising and should be developed further in other physiotherapy settings and subgroups of young people.
healthy_sleep	study objectives: many sleep disorders are characterized by increased motor activity during sleep. in contrast, studies on motor activity during physiological sleep are largely lacking. we quantitatively investigated a large range of motor phenomena during polysomnography in physiological sleep. design: prospective polysomnographic investigation. setting: academic referral sleep laboratory. participants: one hundred healthy sleepers age 19-77 y were strictly selected from a representative population sample by a two-step screening procedure. interventions: n/a. measurements and results: polysomnography according to american academy of sleep medicine (aasm) standards was performed, and quantitative normative values were established for periodic limb movements in sleep (plms), high frequency leg movements (hflm), fragmentary myoclonus (fm), neck myoclonus (nm), and rapid eye movement (rem)-related electromyographic (emg) activity. thirty-six subjects had a plms index >5/h, 18 had a plms index >15/h (90th percentile: 24.8/h). thirty-three subjects had hflm (90th percentile: four sequences/night). all subjects had fm (90th percentile 143.7/h sleep). nine subjects fulfilled aasm criteria for excessive fm. thirty-five subjects had nm (90th percentile: 8.8/h rem sleep). for rem sleep, different emg activity measures for the mentalis and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles were calculated: the 90th percentile for phasic mentalis emg activity for 30-sec epochs according to aasm recommendation was 15.6%, and for tonic mentalis emg activity 2.6%. twenty-five subjects exceeded the recently proposed phasic mentalis cutoff of 11%. none of the subjects exceeded the tonic mentalis cutoff of 9.6%. conclusion: quantification of motor phenomena is a basic prerequisite to develop normative values, and is a first step toward a more precise description of the various motor phenomena present during sleep. because rates of motor events were unexpectedly high even in physiological sleep, the future use of normative values for both research and clinical routine is essential.
addiction	background: cannabis will soon become legalized in canada, and it is currently unclear how this will impact public health. methadone maintenance treatment (mmt) is the most common pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder (oud), and despite its documented effectiveness, a large number of patients respond poorly and experience relapse to illicit opioids. some studies implicate cannabis use as a risk factor for poor mmt response. although it is well established that substance-use behaviors differ by sex, few of these studies have considered sex as a potential moderator. the current study aims to investigate sex differences in the association between cannabis use and illicit opioid use in a cohort of mmt patients. methods: this multicentre study recruited participants on mmt for oud from canadian addiction treatment centre sites in ontario, canada. sex differences in the association between any cannabis use and illicit opioid use were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. a secondary analysis was conducted to investigate the association with heaviness of cannabis use. results: the study included 414 men and 363 women with oud receiving mmt. cannabis use was significantly associated with illicit opioid use in women only (or = 1.82, 95% ci 1.18, 2.82, p = 0.007). heaviness of cannabis use was not associated with illicit opioid use in men or women. conclusions: this is the largest study to date examining the association between cannabis use and illicit opioid use. cannabis use may be a sex-specific predictor of poor response to mmt, such that women are more likely to use illicit opioids if they also use cannabis during treatment. women may show improved treatment outcomes if cannabis use is addressed during mmt.
crohn's_disease	purpose of review this review provides an update on the new interleukin-1 (il-1) cytokine family members in inflammatory diseases with focus on recent findings concerning the family members il-36, il-37, and il-38 and their different expression patterns. recent findings the il-1 cytokines are known to be involved in many different inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. the latest il-1 family members, il-36, il-37, and il-38 have been shown to be differently regulated during course of disease. studies of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases revealed that those cytokines are upregulated in the serum as well as in inflamed tissue. both, epithelial cells and infiltrating peripheral mononuclear blood cells serve as source of the cytokines il-36, il-37, and il-38 triggering different outcomes. these results could be confirmed in different mouse models and in-vitro and ex-vivo studies. summary il-36, il-37, and il-38 are involved in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory diseases psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus as well as crohn 's disease. thereby il-36 acts proinflammatory triggering further inflammatory mediators. in contrast, il-37 and il-38 are upregulated to counteract. understanding the imbalance of the il-1 family is crucial for future therapeutics.
atrial_fibrillation	catheter radiofrequency ablation (rfa) is an effective treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (af). it has been demonstrated that the multielectrode pulmonary vein ablation catheter (pvac) has favourable outcomes at 6-12 months post-ablation, but there are only few studies with a long-term follow-up. we retrospectively reviewed 77 consecutive pvac procedures in our centre, from november 2007 to december 2012. rfa was attempted in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal af (mean age 58.7 +/- 9.8 years, 50 men (64.9 %). the ablation strategy consisted of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (cpvi) with the pvac system. a questionnaire was used over the follow-up period to assess the efficacy of af ablation. success was defined as freedom from af/atrial flutter or atrial arrhythmia for a period ranging from 3 to 12 months or more. seventy-seven patients were included with paroxysmal af. the mean duration of the procedure was 99.6 +/- 26 min and fluoroscopy time 19.4 +/- 6.8 min. time of rfa was 22.4 +/- 5.8 min. acute complication rate was 10.4 % (the most frequent was vascular injury for 6 patients 7.8 %, 1 patient presented sepsis (1.3 %), 1 patient presented transient ischemic stroke). after a single procedure at a mean fu of 55 +/- 11 months, 54/77 (70.1 %) patients were free of symptomatic af. these long-term results suggest that pvac is an efficient system for cpvi of symptomatic paroxysmal af.
addiction	background more than 200 opiate overdose deaths occur annually in ireland. overdose prevention and management, including naloxone prescription, should be a priority for healthcare services. naloxone is an effective overdose treatment and is now being considered for wider lay use. aim to establish gps' views and experiences of opiate addiction, overdose care, and naloxone provision. design and setting an anonymous postal survey to gps affiliated with the department of academic general practice, university college dublin, ireland. method a total of 714 gps were invited to complete an anonymous postal survey. results were compared with a parallel gp trainee survey. results a total of 448/714 (62.7%) gps responded. approximately one-third of gps were based in urban, rural, and mixed areas. over 75% of gps who responded had patients who used illicit opiates, and 25% prescribed methadone. two-thirds of gps were in favour of increased naloxone availability in the community; almost one-third would take part in such a scheme. a higher proportion of gp trainees had used naloxone to treat opiate overdose than qualified gps. in addition, a higher proportion of gp trainees were willing to be involved in naloxone distribution than qualified gps. intranasal naloxone was much preferred to single (p<0.001) or multiple dose (p<0.001) intramuscular naloxone. few gps objected to wider naloxone availability, with 66.1% (n = 292) being in favour. conclusion gps report extensive contact with people who have opiate use disorders but provide limited opiate agonist treatment. they support wider availability of naloxone and would participate in its expansion. development and evaluation of an implementation strategy to support gp-based distribution is urgently needed.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: sexual assaults against women are a global health crisis, with alarmingly high rates in south africa. however, we know very little about the circumstances and the aftermath of these experiences. further, there is limited information about how factors specific to the rape (e.g., fighting back) versus those that are specific to the individual-and potentially modifiable-influence mental health outcomes. this study examined how situational characteristics of rape as well as individual and situational factors confer risk for symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and dysfunctional sexual behavior at 12-month follow-up. method: two hundred nine (n = 209) south african women were recruited from rural rape clinics in the limpopo province (lp) and north west province (nwp) of south africa. interviews were conducted at baseline (within 6 months of the rape incident) and at 6 and 12 months by trained staff at the clinics in english or the women 's native languages. women were interviewed after services were provided in a private room. results: one hundred thirty-two (n = 132) women were lost to follow-up at 12 months, resulting in 77 women with interview data for all time points. undermining by the survivor 's social support system and an increased belief in myths about rape were associated with increased dysfunctional sexual practices and symptoms of depression. conclusions: these findings demonstrate the need for interventions that address the most pervasive effects of rape over time. these behaviors can increase risks for revictimization and reduce psychological well-being in the aftermath of rape.
autism	this study aimed to describe rates of antipsychotic medication use and the association between their use and demographics, clinical variables, and the use of behavioral/education services among children with asd. for children with asd ages 2-11 (n = 4749) and those 12-17 (n = 401), 5.4 and 17.7% were prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic medication respectively. in the multivariable model of young children, older age, use of multiple psychotropic medications, prior asd diagnosis, non-white hispanic race/ethnicity, and oppositional defiant problems were associated with antipsychotic use. among older children, only older age was associated with antipsychotic use. in at least one age group, antipsychotic medication use was also related to behaviour, family and occupational therapy, public insurance, site region, externalizing problems, body mass index, and sleep and gastrointestinal problems.
atrial_fibrillation	purpose to determine the characteristics of eyes with late in-the-bag dislocation of an intraocular lens (iol) after pars plana vitrectomy (ppv). methods fourteen eyes of 14 patients with a dislocated iol after ppv were studied retrospectively. the data collected from the medical charts included the age, sex, history of eye diseases, axial length, and interval from ppv to time of iol dislocation. the surgical procedures used during the ppv were also recorded. results seven eyes had undergone ppv for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; 6 eyes, for proliferative diabetic retinopathy; and 1 eye, for retinal vein occlusion. the average interval between the ppv and the diagnosis of the dislocated iol was 6.2 years (range 2.3-10.1 years). in all eyes, the peripheral vitreous was thoroughly removed with scleral depression during the ppv. conclusions the iol dislocation was most likely caused by damage to the zonular fibers by the peripheral vitrectomy with scleral depression.
kidney_health	background: folate, vitamin b-12, and homocysteine concentrations during pregnancy are important factors for early development and may persistently influence kidney function in the offspring. we examined the associations of folate, vitamin b-12, and homocysteine concentrations during pregnancy with kidney outcomes, in school-aged children. study design: population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life onward. settings & participants: this study was performed among 4,226 pregnant women and their children. predictors: folate, vitamin b-12, and homocysteine blood concentrations measured in early pregnancy (median gestational age, 13.2 [iqr, 12.2-14.8] weeks) and at birth (cord blood). outcomes & measurements: at the median age of 6.0 (iqr, 5.9-6.3) years, we measured combined kidney volume with ultrasound, estimated glomerular filtration rate based on creatinine (egfr(cr)) and cystatin c (egfr(cys)) concentrations, and microalbuminuria. results: we observed that higher maternal folate concentrations were associated with larger childhood combined kidney volume, whereas higher maternal vitamin b-12 concentrations were associated with higher childhood egfr(cys) (p for both <0.05). these associations were independent of homocysteine concentrations. higher maternal homocysteine concentrations were associated with smaller combined kidney volume and lower childhood egfr(cys) (p for both < 0.05). the association of maternal homocysteine concentrations with childhood egfr(cys) was largely explained by combined kidney volume. higher cord blood homocysteine concentrations were associated with larger combined kidney volume and lower egfr(cys) (p for both < 0.05). folate, vitamin b-12, or homocysteine concentrations were not associated with microalbuminuria. limitations: observational study, so causality cannot be established. conclusions: our findings suggest that folate, vitamin b-12, and homocysteine concentrations during fetal life are associated with offspring kidney development. however, effect sizes are small. further studies to replicate these findings and assess the causality and consequences for kidney health in later life are needed.

children's_health	early childhood experience is a social determinant of children 's health and well-being. the well-being of young children is founded on their relationships and interactions with parents and family members in the home, caregivers, and teachers in early education, and friends and families in the greater community. unfortunately, the early language experience of infants and toddlers from low-income families is typically vastly different than children from middle- and higher-income families. hart and risley (meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young american children. brookes, baltimore, 1995) described a ""30 million word gap"" experienced by age four for children from poor families compared to economically advantaged families as measured by the number of words delivered by adults in the home to their children. this discrepancy between groups is associated with a deficit in vocabulary growth over time (hart and risley in meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young american children. brookes, baltimore, 1995; in the social world of children learning to talk. brookes, baltimore, md, 1999; in am educ (spring), 1-9. , 2003), and readiness when they enter preschool and kindergarten compared to their more advantaged classmates. the purpose of this paper is to conceptualize a population-level public health prevention approach to research addressing the harmful impacts of the word gap. the approach includes use of evidence-based practices to improve children 's language environments to foster their early language and literacy learning in early childhood. after a brief review of the word gap, we discuss four aspects: a conceptual framework, a community leadership team as driver of the local intervention, evidence-based language interventions for reducing the gap and promoting child language, and the measurements needed. implications are discussed.
autism	improved outcomes for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) have opened a range of potential pathways during the transition to adulthood. these include attending college, entering the labor force, and achieving a degree of independent living. less cognitively able individuals may be eligible for state benefits and may enter supported employment programs. those attending college require careful support and planning. practitioners need to be familiar with the unique needs of young adults with asd. further research should attempt to define the priorities of individuals and families with asd making this transition and clarify the value of existing supports and interventions.
rheumatoid_arthritis	the purposes of this study were to evaluate the psychometric properties, reliability, and validity of the chinese-version glover-nilsson smoking behavioral questionnaire (gn-sbq-c) and assess the behavioral nicotine dependence among community-dwelling adult smokers in taiwan. the methods used were survey design, administration, and validation. a total of 202 adult smokers completed a survey to assess behavioral dependence, nicotine dependence, depression, social support, and demographic and smoking characteristics. data analysis included descriptive statistics, internal consistency reliability, t test, exploratory factor analysis, independent t test, and pearson product moment correlation. the results showed that (1) the gn-sbq-c has good internal consistency reliability and stability (2-week test-retest reliability); (2) the extracted one factor explained 41.80 % of the variance, indicating construct validity; (3) the scale has acceptable concurrent validity, with significant positive correlation between the gn-sbq-c and nicotine dependence, depression, and time smoking and negative correlation between the gn-sbq-c and age and exercise habit; and (4) the instrument has discriminant validity, supported by significant differences between those with high and low-to-moderate nicotine dependence, smokers greater than 43 years old and those 43 years old and younger, and those who smoked 10 years or less and those smoking more than 10 years. the 11-item gn-sbq-c has satisfactory psychometric properties when applied in a sample of taiwanese adult smokers. the scale is feasible and valid to use to assess smoking behavioral dependence.
osteoarthritis	in the present study, we investigated the role of nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (nlrp6) in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and explored the underlying mechanism. we found that both mrna and protein levels of nlrp6 are attenuated in synovial tissues and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (fls) of ra patients compared to patients with osteoarthritis. we also observed that pro-inflammatory cytokine production is decreased and nuclear factor-kappa b activation is inhibited in nlrp6-overexpressing ra-fls. furthermore, we found that nlrp6 overexpression promotes transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1-binding protein 2/3 lysosome-dependent degradation, and we provide evidence showing that nlrp6 plays the role of providing the docking site to facilitate the interaction between transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1-binding protein 2/3 and tripartite motif 38 in ra-fls.
crohn's_disease	diverticular disease of the small intestine is rare, especially when it is located in the jejunum. it is generally asymptomatic, but in some patients it may have complications such as acute diverticulitis with peritonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction. in such cases, the recommended treatment is surgery. we report a 77-year-old patient with ileal crohn 's disease with a long-standing inflammatory phenotype, who developed acute diverticulitis of the jejunum presenting a severe septic shock and secondary multiple-organ failure. it resolved with medical treatment and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
addiction	background: variation in the cyp2a6 gene alters the rate of nicotine metabolic inactivation and is associated with smoking behaviors and cessation success rates. the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this genetic influence are unknown. methods: intrinsic functional connectivity strength, a whole- brain, data- driven, graph theory- based method, was applied to resting- state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in 66 smokers and 92 nonsmokers. a subset of subjects (n = 23/ 20; smokers/ nonsmokers) performed the monetary incentive delay task, probing reward anticipation, and a go/no-go task, probing response inhibition, on two occasions, in the presence and absence of a nicotine patch. results: a significant cyp2a6 genotype 3 smoking effect was found in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum, such that the normal (vs. slow) genotype individuals showed greater functional connectivity strength among smokers but not nonsmokers. functional connectivity strength was negatively associated with severity of nicotine dependence in slow metabolizers. both hubs were biased by inputs from the insula identified from seed-based connectivity. similar gene 3 environment interactions were seen in ventral striatum during smoking abstinence when subjects performed the monetary incentive delay task and in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex when they performed the go/no-go task; both reductions were "" normalized"" in smokers (and increased in nonsmokers) after acute nicotine administration. conclusions: because the cyp2a6 effect was seen only in smokers, these data suggest that the rate of nicotine metabolism- and thus the concentration of nicotine presented to the brain over the course of nicotine addiction-shapes brain circuits that, among other functions, compute reward and impulsivity processes.
atrial_fibrillation	background: postoperative atrial arrhythmias (aas) are common after lung transplantation, but studies are mixed regarding their impact on outcomes. we therefore performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether aas after lung transplantation impede postoperative recovery. methods: medline, embase, cinahl, and the cochrane register were searched to identify studies comparing outcomes in adult patients undergoing lung transplantation who experienced postoperative aas in the immediate postoperative period vs those without postoperative aas. our primary outcome was perioperative mortality, and secondary outcomes were length of stay (los), postoperative complications, and mid-term (1-6 years) mortality. results: nine studies including 2653 patients were included in this analysis. of this group, 791 (29.8%) had postoperative aas. patients with postoperative aas had significantly higher perioperative (or 2.70 [95% ci: 1.73-4.19], p<.0001) mortality, longer hospital los (md 8.29 [95% ci: 4.37-12.21] days, p<.0001), more frequent requirement for tracheostomy (or 4.67 [95% ci: 2.59-8.44], p<.0001), and higher mid-term mortality (or 1.71 [95% ci: 1.28-2.30], p=.0003). conclusions: aas after lung transplantation are frequent and associated with significantly higher mortality, longer hospital los, and requirement for tracheostomy. given their impact on recovery, prophylactic strategies against aas need to be developed.
medicare	study design. a cross-sectional observational study utilizing the national ambulatory and national hospital ambulatory medical care surveys between 1997 and 2010. objective. the aim of this study was to characterize national physical therapy (pt) referral trends during primary care provider (pcp) visits in the united states. summary of background data. despite guidelines recommending pt for the initial management of low back pain (lbp), national pt referral rates remain low. methods. race, ethnicity, age, payer type, and pt referral rates were collected for patients aged 16 to 90 years who were visiting their pcps. associations among demographic variables and pt referral were determined using logistic regression. results. between 1997 and 2010, we estimated 170 million visits for lbp leading to 17.1 million pt referrals. average proportion of pcp visits associated with pt referrals remained stable at about 10.1% [ odds ratio (or) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% ci) 0.96-1.04)], despite our prior finding of increasing number of visits associated with opioid prescriptions in the same timeframe. lower pt referral rates were observed among visits by patients who were insured by medicaid (or 0.48, 95% ci 0.33-0.69) and medicare (or 0.50, 95% ci 0.35-0.72). furthermore, visits not associated with pt referrals were more likely to be associated with opioid prescriptions (or 1.69, 95% ci 1.22-2.35). conclusion. although therapies delivered by pts are promoted as a first-line treatment for lbp, pt referral rates remain low. there also exist disparately lower referral rates in populations with more restrictive health plans and simultaneous opioid prescription. our findings provide a broad overview to pt prescription trend and isolate concerning associations requiring further explorations.
children's_health	the paper presents the findings of the latest stage of a prospective medical-and-sociological monitoring of cohorts of families; its goal is to trace the development of child health. the monitoring is carried out in the vologda oblast by the institute of sodo-economic development of territories of the russian academy of sciences since 1995 and receives support from the department of health care of the vologda oblast. the monitoring shows real-time dynamics of children 's health and development and reflects the dependence of these changes on the factors that influence them. specific examples show how factors such as parents' lifestyle, the environment in which children are brought up, financial welfare, medical and other health-related activities, diet and nutrition, housing and environmental conditions influence children 's health. over the past 20 years, the russian federation has undergone fundamental changes that affected the most important aspects of social life: russia 's political and economic structure changed; the country experienced two socio-economic crises and implemented intensive reforms in the key sectors (education, health care, housing-and-utilities sector, and agriculture). changes in the economy have had a significant impact on public health and on children 's health in the first place. on the basis of these studies, the authors show positive trends in the reforms of the economy in general and the social sphere in particular; these trends are reflected in the living conditions of families with children, in the level of health satisfaction, in the state of health of newborns, and in obstetric care statistics. the paper presents major factors contributing to the presence of functional abnormalities in the health of newborns (quality of living conditions in families, income level, health status of the mother, maternal smoking).
hereditary_angioedema	background: despite the availability of guidelines for the specific treatment of hereditary angioedema (hae) attacks, hae morbidity and mortality rates remain substantial. hae attacks are a major medical issue requiring specific treatment as well as a considerable socio-economic burden. we report a protocol designed to test whether a dedicated call centre is more effective than usual practice in the management of patients experiencing an hae attack. methods/design: this prospective, cluster-randomised, single-blind, parallel-group, multicentre trial evaluates the morbidity and consequent socio-economic costs of the management of patients experiencing an hae attack by a dedicated call centre as compared to usual practice. the trial aims to recruit 200 patients. patients in the intervention arm are provided with an sos-hae card with the call centre 's freephone number that they can access in the case of an attack. the centre 's mission is to provide recommended expert advice on early home treatment. the centre can route the call to a local emergency medical service with competency in hae management or even arrange for the drugs needed for the specific treatment of an hae attack to be sent to the emergency department of the local hospital. the primary outcome measure is the number of hospital admissions for an hae attack. each patient will be followed up every 2 months for 2 years. the study has been approved by the ethics committee (comite de protection des personnes d'ile de france 10; registration number: 2012-a00044-39; date of approval: 19 january 2012). discussion: the sos-hae protocol has been designed to address the handling of attacks experienced by patients with hae in the home. the proposed trial will determine whether the setting up of a dedicated call centre is more effective than usual practice in terms of reducing morbidity as given by the numbers of hospital admissions. the results are also anticipated to have important implications in terms of socio-economic costs for both healthcare services and patients.
mental_health	backgroundfriends are important in childhood and adolescence, especially to bullied children. technology mediated communication (tmc) could be used both to develop and maintain friendship. the present study examined (1) trends in the use of tmc with friends between 2001 and 2010; (2) possible differences between bullied and not bullied children and (3) differences between children with few close friends and children with several close friends. methodsdata were obtained from three waves of the serial cross-sectional health behaviour in school-aged children survey conducted in denmark, finland, iceland and sweden during 2001/2002, 2005/2006 and 2009/2010. the total sample consisted of 65953 children aged 11, 13 and 15. resultstwo trends were observed. the first trend showed an increased use of tmc in all countries. children that were not bullied and/or had several close friends had increased their use of tmc with friends from 2001 to 2010. the second trend was applicable only for bullied children with few close friends; they had not as other children increased their use of tmc and thus remained at the same levels as in 2001/2002. conclusionsbullied children with few close friends were excluded from communication forums that usually allow children to maintain and develop friendships. this is a concern because friends are important during childhood and adolescence, especially for bullied children.
atopic_dermatitis	several immunologic mediators-phosphodiesterase (pde), interleukin (il), small molecules, and janus kinase-have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and evidence has shown that blocking these mediators can help modify the disease process. several new topical medications have been developed that target the enzyme pde; crisaborole was recently approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and phase ii studies have been completed on opa-15406. the phase iii clinical trial results of the systemic medication dupilumab, an inhibitor of the il-4 receptor a subunit (which inhibits both il-4 and il-13 signaling), are currently being reviewed by the fda.

autism	background: inappropriate sexual behaviour, sexual problems and sexual victimization in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (asd) is regularly reported in previous research, but little is known about factors associated with these problems, nor about factors associated with a healthy sexuality development in adolescents with asd. investigating the judgement of sexual behaviour can be a first step in acquiring insight into inappropriate sexual behaviour in adolescents with asd. methods: we assessed how 94 cognitively-able adolescents with asd and 94 typically developing (td) adolescents judged the appropriateness of different illustrations of sexual situations and we investigated the differences between the two groups. results: the highest level of agreement between the judgements of adolescents with asd and the judgements of an expert panel was found for severely inappropriate sexual behaviours (89.2%) and the lowest agreement was found for appropriate (31.7%) and slightly inappropriate sexual behaviours (26.1%). no significant differences were found between the judgements of the adolescents with asd and the td adolescents. regarding the divergent judgements, adolescents with and without asd were mostly more strict (i.e., more conservative) than the expert panel in their judgement of sexual situations. finally, a small percentage of adolescents with and without asd showed milder (i.e., less conservative) judgements of sexual situations portraying behaviour that was considered severely inappropriate by an expert panel. conclusions: our findings showed that, overall, judgement of illustrations of sexual situations does not seem to be hampered in adolescents with asd. more research is needed to clarify whether this also holds true for their judgements of - and actions in - more complex real life situations.

autism	changes in cognitive control and timing have both been implicated in adhd. both are involved in building and monitoring expectations about the environment, and altering behavior if those expectations are violated. in adhd, problems with expectations about future events have high face validity, as this would be associated with behavior that is inappropriate only given a certain context, similar to symptoms of the disorder. in this fmri study, we used a timing manipulated go/nogo task to assess brain activity related to expectations about what (cognitive control) and when (timing) events would occur. we hypothesized that problems in building expectations about the environment are a more general, trans-diagnostic characteristic of children with hyperactive, impulsive and inattentive symptoms. to address this, we included children with asd and symptoms of adhd, in addition to children with adhd and typically developing children. we found between-group differences in brain activity related to expectations about when (timing), but not what events will occur (cognitive control). specifically, we found timing-related hypo-activity that was in part unique to children with a primary diagnosis of adhd (left pallidum) and in part shared by children with similar levels of adhd symptoms and a primary diagnosis of asd (left subthalamic nucleus). moreover, we found poorer task performance related to timing, but only in children with asd and symptoms of adhd. ultimately, such neurobiological changes in children with adhd symptoms may relate to a failure to build or monitor expectations and thereby hinder the efficiency of their interaction with the environment.
addiction	background and aims: internet gaming disorder (igd) imposes a potential public health threat worldwide. gaming motives are potentially salient factors of igd, but research on chinese gaming motives is scarce. this study empirically evaluated the psychometric properties of the chinese version of the motives for online gaming questionnaire (c-mogq), the first inventory that measures seven different gaming motives applicable to all type of online games. we also investigated the associations between various gaming motives and igd symptoms among chinese gamers. methods: three hundred and eighty-three chinese adult online gamers (mean age = 23.7 years) voluntarily completed our online, anonymous survey in december 2015. results: the confirmatory factor analysis results supported a bi-factor model with a general factor subsuming all c-mogq items (general motivation) and seven uncorrelated domain-specific factors (escape, coping, fantasy, skill development, recreation, competition, and social). high internal consistencies of the overall scale and subscales were observed. the criterion-related validity of this chinese version was also supported by the positive correlations of c-mogq scale scores with psychological need satisfaction and time spent gaming. furthermore, we found that high general motivation (coupled with high escape motive and low skill development motive) was associated with more igd symptoms reported by our chinese participants. discussion and conclusions: our findings demonstrated the utility of c-mogq in measuring gaming motives of chinese online gamers, and we recommend the consideration of both its total score and subscale scores in future studies.
anxiety	purpose the objective of the present study was to validate an existing prediction rule (including age, education, depressive/anxiety symptoms, and recovery expectations) for predictions of the duration of sickness absence due to common mental disorders (cmds) and investigate the added value of work-related factors. methods a prospective cohort study including 596 employees who reported sick with cmds in the period from september 2013 to april 2014. work-related factors were measured at baseline with the questionnaire on the experience and evaluation of work. during 1-year follow-up, sickness absence data were retrieved from an occupational health register. the outcome variables of the study were sickness absence (no = 0, yes = 1) at 3 and 6 months after reporting sick with cmds. discrimination between workers with and without sickness absence was investigated at 3 and 6 months with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc). results a total of 220 (37 %) employees agreed to participate and 211 (35 %) had complete data for analysis. discrimination was poor with auc = 0.69 and auc = 0.55 at 3 and 6 months, respectively. when 'variety in work' was added as predictor variable, discrimination between employees with and without cmd sickness absence improved to auc = 0.74 (at 3 months) and auc = 0.62 (at 6 months). conclusions the original prediction rule poorly predicted cmd sickness absence duration. after adding 'variety in work', the prediction rule discriminated between employees with and without cmd sickness absence 3 months after reporting sick. this new prediction rule remains to be validated in other populations.
osteoarthritis	objective: to identify effective mind-body exercise programs and provide clinicians and patients with updated, high-quality recommendations concerning non-traditional land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis. methods: a systematic search and adapted selection criteria included comparative controlled trials with mind-body exercise programs for patients with knee osteoarthritis. a panel of experts reached consensus on the recommendations using a delphi survey. a hierarchical alphabetical grading system (a, b, c+, c, d, d+, d-) was used, based on statistical significance (p < 0.5) and clinical importance (15% improvement). results: the four high-quality studies identified demonstrated that various mind-body exercise programs are promising for improving the management of knee osteoarthritis. hatha yoga demonstrated significant improvement for pain relief (grade b) and physical function (grade c+). tai chi qigong demonstrated significant improvement for quality of life (grade b), pain relief (grade c+) and physical function (grade c+). sun style tai chi gave significant improvement for pain relief (grade b) and physical function (grade b). conclusion: mind-body exercises are promising approaches to reduce pain, as well as to improve physical function and quality of life for individuals with knee osteoarthritis.
rheumatoid_arthritis	mri of synovitis relies on use of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. diffusion-weighted mri (dwi) visualises thickened synovium but is of limited use in the presence of joint effusion. to investigate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted mri with intravoxel incoherent motion (ivim) for diagnosing synovitis in the knee joint of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. twelve consecutive children with confirmed or suspected juvenile idiopathic arthritis (10 girls, median age 11 years) underwent mri with contrast-enhanced t1-weighted imaging and dwi at 1.5 t. read-out segmented multi-shot dwi was acquired at b values of 0 s/mm(2), 200 s/mm(2), 400 s/mm(2) and 800 s/mm(2). we calculated the ivim parameters perfusion fraction (f) and tissue diffusion coefficient (d). diffusion-weighted images at b=800 s/mm(2), f parameter maps and post-contrast t1-weighted images were retrospectively assessed by two independent readers for synovitis using the juvenile arthritis mri scoring system. seven (58%) children showed synovial hypertrophy on contrast-enhanced imaging. diagnostic ratings for synovitis on dwi and on f maps were fully consistent with contrast-enhanced imaging, the diagnostic reference. two children had equivocal low-confidence assessments on dwi. median f was 6.7 +/- 2.0% for synovitis, 2.1 +/- 1.2% for effusion, 5.0 +/- 1.0% for muscle and 10.6 +/- 5.7% for popliteal lymph nodes. diagnostic confidence was higher based on f maps in three (25%) children and lower in one child (8%), as compared to dwi. dwi with ivim reliably visualises synovitis of the knee joint. perfusion fraction maps differentiate thickened synovium from joint effusion and hence increase diagnostic confidence.
ankylosing_spondylitis	what is known and objectivebiopharmaceuticals are an important class of drugs for the treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory and oncologic diseases. with patent expiries, biotechnological manufacturers can now develop biosimilar drugs. due to timeliness of introducing new and more complex biosimilars, the portuguese association of hospital pharmacists gathered to develop a common positioning on the use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. main issuesthe european pathway to biosimilar approval was developed to improve affordability and access to biological therapies, but it remains a work in progress because unresolved issues remain. due to the present reality of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies, hospital pharmacists must play an important role in ensuring the safe, effective and cost-effective use of biosimilars in health systems; and educating healthcare administrators, providers, legislators, policymakers, payors and patients about these products. what is new and conclusionthe conclusions presented in this work focused on the proposal for optimal biosimilar prescription criteria, the preparation of original biologics and biosimilars in the pharmacy, the management and selection of suppliers, extrapolation issues, the specific role of pharmacovigilance and risk management for the optimal use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies.
mental_health	there has been a proliferation of offender reentry programs since the passage of the second chance act in 2008, including an unprecedented expansion of treatment services into underserved rural areas. review of second chance act programming and observation of unmet mental health and substance abuse needs in justice settings contextualizes description of the middle tennessee rural reentry program, a u.s. bureau of justice assistance funded intervention. the program targeted 209 adult female and male higher risk offenders that were dually diagnosed with mental health and substance abuse disorders for evidence based cognitive behavioral change oriented therapeutic treatment. while offender outcome indicators (recidivism and relapse) suggested program impact, barriers to implementing, delivering, and evaluating reentry programming in rural areas were also identified and orient discussion around evidence based demonstration and replication.
medicare	objectivesto determine the extent of agreement between four commonly used definitions of multiple chronic conditions (mccs) and compare each definition 's ability to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. designretrospective cohort study. settingnational medicare claims data. participantsrandom sample of medicare beneficiaries discharged from the hospital from 2005 to 2009 (n = 710,609). measurementsbaseline chronic conditions were determined for each participant using four definitions of mcc. the primary outcome was all-cause 30-day hospital readmission. agreement between mcc definitions was measured, and sensitivities and specificities for each definition 's ability to identify patients experiencing a future readmission were calculated. logistic regression was used to assess the ability of each mcc definition to predict 30-day hospital readmission. resultsthe sample prevalence of hospitalized medicare beneficiaries with two or more chronic conditions ranged from 18.6% (johns hopkins adjusted clinical groups (acg) case-mix system software) to 92.9% (medicare chronic condition warehouse (ccw)). there was slight to moderate agreement (kappa = 0.03-0.44) between pair-wise combinations of mcc definitions. ccw-defined mcc was the most sensitive (sensitivity 95.4%, specificity 7.4%), and acg-defined mcc was the most specific (sensitivity 32.7%, specificity 83.2%) predictor of being readmitted. in the fully adjusted model, the risk of readmission was higher for those with chronic condition special needs plan (c-snp)-defined mccs (odds ratio (or) = 1.50, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.47-1.52), charlson comorbidity index-defined mccs (or = 1.45, 95% ci = 1.42-1.47), acg-defined mccs (or = 1.22, 95% ci = 1.19-1.25), and ccw-defined mccs (or = 1.15, 95% ci = 1.11-1.19) than for those without mccs. conclusionmcc definitions demonstrate poor agreement and should not be used interchangeably. the two definitions with the greatest agreement (cci, c-snp) were also the best predictors of 30-day hospital readmissions.
stress_management	purpose. the immunoproteasome is known to generate peptides for antigen presentation. however, it has also been proposed to have additional functions such as stress response. the propensity of the immunoproteasome for degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins and peptides makes it interesting in the context of cataract formation and prevention. this study hypothesized that the immunoproteasome is present in human cataractous lenses and that oxidative stress will induce its expression, affect its proteolytic activity and its intracellular location in native cultured human lens epithelial cells (hlecs). methods. the expression of the immunoproteasome and the constitutive proteasome subunits beta i/beta 1, beta 2i/beta 2, and beta 5i/beta 5 were studied by using western blotting. the chymotrypsin-like activity was investigated for possible oxidative stress response. inhibitors specific for the immuno-and constitutive proteasome, onx-0914 and mg-132, respectively, were used to study their relative contributions to total proteasome activity. the intracellular location of the proteasomal subunits beta 5i and beta 5 was studied by immunocytochemistry. results. immunoproteasome subunits were detected both in the lens epithelium and in the lens fibers derived from cataract surgery. oxidative stress to cultured hlecs upregulated the immunoproteasome but not the constitutive proteasome. the chymotrypsin-like activity decreased with increased oxidative stress and the two proteasome types contributed equally to total proteasome activity. immunocytochemical labeling of subunit beta 5i showed mainly cytosolic localization, whereas subunit beta 5 was localized predominantly in the nucleus. h2o2-induced challenge increased the expression of the immunoproteasome. conclusions. the present findings indicate a role for the immunoproteasome in oxidative stress management in the lens.
addiction	background: given the risk of opioid misuse among chronic pain patients being treated with longterm opioid pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological treatments are needed. further, in light of hedonic deficits in this population, therapies that enhance positive affect may be useful. the purpose of this study was to examine effects of a mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement (more) intervention on ecological momentary assessments (ema) of pain and positive affective experience, and to determine if changes in pain, affect, and their interaction were associated with opioid misuse at post-treatment. methods: this study examined unpublished ema data from a subset of participants (n = 55) in a previously published rct (nct01505101) of more versus a support group (sg) control. across 8 weeks of treatment, patients completed up to 224 ema measures of pain and affect. multilevel models and generalized estimating equations examined effects of treatment on momentary pain and positive affect, and generalized linear models examined associations between pain and affect and changes in opioid misuse by post-treatment. results: patients in more reported significantly greater improvements in momentary pain (p = 0.01) and positive affect (p = 0.004) than patients in the sg. further, over the entire course of treatment, patients in more were significantly more likely to exhibit positive affect regulation (or= 2.75) than patients in the sg. finally, improvements in positive affect (but not pain) over the course of intervention were associated with reduced risk of misusing opioids by post-treatment (p= 0.02). conclusion: more may be a useful non-pharmacological treatment for pain and hedonic deficits among chronic pain patients at risk for opioid misuse.

anxiety	females are two times as likely as males to develop generalized anxiety disorder (gad; steiner et al., 2005; vesga-lopez et al., 2008). moreover, the clinical presentation of gad is different across genders. one explanation for these differences may be the role of cognitive biases involved in gad between genders. in the present study, we used an exogenous spatial cueing task to examine gender differences in attentional bias for negative and positive information in 118 individuals with a primary diagnosis of gad. males and females did not differ in their attentional bias for idiographically selected negative or neutral words. however, women showed a significantly larger attentional bias for positive words than did men. results suggest that developing gender-specific treatments for gad could improve treatment response rates.
dementia	hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in older age. however, evidence of the neural basis of the relationship between the deterioration of cognitive function and elevated blood pressure is sparse. based on previous research, we speculate that variations in brain connectivity are closely related to elevated blood pressure even before the onset of clinical conditions and apparent cognitive decline in individuals over 60 years of age. forty cognitively healthy adults were recruited. each received a blood pressure test before and after the cognitive assessment in various domains. diffusion tensor imaging (dti) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfmri) data were collected. our findings confirm that elevated blood pressure is associated with brain connectivity variations in cognitively healthy individuals. the integrity of the splenium of the corpus callosum is closely related to individual differences in systolic blood pressure. in particular, elevated systolic blood pressure is related to resting-state ventral attention network (van) and information processing speed. serial mediation analyses have further revealed that lower integrity of the splenium statistically predicts elevated systolic blood pressure, which in turn predicts weakened functional connectivity (fc) within the van and eventually poorer processing speed. the current study sheds light on how neural correlates are involved in the impact of elevated blood pressure on cognitive functioning.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: prior studies of clinical prognostication in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) using computed tomography (ct) have often used subjective analyses or have evaluated quantitative measures in isolation. this study examined associations between both densitometric and local histogram based quantitative ct measurements with pulmonary function test (pft) parameters and mortality. in addition, this study sought to compare risk prediction scores that incorporate quantitative ct measures with previously described systems. methods: forty six patients with biopsy proven ipf were identified from a registry of patients with interstitial lung disease at brigham and women 's hospital in boston, ma. ct scans for each subject were visually scored using a previously published method. after a semi-automated method was used to segment the lungs from the surrounding tissue, densitometric measurements including the percent high attenuating area, mean lung density, skewness and kurtosis were made for the entirety of each patient 's lungs. a separate, automated tool was used to detect and quantify the percent of lung occupied by interstitial lung features. these analyses were used to create clinical and quantitative ct based risk prediction scores, and the performance of these was compared to the performance of clinical and visual analysis based methods. results: all of the densitometric measures were correlated with forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity, as were the total amount of interstitial change and the percentage of interstitial change that was honeycombing measured using the local histogram method. higher percent high attenuating area, higher mean lung density, lower skewness, lower kurtosis and a higher percentage of honeycombing were associated with worse transplant free survival. the quantitative ct based risk prediction scores performed similarly to the clinical and visual analysis based methods. conclusions: both densitometric and feature based quantitative ct measures correlate with pulmonary function test measures and are associated with transplant free survival. these objective measures may be useful for identifying high risk patients and monitoring disease progression. further work will be needed to validate these measures and the quantitative imaging based risk prediction scores in other cohorts.
psoriatic_arthritis	patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) experience an increased cardiometabolic risk factor burden that is substantially driven by systemic inflammation. this occurs less consistently in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as). psoriatic arthritis most strongly associates with excess adiposity and metabolic risk. ra patients also often have systemic inflammation-induced proinflammatory high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol particles and lean/muscle mass loss in association with increased adiposity, a condition termed rheumatoid cachexia, which further enhances cardiovascular risk. the presence of proinflammatory hdl and lean mass loss was also reported in patients with as. individualized aerobic and resistance exercise programs can improve body composition and metabolic risk factor profiles in ra and as. future studies should assess how long-term lifestyle changes can be effectuated and if these can influence cardiovascular events in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. herein, we review the current evidence on metabolic abnormalities in inflammatory arthritis. we propose management strategies and a research agenda.

kidney_health	the effect of aki and modern continuous rrt (crrt) methods on drug disposition (pharmacokinetics) and response has been poorly studied. pharmaceutical manufacturers have little incentive to perform pharmacokinetic studies in patients undergoing crrt because such studies are neither recommended in existing us food and drug administration (fda) guidance documents nor required for new drug approval. action is urgently needed to address the knowledge deficit. the kidney health initiative has assembled a work group composed of clinicians and scientists representing academia, the fda, and the pharmaceutical and dialysis industries with expertise related to pharmacokinetics, aki, and/or crrt. the work group critically evaluated key considerations in the assessment of pharmacokinetics and drug dosing in crrt, practical constraints related to conducting pharmacokinetic studies in critically ill patients, and the generalizability of observations made in the context of specific crrt prescriptions and specific patient populations in order to identify efficient study designs capable of addressing the knowledge deficit without impeding drug development. considerations for the standardized assessment of pharmacokinetics and development of corresponding drug dosing recommendations in critically ill patients with aki receiving crrt are proposed.
psoriasis	background and objectives: psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, and hyperproliperative skin disease. it has been known that the infectious agents play a role in triggering and exacerbation of the disease. periodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory gum diseases initiated by microorganisms in dental plaques. this study intended to determine the role of periodontal diseases, as chronic infective foci in psoriasis. materials and methods: a total of 76 patients, who applied to faculty of medicine, department of dermatology, inonu university, diagnosed as psoriasis and a control group consisting of 76 dermatologic patients without any systemic disease at similar age and gender were included the study. the dental examinations of the subjects were done by the community periodontal index of treatment needs index system, using a periodontal probe. results: significant difference was identified between the patients with psoriasis and control group, in terms of cpi (community periodontal index), oral hygiene habits, frequency of tooth brushing and flossing (p = 0.01, p = 0.001, p = 0.01, p = 0.05, respectively). a positive correlation between the severities of psoriasis and dental disease was determined, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.204). conclusion: the periodontal disease may affect psoriasis as a chronic infectious focus and probably through proinflammatory cytokines. in order to clarify the exact role of periodontal disease in psoriasis, the issue should be studied in larger series with serum cytokine levels.
atopic_dermatitis	cordyceps bassiana is one of cordyceps species with anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anti-angiogenic, and anti-nociceptive activities. this mushroom has recently demonstrated to have an ability to reduce 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis symptoms in nc/nga mice. in this study, we further examined phytochemical properties of this mushroom by column chromatography and hplc analysis. by chromatographic separation and spectroscopic analysis, 8 compounds, such as 1,9-dimethylguanine (1), adenosine (2), uridine (3), nicotinamide (4), 3-methyluracil (5), 1,7-dimethylxanthine (6), nudifloric acid (7), and mannitol (8) were identified from 6 different fractions and 4 more subfractions. through evaluation of their anti-inflammatory activities using reporter gene assay and mrna analysis, compound 1 was found to block luciferase activity induced by nf-kappa b and ap-1, suppress the mrna levels of cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha. therefore, our data strongly suggests that compound 1 acts as one of major principles in cordyceps bassiana with anti-inflammatory and anti-atopic dermatitis activities.
digestive_health	this review aims to present the different effects produced by a post-weaning intake limitation strategy on the growing rabbit, now largely used by french professional rabbit breeders. although a quantitative feed restriction leads to slower growth, feed conversion (fc) is improved, particularly when the rabbits are again fed freely, as compensatory growth occurs. this better fc or the healthy rabbit is because of better digestion resulting from slower passage through the intestine, whereas the digestive physiology is slightly modified (morphometry of the intestinal mucosa, fermentation pattern, microbiota). meat quality and carcass characteristics are not greatly affected by feed restriction, except for a lower dressing-out percentage. one of the main advantages of limiting post-weaning intake of the rabbit is to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate due to digestive disorders (particularly epizootic rabbit enteropathy syndrome). the consequences for animal welfare are debatable, as feed restriction probably leads to hunger, but it reduces the incidence of digestive troubles after weaning. however, the growing rabbit adapts very well to an intake limitation strategy, without any aggressive behaviour for congener. in conclusion, restriction strategies could improve profitability of rabbit breeding, but they should be adapted to any specific breeding situation, according to the national market, feed prices, etc.
addiction	in this paper, a three dimensional drug model is constructed to investigate the impact of media coverage on the spread and control of drug addiction. the dynamical behavior of the model is studied by using the basic reproduction number ro. the drug-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if r-o1. the results demonstrate that the media effect in human population cannot change the stabilities of equilibria but can affect the number of drug addicts. sensitivity analyses are performed to seek for effective control measures for drug treatment. numerical simulations are given to support the theoretical results.

medicare	cancer care continues to stress the us healthcare system with increases in life expectancy, cancer prevalence, and survivors' complex needs. these challenges are compounded by socioeconomic, racial, and cultural disparities that are associated with poor clinical outcomes. one innovative and resource-wise strategy to address this demand on the system is expanded use of telehealth. this paradigm has the potential to decrease healthcare and patient out-of-pocket costs and improve patient adherence to recommended treatment and/or surveillance.
osteoporosis	there has been very little analysis of the epidemiology of adult fall-related fractures outwith the osteoporotic population. we have analysed all in-patient and out-patient fall-related fractures in a one-year period in a defined population and documented their epidemiology. the overall prevalence of non-spinal fall-related fractures is 63.1% with 40.7% and 82.7% occurring in males and females respectively. in females aged 20-29 years >50% of fractures follow falls, the equivalent age range in males being 50-59 years. analysis of fall-related fractures in two one-year periods in 2000 and 2010/11 shows a significant increase in almost all age ranges up to 60-69 years with a decreased incidence in 90+ patients. in males there is a significant increase in 30-39 year males but also in males >80 years. in females the greatest increase in incidence is in 16-19 year females but all age ranges show a significant increase up to 60-69 years. there is a decreased incidence in 90+ females. the reasons for the increase in the incidence of fall-related are multifactorial but they are probably contributed to by the inherently weaker bone of younger females and by the increased incidence of conditions such as obesity and diabetes.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	chronic rejection after organ transplantation is defined as a humoral- and cell-mediated immune response directed against the allograft. in lung transplantation, chronic rejection is nowadays clinically defined as a cause of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (clad), consisting of different clinical phenotypes including restrictive allograft syndrome (ras) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos). however, the differential role of humoral and cellular immunity is not investigated up to now. explant lungs of patients with end-stage bos (n = 19) and ras (n = 18) were assessed for the presence of lymphoid (b and t cells) and myeloid cells (dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) and compared to nontransplant control lung biopsies (n = 21). all myeloid cells, with exception of dendritic cells, were increased in ras versus control (neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells: all p < 0.05, macrophages: p < 0.001). regarding lymphoid cells, b cells and cytotoxic t cells were increased remarkably in ras versus control (p < 0.001) and in bos versus control (p < 0.01). interestingly, lymphoid follicles were restricted to ras (p < 0.001 versus control and p < 0.05 versus bos). our data suggest an immunological diversity between bos and ras, with a more pronounced involvement of the b-cell response in ras characterized by a structural organization of lymphoid follicles. this may impact future therapeutic approaches.
mental_health	this article addresses 4 questions: first, how much weight should be given to parental conflict and the quality of the coparenting relationship in determining parenting time-specifically with respect to children 's living at least 35% time with each parent in joint physical custody? second, to what extent are low conflict and cooperative coparenting connected to better outcomes for children? third, to what degree are children 's outcomes linked to whether their parents take their custody disputes to court or have high legal conflict? fourth, is joint physical custody associated with worse outcomes than sole physical custody for children whose parents have a conflicted, uncooperative coparenting relationship? recent research does not support the idea that conflict-including high legal conflict-should rule out joint physical custody as the arrangement that best serves children 's interests. parents with joint physical custody do not generally have significantly less conflict or more cooperative relationships than parents with sole physical custody. conflict and poor coparenting are not linked to worse outcomes for children in joint physical custody than in sole physical custody. the quality of the parent-child relationship is a better predictor than conflict of children 's outcomes, with the exception of the most extreme forms of conflict to which some children are exposed. while continuing our efforts to improve parents' relationships with one another, we should become more invested in helping both parents maintain and strengthen their relationships with their children.
osteoarthritis	physical activity (pa) is increasingly recognised as an important factor within studies of osteoarthritis (oa). however, subjective methods used to assess pa are highly variable and have not been developed for use within studies of oa, which creates difficulties when comparing and interpreting pa data in oa research. the aim of this study was, therefore, to gain expert agreement on the appropriate methods to harmonise pa data among existing population cohorts to enable the investigation of the association of pa and oa. the definition of pa in an oa context and methods of harmonization were established via an international expert consensus meeting and modified delphi exercise using a geographically diverse committee selected on the basis of individual expertise in physical activity, exercise medicine, and oa. agreement was met for all aims of study: (1) the use of metabolic equivalent of task (met) minutes per week (met-min/week) as a method for harmonising pa variables among cohorts; (2) the determination of methods for treating missing components of met-min/week calculation; a value will be produced from comparable activities within a representative cohort; (3) exclusion of the domain of occupation from total met-min/week; (4) the need for a specific measure of joint loading of an activity in addition to intensity and time, in studies of diseases, such as oa. this study has developed a systematic method to classify and harmonise pa in existing oa cohorts. it also provides minimum requirements for future studies intending to include subjective pa measures.
rheumatoid_arthritis	the role of b cells in graft rejection and tolerance has aroused great interest. we previously reported that rituximab (rit) induction prior to kidney transplantation (ktx) reduced the incidence rate of chronic rejection. here, we performed a cross sectional investigation to determine the characteristics of b cells after rit induction for ktx. we sampled blood from 29 patients with (n=16) and without (n=13) rit induction 3 to 18months after ktx. in the rit group, the majority of repopulating b cells was the transitional type, while memory b cells were scarce. although transitional b cells are believed to have immune-regulatory functions by producing il-10, transcriptional levels of il-10 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were similar in both groups. in contrast, transcription levels of baff-receptor relatively increased in patients with rit induction. in conclusion, baff-receptor expressing highly proliferating transitional b cell was the major subset after rit induction for ktx.
osteoarthritis	objective osteoarthritis (oa) is a major cause of musculoskeletal pain and disability worldwide. the investigation of disease-modifying treatment options for oa has become an important aspect of orthopedic care. to assess the effect of intra-articular and oral glucosamine sulfate (gs) versus placebo on osteoarthritis in a canine model. materials in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, oa was induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (aclt) according to the pond-nuki model in 32 canines. all canines were allocated into 4 treatment subgroups with treatment administered for 8 weeks: gs (400 mg) intra-articular, placebo intra-articular, gs (200 mg/kg body weight) oral, and placebo oral. the contralateral nonoperated stifle (knee) served as control. after 8 weeks, the medial and lateral femoral condyles, the medial and lateral tibial plateau and patella were histologically examined and anatomic changes quantified by light microscopy using the modified mankin score. results after 8 weeks, mean mankin score values significantly (p < 0.002) decreased in the intra-articular gs group (8.1; range 7.9-8.8) compared with the intra-articular placebo group (13.9; range 11.6-15.9) and again significantly (p < 0.002) in the oral gs group (12.1; range 9.9-12.7) compared with the oral placebo group (15.1; range 12.5-17.0). mean mankin score values were significantly (p < 0.002) lower in the intra-articular gs group compared with the oral gs group. conclusion both, intra-articular and oral administered gs significantly reduced histological signs of oa in the pond-nuki model, with the intra-articular application being more effective compared to oral administration.
smoking_cessation	background: after declining sharply for many years, the prevalence of smoking has remained fairly stable over the past decade. one possible explanation is that there has been an increase in the prevalence of barriers to cessation, like depression, among remaining smokers. objectives: to estimate changes in the prevalence of depression among current, former and never smokers in the united states (u.s.) population from 2005 to 2013 overall and by age, gender. and income. methods: data were drawn from the national household survey on drug use (nsduh), an annual cross-sectional study of persons ages 12 and over (n=496,805). the prevalence of past 12-month depression was examined annually among current (past 12-month), former (not past 12-month), and lifetime nonsmokers from 2005 to 2013. data were re-analyzed stratified by age, gender, and household income, and adjusted for demographics. results: depression appears to have significantly increased in the united states from 2005 to 2013 among current, former, and never smokers. depression prevalence increased among current smokers overall, but the increase among former and never smokers was even more prominent. striking temporal changes emerged by age, gender and income. specifically, (1) depression increased significantly among current smokers aged 12-17 (from 16% to 22%, p-value =0.0002) and the prevalence was consistently more than twice as high as that of never smokers; (2) depression increased among male smokers (6.19%-7.82%, p-value = 0.0099): (3) depression increased significantly among smokers in the highest income group (6.36% to 8.91%, p-value = 0.0400). throughout this period, the prevalence of depression among current smokers was consistently twice as high as among former and never smokers. discussion: public health efforts aimed at decreasing the prevalence of smoking should take depression into account, a common and modifiable barrier whose treatment may help to increase successful smoking cessation. future work is needed to disentangle the role of smoking and other factors that lead to increases in depression in the us population.

lymphoma	composite lymphoma (cl) describes the rare occurrence of 2 or more distinct types of lymphoma in a single anatomical location. we present the case of a 78-year-old man presenting with a 3-month history of weakness, malaise, and increasing dyspnea. a lymph node excised from the posterior triangle of the neck revealed the coexistence of 2 morphologically and phenotypically distinct lymphoid neoplasms consistent with a blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) occurring in composite with classical hodgkin lymphoma (chl), mixed cellularity subtype. a t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the mcl and hodgkin reed-sternberg cells of the chl. multiplex polymerase chain reaction detected clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (vfr1-j, vfr2-j, and vfr3-j), clonal immunoglobulin light chain kappa (v-j and v/jc intron-kde) and clonal immunoglobulin light chain lambda (v-j) gene rearrangements in the mcl. this report represents the first case of a blastoid variant of mcl occurring in composite with chl.
migraine	background: the amygdala is a large grey matter complex in the limbic system, and it may contribute in the neurolimbic pain network in migraine. however, the detailed neuromechanism remained to be elucidated. the objective of this study is to investigate the amygdala structural and functional changes in migraine and to elucidate the mechanism of neurolimbic pain-modulating in the migraine pathogenesis. methods: conventional mri, 3d structure images and resting state functional mri were performed in 18 normal controls (nc), 18 patients with episodic migraine (em), and 16 patients with chronic migraine (cm). the amygdala volume was measured using freesurfer software and the functional connectivity (fc) of bilateral amygdala was computed over the whole brain. analysis of covariance was performed on the individual fc maps among groups. results: the increased fc of left amygdala was observed in em compared with nc, and the decreased of right amygdala was revealed in cm compared with nc. the increased fc of bilateral amygdala was observed in cm compared with em. the correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between the score of sleep quality (0, normal; 1, mild sleep disturbance; 2, moderate sleep disturbance; 3, serious sleep disturbance) and the increased fc strength of left amygdala in em compared with nc, and a positive correlation between the score of sleep quality and the increased fc strength of left amygdala in cm compared with em, and other clinical variables showed no significant correlation with altered fc of amygdala. conclusions: the altered functional connectivity of amygdala demonstrated that neurolimbic pain network contribute in the em pathogenesis and cm chronicization.
anxiety	objective: most weight loss research focuses on weight as the primary outcome, often to the exclusion of other physiological or psychological measures. this study aims to provide a holistic evaluation of the effects from weight loss interventions for individuals with obesity by examining the physiological, psychological and eating disorders outcomes from these interventions. methods: databases medline, psycinfo and cochrane library (2011-2016) were searched for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews of obesity treatments (dietary, exercise, behavioural, psychological, pharmacological or surgical). data extracted included study features, risk of bias, study outcomes, and an assessment of treatment impacts on physical, psychological or eating disorder outcomes. results: from 3628 novel records, 134 studies met all inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. lifestyle interventions had the strongest evidence base as a first-line approach, with escalation to pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery in more severe or complicated cases. quality of life was the most common psychological outcome measure, and improved in all cases where it was assessed, across all intervention types. behavioural, psychological and lifestyle interventions for weight loss led to improvements in cognitive restraint, control over eating and binge eating, while bariatric surgery led to improvements in eating behaviour and body image that were not sustained over the long-term. discussion: numerous treatment strategies have been trialled to assist people to lose weight and many of these are effective over the short-term. quality of life, and to a lesser degree depression, anxiety and psychosocial function, often improve alongside weight loss. weight loss is also associated with improvements in eating disorder psychopathology and related measures, although overall, eating disorder outcomes are rarely assessed. further research and between-sector collaboration is required to address the significant overlap in risk factors, diagnoses and treatment outcomes between obesity and eating disorders.
anxiety	just before the official launch of the dsm-5 in 2013, the research domain criteria (rdoc) initiative of the national institute of mental health was made public and is becoming increasingly more important in psychiatric research. the aim of this paper is to clarify the conceptual approach of rdoc, to systematically discuss limitations, to present exemplary rdoc-based studies and to consider the relevance of the rdoc concepts for clinicians and scientists. the is a qualitative introduction and review article with a critical discussion. the rdoc initiative was not conceived as an alternative diagnostic manual to dsm-5 or idc-10/11 for use in clinical practice. it is a new systematic framework for psychiatric research based on the most recent results of cognitive neuroscience and aims to map mental disorders dimensionally and transdiagnostically. despite some weaknesses, it is currently the most elaborated and scientifically grounded approach for multidisciplinary research on mental disorders. in contrast to the purely symptom-based dsm and icd approaches, which are agnostic with respect to the pathogenesis of mental diseases, the explicit aim of the rdoc initiative is to systematize biological knowledge about risk factors and causes of mental disorders; therefore, it has a much greater potential to develop new and individualized therapeutic strategies based on disease mechanisms.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective: prevalence and impact of low bone mineral density (bmd) in psoriatic arthritis (psa) is not well understood. we aimed to synthesize current evidence regarding the prevalence, impact, and risk factors for low bmd and fractures in psa. methods: a systematic literature search limited to human studies was conducted without language restriction. data on bmd, prevalence of osteoporosis, osteopenia and fractures, risk factors, morbidity, and mortality due to low bmd in psa patients were collected. result: a total of 21 studies (16 case control, 4 cross-sectional, and 1 prospective cohort) were reviewed after screening 639 titles and abstracts. in all, 17 studies compared psa patients with one or more control group (four normal controls, five psoriasis, and eight other rheumatic diseases with or without healthy controls). the number of psa patients in the studies ranged from 8 to 2212 with a mean (standard deviation) age of 35 (10) to 63.4 (6.2), and mean psa duration of 2.25-13.65 years. reported prevalence of osteoporosis varied from 1.4% to 68.8%. low bmd was identified as a significant problem in 13 of the 21 studies. age, female sex, postmenopausal status, psa duration, presence of erosions, and cumulative steroid dose were associated with lower bmd. fractures (12-40%) were associated with postmenopausal status and axial disease. no studies reported on hospitalization and mortality due to low bmd. conclusion: this systematic review synthesizes current evidence on bmd and its impact in psa. high likelihood of bias and inconsistent results suggest a need for well-designed longitudinal studies on bone health in psa.

children's_health	background: knowledge of living with childhood cancer, through the trajectory, is sparse. aim: the aim of this study was to follow young children 's health and functioning in everyday life through their cancer trajectory. methods: data were gathered longitudinally from a group of 13 young children and their parents connected to a pediatric oncology unit in sweden. the international classification of functioning, disability and health for children and youth structure was used to identify difficulties in health and functioning in everyday life, in interview and questionnaire data. descriptive statistical analysis was performed to show patterns of difficulty over a 3-year period from diagnosis. results: difficulties experienced by children declined and changed over time. an increase in difficulties with personal interactions with others and access to and support from health care professionals was seen 2 to 3 years after diagnosis and start of treatment. similar patterns are seen within individual children 's trajectories in relation to diagnosis but individual patterns were seen for each child. conclusions and clinical implications: health care professionals need to plan for ongoing contact with school services and information and support pathways, beyond the treatment period. a person-centered philosophy of care is required throughout the cancer trajectory.
rheumatoid_arthritis	here we report adamantyl cyanoguanidine compounds based on hybrids of the adamantyl amide scaffold reported by astrazeneca and cyanoguanidine scaffold reported by abbott laboratories. compound 27 displayed five-fold greater inhibitory potency than the lead compound 2 in both pore-formation and interleukin-1 beta release assays, while 35-treated mice displayed an antidepressant phenotype in behavioral studies. this sar study provides a proof of concept for hybrid compounds, which will help in the further development of p2x(7)r antagonists.

bipolar_disorder	the role of dopamine d-1-type receptor (d1r)-expressing neurons in the regulation of motivated behavior and reward prediction has not yet been fully established. as a prerequisite for future research assessing d-1-mediated neuronal network regulation using simultaneous pet/mri and d1r-selective [c-11]sch23390, this study investigated the stability of central d1r measurements between two independent pet/mri sessions under baseline conditions. thirteen healthy volunteers (7 female, age 33 +/- 13 yrs) underwent 90-min emission scans, each after 90-s bolus injection of 486 +/- 16 mbq [c-11]sch23390, on two separate days within 2-4 weeks using a pet/mri system. parametric images of d1r distribution volume ratio (dvr) and binding potential (bpnd) were generated by a multi-linear reference tissue model with two parameters and the cerebellar cortex as receptor-free reference region. volume-of-interest (voi) analysis was performed with manual vois drawn on consecutive transverse mri slices for brain regions with high and low d1r density. the dvr varied from 2.5 +/- 0.3 to 2.9 +/- 0.5 in regions with high d1r density (e.g. the head of the caudate) and from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 in regions with low d1r density (e.g. the prefrontal cortex). the absolute variability of the dvr ranged from 2.4% +/- 1.3% to 5.1% +/- 5.3%, while bland-altman analyses revealed very low differences in mean dvr (e.g. 0.013 +/- 0.17 for the nucleus accumbens). intraclass correlation (one-way, random) indicated very high agreement (0.93 in average) for both dvr and bpnd values. accordingly, the absolute variability of bpnd ranged from 7.0% +/- 4.7% to 12.5% +/- 10.6%; however, there were regions with very low d1r content, such as the occipital cortex, with higher mean variability. the test-retest reliability of d1r measurements in this study was very high. this was the case not only for d1r-rich brain areas, but also for regions with low d1r density. these results will provide a solid base for future joint pet/mri data analyses in stimulation-dependent mapping of d1r-containing neurons and their effects on projections in neuronal circuits that determine behavior.
atopic_dermatitis	rationale: cystatin a and spink5 are endogenous protease inhibitors (epis) that mayplay key roles in epithelial barrier function. objectives: to investigate the roles of epis in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (crs). methods: we examined the expression of cystatin a and spink5 in the nasal epithelial cells of patients with crs. additionally, the in vitro effects of recombinant epis on the secretion of the epithelial derived cytokines il-25, il-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in airway epithelial cells, and the in vivo effects of recombinant epis in the nasal epithelium of mice exposed to multiple airborne allergens (maa) were examined. measurements and main results: compared with control subjects and patients with noneosinophilic crs, patients"" with eosinophilic crs showed significantly lower protein and mrna expression of cystatin a and spink5 in the nasal epithelium. allergen-induced production of il-25, il-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in normal human bronchial epitheliakells was inhibited by treatment with recombinant cystatin a or spink5. conversely, the production of these cytokines was increased when cystatin a or spink5 were knocked down with small interfering rna. chronic maa exposure induced goblet cell metaplasia and epithelial disruption in mouse nasal epithelium and decreased the tissue expression and nasal lavage levels of cystatin a and spink5. intranasal instillations of recombinant epis attenuated this maa-induced pathology. conclusions: cystatin a and spink5 play an important role in protecting the airway epithelium from exogenous proteases. the preservation of epis may have a therapeutic benefit in intractable airway inflammation, such as eosinophilic crs.
rheumatoid_arthritis	to investigate the additive systemic inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in arterial hypertension patients, structural and morphological changes of the retina and optic nerve head were assessed by modern topographic technologies. similarities of underlying vascular mechanisms between ra and arterial hypertension are interesting and have not been researched in depth. the aim of this study is to evaluate changes of ra and arterial hypertension with the optic coherence topography (oct) and heidelberg retina tomography (hrt iii), to validate ra changes in comparison to arterial hypertension only patients and, finally, if these methods are useful to detect the chronic inflammatory influence of the ra on the eye. in this prospective study design, data of 18 patients with ra and arterial hypertension (55.3 +/- 4.31 years old), positive for antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides, 21 patients with arterial hypertension (54.2 +/- 4.18 years old) and 19 healthy subjects (53.1 +/- 3.25 years old) were included. intensive ophthalmologic and internistic screening tests were carried out in all subjects. all participants were investigated for the retinal nerve fiber layer (rnfl) and macula thickness with the oct (carl zeiss ag germany) and for stereometric parameters of the optic nerve head with the heidelberg retina tomograph iii (heidelberg engineering germany). the pachymetry was conducted by the orbscan ii system (bausch & lomb). statistical data were assessed by spss, v20.0. no significant differences were found in visual function, diastolic and systolic blood pressure. rnfl, and macular thickness (stratus-oct) were almost consistent between the groups and even the main stereometric parameters measured with hrt iii showed no significant differences. contrary to our study hypothesis no structural and morphological changes could be detected in patients with arterial hypertension without ra compared to healthy subjects. furthermore, no ra-specific effects could be shown in comparison with the hypertension group. thus, the used examination techniques are not suitable to prove the systemic inflammatory influence of ra on the eye.
ankylosing_spondylitis	to compare mri-defined back muscle volume between as patients and age, and spinopelvic alignment matched control patients with chronic back pain. 51 male patients with as were enrolled. age and spinopelvic alignment matched controls (male) were found among non-as patients with chronic back pain. after matching procedure, fully matched controls were found in 31 of 51 as patients (60.8%), who represent as patients without deformity. however, matched controls were not found in 20 of 51 as patients (39.2%), who represent as patients with deformity. mri parameters of back muscle (paraspinal muscle and psoas muscle) at l4/5 disc level including cross-sectional area (csa) and fat-free cross-sectional area (fcsa) were compared between as patients and matched controls. covariates, including bmi, self-reported physical activity, and the presence of chronic disease, which can influence back muscle volume, were also investigated. there were no statistical differences in age, body mass index, score of back pain (nrs), and spinopelvic alignment, and physical activity between matched as patients and control patients except for duration of back pain. all mri parameters for paraspinal muscle volume in matched as patients (without deformity) were significantly less than those of control patients, and significantly larger than those of non-matched as patients (with deformity). body size adjusted mri parameters (relative csa and relative fcsa) of paraspinal muscle showed strong correlations with lumbar lordosis and sacral slope. such relationship between paraspinal muscle and spinopelvic parameters remained significant even after multivariate adjustment. as patients without deformity already have decreased paraspinal muscle volume compared with age and spinopelvic alignment matched non-as patients with chronic back pain. such decrease in paraspinal muscle volume was significantly associated with kyphotic deformity of as patients even after multivariate adjustment. although the result of our study supports the causal relationship between muscle degeneration and kyphotic deformity in as patients, further study is required to prove the causality.
addiction	aimto test whether an incentive-based intervention that increased adherence to naltrexone also increased opiate abstinence. designpost-hoc combined analysis of three earlier randomized controlled trials that showed individually that incentives for adherence to oral and to extended-release injection naltrexone dosing schedules increased naltrexone adherence, but not opiate abstinence. settingout-patient therapeutic work-place in baltimore, md, usa. participantsone hundred and forty unemployed heroin-dependent adults participating from 2006 to 2010. interventionsparticipants were hired in a model work-place for 26weeks and randomized to a contingency (n=72) or prescription (n=68) group. both groups were offered naltrexone. contingency participants were required to take scheduled doses of naltrexone in order to work and earn wages. prescription participants could earn wages independent of naltrexone adherence. measuresthrice-weekly and monthly urine samples tested for opiates and cocaine and measures of naltrexone adherence (percentage of monthly urine samples positive for naltrexone or percentage of scheduled injections received). all analyses included pre-randomization attendance, opiate use and cocaine use as covariates. additional analyses controlled for cocaine use and naltrexone adherence during the intervention. findingscontingency participants had more opiate abstinence than prescription participants (68.1 versus 52.9% opiate-negative thrice-weekly urine samples, respectively; and 71.9 versus 61.7% opiate-negative monthly urine samples, respectively) based on initial analyses [thrice-weekly samples, odds ratio (or)=3.3, 95% confidence interval (ci)=1.7-6.5, p<0.01; monthly samples, or=2.6, 95% ci=1.0-7.1, p=0.06] and on analyses that controlled for cocaine use (thrice-weekly samples, or=3.9, 95% ci=3.3-4.5, p<0.01; monthly samples, or=3.4, 95% ci=1.1-11.1, p=0.04), which was high and associated with opiate use. the difference in opiate abstinence rates between contingency and prescription participants was reduced when controlling for naltrexone adherence (monthly samples, or=1.1, 95% ci=0.7-1.7, p=0.84). conclusionsincentives for naltrexone adherence increase opiate abstinence in heroin-dependent adults, an effect that appears to be due to increased naltrexone adherence produced by the incentives.
atopic_dermatitis	introduction: fexofenadine (fxf) is a third-generation antihistamine drug and osthole is assumed as a natural antihistamine alternative. this paper compares results of histamine, fxf and osthole impact on hrh-1, cox-2, nf-b-k-p50, ccr1 mrna expression. we also measured mrna expression of il-1 beta and ccl5/rantes in incubated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to compared how histamine, fxf and osthole had influence on expression level and interacts on product secretion. objective: the purpose was to investigate expression pattern in asthma pbmc. methods: the cultures were treated 72 h with fxf and osthole. we measured mrna expression of histamine hrh-1, cox-2, nf-b-k-(p)50, ccr1, il-1 beta and ccl5/rantes with real-titne pcr (rt-pcr). results: the present study suggest that osthole may be a potential inhibitor of histamine h-1 receptor activity. we also demonstrated that cells cultured with histamine increase cox-2 mrna expression and osthole reduce it. conclusion:allergy remains one of the most common chronic diseases in europe and it is rapidly approaching epidemic proportions; with current predictions estimating that the number of allergy-afflicted will equal the healthy population by 2020. it is therefore paramount to find new pharmaceuticals which successfully combat allergic disease.

lymphoma	background: the aim of this study was to compare radiotherapy plans for stage i-ii nasal natural killer/t-cell lymphoma (nnktl) using helical tomotherapy (ht), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (vmat), fixed-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (imrt), and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3d-crt). methods: eight patents with stage i-ii nnktl treated with imrt were re-planned for ht, vmat (two full arcs), and 3d-crt. the quality of target coverage, the exposure of normal tissue and the efficiency of radiation delivery were analyzed. results: ht showed significant improvement over imrt in terms of d-98%, cold spot volume and homogeneity index (hi) of planning target volume (ptv). vmat provided best dose uniformity (p = 0.000) to ptv, while ht had best dose homogeneity among the four radiotherapy techniques (p = 0.000) to ptv. vmat obviously reduced treatment time (p = 0.010; 0.000) compared to ht and imrt. mean dose of left and right optic nerve was significantly reduced by imrt compared to ht (19.86%, p = 0.000; 21.40%, p = 0.002) and vmat (8.97%, p = 0.002; 9.35%, p = 0.001), and maximum dose of left lens of vmat increased over the ht (36.25%, p = 0.043) and imrt (40.65%, p = 0.001). conclusion: the unexpected results show that both ht and vmat can achieve higher conformal treatment plans while getting worse organs at risk (oars) sparing than imrt for patients with stage i-ii nnktl. vmat requires the shortest delivery time, and imrt delivers the lowest dose to most oars. the results could provide guidance for selecting proper radiation technologies for different cases.
atrial_fibrillation	acrolein is a highly toxic, volatile, unsaturated aldehyde generated during incomplete combustion as in tobacco smoke and indoor fires. because the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (trpa1) channel mediates tobacco smoke-induced lung injury, we assessed its role in high-level acrolein-induced toxicity in mice. acrolein (100275 ppm, 10-30 min) caused upper airway epithelial sloughing, bradypnea and oral gasping, hypothermia, cardiac depression and mortality. male wild-type mice (wt, c57bl/6; 5-52 weeks) were significantly more sensitive to high-level acrolein than age-matched, female wt mice. both male and female trpai-null mice were more sensitive to acrolein-induced mortality than age- and sex-matched wt mice. acrolein exposure increased lung weight:body weight ratios and lung albumin and decreased plasma albumin to a greater extent in trpa1-null than in wt mice. lung and plasma protein-acrolein adducts were not increased in acrolein-exposed trpal-null mice compared with wt mice. to assess trpa1-dependent protective mechanisms, respiratory parameters were monitored by telemetry. trpa1-null mice had a slower onset of breathing rate suppression ( 'respiratory braking') than wt mice suggesting trpai mediates this protective response. surprisingly, wt male mice treated either with a trpai antagonist (hc030031; 200 mg/kg) alone or with combined trpa1 (100 mg/kg) and trpv1 (capsazepine, 10 mg/kg) antagonists at 30 min post-acrolein exposure (i.e., ""real world"" delay in treatment) were significantly protected from acrolein-induced mortality. these data show trpa1 protects against high-level acrolein-induced toxicity in a sex-dependent manner. post-exposure trpa1 antagonism also protected against acrolein-induced mortality attesting to a complex role of trpa1 in cardiopulmonary injury.(c) 2016 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
crohn's_disease	irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)-like symptoms are not uncommon in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). while gluten-free diet is applied by patients, there are no reported interventional studies. the low-fodmap diet, on the other hand, has efficacy similar to that seen in patients with ibs in three unblinded or observational studies of ibd cohorts who had well-controlled inflammatory disease and in one small randomized cross-over study. fodmap intake by patients with ibd is not elevated, and, in one study, fructan intakes were lower in patients with crohn 's disease than in controls. there is no clear relationship between the level of fodmap intake and intestinal inflammation. the risk of compromising nutritional status with a restrictive diet must be seriously considered especially as under-nutrition is already common in this patient population. the effects of fodmaps on the gut microbiota of patients with crohn 's disease mimic that in ibs, with a balance between prebiosis from the addition of fodmaps and loss of prebiosis from their reduction. as undernutrition is common in ibd, the use of restrictive diets should be supervised by a dietitian. thus, low-fodmap diet is a viable option for ibs-like symptoms but should be carefully supervised to mitigate risk.
addiction	background: there is growing recognition that chronic cocaine users have alterations in sensorimotor control that are positively related to low frontal-striatal connectivity within the motor system. these frontal-striatal motor circuits however, are modulated by circuits governing attention, which are also disrupted in cocaine users. this study 's aim was to determine if sensorimotor control deficits are positively related to the difficulty of a motor task or exist independent of the increasing cognitive demand. methods: functional mri data was collected from 40 individuals (20 non-treatment seeking chronic cocaine users, 20 age and gender matched non-drug using controls) as they mimicked an unpredictable finger-tapping sequence at various speeds. dependent measures included task accuracy, percent bold signal change in sensorimotor regions of interest (rois), and functional connectivity (temporal correlations) between rois. results: in both groups, as speed increased, the bold signal change increased in the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area (sma), cerebellum, and anterior cingulate cortex. compared to controls, cocaine user sma-caudate and acc-putamen connectivity was lower at all speeds in the contralateral hemisphere. furthermore, as speed increased there was a decrease in connectivity between additional roi pairs among users. conclusions: these data support previous observations of sensorimotor performance deficits and dorsal frontal-striatal connectivity impairments among cocaine users. while previous studies demonstrate these deficits when performing a finger-tapping task at a single speed, we show that these same impairments exist at multiple levels of task difficulty. these data suggest that previously observed frontalstriatal connectivity in cocaine users during sensorimotor task performance are stable and not directly related to cognitive demands of the task.

medicare	background: the role of adjuvant chemotherapy (ac) within urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (ucub) patients after radical cystectomy (rc) is under debate. we assessed contemporary ac utilization rates. we also examined the rates of ac according to patient disease and sociodemographic characteristics. methods: we relied on the seer-medicare database for non-organ-confined, muscle-invasive t2 n+ -t4a ucub patients who underwent rc between 1991 and 2009 without neoadjuvant chemotherapy delivery. multivariable logistic regression analyses tested predictors of ac use; t-stage, n-stage, year of diagnosis, age, gender, race, radiotherapy (rt) administration, marital urban and socioeconomic status, tumor grade and charlson comorbidity index (cci). results: overall, 2681 patients were identified. of those, 667 (24.9%) received ac. the rate of ac were 21.4%, 23.5%, 24.6% and 29.9% over time (1991-1999 vs. 2000-2002 vs. 2003-2005 vs. 2006-2009) (p=0.002). in multivariable analyses stages pt2n+ (odds ratio (or): 4.7; p < 0.001) and pt3/4an+ (or: 4.0; p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (or: 1.9; p < 0.001), rt (or: 1.7; p < 0.001), married status (or: 1.4; p=0.001) and advanced age (or: 0.3; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of ac. neither race nor cci demonstrated significance. conclusions: in conclusion, we report lower than anticipated overall (24.9%) use of ac. nonetheless, the rate increased from 13.6% (1991) to 24.1% (2009). presence of lymph node invasion at rc regardless of t2 or t3/4a stage was the most important variable that increased ac use. older and unmarried individuals were less likely to receive ac. ac rates were higher in t2n+ ucub patients than in t3-t4a individuals.
autism	transgenic mice carrying mutations that cause autism spectrum disorders (asds) continue to be valuable for determining the molecular underpinnings of the disorders. recently, researchers have taken advantage of such models combined with cre-loxp and similar systems to manipulate gene expression over space and time. thus, a clearer picture is starting to emerge of the cell types, circuits, brain regions, and developmental time periods underlying asds. asd-causing mutations have been restricted to or rescued specifically in excitatory or inhibitory neurons, different neurotransmitter systems, and cells specific to the forebrain or cerebellum. in addition, mutations have been induced or corrected in adult mice, providing some evidence for the plasticity and reversibility of core asd symptoms. the limited availability of cre lines that are highly specific to certain cell types or time periods provides a challenge to determining the cellular and circuitry bases of autism, but other technological advances may eventually overcome this obstacle.
stress_management	this study investigated the relationship between emotional intelligence (ei) and burnout among architecture students. the sample of the study included 35 4th year students in the architecture department. in the study the emotional quotient inventory (eq-i) of bar-on was used to measure the emotional intelligence profile, and maslach burnout inventory (mbi) of maslach was used to measure the state of burnout. the ei level of architecture students was found upper intermediate with a score of 3,63/5. no relationship was found between the ei level of students and their gender, habitation, employment and financial welfare levels. the burnout status of architecture students was defined as intermediate with a score of 2,66/5. no relationship was found between the burnout status of students and their gender, habitation, employment and financial welfare levels. the statistical analysis of the data has revealed a strong statistically significant relationship, in the same direction between the emotional intelligence levels of the students and their burnout status. the study has also revealed a strong and statistically significant relationship between the burnout status and general mood and stress management subscales of emotional intelligence.
children's_health	background: exact determination between children 's sleep habits and their growth could help us to prevent this risk factor of children 's growth disorders. thus this research was performed to investigate the correlation between sleep habits and growth of preschool children in ahvaz-iran. materials and methods: in this cross-sectional study, the data was obtained by using available sampling from 208 children of 3-6 years old that came to a private pediatric clinic in ahvaz, south west of iran in 2015 without regard to their gender. measurement of height and weight of all patients with the meter and scale was performed. after measuring height and weight, stature-for-age and weight-for-age percentiles was calculated using child growth chart calculator of cdc for each child. information on the onset time of night sleep, time to wake up in the morning and nap duration of children were gathered using researcher made questionnaire. data analysis was performed with descriptive statistic and kendall 's tau-b statistical test using spss-19. results: results of this study showed of the 208 children that were evaluated, 32 of them (15.38%) was stunted, underweight, or both and 176 (84.6%) of them had n't any growth disorder. results of kendall 's tau test showed that there is no significant relationship between the onset time of night sleep, waking up time in the morning, nap duration and neither height-for-age percentile nor weight-for-age percentile of preschool children (p>0.05). conclusion the results of this study showed that children sleep habits does not affect their stature and weight-percentile. but this is n't mean that going to sleep late has no effect on children 's health, since the establishment of a normal sleep-wake rhythm is essential for both physical and mental development in children, so it is necessary to educate parents regarding the importance of children 's sleep.
ankylosing_spondylitis	purpose: to evaluate the effect of systemically used anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) medication on the thickness of corneal epithelium and stroma in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as). methods: a total of 125 eyes of 69 participants were included in this retrospective study of three groups: healthy participants (group 1), as patients receiving anti-tnf-alpha medication (group 2), and as patients receiving a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (group 3). results: according to anterior segment optical coherence tomography, the mean thickness of the corneal epithelium was significantly thicker in group 2 than in group 3 (51.6 +/- 3.2 mu m versus 50.4 +/- 3 mu m, p = 0.01), as was that of the stroma (475 +/- 33 mu m versus 443 +/- 29 mu m, p = 0.002). conclusions: anti-tnf-alpha medication and/or avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could improve the thickness of both the corneal epithelium and stroma in as patients.
children's_health	background and purpose: the awareness of and demand for neurological expertise in global health (gh) have emerged over recent years and have become more relevant due to the increasing numbers of refugees from developing countries arriving in europe. this study aimed to assess the provision of gh education and opportunities for international exchange during neurology post-graduate training with a focus on europe. methods: we developed a questionnaire covering different aspects of and interest in gh education on behalf of the european association of young neurologists and trainees. residents in neurology and junior neurologists (rjn) were approached to complete this survey. results: completed questionnaires were returned by 131 rjns, of whom 65.7% were women and 84.0% were between 26 and 35 years old. in total, almost one-third (29.0%) of rjns reported that their residency programs offered training in gh. limited education was reported for women 's or children 's health and neurological disorders of immigrants and refugees, as only 22.1%, 25.2% and 22.1% of rjns reported that such training was offered, respectively. the curriculum rarely included coverage of the global impact of neurological disorders. definite plans to volunteer in a developing country were reported by 7.6%. the majority of the participants acknowledged the importance of gh training and international exchange during post-graduate education. conclusion: this survey corroborates the interest in and appreciation of gh education by european rjns. however, there are shortcomings in training and opportunities for international exchange. academic neurology and international bodies, including the european academy of neurology, are requested to address this.
osteoporosis	nuclear factor i-c (nfi-c) plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes such as odontoblast and osteoblast differentiation. nfic-deficient mice showed abnormal tooth and bone formation. the transplantation of nfic-expressing mouse bone marrow stromal cells rescued the impaired bone formation in nfic(-/-) mice. studies suggest that nfi-c regulate osteogenesis and dentinogenesis in concert with several factors including transforming growth factor-beta 1, kruppel-like factor 4, and beta-catenin. this review will focus on the function of nfi-c during tooth and bone formation and on the relevant pathways that involve nfi-c.
osteoporosis	background: the fruit of lycium cliinense (lc), one of the most popular natural materials, has been used to counter the effects of musculoskeletal diseases in oriental medicine. in particular, this fruit is known to have antiaging effects, which is of significant interest to the research community. the purpose of our investigation was to observe and confirm the ameliorative effect of lc on osteoporosis, which was verified in this in vivo study. methods: female icr mice aged 5 weeks were surgically ovariectomized (ovx) to induce osteoporosis. after 7 weeks of induction, oral administration with i mg/kg and 100 mg/kg lc was continued for 6 weeks. at the end of the experiment, the levels of bone mineral content (bmc) and bone mineral density (bmd) were estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed; additionally, serum osteocalcin and calcium concentrations were analyzed. results: lc treatment significantly reduced the deterioration of bmc and bmd compared with ovx mice. histological analysis showed that lc ameliorated osteoporosis including the hypertrophy of the epiphyseal plate. additionally, decreased serum osteocalcin as well as the calcium levels recovered following the administration of lc. conclusion: these results demonstrated that lc ameliorates osteoporosis in ovx mice by improving several important parameters including bmc, bmd, and bone-turnover markers such as osteocalcin and calcium levels in serum. copyright (c) 2017, the chinese medical association. published by elsevier taiwan llc.
anxiety	aim: the aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the salutogenic health indicator scale (shis) in an adolescent population. methods: the investigation was performed among swedish students aged 13-15 years (n = 817; 58% girls). the shis was assessed for respondent acceptability, and its psychometric properties were evaluated according to classical test theory (regarding unidimensionality, targeting, reliability, and external construct validity). results: the adolescents found it easy to complete the questionnaire, which was completed in an average of 4 minutes. exploratory factor analysis, which is based on polychoric correlations, identified one factor, supporting the instrument 's unidimensionality. floor/ceiling effects were 3.3%. reliability estimates yielded a cronbach 's alpha value of 0.93; the test-retest reliability (n = 50; 2-week interval) coefficients were 0.89 for the total shis score and 0.52-0.79 for item scores. spearman correlations with other variables were based on a priori expectations (self-rated general health, 0.595; depressive symptoms, -0.773; anxiety, -0.577; and sleep problems, 0.519). conclusions: our observations support both the acceptability and the psychometric properties of the shis as a brief, unidimensional assessment tool for salutogenic health in adolescents. further studies using modern test theory are needed to better understand the measurement properties of the shis, including the functioning of its response categories and its comparability between adolescents and adults.
migraine	background: migraine has been recognized as one of the leading causes of disability in the 2013 global burden of disease study and seriously affects the quality of patients' life, current treatment options are not ideal. monoclonal antibodies to calcitonin gene-related peptide and its receptor (cgrp-mabs) appear more promising for migraine because of considerably better effect and safety profiles. the objective of this study is to systematically assess the clinical efficacy and safety of cgrp-mabs for migraine therapy. methods: a systematic literature search in pubmed, cochrane library and baidu scholar was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (rcts), which compared the effect and safety of cgrp-mabs with placebo on migraine. regarding the efficacy, the reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline to weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12; responder rates were extracted as the outcome measures of the effects of cgrp-mabs. regarding the safety, total adverse events, the main adverse events, and other adverse events were evaluated. results: we found significant reduction of monthly migraine days in cgrp-mabs vs. placebo (weeks 1-4: smd -0.49, 95% ci -0.61 to -0.36; weeks 5-8: smd -0.43, 95% ci -0.56 to -0.30; weeks 9-12: smd -0.37, 95% ci -0.49 to -0.24).50% and 75% responder rates (or 2.59, 95% ci 1.99 to 3.37; and or 2.91, 95% ci 2.06 to 4.10) were significantly increased compared with placebo. there was no significant difference in total adverse events (or 1.17, 95% ci 0.91 to 1.51), and the main adverse events including upper respiratory tract infection (or 1.44, 95% ci 0.82 to 2.55), nasopharyngitis (or 0.59, 95% ci 0.30 to 1.16), nausea (or 0.61, 95% ci 0.29 to 1.32), injection-site pain (or 1.73, 95% ci 0.95 to 3.16) and back pain (or 0.97, 95% ci 0.49 to 1.90) were not obviously changed compared with placebo control, but the results showed significant increase of dizziness in cgrp-mabs vs. placebo (or 3.22, 95% ci 1.09 to 9.45). conclusions: this meta-analysis suggests that cgrp-mabs are effective in anti-migraine therapy with few adverse reactions, but more and larger sample-size rcts are required to verify the current findings.
ankylosing_spondylitis	purpose of review we review the pathways, cytokines, and concepts important to the pathogenesis of bone resorption and formation in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and spondyloarthritis (spa). recent findings research in bone biology has shed light on the pathogenesis of the joint destruction that occurs in ra and in peripheral spa. however, understanding the mechanisms behind the bone formation seen in peripheral and axial spa has been challenging. mouse models have been used to gain an understanding of key signaling pathways, cytokines and cells regulating inflammation in these diseases. biologic therapies directed against these targets have been developed to control both inflammation and effects on bone. summary although biologic therapies improve joint inflammation in both ra and spa, leading to a decrease in pain and improving quality of life for patients, the long-term effects of such therapies must also be evaluated by assessing their impact on structural progression. inhibition of radiographic progression in both ra and peripheral spa has been easier to demonstrate than in axial spa. here, we discuss the similarities and differences among biologic therapies as they pertain to radiographic progression.
bipolar_disorder	the use of social networks has grown exponentially in recent years. the large amount of data available in these networks can be effectively utilized in many machine learning applications. this paper proposes a framework of an emotion recognition system that fetches huge amount of face images from the social networks into a cloud. in the cloud, the problem of the unlabeled facial images is handled by applying an active learning approach. for the feature extraction, an interlaced derivative pattern is used, while for a base classifier, an extreme learning machine is utilized. once the emotion is recognized in the cloud, it can be shared with the end users to meet their interests. several experiments were performed using some publicly available databases and heterogeneous images from the social networks. experimental results showed that the proposed framework may effectively be used in the emotion recognition.
stress_management	background: dementia care practitioner training is essential for professional caregivers to acquire medical knowledge and care skills for dementia patients. we investigated the significance of training in stress management by evaluating caregivers' job stress and coping style before and after they have completed training. methods: the subjects included 134 professional caregivers (41 men, 93 women) recruited from participants in training programmes held in kanagawa prefecture from august 2008 to march 2010. a survey using a brief job stress questionnaire and a coping scale was carried out before and after they completed their training. a t-test and multiple regression analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of the training. result: after the training, the scores of modifiers on the job stress scale and of the coping scale increased, whereas the scores of stress reactions on the job stress scale decreased. however, there were no changes in participants' subjective cognition concerning their workplace environment. furthermore, the change in stress reaction score tended to correlate with the change in consultation score in all participants and with the change in problem-solving and consultation in male participants. among female participants, the change in stress reaction score tended to correlate with change in support from superiors and colleagues as modifiers. the factors that correlated to the change in stress reaction score differed between genders. conclusion: the findings suggest that training caregivers improves their stress reaction and coping skills.
addiction	background and aims: to determine the relationship between the risk of exercise addiction (rea) and health status in amateur endurance cyclists. methods: in 859 (751 men and 108 women) cyclists and 718 inactive subjects (307 men and 411 women), we examined the rea (exercise addiction inventory), training status (volume, frequency, experience, and performance), socioeconomic status, quality of life (qol) (sf-12), quality of sleep (pittsburgh sleep quality index), anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale), and cardiometabolic risk: body mass index, physical activity (international physical activity questionnaire), physical condition (international fitness scale), adherence to the mediterranean diet (mediterranean diet adherence screener), alcohol and tobacco consumption. results: in total, 17% of the cyclists showed evidence of rea and 83% showed low rea. rea occurred independent of age, sex, training, and socioeconomic status (all ps >.05). regardless of rea, the cyclists displayed a better physical qol and a lower cardiometabolic risk than the inactive subjects (all ps < .05). the cyclists with rea displayed worse values of mental qol, quality of sleep, and anxiety than cyclists with low rea (all ps < .05). the rea group had better values of mental qol and anxiety and similar values of quality of sleep than the inactive subjects. the differences in mental qol between the rea and low rea groups were significantly greater in women (p = .013). there was no addiction x sex interaction in the other analyzed variables. conclusion: our results suggest that an increased prevalence of rea limits the benefits that amateur endurance cycling has on mental health and quality of sleep.
bipolar_disorder	the amygdala has attracted considerable research interest because of its potential involvement in various neuropsychiatric disorders. recently, attempts have been made using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to evaluate the integrity of the axonal connections to and from the amygdala under pathological conditions. although amygdalar pathways have been studied extensively in animal models, anatomical references for the human brain are limited to histology-based resources from a small number of slice locations, orientations and annotations. in the present study, we performed high-resolution (250 mu m) mri of postmortem human brains followed by serial histology sectioning. the histology data were used to identify amygdalar pathways, and the anatomical delineation of the assigned structures was extended into 3d using the mri data. we were able to define the detailed anatomy of the stria terminalis and amygdalofugal pathway, as well as the anatomy of the nearby basal forebrain areas, including the substantia innominata. the present results will help us understand in detail the white matter structures associated with the amygdala, and will serve as an anatomical reference for the design of in vivo mri studies and interpretation of their data.
crohn's_disease	case:zoe, a 13-year-old white girl, presents as a new patient to your pediatric clinic with complaints of frequent emesis, anxiety, and learning problems, and previous diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. parents accompany zoe and state, it is really hard for her to go out, she gets sick and falls easily. she was born full term by vaginal delivery without complications. given globally delayed milestones, she received early intervention services. feeding problems began at infancy, including gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration pneumonia.at age 2, zoe saw a neurologist and brain mri revealed cerebellar atrophy. she recently saw a geneticist and genetic studies are pending. parents report receiving little information regarding prognosis; through their own research, they read about individuals having similar symptoms in adulthood, with a degenerative pattern. they worry that zoe is still very young and we do not know what her future will be like.despite ongoing speech and feeding challenges, the parents report difficulty finding a speech and language therapist in their area. zoe does see an otolaryngologist for frequent otitis media and hearing loss and an ophthalmologist for vision problems. still, she continues to fall further behind in school. furthermore, she is intensely afraid of falling at school and has few friends, resulting in the family being at a loss regarding what to do about school.she lives with both parents and 2 healthy older sisters. her mother has crohn 's disease and has been unable to work. her maternal aunt is close to zoe and has hypothyroidism. her father works as an insurance agent and resources have been tight. zoe 's mother describes making zoe go out to the movies, otherwise she just stays home. zoe usually needs assistance to walk in public, to keep from stumbling. parents share that simply being in a public place or meeting a new physician may trigger emesis. zoe does enjoy interacting with neighborhood children and says she wants to be normal, wear nail polish, and date. she seeks independence, often refusing to use her wheelchair. parents feel she requires more intensive occupational and physical therapy.on examination, she is very slender with hypertelorism and nystagmus. holding an emesis bag, she gags intermittently, producing clear secretions. she has a notable tremor and walks slightly stooped with wide-based gait. her few words demonstrate articulation differences and cognitive expression characteristic of a younger child. she wears light make-up and age-appropriate clothes. she asks, when can i go home?at the end of the visit, parents share their worry that zoe is so young and we do not know anything, what to expect, or what to tell her. as the family 's new medical home, they ask you to weigh in on what to do next to best support her? where do you begin?
migraine	this study provides national prevalence estimates of us military veterans with severe pain, and compares veterans with nonveterans of similar age and sex. data used are from the 2010 to 2014 national health interview survey on 67,696 adults who completed the adult functioning and disability supplement. participants with severe pain were identified using a validated pain severity coding system imbedded in the national health interview survey adult functioning and disability supplement. it was estimated that 65.5% of us military veterans reported pain in the previous 3 months, with 9.1% classified as having severe pain. compared with veterans, fewer nonveterans reported any pain (56.4%) or severe pain (6.4%). whereas veterans aged 18 to 39 years had significantly higher prevalence rates for severe pain (7.8%) than did similar-aged nonveterans (3.2%), veterans age 70 years or older were less likely to report severe pain (7.1%) than nonveterans (9.6%). male veterans (9.0%) were more likely to report severe pain than male nonveterans (4.7%); however, no statistically significant difference was seen between the 2 female groups. the prevalence of severe pain was significantly higher in veterans with back pain (21.6%), jaw pain (37.5%), severe headaches or migraine (26.4%), and neck pain (27.7%) than in nonveterans with these conditions (respectively; 16.7%, 22.9%, 15.9%, and 21.4%). although veterans (43.6%) were more likely than nonveterans (31.5%) to have joint pain, no difference was seen in the prevalence of severe pain associated with this condition. perspective: prevalence of severe pain, defined as that which occurs ""most days"" or ""every day"" and bothers the individual ""a lot,"" is strikingly more common in veterans than in members of the general population, particularly in veterans who served during recent conflicts. additional assistance may be necessary to help veterans cope with their pain. published by elsevier inc. on behalf of the american pain society
smoking_cessation	we developed and validated an efficient and robust method for the simultaneous quantification of 44 fatty acid species in human plasma via gc-tof-ms. the method is characterized by its robustness, accuracy and precision covering a wide range of fatty acid species with various saturation degrees including short chain fatty acids (beginning with fa 4:0) and long chain fatty acids (up to fa 32:0). the fatty acids were methylated prior to analyses and subsequently detected as fatty acid methyl esters by means of gc-tof-ms. a highly substituted polar column allowed the separation of geometrical and positional isomers of fatty acid species. the method was applied to plasma samples of a strictly diet controlled clinical smoking cessation study including 39 smokers followed over the course of three months after having quit. statistical significant alterations within the fatty acid profile were observed when comparing the baseline (subjects still smoking) with one week, one month and three months of smoking cessation. after 3 months of smoking cessation, a partial recovery of alterations in the fatty acid profile evoked by smoking was observed. in conclusion, the developed fatty acid profiling method using gc-tof-ms has proven as a reliable tool for the quantitative determination of 44 individual fatty acid species within clinical studies.

mental_health	we used the moving to opportunity (mto) housing experiment to inform how housing choice vouchers and housing mobility policies can assist families living in high-poverty areas to make opportunity moves to higher quality neighborhoods, across a wide range of neighborhood attributes. we compared the neighborhood attainment of the three randomly assigned mto treatment groups (low-poverty voucher, section 8 voucher, control group) at 1997 and 2002 locations (4-7years after baseline), using survey reports, and by linking residential histories to numerous different administrative and population-based data sets. compared with controls, families in low-poverty and section 8 groups experienced substantial improvements in neighborhood conditions across diverse measures, including economic conditions, social systems (e.g., collective efficacy), physical features of the environment (e.g., tree cover) and health outcomes. the low-poverty voucher group, moreover, achieved better neighborhood attainment compared with section 8. treatment effects were largest for new york, new york, and los angeles, california. we discuss the implications of our findings for expanding affordable housing policy.
children's_health	introduction: oil spill exposures are associated with increased levels of depression, which is often measured using continuous scores or dichotomous cut points on screening tools in population-based studies. latent profile analysis can overcome analytic limitations such as 1) masking of heterogeneity in outcomes among people within dichotomous categories and 2) loss of information about symptom patterns among those with the same continuous score. this study examined variation in depressive symptoms and assessed the associations between depressive symptomatology and oil spill exposure, socioeconomic risk factors, and social capital. methods: between 2012 and 2014, we interviewed 2852 women in southeastern louisiana. we performed latent profile analysis then tested the adjusted associations between sociodemographic characteristics, oil spill exposure and latent class membership. results: results indicated a three-class solution in which classes varied by symptom severity as the best fit. the strongest associations were among women with the most severe depressive symptoms, who were less educated, were more economically vulnerable, and had the least social support compared to women with no depressive symptoms. limitations: this study is limited by its cross-sectional design and the self-reported nature of exposures and depressive symptoms, but results are consistent with prior literature. conclusions: our results support the conventional use of screening tools to estimate depressive symptomatology. nevertheless, the identification of subgroups within study participants highlights an important finding: the subgroups were comprised of characteristically different women with varying levels of depressive symptoms, a discovery that would have been overlooked if the ces-d was used conventionally.

bipolar_disorder	the rapidly-acting antidepressant properties of ketamine are a trend topic in psychiatry. despite its robust effects, these are ephemeral and can lead to certain adverse events. for this reason, there is still a general concern around the off-label use of ketamine in clinical practice settings. nonetheless, for refractory depression, it should be an indication to consider. we report the case of a female patient admitted for several months due to a treatment-resistant depressive bipolar episode with chronic suicidal behaviour. after repeated intravenous ketamine infusions without remarkable side effects, the patient experienced a complete clinical recovery during the 4 weeks following hospital discharge. unfortunately, depressive symptoms reappeared in the 5th week, and the patient was finally readmitted to hospital as a result of a suicide attempt.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: biologics seem to offer a promising nonsurgical approach in hidradenitis suppurativa (hs), especially in disease with highly pronounced inflammation. recent studies revealed increased expression of a broad range of cytokines in lesional hs skin, including interleukin (il)-17. objective: this study was undertaken to determine il-17 serum levels in this group of patients. methods: our study was conducted on a group of 86 patients between 16 and 72 years of age with hs. a total of 86 matched healthy volunteers constituted the control group. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to quantify il-17 serum concentration. results: the mean il-17 serum level of patients with hs was 3.68 +/- 2.08 pg/ml, which was significantly elevated (p <.0001) compared with that found in healthy volunteers (2.5 +/- 1.11 pg/ml). moreover, there was a tendency toward higher serum concentrations of il-17 in patients with more advanced disease (p = .005). disease duration; patient sex, age, and body mass index; and smoking habits were not determining factors for il-17 serum concentration. limitations: hospital-based study population was a limitation, as was a lack of posttreatment assessment. conclusion: in light of our findings and literature on increased expression of il-17 in hs lesions, evaluating the clinical effectiveness of using anti-il-17 agents in the treatment of patients with hs is justified.
hereditary_angioedema	background: hereditary angioedema (hae) caused by a deficiency in functional c1 esterase inhibitor (c1inh) is characterized by recurrent episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal/submucosal tissue swelling affecting multiple anatomic locations. previous studies demonstrated efficacy of recombinant human c1inh (rhc1inh) for acute hae attacks. objective: this study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rhc1inh (50 iu/kg) for the treatment of multiple hae attacks in an open-label extension study. methods: time to onset of symptom relief and time to minimal symptoms were assessed using a treatment effect questionnaire (teq), a visual analog scale, and a 6-point ordinal scale investigator score. results: forty-four patients received rhc1inh, and a single dose was administered for 215 of 224 (96%) attacks. median time to beginning of symptom relief based on teq for the first 5 attacks was 75.0 (95% ci, 69-89) minutes, ranging from 62.5 (95% ci, 48-90) to 134.0 (95% ci, 32-119) minutes. median time to minimal symptoms using teq for the first 3 attacks was 303.0 (95% ci, 211-367) minutes. rhc1inh was well tolerated. there were no discontinuations due to adverse events. no thrombotic or anaphylactic events were reported, and repeat rhc1inh treatments were not associated with neutralizing anti-c1inh antibodies. conclusions: a single 50-iu/kg dose rhc1inh was effective for improving symptoms of an hae attack with sustained efficacy for treatment of subsequent attacks. rhc1inh had a positive safety profile throughout the study. this study supports repeated use of rhc1inh over time in patients with hae attacks.

addiction	buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist and kappa antagonist which is used for the treatment of pain and opioid addiction. a mixture of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride has been approved for the treatment of opioid dependence. in this study a third order derivative spectrophotometric method based on zero-crossing technique has been used for the simultaneous determination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride in tablets. the measurements were carried out at wavelengths of 257.8 (zero-crossing point of naloxone hydrochloride) and 252.2 nm (zero-crossing point of buprenorphice hydrochloride) for buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride, respectively in the third order derivative spectra obtained in methanol and 0.1 m naoh (50: 50) as solvent. the method was found to be linear in the range of 20-80 mu g/ml for buprenorphine hydrochloride and 5-20 mu g/ml for naloxone hydrochloride. the within-day and between-day coefficient of variation and error values were less than 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. the proposed method was successfully used for simultaneous determination of these drugs in pharmaceutical dosage form without any interference from excipients or need to prior separation before analysis.
bipolar_disorder	methamphetamine dependence is a growing problem in australia and globally. currently, there are no approved pharmacotherapy options for the management of methamphetamine dependence. n-acetylcysteine is one potential pharmacotherapy option. it has received growing attention as a therapy for managing addictions because of its capacity to restore homeostasis to brain glutamate systems disrupted in addiction and thereby reduce craving and the risk of relapse. n-acetylcysteine also has antioxidant properties that protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity and it may therefore assist in the management of the neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive effects of methamphetamine. this commentary overviews the actions of n-acetylcysteine and evidence for its efficacy in treating addiction with a particular focus on its potential utility for methamphetamine dependence. we conclude that the preliminary evidence indicates a need for full-scale trials to definitively establish whether n-acetylcysteine has a therapeutic benefit and the nature of this benefit, for managing methamphetamine dependence.

digestive_health	a field enquiry mentioned the potential positive impact of a feed restriction on the health of young rabbits, but no objective information relates the intake to digestive health. the effects of a post-weaning feed restriction strategy were thus studied on digestive health and growth and carcass parameters of the growing rabbit, using a monofactorial design that produces a quantitative linear reduction of the intake, from ad libitum (al group) to 80%, 70% and 60% of al. the study was performed simultaneously in six experimental sites, on 1984 growing rabbits (496 per treatment) collectively caged from weaning (34 to 38 days of age, depending on the site) to slaughter (68 to 72 days). the feeding programme was applied as followed: restriction during 21 days after weaning, and then ad libitum till slaughter during the feed restriction period the growth rate was linearly reduced with the restriction level, by 0.5 g/day for each percent of intake reduction. when returning to ad libitum intake (after 54 days old) a compensatory growth and a higher feed efficiency occurred. therefore, the impact of the feeding programme on the slaughter weight (sw) was significant (-4.5 g/% of restriction), but relatively moderate: the weight loss of the more-restricted rabbits (60%) reached 7.7% (-200 g) compared to the al group. over the whole fattening period the feed restriction reduced linearly and significantly the feed conversion (fc) (-0.0077 unit/% of restriction). carcass traits were little affected by the feeding programme, except for a slightly lower decrease of the dressing percentage (mean: 1.2 units between al and the three restricted groups). on the six experimental sites, mortality and morbidity were always caused by acute digestive disorders, namely diarrhoea and/or caecal impaction. independent of the treatment, the mortality rate strongly varied according to the site (between 7% and 18% from weaning to 54 days and for the al group). during feed restriction, the mortality was significantly lower from a restriction threshold of 80% (meanly: -9% compared to al). the morbidity was also significantly reduced (-6%) for the two most restricted groups (70% and 60%). the favourable effect of a lower intake on health did not persist after returning to ad libitum intake (54 days to slaughter), since mortality and morbidity were not significantly different among the treatments. such a feeding strategy thus represents a double benefit in terms of feed costs and lower losses of young rabbits.
medicare	objectiveto examine the association between 10-year temporal changes in the primary care workforce and medicare beneficiaries' outcomes. data sources2001 and 2011 american medical association masterfiles and fee-for-service medicare claims. study design/methodswe calculated two primary care workforce measures within primary care service areas: the number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population (per capita) and the number of medicare primary care full-time equivalents (ftes) per 10,000 medicare beneficiaries. the three outcomes were mortality, ambulatory care-sensitive condition (acsc) hospitalizations, and emergency department (ed) visits. we measured the marginal association between changes in primary care workforce and patient outcomes using poisson regression models. principal findingsan increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with 15.1 fewer deaths per 100,000 and 39.7 fewer acsc hospitalizations per 100,000 (both p<.05). an increase of one medicare primary care fte per 10,000 beneficiaries was associated with 82.8 fewer deaths per 100,000, 160.8 fewer acsc hospitalizations per 100,000, and 712.3 fewer ed visits per 100,000 (all p<.05). conclusionsmedicare beneficiaries' outcomes improved as the number of primary care physicians and their clinical effort increased.
anxiety	this study investigates whether the augmentation of cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) with fluoxetine improves outcomes in anxious school refusing adolescents (11-16.5 years). sixty-two participants were randomly allocated to cbt alone, cbt + fluoxetine or cbt + placebo. all treatments were well tolerated; with one suicide-attempt in the cbt + placebo group. all groups improved significantly on primary (school attendance) and secondary outcome measures (anxiety, depression, self-efficacy and clinician-rated global functioning); with gains largely maintained at 6-months and 1-year. few participants were anxiety disorder free after acute treatment. during the follow-up period anxiety and depressive disorders continued to decline whilst school attendance remained stable, at around 54 %. the only significant between-group difference was greater adolescent-reported treatment satisfaction in the cbt + fluoxetine group than the cbt alone group. these results indicate the chronicity of school refusal, and the need for future research into how to best improve school attendance rates.
addiction	outcomes related to disordered metabolism are common in alcohol dependence (ad). to investigate alterations in the regulation of body mass that occur in the context of ad, we performed a genome-wide association study (gwas) of body mass index (bmi) in african americans (aas) and european americans (eas) with ad. subjects were recruited for genetic studies of ad or drug dependence and evaluated using the semi-structured assessment for drug dependence and alcoholism. we investigated a total of 2587 aas and 2959 eas with dsm-iv ad diagnosis. in the stage 1 sample (n=4137), we observed three genome-wide significant (gws) single-nucleotide polymorphism associations, rs200889048 (p = 8.98* 10(-12)) and rs12490016 (p = 1.44* 10(-8)) in eas and rs1630623 (p= 5.14* 10(-9)) in aas and eas meta-analyzed. in the stage 2 sample (n= 1409), we replicated 278, 253 and 168 of the stage 1 suggestive loci (p< 5*10(-4)) in aas, eas, and aas and eas meta-analyzed, respectively. a meta-analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 samples (n= 5546) identified two additional gws signals: rs28562191 in eas (p= 4.46* 10(-8)) and rs56950471 in aas (p= 1.57* 10(-9)). three of the gws loci identified (rs200889048, rs12490016 and rs1630623) were not previously reported by gwas of bmi in the general population, and two of them raise interesting hypotheses: rs12490016 -a regulatory variant located within linc00880, where there are other gwas-identified variants associated with birth size, adiposity in newborns and bulimia symptoms, which also interact with social stress in relation to birth size; rs1630623-a regulatory variant related to aldh1a1, a gene involved in alcohol metabolism and adipocyte plasticity. these loci offer molecular insights regarding the regulatory mechanisms of body mass in the context of ad.
children's_health	the notion that negative childhood experiences can be sources of toxic stress that have short- and long-term consequences for children 's health and well-being has gained increasing attention in recent years. the family environment can be a key source of stress, particularly when parents inflict pain on children; when that pain rises to the level of physical abuse the stress is thought to be toxic. in this article the author considers the possibility that nonabusive physical punishment may also constitute a source of toxic stress in the lives of children that affects their brain structure and functioning. the research linking physical abuse and physical punishment to children 's brain structure and functioning is summarized, and the article concludes with a discussion of implications for future research, policy, and practice.
medicare	purpose: to evaluate the impact of an array of nongeographic patient and within-year temporal factors on variation in medicare imaging utilization. methods: using the cms chronic conditions data warehouse, we identified imaging events nationally per 1,000 medicare beneficiaries from 2008 through 2014 on a quarterly basis. we also stratified imaging utilization by a variety of clinical and sociodemographic patient factors. data were summarized descriptively. results: on a quarterly basis from 2008 through 2014, mean and median imaging utilization were highest in the second quarter (878 and 885 imaging events per 1,000 beneficiaries, respectively) and lowest in the fourth quarter (844 and 846, respectively) of each year. imaging events per 1,000 beneficiaries increased progressively with increasing patient comorbidities (0 conditions, 511 events; 1-3 conditions, 2,033 events; 4-5 conditions, 3,188 events; 6+ conditions, 5,774 events). imaging utilization was also higher in dual medicaid eligibility beneficiaries than in others (3,855 versus 3,200 events) and in those eligible for medicare owing to end-stage renal disease versus age or disability (7,876 versus 3,225 and 3,501, respectively). imaging utilization showed additional variation with beneficiary age, gender, and ethnic group. conclusions: in the medicare population, the utilization of medical imaging varies greatly in association with a variety of patient and within-year temporal factors that have previously received little attention. as radiologists embark on risk-bearing contracts, the timing and length of such arrangements should be carefully considered, as well as specific features of the patient population attributed to their practices.
osteoporosis	collagen crosslinking is an important determinant of the quality of bone material. we have previously shown that suppressed bone turnover by high doses of minodronic acid and alendronate increases compressive strength of vertebra, but also increases microdamage accumulation, in monkey bone. the aim of this study is to examine the effects of these bisphosphonates on collagen crosslinks and intrinsic material properties, in addition to microdamage accumulation, in vertebral cancellous bone in ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys. sixty female monkeys aged 9-17 years were divided into five groups: sham and ovariectomized groups were treated daily for 17 months with lactose vehicle, and the other three groups were given minodronic acid daily at 0.015 or 0.15 mg/kg or alendronate daily at 0.5 mg/kg orally. after sacrifice, lumbar vertebrae were subjected to histomorphometry, microdamage measurement, analysis of collagen crosslinking and compressive mechanical tests. minodronic acid caused dose-dependent suppression of increased bone remodeling due to ovariectomy, and low-dose minodronic acid suppressed remodeling same level as alendronate. however, low-dose minodronic acid did not change microdamage accumulation, collagen maturity and the pentosidine level, whereas high-dose minodronic acid and alendronate increased these parameters. compressive ultimate load was increased following high-dose minodronic acid and alendronate, but no treatment altered the reduction in intrinsic material properties caused by ovariectomy. these findings suggest that deterioration of bone material and formation of pentosidine and microdamage induced by minodronic acid is less than that expected based on the extent of remodeling suppression, in comparison with alendronate, but this was not reflected in any significant change of mechanical properties.

children's_health	the united nations convention on the rights of the child has inspired numerous initiatives to recognize children 's health-related rights. whereas children 's rights have served as the dominant moral framework for child health concerns in europe, pediatric bioethics has emerged as the principal framework used in north america. despite their similarities, these two frameworks differ significantly. children 's rights initiatives tend to be universalist, highlighting substantive standards for all children, while pediatric bioethics has developed norms, models, and procedures for the ethical analysis and management of individual cases. the aim of this article is to critically examine the respective contributions and intersections of children 's rights and pediatric bioethics moral frameworks in child health. we describe our collaboration bridging our work with these two frameworks to address pediatric health-care concerns in the republic of georgia. we conclude with recommendations for how the complementarity of these two frameworks can be further bridged and promoted internationally.
lymphoma	chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroid (clippers) was first described in 2010. the characteristic clinical picture, radiological distribution and steroid response have been well-described in previous reports. however, the underlying pathogenesis and nosological position of clippers in the cns require further investigation for the primary cns lymphoma have been identified by autopsy subsequently. here, we report a 51-year-old woman who was diagnosed with clippers but progressed to primary cns lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which supports that clippers is not just an inflammatory cns disorder.

asthma	novel biologic agents have allowed clinicians to achieve improved patient outcomes. appropriate pharmacoeconomic analyses demand evaluation of all relevant costs, including the treatments, the disease and comorbidities, and costs of alternative treatments, including their short- and long-term side effects. only with complete data can the value of therapies be correctly estimated. by assessing costs, pharmacoeconomic studies complement studies of efficacy and safety, helping to determine the relationships of treatment and outcome. this article provides a broad framework for understanding and evaluating published economic analyses and identifying the key costs and benefits caring for patients with asthma and other immune diseases.
anxiety	generalized anxiety disorder (gad), a common mental disorder, has several treatment options including pregabalin. not all patients respond to treatment; quickly determining which patients will respond is an important treatment goal. patient-level data were pooled from nine phase ii and iii randomized, double-blind, short-term, placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin for the treatment of gad. efficacy outcomes included the change from baseline in the hamilton anxiety scale (ham-a) total score and psychic and somatic subscales. predictive modelling assessed baseline characteristics and early clinical responses to determine those predictive of clinical improvement at endpoint. a total of 2155 patients were included in the analysis (1447 pregabalin, 708 placebo). pregabalin significantly improved the ham-a total score compared with the placebo at endpoint, treatment difference (95% confidence interval), -2.61 (-3.21 to -2.01), p<0.0001. pregabalin significantly improved ham-a psychic and somatic scores compared with placebo, -1.52 (-1.85 to -1.18), p= 30% improvement in ham-a total, psychic or somatic score) was predictive of an endpoint greater than or equal to 50% improvement in the ham-a total score. pregabalin is an effective treatment option for patients with gad. patients with early response to pregabalin are more likely to respond significantly at endpoint. copyright (c) 2016 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
asthma	the state of qatar experienced a sandstorm on the night of april 1, 2015, lasting approximately 12 hours, with winds of more than 100 km/h and average particulate matter of approximately 10 m in diameter. the emergency department (ed) of the main tertiary hospital in qatar managed 62% of the total emergency calls and those of higher triage order. the peak load of patients during the event manifested approximately 6 hours after the onset. the major emergency command centre of the hospital ensured the department was maximally organized in terms of disaster management, and established protocols were brought into action. multiple timely meetings were convened in efforts to effectively execute plans that included rapid emergency medical services handover time, resourcing staff, maximizing bed space, preventing dust entry in the ed, bypassing certain administrative processes, canceling day-surgeries that did not affect inpatient morbidity, and procuring additional respiratory equipment. patients arrived mainly with exacerbations of asthma and respiratory distress, ophthalmic emergencies, and vehicular trauma; surprisingly, the incidence of pedestrian injuries did not vary.
crohn's_disease	background & aims: the hygiene hypothesis (a lack of childhood exposure to microorganisms increases susceptibility to allergic diseases by altering immune development) has been proposed as an explanation for the increasing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, there are few data on the relationship between oral hygiene and development of ibd, and study results have been inconsistent. we investigated the association between poor oral health and risks of ibd, ulcerative colitis (uc), and crohn 's disease (cd). methods: we performed a population-based cohort study of 20,162 individuals followed for 40 years (from 1973 to 2012). residents of 2 municipalities of uppsala county, sweden (n = 30,118), 15 years or older, were invited, and among them 20,333 were examined for tooth loss, dental plaques, and oral mucosal lesions at the time of study entry. other exposure data were collected from questionnaires. patients who later developed ibd (uc or cd) were identified by international classification codes from swedish national patient and cause of death registers. cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for ibd, uc, and cd. results: from national patient and cause of death registers, we identified 209 individuals who developed ibd (142 developed uc and 67 developed cd), with an incidence rate of 37.3 per 100,000 person-years. we found an inverse relationship between poor oral health and ibd, especially in individuals with severe oral problems. loss of 5-6 teeth of the 6 teeth examined was associated with a lower risk of ibd (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.98). having dental plaques that covered more than 33% of tooth surface was negatively associated with cd (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.97). conclusions: in a population-based cohort study of more than 20,000 people in sweden, we associated poor oral health with reduced risk of future ibd.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd) affects individuals across all racial and ethnic groups, yet rates of diagnosis are disproportionately higher for black and hispanic children. caregivers of children with asd experience significant stressors, which have been associated with parental strain, inadequate utilization of mental health services and lower quality of life. the family peer advocate (fpa) model has been utilized across service delivery systems to provide family-to-family support, facilitate engagement, and increase access to care. this study used a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of fpas in a racially and ethnically diverse sample. results demonstrate significantly increased knowledge of asd and reduced levels of stress for caregivers who received the fpa intervention as compared to treatment as usual.
atopic_dermatitis	background: atopic dermatitis (ad) is caused by a complex interplay between immune and barrier abnormalities. murine models of ad are essential for preclinical assessments of new treatments. although many models have been used to simulate ad, their transcriptomic profiles are not fully understood, and a comparison of these models with the human ad transcriptomic fingerprint is lacking. objective: we sought to evaluate the transcriptomic profiles of 6 common murine models and determine how they relate to human ad skin. methods: transcriptomic profiling was performed by using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr on biopsy specimens from nc/nga, flaky tail, flg-mutated, ovalbumin-challenged, oxazolone-challenged, and il-23-injected mice. gene expression data of patients with ad, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis were obtained from previous patient cohorts. criteria of a fold change of 2 or greater and a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less were used for gene arrays. results: il-23-injected, nc/nga, and oxazolone-challenged mice show the largest homology with our human meta-analysisderived ad transcriptome (37%, 18%, 17%, respectively). similar to human ad, robust t(h)1, t(h)2, and also t(h)17 activation are seen in il-23-injected and nc/nga mice, with similar but weaker inflammation in ovalbumin-challenged mice. oxazolone-challenged mice show a th1-centered reaction, and flaky tail mice demonstrate a strong th17 polarization. flg-mutated mice display filaggrin downregulation without significant inflammation. conclusion: no single murine model fully captures all aspects of the ad profile; instead, each model reflects different immune or barrier disease aspects. overall, among the 6 murine models, il-23-injected mice best simulate human ad; still, the translational focus of the investigation should determine which model is most applicable.
autism	the present study examined authoritative parenting and associations with parenting sense of competence and social support in chinese mothers of children with intellectual disability and mothers of typically developing children. one hundred and sixty-seven mothers of children with intellectual disability with a mean age of 10.89 years (sd = 1.74) and 119 mothers of typically developing children with a mean age of 10.55 years (sd = 1.10) participated in a survey. mothers of children with intellectual disability reported similar levels of parental warmth, and less use of reasoning and autonomy support compared with mothers of typically developing children. parenting efficacy contributed uniquely to three dimensions of authoritative parenting for mothers of children with intellectual disability. by comparison, parenting efficacy did not contribute to use of reasoning and autonomy support for mothers of typically developing children. social support made a unique but small contribution to parental warmth but not to parental reasoning and autonomy support for mothers of children with intellectual disability. for mothers of typically developing children, social support was associated with both parental warmth and autonomy support. this study suggests that child disability status is related to maternal authoritative parenting, and additionally, parenting efficacy plays a more critical role in predicting authoritative parenting of chinese mothers of children with intellectual disability than mothers of typically developing children.
dementia	progranulin (grn) gene mutations have been genetically associated with frontotemporal dementia (ftd) and are present in about 23% of patients with familial ftd. however, the neurobiology of this secreted glycoprotein remains unclear. here, we report the identification of 3 pedigrees of southern italian extraction in whom ftd segregates with autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. we present evidence that all the available patients in these 3 familial cases are carrying the rare grn gene exon 6 deletion g10325_ 10331delctgctgt (relative to nt 1 in ng_007886.1), alias cys157lysfsx97. this mutation was previously described in 2 sporadic cases but was never associated with familial cases. our patients demonstrate heterogeneous clinical phenotypes, such as the behavioral variant (bvftd) in the affected men and the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvppa) in the affected woman. haploinsufficiency was revealed by both quantitative real-time pcr of the gene and protein analyses. these findings provide further support for a previously proposed role for the grn gene in the genetic etiology of ftd and its phenotypic variability.

smoking_cessation	varenicline is a smoking cessation aid for which limited data exist concerning safety during human pregnancy. this multicentre prospective observational comparative cohort study was undertaken using surveillance data collected by the european network of teratology information services. the study sample consisted of 89 varenicline exposed pregnancies and two matched comparator groups; 267 nonteratogen exposed (nte) controls and 78 exposed to nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion (nrt/13) for smoking cessation. for all exposed pregnancies, varenicline use only occurred in the first trimester, with a considerable proportion discontinuing use in the very early stages of pregnancy. the major congenital malformation rate (n=2/89, 2.25%) was in keeping with the expected background rate (2-4%), and was not significantly increased for first trimester varenicline-exposed infants in comparison with non-exposed controls (vs. nte: or 2.02, 95%ci 0.166 to 17.9, vs. nrt/b: or 0.874, 95%ci 0.0620 to 12.3). however, the small sample size produced very imprecise risk estimates.(c) 2016 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
anxiety	major axis-i disorders including major depressive disorder (mdd), bipolar disorder (bd), anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia are associated with a host of aberrations in the way social stimuli are processed. face perception tasks are often used in neuroimaging research of emotion processing in both healthy and patient populations, and to date, there exists a mounting body of evidence, both behavioral and within the brain, indicating that emotional faces compared to neutral faces are processed abnormally by those with axis-i disorders relative to healthy control (hc) groups. the use of neutral faces as a baseline control condition is predicated on the assumption that neutral faces are processed in the same way hcs and individuals with major axis-i disorders. in this paper, existing fmri studies examining the way neutral faces are processed in groups with axis-i disorders involving socioaffective perception are reviewed. in reviewing available studies, a consistent pattern of results demonstrated that these disorders are associated with abnormal frontolimbic activity in response to neutral faces and in particular within the amygdala and prefrontal regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and anterior cingulate cortex (acc) compared to hc groups. specifically, increased amygdala activation was consistently reported in response to neutral faces in anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. abnormal medial pfc activity was reported in patients with mdd, and patients with bd exhibit decreased activity in the dlpfc and acc relative to hcs. in addition, specific suggestions to overcome these obstacles with new research and additional analyses are discussed.
crohn's_disease	background: patients with crohn 's disease have a higher failure rate after ileal pouch surgery compared with their counterparts with ulcerative colitis. objective: we hypothesized that risk of continent ileostomy failure can be stratified based on the timing of crohn 's disease diagnosis and aimed to assess long-term outcomes. design: this was a retrospective cohort study. settings: the investigation took place in a high-volume, specialized colorectal surgery department. patients: patients with crohn 's disease who underwent continent ileostomy surgery between 1978 and 2013 were evaluated. main outcome measures: functional outcomes, postoperative complications, requirement of revision surgery, and continent ileostomy failure were analyzed. results: there were 48 patients (14 male patients) with a median age of 33 years at the time of continent ileostomy creation. crohn 's disease diagnosis was before continent ileostomy (intentional) in 15 or made in a delayed fashion at a median 4 years after continent ileostomy in 33 patients. median follow-up was 19 years (range, 1-33 y) after index continent ileostomy creation. major and minor revisions were performed in 40 (83%) and 13 patients (27%). complications were fistula (n = 20), pouchitis (n = 16), valve slippage (n = 15), hernia (n = 9), afferent limb stricture (n = 9), difficult intubation (n = 8), incontinence (n = 7), bowel obstruction (n = 7), valve stricture (n = 5), leakage (n = 4), bleeding (n = 3), and valve prolapse (n = 3). median cleveland global quality-of-life score was 0.8. continent ileostomy failure occurred in 22 patients (46%). based on kaplan-meier estimates, continent ileostomy survival was 48 % (95% ci, 33%-63%) at 20 years. continent ileostomy failure was similar regardless of timing of diagnosis of crohn 's disease (p = 0.533). limitations: this study was limited by its retrospective and nonrandomized nature. conclusions: outcomes of continent ileostomy in patients with crohn 's disease are poor, regardless of the timing of diagnosis. very careful consideration should be given by both the surgeon and the patient before undertaking this procedure in patients with crohn 's disease.
autism	difficulties with figurative language comprehension were documented in adult dyslexia (dys). in the present research, we investigated the comprehension and generation of metaphors in 37 children, 35 adolescents, and 34 adults with and without dys. we also tested the contribution of executive function to metaphor processing. a multiple-choice questionnaire with conventional and novel metaphors was used to assess comprehension; a concept-explanation task was used to test conventional and novel metaphor generation (verbal creativity). the findings indicated differences between the dyslexic children and the control group in conventional metaphor comprehension. however, both groups performed similarly in the novel metaphor comprehension test. furthermore, although children and adolescents with dys showed similar performance in metaphor generation as their typically developing peers, adults with dys generated more metaphors than controls. while scores on tests of verbal knowledge and mental flexibility contributed to the prediction of conventional metaphor comprehension, scores on non-verbal tests and mental flexibility contributed to the prediction of novel metaphor generation. our findings suggest that individuals with dys are not impaired in novel metaphor comprehension and metaphor generation and that metaphor comprehension and generation utilize different cognitive resources. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
lymphoma	background: the purpose of this study is to characterize the risk of cancer in a large cohort of patients with primary sjogren syndrome (sjs). methods: we had analyzed the development of cancer in 1300 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 sjs classification criteria. the baseline clinical and immunological characteristics and systemic activity (essdai scores) were assessed at diagnosis as predictors of cancer using cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis and gender. the sex-and age-specific standardized incidence ratios (sir) of cancer were estimated from 2012 spanish mortality data. results: after a mean follow-up of 91 months, 127 (9.8%) patients developed 133 cancers. the most frequent type of cancer was b-cell lymphoma (including 27 malt and 19 non-malt b-cell lymphomas). systemic activity at diagnosis of primary sjs correlated with the risk of hematological neoplasia and cryoglobulins with a high risk of either b-cell or non-b-cell lymphoma subtypes. patients with cytopenias had a high risk of non-malt b-cell and non-b-cell cancer, while those with low c3 levels had a high risk of malt lymphomas and those with monoclonal gammopathy and low c4 levels had a high risk of non-malt lymphomas. the estimated sir for solid cancer was 1. 13 and 11.02 for hematological cancer. sirs for specific cancers were 36.17 for multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases, 19.41 for hodgkin lymphoma, 6.04 for other non-hodgkin lymphomas, 5.17 for thyroid cancer, 4.81 for cancers of the lip and oral cavity, and 2.53 for stomach cancer. conclusions: one third of cancers developed by patients with primary sjs are b-cell lymphomas. the prognostic factors identified at sjs diagnosis differed according to the subtype of b-cell lymphoma developed. primary sjs is also associated with the development of some non-hematological cancers (thyroid, oral cavity, and stomach).
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, downregulates intracellular inflammatory mediator synthesis by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. the palace 2 trial evaluated apremilast efficacy and safety in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (psa) despite prior conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or biologic therapy. methods. eligible patients were randomized (1: 1: 1) to placebo, apremilast 20 mg bid, or apremilast 30 mg bid. at week 16, patients with swollen and tender joint count improvement20% improvement in american college of rheumatology response criteria (acr20) at week 16. results. in the intent-to-treat population (n = 484), acr20 at week 16 was achieved by more patients receiving apremilast 20 mg bid [37.4% (p = 0.0002)] and 30 mg bid [32.1% (p = 0.0060)] versus placebo (18.9%). clinically meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of psa, physical function, and psoriasis were observed with apremilast through week 52. the most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection. diarrhea and nausea generally occurred early and usually resolved spontaneously with continued treatment. laboratory abnormalities were infrequent and transient. conclusion. apremilast demonstrated clinical improvements in psa for up to 52 weeks, including signs and symptoms, physical function, and psoriasis. no new safety signals were observed. clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01212757.
asthma	background: asthma disproportionately affects minority populations and is associated with psychosocial stress such as racial/ethnic discrimination. we aimed to examine the association of perceived discrimination with asthma and poor asthma control in african american and latino youth. methods: we included african american (n = 954), mexican american (n = 1,086), other latino (n = 522), and puerto rican islander (n = 1,025) youth aged 8 to 21 years from the genes-environments and admixture in latino americans study and the study of african americans, asthma, genes, and environments. asthma was defined by physician diagnosis, and asthma control was defined based on the national heart, lung, and blood institute guidelines. perceived racial/ethnic discrimination was assessed by the experiences of discrimination questionnaire, with a focus on school, medical, and public settings. we examined the associations of perceived discrimination with each outcome and whether socioeconomic status (ses) and global african ancestry modified these associations. results: african american children reporting any discrimination had a 78% greater odds of experiencing asthma (or, 1.78; 95% ci, 1.33-2.39) than did those not reporting discrimination. similarly, african american children faced increased odds of poor asthma control with any experience of discrimination (or, 1.97; 95% ci, 1.42-2.76) over their counterparts not reporting discrimination. these associations were not observed among latino children. we observed heterogeneity of the association between reports of discrimination and asthma according to ses, with reports of discrimination increasing the odds of having asthma among low-ses mexican american youth (interaction p = .01) and among high-ses other latino youth (interaction p = .04). conclusions: perceived discrimination is associated with increased odds of asthma and poorer control among african american youth. ses exacerbates the effect of perceived discrimination on having asthma among mexican american and other latino youth.
stress_management	the aims of this review were to describe the self-management interventions used to improve risk factor control in stroke patients and quantitatively assess their effects on the following: 1) overall risk factor control from lifestyle behaviour (i.e. physical activity, diet and nutrition, stress management, smoking, alcohol, and medication adherence), and medical risk factors (i.e. blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose) and (2) individual risk factors. we systematically searched the pubmed, psycinfo, cinahl and cochrane database of systematic reviews databases to september 2015 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials investigating self-management to improve stroke risk factors. the self-management interventions were qualitatively described, and the data included in meta-analyses. fourteen studies were included for review. the model estimating an effect averaged across all stroke risk factors was not significant, but became significant when four low-quality studies were removed (smd = 0.10 [95 % ci = 0.02 to 0.17], i (2) = 0 %, p = 0.01). subgroup analyses revealed a significant effect of self-management interventions on lifestyle behaviour risk factors (smd = 0.15 [95 % ci = 0.04 to 0.25], i (2) = 0 %, p = 0.007) but not medical risk factors. medication adherence was the only individual risk factor that self-management interventions significantly improved (smd = 0.31 [95 % ci = 0.07 to 0.56], i (2) = 0 %, p = 0.01). self-management interventions appear to be effective at improving overall risk factor control; however, more high-quality research is needed to corroborate this observation. self-management has a greater effect on lifestyle behaviour risk factors than medical risk factors, with the largest effect at improving medication adherence.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms include social communication deficits and repetitive and rigid behaviours. the ""broad autism phenotype"" (bap) includes milder, subclinical personality and language characteristics. we explored the relationship between bap features, empathy skills, and friendships in emerging adults with or without a biological relative with asd. we found emerging adults from both groups with more bap features had less interest in and shorter duration of friendships. this relationship was mediated by empathy, such that those with weak empathy skills experienced the most negative friendship outcomes. this mixed methods study sheds light on the relational implications of exhibiting bap features and the importance of non-normative life events on friendships.

asthma	background: the economic burden of asthma, which relates to the degree of control, is sic 5 billion annually in italy. pharmacists could help improve asthma control, reducing this burden. this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medicines use reviews provided by community pharmacists in asthma. methods: this cluster randomised, multi-centre, controlled trial in adult patients with asthma was conducted in 15 of the 20 regions of italy between september 2014 and july 2015. after stratification by region, community pharmacists were randomly allocated to group a (trained in and delivered the intervention at baseline) or b (training and delivery 3 months later), using computerised random number generation in blocks of 10. each recruited up to five patients, with both groups followed for 9 months. the intervention consisted of a systematic, structured face-to-face consultation with a pharmacist, covering asthma symptoms, medicines used, attitude towards medicines and adherence, recording pharmacist-identified pharmaceutical care issues (pcis). the primary outcome was asthma control, assessed using the asthma-control-test (act) score (act >= 20 represents good control). secondary outcomes were: number of active ingredients, adherence, cost-effectiveness compared with usual care. although blinding was not possible for either pharmacists or patients, assessment of outcomes was conducted by researchers blind to group allocation. results: numbers of pharmacists and patients enrolled were 283 (a = 136; b = 147) and 1263 (a = 600; b = 663), numbers completing were 201 (a = 97; b = 104) and 816 (a = 400; b = 416), respectively. patients were similar in age and gender and 56.13% (458/816) had poor/partial asthma control. pharmacists identified 1256 pcis (mean 1.54/patient), mostly need for education, monitoring and potentially ineffective therapy. median act score at baseline differed between groups (a = 19, b = 18; p < 0.01). odds ratio for improved asthma control was 1.76 (95% ci 1.33-2.33) and number needed to treat 10 (95% ci 6-28). number of active ingredients reduced by 7.9% post-intervention (p < 0.01). adherence improved by 35.4% 3 months post-intervention and 40.0% at 6 months (p < 0.01). the probability of the intervention being more cost-effective than usual care was 100% at 9 months. conclusions: this community pharmacist-based intervention demonstrated both effectiveness and costeffectiveness. it has since been implemented as the first community pharmacy cognitive service in italy.
medicare	this article highlights social work, critical thinking, and an ethic of care in geriatric teamwork to promote generativity and the well-being of latinx elderly. we offer the tripartite paradigm of cultural humility, transformative complicity, and empowerment to reduce power imbalances between service providers, elderly persons, and their communities. a force field analysis considers the patient protection and affordable care act (ppac) and accountable care organizations (aco) to understand the restraining and driving forces affecting the institutionalization of inter/transdisciplinary teams. effective evidence-based models that humanize geriatric services are offered to counter the current biomedical emphasis of medicare/medicaid policies and less-than-responsive geriatric institutional and educational systems. we highlight bloom and farragher 's sanctuary model of compassionate and democratic practices to address the negative effects of moral entrepreneurship and ageism. the case of florence, an lgbtq (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and questioning) grandparent with multiple health issues, is analyzed from biomedical, person in the environment, and a strength-based perspective.
anxiety	purpose. china has a high prevalence of smoking, but the characteristics of social smoking in chinese college students have not been investigated. we examined the pattern of social smoking and explored the association between social smoking and personal cessation efforts and mental health factors among chinese male college students. design. study design was a cross-sectional survey. setting. p. r. china was the setting of the study. subjects. participants were a random sample of 1327 male college students. measures. all participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that examined their smoking behaviors and a group of specific mental health factors (loneliness, self-harm, suicide, depression, and anxiety). analysis. analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, (2) analysis, and multivariate logistic regression. results. of a total of 207 current smokers, 102 (49.3%) were identified as social smokers. compared with nonsmokers, social smokers had increased risks for depression (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.65). among daily smokers, social smokers were less likely to have an intention to quit smoking than nonsocial smokers (odds ratio, .08; 95% confidence interval, .01-.57). conclusion. this study reveals unique psychologic characteristics related to social smoking. college students are a particular group of interest because unhealthy behaviors initiated during adolescence may continue through adulthood. our findings provide evidence for future tobacco control intervention among this population.
atrial_fibrillation	background: primary cardiac tumors are rare and myxoma constitutes the majority. the present study summarizes our 30-year clinical outcomes of surgical myxoma resection. methods: between january 1986 and december 2015, 93 patients (30 men, 63 women; mean age, 54.7 +/- 16.6 years) underwent surgical myxoma resection. the most common origin site was the left atrium. surgery was performed via a biatrial approach in 74.2%, atrial septotomy through right atriotomy in 17.2%, and left atriotomy only in 8.6%. mean myxoma size based on longest length was 4.73 +/- 1.92 cm (range, 1.2-11.0 cm). results: the mean follow-up duration was 9.9 +/- 7.8 years (range, 0-29 years). in-hospital mortality was 3.2%. the most common postoperative complication was atrial fibrillation (4.3%). the 5-, 10-, and 30-year survival rates were 92.9%, 87. 2%, and 75.5%, respectively. recurrence occurred in two patients (2.1%), which were detected at 20 and 79 months after the first surgery, respectively. conclusions: long-term survival after myxoma resection was excellent and recurrence was rare. based on our experience, surgical method did not affect the outcome.
dementia	recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fmri) studies have provided strong evidence of abnormal spontaneous brain activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci). however, the conclusions have been inconsistent. a meta-analysis of whole-brain rs-fmri studies that measured differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (alff) between amci patients and healthy controls was conducted using the seed-based d mapping software package. twelve studies reporting 14 datasets were included in the meta-analysis. compared to healthy controls, patients with amci showed decreased alffs in the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices, bilateral frontoinsular cortices, left occipitotemporal cortex, and right supramarginal gyrus and increased alffs in the right lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left hippocampus, and left inferior temporal gyrus. a meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the increased severity of cognitive impairment in amci patients was associated with greater decreases in alffs in the cuneus/precuneus cortices. our comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that amci is associated with widespread aberrant regional spontaneous brain activity, predominantly involving the default mode, salience, and visual networks, which contributes to understanding its pathophysiology.

medicare	background: the prognostic value of heart failure specific and global health status before and after left ventricular assist device (lvad) implantation in the usual care setting is not well studied. methods: we included 3,836 continuous-flow lvad patients in the intermacs registry. health status was measured pre-operatively and 3 months post-lvad using the kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire (kccq) and euroqol visual analog scale (vas). primary outcomes were mortality/rehospitalization. inverse propensity weighting was used to minimize bias from missing data. results: pre-operative global and heart failure-specific health status were very poor: kccq median 34.6 (iqr 21.4-50.5); vas median 43 (interquartile range (iqr) 25-65). health status measures improved 3 months after lvad placement: kccq median 69.3 (iqr 54.2-82.3); vas median 75 (iqr 60-85). pre-operative health status was not associated with death (unadjusted hr for lowest vs. highest score quartiles: 1.09 (0.85-1.41) kccq; 1.12 (0.85-1.49) vas) or rehospitalization (unadjusted hr 0.83 (0.72-0.96) kccq; 0.99 (0.85-1.16) vas). three-month kccq was associated with mortality (unadjusted hr 2.17 (1.47-3.21); vas was not (1.43 (0.94-2.17). three-month kccq added incremental discriminatory value to the heartmate ii risk score for death (c-stat 0.60 to 0.66); vas did not (c-stat 0.59 to 0.60). three-month health status was associated with rehospitalization (unadjusted hr 1.31 (1.15-1.57) kccq; 1.24 (1.05-1.46) vas), but did not add incremental discriminatory value (c-stat 0.52 to 0.55 and 0.54, respectively). conclusions: these real-world data suggest that pre-operative health status has limited association with outcomes after lvad. however, persistently low health status after surgery may independently signal higher risk for subsequent death. further study is needed to determine the clinical utility of routinely collected health status data after lvad implantation.
psoriasis	perineal streptococcal dermatitis (psd) is largely known to be caused by group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gas). we would like to bring cases of non-gas psd to the attention of dermatologists, as there are implications for workup and therapy. we report 3 pediatric cases of psd: 1 caused by gas, 1 caused by group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gbs), and 1 associated with group c -hemolytic streptococcus (gcs). gbs and gcs are very rarely reported in pediatric cases of psd. the literature on non-gas psd is reviewed, which additionally revealed several instances of psd caused by group g beta-hemolytic streptococcus (ggs) and staphylococcus aureus. gbs, gcs, ggs, and s aureus are significant causes of psd to consider, particularly among adult patients, based on our encountered cases and the literature. if using rapid antigen tests to expedite the diagnosis of gas, we recommend supplementing with a lesional swab for bacterial culture and sensitivity as the rapid antigen test does not detect non-gas organisms. therapy should be tailored to the microbiologic cause.
bipolar_disorder	objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of psychiatric comorbidity and severity of dependence on health-related quality of life (hrqol).methods: one hundred and ninety-eight substance use disorder (sud) patients were recruited from an outpatient center that provides treatment for sud. the international personality disorder examination screening questionnaire (ipde-sq), mini international neuropsychiatric interview (mini), substance dependence severity scale (sdss) and health-related quality of life for drug abusers test (hrqolda test) were administered.results: patients with psychiatric comorbidity evaluated their hrqol more negatively than patients without psychiatric comorbidity. an analysis of the relationship between severity of dependence and hrqol scores indicated significant correlations among alcohol-, cocaine-, heroin- and cannabis-dependent patients. according to multivariate analyses, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, severity of dependence on alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, paranoid, borderline and avoidant personality disorders (pds) were observed to have a major impact on hrqol.conclusions: sud (severity of dependence on alcohol, cannabis and cocaine) and other mental disorders (anxiety disorders; mood disorders; paranoid, borderline and avoidant pds) are involved in the deterioration of the sud patients' hrqol. this study demonstrates the need for integrated treatment for sud patients. treating only a part of the problem (whether sud or other mental disorders are present) is insufficient for improving quality of life.
bipolar_disorder	g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) regulate many animal behaviors. gpcr signaling is mediated by agonist-promoted interactions of gpcrs with heterotrimeric g proteins, gpcr kinases (grks), and arrestins. to further elucidate the role of grks in regulating gpcr-mediated behaviors, we utilized the genetic model system caenorhabditis elegans. our studies demonstrate that grk-2 loss-of-function strains are egg laying-defective and contain low levels of serotonin (5-ht) and high levels of the 5-ht metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa). the egg laying defect could be rescued by the expression of wild type but not by catalytically inactive grk-2 or by the selective expression of grk-2 in hermaphrodite-specific neurons. the addition of 5-ht or inhibition of 5-ht metabolism also rescued the egg laying defect. furthermore, we demonstrate that amx-2 is the primary monoamine oxidase that metabolizes 5-ht in c. elegans, and we also found that grk-2 loss-of-function strains have abnormally high levels of amx-2 compared with wild-type nematodes. interestingly, grk-2 was also found to interact with and promote the phosphorylation of amx-2. additional studies reveal that 5-hiaa functions to inhibit egg laying in a manner dependent on the 5-ht receptor ser-1 and the g protein goa-1. these results demonstrate that grk-2 modulates 5-ht metabolism by regulating amx-2 function and that 5-hiaa may function in the ser-1 signaling pathway.
healthy_sleep	objective: insufficient and poor quality sleep is prevalent in children, and is a significant public health concern due to the negative consequences for health. certain sleep-related behaviours are associated with improved sleep, and sleep behaviours are amenable to efforts targeted towards behaviour change. parental educational interventions have been successful at improving parents' knowledge and children 's health outcomes in some areas of health, but no population-based educational interventions have been designed to improve parents' knowledge of healthy children 's sleep. this study aimed to design and test an educational tool to increase caregivers' knowledge of healthy children 's sleep in a primary care setting. setting: a hospital-based pediatric primary care clinic where children attend for well-child and sick visits. method: parents of 95 children aged three months to 12 years completed two surveys, one prior to and one after receiving the intervention. the surveys assessed children 's sleep habits (pre-intervention) and parental sleep beliefs and sleep knowledge (pre- and post-intervention). the intervention was a short, informational brochure. results: following the intervention there was a significant increase in parents' knowledge regarding children 's healthy sleep, and in the number of parents who planned to make positive behaviour changes regarding their child 's sleep practices. conclusion: simple written educational interventions may be effective tools with which to increase parents' knowledge and promote healthy sleep behaviours in children.
osteoporosis	background: nitric oxide and its metabolites, nitrate and nitrite, are important regulators linked to various diseases. we studied the association of fasting serum concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, combined as nox, without special diet, with the prevalence of various chronic diseases. methods: fasting concentrations of nox were assayed in a cohort of 1087 patients recruited to stress aging and health in russia study that represents male and female population in moscow, russia, over 55 years of age. chronic diseases were recorded based on anamnesis and additional assays were run to characterize immune status and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism odds ratios were calculated to associate nox concentrations with prevalence of chronic diseases in pooled deciles below or above borderline. results: nox over 44.7 mu m were associated with increased prevalence of various chronic diseases such as diabetes type ii, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, gout and thrombosis/stroke. nox 65.3 mu m and above were associated with lowered prevalence of osteoporosis. nox levels of 74.6 mu m and above were associated with significantly higher number of patients who abstain from consumption of alcoholic beverages. nox were not associated with cancer. conclusions: thus, fasting concentrations of nox in serum can be an important diagnostic parameter characteristic for specific chronic diseases.
atrial_fibrillation	purposeidentifying atrial fibrillation (af) in outpatients treated with oral anticoagulants (oacs) from claims databases is challenging when the outpatient indication is not available, as oacs are also prescribed for deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (dvt/pe) that may be treated in the ambulatory setting. an algorithm was developed to identify af in outpatients initiating oac from medico-administrative data. methodsamong patients initiating oac in 2013 in the french healthcare databases, those treated for orthopaedic indications were excluded. patients with a history of af or dvt/pe directly identified from available medical data, mainly hospital discharge diagnoses, were considered to be confirmed af or dvt/pe patients'. demographics of these patients and their healthcare utilization data prior to oac initiation were then included in a logistic regression model discriminating af versus dvt/pe indications. the final model selected, comparing c-index, provided an algorithm identifying af from among initially unclassified patients assumed to be either af or dvt/pe outpatients. resultsamong 256418 patients initiating oac, 37 388 were excluded; 61329 af and 59859 dvt/pe patients were directly identified, leaving 88488 unclassified patients. the final model (c-index: 0.93) included demographics, cardiologist prescriber, hospitalization for stroke, use of antiarrhythmics/beta-blockers/antihypertensive drugs and undergoing a holter/echocardiography procedure, thyroid function tests, but no d-dimer tests. with a specificity of 95% (sensitivity: 65%), 41% of the unclassified patients were assumed to be af outpatients. similar results were obtained on 250159 new users in 2014. conclusionthis algorithm combining inpatient and outpatient claims data performed relatively well to identify af outpatients initiating oac. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
atrial_fibrillation	the use of oral anticoagulation (oac) in the elderly population with atrial fibrillation (af) treated in long-term care (ltc) facilities is inconsistent. we examined the magnitude and sources of the gap between indicated and prescribed oac in the elderly population with af. we retrospectively scanned the electronic medical record (emr) and pharmacy data of 25 ltc facilities in ontario, canada. the diagnosis of af was drawn from emr. different attributable risk factors for possible failure to prescribe oac were examined. in total, 3378 active resident data were examined in the 25 ltc facilities. all the residents were ae65 years old with mean age of 85 +/- 8 years and 2449 (72%) were female. we identified 433 (13%) residents with af with mean age 87 +/- 7 years and mean chads2 score of 3 +/- 1. out of all residents with af, 273 (63%) were on oac therapy. residents were mostly treated with warfarin (n = 114 (42%)), rivaroxaban (n = 71 (26%)) or apixaban (n = 62 (23%)) followed by dabigatran (n = 26 (10%)). antiplatelet drugs as the only stroke prevention therapy were used in 88 (20%) residents, and 28 (6%) residents were on anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs. seventy-two (17%) residents were not on any antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy. none of the potential attributable risks identified consistently correlated with the failure to prescribe indicated therapy. this data set suggests that 37% of eligible elderly ltc residents failed to receive recommended stroke prevention therapies.
medicare	objectiveto compare two approaches to measuring racial/ethnic disparities in the use of high-quality hospitals. data sourcessimulated data. study designthrough simulations, we compared the minority-serving approach of assessing differences in risk-adjusted outcomes at minority-serving and non-minority-serving hospitals with a fixed-effect approach that estimated the reduction in adverse outcomes if the distribution of minority and white patients across hospitals was the same. we evaluated each method 's ability to detect and measure a disparity in outcomes caused by minority patients receiving care at poor-quality hospitals, which we label a between-hospital disparity, and to reject it when the disparity in outcomes was caused by factors other than hospital quality. principal findingsthe minority-serving and fixed-effect approaches correctly identified between-hospital disparities in quality when they existed and rejected them when racial differences in outcomes were caused by other disparities; however, the fixed-effect approach has many advantages. it does not require an ad hoc definition of a minority-serving hospital, and it estimated the magnitude of the disparity accurately, while the minority-serving approach underestimated the disparity by 35-46 percent. conclusionsresearchers should consider using the fixed-effect approach for measuring disparities in use of high-quality hospital care by vulnerable populations.
asthma	backgroundit is known that asthma is related to obesity but also to small birthweight. the objective of this study was to clarify this issue by assessing the putative relationship between the changes in corpulence between birth and childhood as assessed by body mass index (bmi) and asthma phenotypes. methodsthe following status in corpulence was assessed in 7781 schoolchildren using quartile of bmi at birth and at around 10 (9-11 years): underweight at birth and at around 10, underweight at birth and overweight at around 10, overweight at birth and underweight at around 10, overweight at birth and at around 10, and the reference group constituted by all the other children in whom corpulence changes were not extreme. determination of asthma phenotypes (allergic, non-allergic, and exercise-induced asthma) was based on a clinical examination including skin prick tests, an exercise challenge test, and a questionnaire. resultsthe risk of allergic asthma was higher in children with persistent underweight, children with persistent overweight, and children becoming markedly more corpulent. in boys, the risk of allergic asthma was significantly higher for the less corpulent children at birth, regardless of whether they remained so or become overweight. in girls, the risk of allergic asthma was significantly higher in those with persistent overweight. there were no significant associations between bmi changes and non-allergic and exercise-induced asthma. conclusionswe observed that some extreme changes in bmi, persistent underweight, and persistent overweight in childhood increased the risk of allergic asthma.
autism	this study investigated the extent to which life skills training was offered to middle and high school students with autism and life skills training needs after high school. a secondary analysis of the national longitudinal training study-2 (nlts-2) data was conducted in this study. this study found that the majority of the middle and high school students with autism (77.4%) had received life skills training in school. receipt of life skills training differed across students' gender, age, diagnosis of intellectual disability, and functional mental skills. students received life skills training in general education classrooms, special education classrooms, individual instruction, and community settings. life skills training was needed for the majority of the high school leavers with autism (78%).
mental_health	mandatory hiv screening of united states air force (usaf) personnel every two years effectively identifies incident cases, however testing frequency limits the ability to detect early hiv infection. identifying clinical indicators of hiv in the usaf population is necessary to develop a supplemental provider-based targeted testing strategy. we conducted a matched case-control study of male active duty usaf personnel with a new hiv diagnosis (n=452) between 1996 and 2011 matched to five randomly selected controls (n=2176). the relationship between clinical diagnoses, determined by icd-9 codes, and hiv infection was assessed using conditional logistic regression. in unadjusted analyses of icd-9 codes ever and within the last two years before hiv diagnosis, the conditional odds of hiv infection were greater in those with clinical signs and symptoms of hiv (cor 5.05, 95% ci 4.00-6.39), mental health diagnoses (cor 2.61, 95% ci 1.86-3.67), and sti diagnoses (cor 2.33, 95% ci 1.50-3.60). compared to those with 10 medical encounters in the two years prior to hiv diagnosis, individuals with 11-35 medical encounters (cor 2.19, 95% ci 1.73-2.79) and >35 medical encounters (cor 4.15, 95% ci 2.69-6.39) had a higher odds of hiv acquisition. in multivariate analyses, clinical signs and symptoms of hiv within the last two years of hiv diagnosis (cor 4.10, 95% ci 3.22-5.22) and ever having a mental health diagnosis (cor 1.97, 95% ci 1.44-2.70) remained significant (p<.01). clinical encounters, particularly those featuring clinical signs and symptoms of hiv or a history of mental health complaints, provide an opportunity for targeted testing as a supplement to mandated testing at two-year intervals. provider education to increase hiv testing in persons at risk would enhance early hiv diagnosis and potentially reduce forward transmission in the usaf population.
dementia	background: toxoplasma deprives host neuron cells from cholesterol and leads to its ability to potentiate dementia. apoe intermediates neuronal transmission of cholesterol, which is a key constituent for axonal development, redesigning occasions that are important for education and synaptic arrangement, development of memory and repair of neuron. the aim of this work is to investigate the effect of apoe genotypes on dementia associated with neurodegeneration in latent toxoplasma gondii in elderly population. methods: this study comprised: 133 patients with dementia (78 were positive for toxoplasma igg and 55 were negative) and 95 subjects as control group without dementia (30 were positive for toxoplasma igg and 65 were negative). all of them were subjected to a cognitive assessment, t. gondii seropositivity (elisa) and determination of apoe allelic forms (pcr). results: the apoe genotype distribution shows that the most predominant genotype is apoe3/3 and the most widely recognized allele is e3. both patients and control were further divided into toxoplasma igg positive group (n = 108) and toxoplasma igg negative group (n = 120). apoe4 non carrier, apoe 2/3 and apoe 3/3 alleles have highly significant differences (p < 0.001) between dementia and non-dementia patients in toxoplasma infected patients in comparison to non-infected ones. conclusion: toxoplasma positive patients have more risk to develop dementia regardless apoe4 carriage.

ankylosing_spondylitis	although total hip replacement (thr) has been proven to be effective, the effect of thr on employment in ankylosing spondylitis (as) in chinese population is still unknown. we aimed to demonstrate whether or not patients with as returned to work following thr and factors associated with the work ability after thr. we performed a retrospective study including a total number of 128 as patients undergoing thr between 2009 and 2013. presurgery and postsurgery data including disease state, work status, type of job, and time of resuming work were collected. factors associated with early return to work were assessed through ordinal regression. eighty-seven of 128 patients (68 %) were employed within 1 year before thr and 98 returned to work after surgery. among them, 21, 46, and 31 resumed work by 3, 6, and 12 months postoperation, respectively. multivariate ordinal regression showed that patients with unilateral thr, younger age, lower basfi score, employed presurgery, and low or moderate physical demand were more likely to resume work earlier. most individuals working presurgery returned to work after thr. for young as patients with hip involvement, thr is an effective treatment for improving and maintaining work ability.
stress_management	depression or anxiety in multiple sclerosis (ms) has been linked to a more severe course of the disease and higher numbers of relapses, in addition to poorer treatment adherence and exacerbated immune system dysregulation. recent investigations indicate that psychotherapeutic interventions for stress management, such as mindfulness-based interventions (mbis), could improve quality of life, depression, anxiety, and fatigue in ms patients. mindfulness fosters the ability to slow down and observe experiences as they truly are, which improves affect regulation. mindfulness is acquired through training; its advantage over other psychotherapeutic interventions is that effects may remain over time, since cultivating mindfulness depends on regular practising of abilities learned during training. the objective of this article is to review the current evidence of psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions, including mbis for stress management, and their beneficial effects on ms patients.

smoking_cessation	traditional hapten-protein conjugate nicotine vaccines have shown less than desired immunological efficacy due to their poor recognition and internalization by immune cells. we developed a novel lipid-polymeric hybrid nanoparticle-based nicotine vaccine to enhance the immunogenicity of the conjugate vaccine, and studied the influence of particle size on its immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic efficacy. the results demonstrated that the nanovaccines, regardless of size, could induce a significantly stronger immune response against nicotine compared to the conjugate vaccine. particularly, a significantly higher anti-nicotine antibody titer was achieved by the 100 compared to the 500 nm nanovaccine. in addition, both the 100 and 500 nm nanovaccines reduced the distribution of nicotine into the brain significantly. the 100 nm nanovaccine exhibited better pharmacokinetic efficacy than the 500 nm nanovaccine in the presence of alum adjuvant. these results suggest that a lipid-polymeric nanoparticle-based nicotine vaccine is a promising candidate to treat nicotine dependence.

mental_health	although universal screening for mental health difficulties is increasingly recognized as a way to identify children who are at risk and provide early intervention, little research exists to inform decisions about screening, such as the choice of informants and the type of information collected. the present study examined the incremental validity of teacher- and parent-rated (primarily mothers) symptoms and impairment in a non-referred sample of early elementary school children (n = 320, 49 % boys, ages 6 to 9) in terms of predicting impairment as rated by a different teacher 1 year later. teacher-rated symptoms and impairment and parent-rated impairment were each unique predictors of later impairment; however, parent-rated symptoms did not contribute to the prediction of later impairment above and beyond these other indicators. the results indicate that, when screening for mental health difficulties in the school system, impairment ratings collected across settings add useful information, but it may not be necessary to use parent symptom ratings when teacher symptom ratings are available.
osteoporosis	objectivesthe compromised capacity of bone healing in osteoporotic population renders a serious concern of patients and clinicians. this study aimed to investigate the influence of g-csf on bone reconstruction using an osteoporotic animal model. materials and methodssixty skeletal mature female spraque-dawley rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy (ovx) and were assigned into three groups (n=20). three months after ovx, defects of 5mm in cranial and 2mm in femur were surgically created on all the animals. the defects were left unfilled, filled with gelatin sponge (gs), or filled with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) infused gs. specimens were retrieved for histomorphometric and micro-ct analyses at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 after surgery. resultsat early stage of week 1 to week 8, the histomorphometric and micro-ct analysis demonstrated more advanced bone formation in femur in the control group; by week 12, all groups achieved cortical closure. in cranial bone, more advanced bone formation was exhibited in g-csf-treated group at both early and late stages, although this observation was not statistically significant. conclusionsthe results indicated that in osteoporotic bone, g-csf may advance bone healing in cranial bone where spontaneous bone formation was insufficient.
addiction	backgroundalcoholics anonymous (aa) is a world-wide recovery mutual-help organization that continues to arouse controversy. in large part, concerns persist because of aa 's ostensibly quasi-religious/spiritual orientation and emphasis. in 1990 the united states' institute of medicine called for more studies on aa 's effectiveness and its mechanisms of behavior change (mobc) stimulating a flurry of federally funded research. this paper reviews the religious/spiritual origins of aa and its program and contrasts its theory with findings from this latest research. methodliterature review, summary and synthesis of studies examining aa 's mobc. resultswhile aa 's original main text (the big book', 1939) purports that recovery is achieved through quasi-religious/spiritual means (spiritual awakening'), findings from studies on mobc suggest this may be true only for a minority of participants with high addiction severity. aa 's beneficial effects seem to be carried predominantly by social, cognitive and affective mechanisms. these mechanisms are more aligned with the experiences reported by aa 's own larger and more diverse membership as detailed in its later social, cognitive and behaviorally oriented publications (e.g. living sober, 1975) written when aa membership numbered more than a million men and women. conclusionsalcoholics anonymous appears to be an effective clinical and public health ally that aids addiction recovery through its ability to mobilize therapeutic mechanisms similar to those mobilized in formal treatment, but is able to do this for free over the long term in the communities in which people live.
bipolar_disorder	aims: bipolar disorder is characterized by behavioral changes such as risk-taking and increasing goal-directed activities, which may result from altered reward processing. patients with bipolar disorder show impaired reward learning in situations that require the integration of reinforced feedback over time. in this study, we examined the behavioral and electrophysiological characteristics of reward learning in manic and euthymic patients with bipolar disorder using a probabilistic reward task. methods: twenty-four manic and 20 euthymic patients with bipolar i disorder and 24 healthy control subjects performed the probabilistic reward task. we assessed response bias (rb) as a preference for the stimulus paired with the more frequent reward and feedback-related negativity (frn) to correct identification of the rich stimulus. results: both manic and euthymic patients showed significantly lower rb scores in the early learning stage (block 1) in comparison with the late learning stage (block 2 or block 3) of the task, as well as significantly lower rb scores in the early stage compared to healthy subjects. relatively more negative frn amplitude is elicited by no presentation of an expected reward, compared to that elicited by presentation of expected feedback. the frn became significantly more negative from the early (block 1) to the later stages (blocks 2 and 3) in both manic and euthymic patients, but not in healthy subjects. changes in rb scores and frn amplitudes between blocks 2 and 3 and block 1 correlated positively in healthy controls, but correlated negatively in manic and euthymic patients. the severity of manic symptoms correlated positively with reward learning scores and negatively with the frn. conclusions: these findings suggest that patients with bipolar disorder during euthymic or manic states have behavioral and electrophysiological alterations in reward learning compared to healthy subjects. this dysfunctional reward processing may be related to the abnormal decision-making or altered goal-directed activities frequently seen in patients with bipolar disorder.
psoriasis	psoriasis is a chronic relapsing immune mediated disorder of the skin. the disease presents itself with well featured clinical and histological characteristics however the aetiology of the disease still remains obscure. the current systemic therapies aim to eliminate the symptoms of disease rather than offering a complete cure. parangichakkai chooranam (pc), a siddha oral herbal formulation has been widely prescribed for the treatment of psoriasis. though the medication is highly prescribed by the siddha healers the mechanism of pc for the treatment of psoriasis remains to be elucidated. the current study utilizes an integrated systems pharmacology approach to decipher the mechanism of action of pc. the comprehensive network pharmacological approach resulted in the construction of a compound-target network which encloses 155 compounds and 583 protein targets. a disease-target network was constructed by assembling disease proteins and their partners. when the compound targets were mapped to the network their involvement as controllers of the disease and triggers of disease associated comorbidities were identified. a target-pathway network raised from the pathway enrichment analysis not only identified disease specific pathways but also the pathways mediating secondary complications such as skin hemostasis, wound healing, desquamation and itch. the present work sheds light on the mechanism of action of pc in treating psoriasis. this work not only highlights the pharmacological action of the formulation but also emphasis on safe herbal remedies offered by the siddha medicinal system.

psoriasis	while ustekinumab has been widely used as an effective biologic for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, no prospective studies have specifically investigated the clinical factors that may influence treatment outcomes with ustekinumab. this post-hoc analysis aimed to identify specific clinical factors that may influence treatment outcomes with ustekinumab in psoriasis patients. in the marcopolo study, 102 korean patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were analyzed to assess the influence of baseline characteristics as clinical factors on clinical response (improvement in psoriasis area and severity index by 75%/90% [pasi75/pasi90]) to ustekinumab. in addition, differences in pasi75 and pasi90 responses between the responder group and non-responders were evaluated at weeks 28 and 52. multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted clinical factors predicting treatment outcomes among patient characteristics. at week 28, there was a significant difference in pasi75/pasi90 response based on prior biologic experience, although the difference did not persist at week 52. in addition, after adjusting for the effects of relevant clinical factors, biologic experience was significantly associated with less pasi75 (odds ratio [or] = 0.14, p = 0.001) and pasi90 (or = 0.22, p = 0.036) responses at week 28. the presence of comorbidities was higher among non-responders than among pasi75/pasi90 responders at both weeks 28 and 52, but was not statistically significant. previous biologic use was the only clinical factor predicting less response at week 28, although it did not influence the clinical response after week 52. further studies are warranted to investigate the association between presence of comorbidities and clinical response.
dementia	this article describes an examination of the sociodemographic characteristics of adult children, particularly baby boomer caregivers, who provide financial care to older parents with dementia. the sample including 1,011adult children dementia caregivers aged 50 to 64 years is selected from a nationally representative sample in the 2010 health and retirement study. exact logistic regression revealed that race, provision of financial assistance to caregiver children, and the number of their children are significantly associated with financial caregiving of parents. non-white caregivers are more likely to provide financial care to their parents or parents-in-law with dementia; those who have more children and provide financial assistance to their children are less likely to provide financial care to parents with dementia. the current findings present valuable new information on the sociodemographic characteristics of adult children who provide financial assistance to parents with dementia and inform research, programs, and services on dementia caregiving.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. the aim was to assess the characteristics of psa, find out how well the disease is controlled in real life, demonstrate the treatments and identify the unmet needs. methods. the psa registry of turkey is a multicentre web-based registry established in 2014 and including 32 rheumatology centres. detailed data regarding demographics for skin and joint disease, disease activity assessments and treatment choices were collected. results. one thousand and eighty-one patients (64.7% women) with a mean (s.d.) psa duration of 5.8 (6.7) years were enrolled. the most frequent type of psa was polyarticular [437 (40.5%)], followed by oligoarticular [407 (37.7%)] and axial disease [372 (34.4%)]. the mean (s.d.) swollen and tender joint counts were 1.7 (3) and 3.6 (4.8), respectively. of these patients, 38.6% were on conventional synthetic dmard monotherapy, 7.1% were on anti-tnf monotherapy, and 22.5% were using anti-tnf plus conventional synthetic dmard combinations. according to das28, 86 (12.4%) patients had high and 105 (15.2%) had moderate disease activity. low disease activity was achieved in 317 (45.7%) patients, and 185 (26.7%) were in remission. minimal disease activity data could be calculated in 247 patients, 105 of whom (42.5%) had minimal disease activity. the major differences among sexes were that women were older and had less frequent axial disease, more fatigue, higher haq scores and less remission. conclusion. the psa registry of turkey had similarities with previously published registries, supporting its external validity. the finding that women had more fatigue and worse functioning as well as the high percentage of active disease state highlight the unmet need in treatment of psa.
osteoporosis	teriparatide is a drug for the treatment of osteoporosis which is licensed for use for up to 24 months. there is little experience with retreatment. the aim of this study was to evaluate, in three patients with severe secondary osteoporosis, the response to a second cycle of teriparatide regarding bone mineral density (bmd) and osteocalcin. case 1 : a 62-year-old woman with multiple vertebral fractures has received corticoids for a long time. after starting teriparatide, her bmd and osteocalcin increased. she then received ibandronate for 3 years but her bmd declined. after a second treatment with teriparatide, her bmd increased again (18%). case 2 : a 60-year-old woman with severe osteoporosis in lumbar spine (ls) (t-score - 4.5) had received corticoids for a long time and had celiac disease. after starting teriparatide, her bmd improved by 11.7%. she then received zoledronic acid for 15 months, but bone density decreased, so she was retreated with teriparatide. bmd had a slightly higher increase than after the first cycle (12.6%). case 3 : a 60-year-old woman consulted for osteoporosis (ls t-score - 5.3), several fractures, and hyperthyroidism. she started teriparatide with improvement in bmd (39%). after 24 months, she received ibandronate for 1 year, but as her bmd declined, she was retreated with teriparatide. bmd showed an increase of 15%. the indication of a second cycle of treatment with teriparatide in three patients was effective in increasing bmd. additional studies are needed to further identify the benefits and safety of retreatment with teriparatide.
digestive_health	we evaluate the effect of the crude protein source (of) in combination with 2 feeding strategies (al: ad libitum or r: restricted) on the performance, health status and carcass traits of growing-fattening rabbits (between 33 and 75 d of age). two experimental diets were formulated; the first containing soybean meal (sbm: 70 g/kg) as the main cp source and the second containing white lupin seeds (wls: 105 g/kg) as the main cp source. a total of 160 weaned hyplus rabbits (774 +/- 10 g live weight) were randomly allocated to the experimental groups, combination of feeding strategy and diet (al sbm, r sbm, al wls and r wls; 40 rabbits per group with 4 rabbits per cage), for 42 d. the feeding programme was applied as follows: both the al sbm and al wls rabbits were fed ad libitum for the entire fattening period, whereas the r sbm and r wls rabbits were subjected to feed restriction between 33 and 47 d of age (75% of the ad libitum intake). afterwards, all restricted rabbits were fed ad libitum until 75 d of age. regardless of the cp source, the feed restriction reduced the final live weight by 83 g, chilled carcass weight by 65 g, and dressing out percentage by 0.9 percentage points (p<0.05). there was a higher chilled carcass weight (+114 g; p=0.001) and reference carcass weight (+91 g; p=0.001) in rabbits fed with wls diet than in rabbits fed with sbm diet. no dead or morbid rabbits were observed in restricted rabbits during the restriction period. there was no effect of the diet on the health of rabbits. however when the rabbits of al sbm and al wls group were compared did we observe a lower number of rabbits at sanitary risk in al wls group (2 vs. 12 rabbits, p=0.006). in conclusion, the growth performance was not affected by the crude protein source, and no interaction between dietary cp source and feeding regime was observed. feed restriction regime did not improve sanitary risk index throughout the entire period.
atopic_dermatitis	background: the health education impact questionnaire (heiq) evaluates the effectiveness of health education and self-management programs provided to people dealing with a wide range of conditions. aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt and validate the dutch translation of the heiq and to compare the results with the english, german and french translations. methods: a systematic translation process was undertaken. psychometric properties were studied among patients with arthritis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma (n = 286). factorial validity using confirmatory factor analysis, item difficulty (d), item remainder correlation and composite reliability were conducted. stability was tested using the intra-class correlation coefficient (icc). results: items were well understood and only minor language adjustments were required. confirmatory fit indices were >0.95 and item difficulty was d >= 0.65 for all items in scales showing acceptable fit indices, except for the reversed emotional distress scale. composite reliability ranged between 0.67 and 0.85. test-retest reliability (n = 93) icc varied between 0.61 and 0.84. comparisons with other translations showed comparable fit indices. a lower icc on self-monitoring and insight scale was observed. conclusions: the dutch translation of the heiq was found to be well understood and user friendly by patients with rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma and to have robust psychometric properties for evaluating the impact of health education and self-management programs. given the wide applications of the heiq and the comparability of the dutch results with the english, german and french version, the heiq is a practical and useful questionnaire to evaluate the impact of self-management support programs in different countries and populations with different diseases.
stress_management	this exploratory study provides insights into everyday realities, concerns, and cultural perspectives of latinas undergoing chemotherapy, and elicits information on stress management and information needs. informed by a community-based participatory research approach using qualitative methods, we conducted ten interviews with providers, and two focus groups (n = 13) and 20 in-depth interviews with latinas recently diagnosed with breast cancer. providers and latina patients acknowledged multiple physical and emotional stressors associated with cancer treatment, viewed a positive aspect of the cancer experience to include connection with god and enhanced spirituality, saw family as a motivating factor for recovery, and expressed a need to draw on existing coping strategies. findings show considerable overlap between providers and latina cancer patients' perceptions of stressors during chemotherapy. however, a few notable differences in perceptions of stress management needs during this treatment period emerged. while latina cancer patients mentioned similar social/structural stressors (e.g., economic problems, lack of information) they tended to emphasize more of the interpersonal stressors related to family communication and relationships (e.g., providing and caring for family, distance from family), and intrapersonal stressors such as fear, changes in physical appearance, and side effects of chemotherapy. our study illustrates the importance of including multiple perspectives. the information gained by including both providers and patient perspectives yielded a more complete understanding of the stress management needs of latinas undergoing chemotherapy. findings suggest that stress management educational interventions should aim to develop self-care skills, be culturally relevant and language-specific, and build upon stress-reducing strategies latinas may already employ.
stress_management	objectivethis study aimed to assess the relationship between emotional social support and emotional well-being among latina immigrants with breast cancer and test whether two culturally relevant coping strategies, fatalism and acceptance, mediate this relationship. methodsone hundred fifty spanish-speaking latinas within 1year of breast cancer diagnosis participating in a randomized trial of a stress management intervention were assessed in person at baseline and via telephone 6months later. survey measures included baseline emotional support, fatalism, and acceptance and emotional well-being 6months later. generalized linear models estimated direct effects of emotional support on emotional well-being and indirect effects through fatalism and acceptance. resultsmean age was 50.1 (sd=10.9) years; most women had low education and acculturation levels. emotional support was negatively associated with fatalism (r=-0.24, p<0.01) and positively associated with acceptance (r=0.30, p<0.001). emotional support (r=0.23, p=0.005) and acceptance (r=0.28, p=0.001) were positively associated with emotional well-being, whereas fatalism (r=-0.36, p<0.0001) was negatively associated with emotional well-being. in multivariable models, emotional support was associated with emotional well-being (b=0.88, 95% ci: 0.24, 1.52). this direct effect remained significant when additionally controlling for fatalism (b=0.66, 95% ci: 0.03, 1.30) and acceptance (b=0.73, 95% ci: 0.09, 1.37) in separate models. there was a significant indirect effect of emotional support on emotional well-being through fatalism (b=0.21, 95% ci: 0.04, 0.51) as well as a marginally significant effect through acceptance (b=0.15, 95% ci: 0.001, 0.43). conclusionsemotional support may increase well-being among spanish-speaking latina cancer survivors by reducing cancer fatalism.copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
mental_health	self-esteem, generally regarded as an important indicator of adolescents' mental health, was assessed by a self-report questionnaire in a school sample of 593 subjects who had been assessed at 3 time points over 7 years between 11 and 25 years of age within the zurich psychology and psychopathology study (zapps). cross-lagged panel analyses of the longitudinal data from zapps indicated that self-esteem was predictive of internalizing problems and had an impact on internalizing symptoms when the analyses were adjusted for coping behavior, efficiency of social networks, and impact of stressful life events. self-esteem was also stable (r = .37-.60) within the observed age range, after controlling for prior levels of the predicted variables. the findings support the impact of self-esteem on mental health and indicate the importance of addressing self-esteem in prevention and intervention programs.
lymphoma	meta-analysis can average estimates of multiple parameters, such as a treatment 's effect on multiple outcomes, across studies. univariate meta-analysis (uvma) considers each parameter individually, while multivariate meta-analysis (mvma) considers the parameters jointly and accounts for the correlation between their estimates. the performance of mvma and uvma has been extensively compared in scenarios with two parameters. our objective is to compare the performance of mvma and uvma as the number of parameters, p, increases. specifically, we show that (i) for fixed-effect (fe) meta-analysis, the benefit from using mvma can substantially increase as p increases; (ii) for random effects (re) meta-analysis, the benefit from mvma can increase as p increases, but the potential improvement is modest in the presence of high between-study variability and the actual improvement is further reduced by the need to estimate an increasingly large between study covariance matrix; and (iii) when there is little to no between-study variability, the loss of efficiency due to choosing re mvma over fe mvma increases as p increases. we demonstrate these three features through theory, simulation, and a meta-analysis of risk factors for non-hodgkin lymphoma.
lymphoma	introduction: immunotherapy targeting the programmed death 1 (pd-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (pd-l1) checkpoint has shown promising efficacy in patients with nsclc. lymphocyte activating 3 gene (lag-3) is another important checkpoint, and its role in nsclc is still not clear. in this study we investigated lymphocyte activing 3 (lag-3) protein expression; its correlation with pd-1, pd-l1, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils); and its association with survival in nsclc. methods: the expression of lag-3 (epr4392 [abcam, cambridge, ma]) protein was assessed in 55 nsclc cell lines by immunohistochemistry. lag-3, pd-1 (nat 105 [cell marque, rocklin, ca]), and pd-l1 (22c3 [dako, carpenteria, ca]) protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and til abundance was scored in 139 surgically resected specimens from patients with nsclc. we also verified results in samples from 62 patients with untreated nsclc and detected a correlation between lag-3 expression and egfr and kras mutation and echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 gene (eml4)-anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (alk) rearrangement. results: lag-3 was not expressed on any of the 55 nsclc cell lines. however, lag-3 was expressed on the tils in 36 patients with nsclc (25.9%). sixty patient samples (43.2%) were positive for pd-1 on the tils, and 25 (18.0%) were positive for pd-l1 on tumor cells. neither lag-3 nor pd-1 was expressed on the tumor cells. lag-3 was overexpressed on the tils in nonadenocarcinoma compared with in adenocarcinoma (p = 0.031). lag-3 expression on tils was significantly correlated with that of pd-1 on tils (p < 0.001) and pd-l1 on tumor cells (p = 0.041) but not with til percentage (p = 0.244). with the logistic regression model, the ors for lag-3 were 0.320 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.110-0.929) and 4.364 (95% ci: 1.898-10.031) when nonadenocarcinoma was compared with adenocarcinoma and tils that were negative for pd-1 were compared with those positive for pd-1. recurrence-free survival was significantly different in patients whose tils were lag-3 negative as opposed to lag-3-positive (1.91 years [95% ci: 0.76-3.06] versus 0.87 years [95% ci: 0.27-1.47] [p = 0.025]). likewise, lag-3 status of tils (negative versus positive) did significantly affect overall survival (os) (3.04 years [95% ci: 2.76-3.32] versus 1.08 years [95% ci: 0.421.74] [p = 0.039]). using kaplan-meier analysis, we found that patients with both pd-l1-negative tumor cells and lag 3 -negative tils have longer recurrence-free survival than patients who are either pd-l1-or lag-3-positive or both pd-l1- and lag-3-positive (2.09 years [95% ci: 0.90-3.28] versus 1.42 years [95% ci: 0.46-2.34] versus 0.67 years [95% ci: 0.00-1.45] [p = 0.007]). in the verification stage, high expression of lag-3 was also significantly correlated with higher expression of pd-1 on tils (p = 0.016) and pd l1 on tumor cells (p = 0.014). there was no correlation between lag-3 expression and egfr (p = 0.325) and kras mutation (p = 1.000) and alk fusion (p = 0.562). conclusions: lag-3 is expressed on tils in tumor tissues of some patients with nsclc. its expression was higher in nonadenocarcinoma and correlated with pd-1/pd-l1 expression. lag-3 positivity or both lag-3 and pd-l1 positivity was correlated with early postoperative recurrence. lag-3 was related to poor prognosis.

psoriatic_arthritis	objectives: we examined rheumatologists' motivation for prescribing biosimilars, assessed their treatment preferences in relation to prescribing behavior and explored patient attitudes to biosimilars. methods: data were taken from the adelphi real world biosimilars programme, a real-world, cross-sectional study undertaken with german rheumatologists and patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis in 2015-2016. rheumatologists provided data on their prescribing behavior and attitudes toward biosimilars and invited the next eight eligible consecutive consulting patients to complete a questionnaire. rheumatologists were split into ""investigative"", ""conservative"" and ""other"" groups. results: overall, 50 rheumatologists and 261 patients participated. biosimilars accounted for95% of rheumatologists would prescribe a biooriginator rather than biosimilar as the first- or second-line therapy if unrestricted. patients showed some reluctance to accept biosimilars, and a small proportion of patients were unhappy when switched from a biooriginator to a biosimilar. satisfaction with treatment was highest in patients who started treatment with a biooriginator prior to biosimilar availability. patient concerns when starting treatment with a biooriginator or a biosimilar included not knowing enough about the drug (25%-41%), potential side effects (26%-32%) and potential long-term problems (19%-30%). conclusion: study results demonstrate that there is some reluctance from patients to accept biosimilars and the need to educate patients who are unsure to allow them to be involved in decision making, highlighting the importance of patient and physician communication. there remains a need for further research into nonclinical switching and the long-term impact of prescribing biosimilars.
mental_health	background: several research areas, including medical education (me), focus on empathy as an important topic in interpersonal relationships. this focus is central to the use of communication skills related to empathy and even more crucial to provide information in a way that makes patients feel more involved in the treatment process. psychoanalysis (pa) provides its initial concept of empathy based on affective aspects including findings from neuroscience and brain research. enhancing cooperation between me and pa can help to integrate both aspects of empathy into a longitudinal training program. discussion: the condition of psychoanalytic empathy definitions is the understanding of unconscious processes. it is important to primarily attend especially the dominant affects towards the patient before interpreting his or her behaviour, since in explaining the emerging affects, the analyst has to empathize with the patient to understand the (unconscious) reasons for its behaviour. a strong consideration of nonverbal communication, clinical perceptions, intuitive interaction, contagion-like processes and their implementation and empowerment in medical and therapeutic curricula is one way of beneficially using interdisciplinary approaches to yield empathy in clinical interaction. conclusion: established methods of pa, like training of containment, reflective functioning, affective holding and giving meaningful interpretations in accordance with countertransferential and transferential aspects may help to put a focus on the clinican-patient-interaction and the preservation of the physicians' (mental) health. in consequence of the discussion of various training methods that take the theoretical and practical concepts of empathy into account, we aim for an implementation of the named methods in the medical curricula.
osteoporosis	objective. the aim was to characterize sle medication trends before, during and after pregnancy and to compare other commonly used medications during sle pregnancies with non-sle pregnancies. methods. women with pregnancies ending in live birth or stillbirth were identified from the swedish medical birth register (2006-12). national registers were used to identify women with prevalent sle during pregnancy and a sample without sle and to identify prescription medications dispensed from 3 months pre-pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. we reported the prevalence of dmards, systemic css and nsaids (aspirin reported separately) in sle pregnancies. we calculated prevalence estimates of other medications that were dispensed during pregnancy to a (c) 3/4 5% of sle pregnancies and for the same medications among non-sle pregnancies. results. there were 483 pregnancies among women with sle and 5723 pregnancies among women without sle. in sle pregnancies, 49.3% had one or more dispensing for dmards during pregnancy; the prevalence was 48.0% for css, 40.8% for aspirin and 6.0% for other nsaids and varied by pregnancy period. the prevalence of common medications among sle pregnancies was 1.2- to 20-fold higher than among non-sle pregnancies; for example, dalteparin (20.9 vs 1.0%), paracetamol (18.2 vs 2.9%) and levothyroxine (15.9 vs 4.9%). conclusion. in nearly half of sle pregnancies, women were dispensed dmards and css. commonly used medications in sle pregnancies had far higher prevalence estimates compared with non-sle pregnancies. research regarding benefits and risks of commonly used medications on sle pregnancies, breast milk and long-term outcomes for offspring is needed.
anxiety	individual differences in visuo-spatial factors play an important part in environment learning when it comes to mentally representing environments, but little is known about how visuo-spatial factors (in terms of abilities and self-assessments) are related to an individual 's representations of familiar environments. a group of 273 female undergraduates familiar with a university campus completed object-based visuo-spatial tasks (i.e., mental rotation and visuo-spatial working memory [vswm] tasks), and questionnaires on their self-assessed wayfinding inclinations (i.e., sense of direction, visuo-spatial preferences, pleasure in exploring environments), and their spatial anxiety. their spatial orientation performance was assessed with landmark locating and pointing tasks. the results of structural equation modeling showed that object-based visuo-spatial abilities and self-assessed wayfinding inclinations were related with spatial orientation performance. in particular, it was postulated that object-based visuo-spatial abilities (where rotation had an indirect effect through vswm) and self assessed wayfinding inclinations support spatial orientation performance. spatial anxiety was only related to self-assessed wayfinding inclinations. overall, these results show that a set of different individual visuo-spatial factors have a role in the representation of a familiar environment.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) are not fully understood. few studies have examined autopsy findings in patients who have died from an acute exacerbation of ipf. the pathologic findings in systemic organs have not been described. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the autopsy findings in 12 patients who had died from an acute exacerbation of ipf and two of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease between 2005 and 2015. we recorded demographic and clinical characteristics, autopsy findings and cytologic findings in peripheral blood. results: the median age at autopsy was 68 years (range 45-87 years); 11 subjects (78.5 %) were men. high-dose corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide and oxygen therapy had been administered to all patients. underlying lesions had the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern; diffuse alveolar damage and contraction band necrosis were observed in all cases. large cells expressing scavenger receptor a (sra(+)) had been observed in the systemic circulation of 11 of the 14 cases (78.6 %) before acute exacerbation, and cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha(+)) were detected after its diagnosis in nine (64.3 %). both were detected in all cases at autopsy. there was neutrophil and platelet accumulation predominantly in capillaries, and extensive capillary endothelial cells injury. conclusions: our findings suggest that acute exacerbation of ipf has systemic consequences with multiple organ injury, with sra(+) and tnf-alpha(+) cells in the systemic circulation playing central roles in multiple organ injury.
stress_management	the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a two-year intervention program to promote emotional intelligence (el) at school. participants were 228 primary school pupils between 10 and 11 years old. this study evaluated the effects of the intervention using a pre- and post-experimental design with a control group and four evaluation moments. el was assessed with the eq-i:yv questionnaire by bar-on and parker (2000), adapted to spanish by ferrandiz, hernandez, bermejo, ferrando, and sainz (2012). the results showed the effectiveness of the intervention, highlighting an increase in all the el dimensions of the bar-on model: intrapersonal, interpersonal, stress management, adaptability, and general mood. these findings suggest that ei can be improved. results are discussed, and recommendations are made for future implementation.

dementia	dementia with lewy bodies (dlb) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia. the accurate diagnosis is often possible only by neuropathological examination. the morphologic hallmarks are the presence of a-synuclein-rich lewy bodies and lewy neurites, identical to those seen in parkinson 's disease (pd) and parkinson 's disease dementia (pdd). neurotransmitter deficits, synaptic and ubiquitin-proteasome system (ups) dysfunction play major role in the pathomechanism. characteristic symptoms are cognitive fluctuation, parkinsonism and visual hallucinations. due to the often atypical clinical presentation novel imaging techniques and biomarkers could help the early diagnosis. although curative treatment is not available, therapies can improve quality of life. clinicopathological studies are important in exploring pathomechanisms, ensuring accurate diagnosis and identifying therapeutic targets.
bipolar_disorder	although a percentage of patients report cognitive sideeffects when taking lithium, it can be difficult to determine from the literature whether any cognitive changes reflect lithium itself, the lithium serum level, residual mood symptoms, the underlying nature of bipolar disorder, or biological alterations such as hypothyroidism. this review was carried out to synthesize and evaluate relevant literature examining any cognitive impact of lithium in those with bipolar disorder. the effect of lithium in those with bipolar disorder was examined across the cognitive domains of attention, psychomotor speed, processing speed, working memory, intellectual functioning, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning by reviewing the published empirical literature. any impact of hypothyroidism and lithium toxicity was also examined. the literature supports the conclusion that lithium has a distinct impact on psychomotor speed in participants with bipolar disorder. in contrast, there appears to be no impact on attention. any impact of lithium on memory in patients with bipolar disorder is unclear as the literature is contradictory and any such effect may be overshadowed by the greater impact of residual mood symptoms. the impact on processing speed, intellectual abilities, and executive functioning also remains unclear. several clinical management strategies are recommended. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	rationale: interstitial lung disease (ild) is a heterogeneous group of acute and chronic inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases. existing ild registries have had variable findings. little is known about the clinical profile of ilds in india. objectives: to characterize new-onset ilds in india by creating a prospective ild using multidisciplinary discussion (mdd) to validate diagnoses. methods: adult patients of indian origin living in india with new-onset lld (27 centers, 19 indian cities, march 2012-june 2015) without malignancy or infection were included. all had connective tissue disease (ctd) serologies, spirometry, and high-resolution computed tomography chest. ild pattern was definedby high-resolution computed tomography images. three groups independently made diagnoses after review of clinical data including that from prompted case report forms: local site investigators, ild experts at the national data coordinating center (ndcc; jaipur, india) with mdd, and experienced ild experts at the center for ild (cild; seattle, wa) with mdd. cohen 's k was used to assess reliability of interobserver agreement. measurements and main results: a total of 1,084 patients were recruited. final diagnosis: hypersensitivity pneumonitis in 47.3% (n = 513; exposure, 48.1% air coolers), ctd-ild in 13.9%, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 13.7%. cohen 's k: 0.351 site investigator/cild, 0.519 site investigator/ndcc, and 0.618 ndcc/cild. conclusions: hypersensitivity pneumonitis was the most common new-onset ild in india, followed by ctd-ild and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; diagnoses varied between site investigators and cild experts, emphasizing the value of mdd in ild diagnosis. prompted case report forms including environmental exposures in prospective registries will likely provide further insight into the etiology and management of ild worldwide.
ankylosing_spondylitis	non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and naproxen are widely used for the treatment of arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and acute muscle pain. however, most of them are usually not metabolized and simply pass through human body. these drugs are difficult to be decomposed by general waste treatment strategies and have caused serious environmental concerns. we report a rapid and efficient conversion of diclofenac and naproxen by chloroperoxidase-catalyzed h2o2-oxidation, a heme protein isolated from caldarimyces fumago. complete conversion of diclofenac and naproxen was achieved in only 9 and 7 min respectively with 0.1 mmol l-1 h2o2 and nanomolar enzyme concentration at ph 3.0. the converted products were identified by hplc-ms and nmr, suggesting involvement of multiple steps in cpo catalyzed conversion. our work demonstrated that cpo treatment (with cod removal of 4.9%, 9.1% for diclofenac and naproxen, respectively) followed by existing bioremediation technologies (activated sludge) greatly improved the decontaminating these two drugs from waste water (cod removal was enhanced to 85% and 86%, respectively). the eco-toxicity evaluation according to the 72-h ec50 value using the green algae chlorella pyrenoidos as ecological indicators showed that the converted products of diclofenac and naproxen had lower toxicity than the original drugs.

asthma	recruitment of monocytes to endothelial cells is important during early stages of atherosclerosis development, which is activated in response to a number of inflammatory stimuli, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl). montelukast is a licensed drug approved by the food and drug administration (fda) and clinically used for the treatment of asthma by reducing the eosinophilic inflammation in the airway. little information regarding the effects of montelukast on endothelial inflammation has been reported before. in the current study, we found that montelukast markedly reduced ox-ldl-induced monocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. in addition, the inhibitory mechanism of montelukast was associated with suppression of adhesion molecule expression, including vcam-1 and e-selectin. mechanistically, erk5 mediated expression of the transcriptional factor klf2 was found to be involved in the anti-inflammation effects of montelukast against ox-ldl induced endothelial inflammation. results indicate that montelukast plays a protective role in the early stages of atherosclerosis.

atrial_fibrillation	diseases with sex-dependent expressions may have an etiology in prenatal sex hormone exposure, specifically prenatal androgens. this study examined the relationship between prenatal hormone exposure (as evidenced by the 2d4d ratio), with life stress as a potential moderator/mediator, and adult depressive and/or physical health symptoms. participants were n = 137 undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. results indicated a more masculine 2d4d ratio was associated with poorer health in males, but the 2d4d ratio seemed to have little explanatory power for female physical/mental health. in males, a lower ratio (i.e., more masculine) ratio was linked to clinical cutoff scores for depression, higher levels of life stress, and greater depression scores. in addition, the relationship was mediated by life stress, indicating the link between a more masculine ratio and depression was dependent on levels of life stress. the 2040 ratio was also moderated by life stress, such that at high levels of stress a more masculine ratio was associated with more physical symptoms. overall, while life stress seemed to have the largest impact on physical and mental health for female participants, a more masculine ratio emerged as a risk factor for men, but was strongly governed by the context of reported stress levels.

atrial_fibrillation	the past 3 decades have been characterized by an exponential growth in knowledge and advances in the clinical treatment of atrial fibrillation (af). it is now known that af genesis requires a vulnerable atrial substrate and that the formation and composition of this substrate may vary depending on comorbid conditions, genetics, sex, and other factors. population-based studies have identified numerous factors that modify the atrial substrate and increase af susceptibility. to date, genetic studies have reported 17 independent signals for af at 14 genomic regions. studies have established that advanced age, male sex, and european ancestry are prominent af risk factors. other modifiable risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated blood pressure predispose to af, and each factor has been shown to induce structural and electric remodeling of the atria. both heart failure and myocardial infarction increase risk of af and vice versa creating a feed-forward loop that increases mortality. other cardiovascular outcomes attributed to af, including stroke and thromboembolism, are well established, and epidemiology studies have championed therapeutics that mitigate these adverse outcomes. however, the role of anticoagulation for preventing dementia attributed to af is less established. our review is a comprehensive examination of the epidemiological data associating unmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for af and of the pathophysiological evidence supporting the mechanistic link between each risk factor and af genesis. our review also critically examines the epidemiological data on clinical outcomes attributed to af and summarizes current evidence linking each outcome with af.
medicare	background-patients with advanced heart failure (hf) enroll in hospice at low rates, and data on their acute medical service utilization after hospice enrollment is limited. methods and results-we performed a descriptive analysis of medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, with at least one home health claim between july 1, 2009, and june 30, 2010, and at least 2 hf hospitalizations between july 1, 2009, and december 31, 2009, who subsequently enrolled in hospice between july 1, 2009, and december 31, 2009. we estimated panel-negative binomial models on a subset of beneficiaries to compare their acute medical service utilization before and after enrollment. our sample size included 5073 beneficiaries: 55% were female, 45% were >= 85 years of age, 13% were non-white, and the mean comorbidity count was 2.38 (standard deviation 1.22). the median number of days between the second hf hospital discharge and hospice enrollment was 45. the median number of days enrolled in hospice was 15, and 39% of the beneficiaries died within 7 days of enrollment. during the study period, 11% of the beneficiaries disenrolled from hospice at least once. the adjusted mean number of hospital, intensive care unit, and emergency room admissions decreased from 2.56, 0.87, and 1.17 before hospice enrollment to 0.53, 0.19, and 0.76 after hospice enrollment. conclusions-home health care medicare beneficiaries with advanced hf who enrolled in hospice had lower acute medical service utilization after their enrollment. their pattern of hospice use suggests that earlier referral and improved retention may benefit this population. further research is necessary to understand hospice referral and palliative care needs of advanced hf patients.
digestive_health	a sufficient dietary fibre supply is essential to prevent digestive troubles in the growing rabbit. the most recent recommendations have implicated several classes of fibre, including low-digested fibre (lignocellulose) and digestible fibre (hemicelluloses and pectins). moreover, agro-industrial by-products (brans and pulps), rich in digestible fibre, are often incorporated in rabbit feeding, although this fibre fraction is not analysed by the current routine method. therefore, the present review focuses on the respective role of low-digested and digestible fibre fractions in the digestive health of the growing rabbit, after weaning. it gives levels of fibre classes, including pectins, in some feed ingredients classically used in rabbit feeding. a brief overview of some characteristics of dietary fibre and some routine methods to estimate fibre fractions in animal feed ingredients are presented.

children's_health	the paper investigates the impact of ethnic segregation on the life chances of low-income african american and latino children, focusing on whether it is the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood per se that matters or other, correlated aspects of the residential environment. the approach links the consequences of segregation and neighbourhood effects literatures by arguing that metropolitan segregation forces directly shape children 's intra-neighbourhood ethnic exposure and indirectly shape their exposure to non-ethnic aspects of neighbourhood. associations between a wide range of neighbourhood characteristics and children 's health, exposure to and engaging in violence, educational and fertility outcomes are quantified using a natural experiment, thereby permitting valid causal inferences. data analysed come from a retrospective survey of denver (co) housing authority (dha) residents. the analysis avoids parental geographic selection bias because dha 's assignment of households to neighbourhoods mimics a random process. logit models stratified by ethnicity show that growing up amid concentrations of african american residents is associated with a variety of adverse outcomes for low-income latino and (especially) african american children, though outcomes associated with concentrations of latino residents are more mixed. virtually all of the negative associations disappear, however, when other aspects of the residential context are controlled, and several positive ones persist. the adverse developmental consequences of ethnic segregation appear to be generated primarily in denver by concentrating minority children in neighbourhoods with higher rates of property crime and lower occupational prestige.
osteoporosis	background proximal humerus fractures accounts for about 4% to 5% of all fractures. they are the third most common fractures in elderly population after hip and distal radius fractures. due to increasing incidence of high velocity trauma, the fracture pattern in proximal humerus fracture are becoming complicated. it has always been an enigma for the management of such fractures because of numerous muscles attachment and paucity of space for fixing implant in fracture of proximal humerus. the treatment is more controversial for articular fractures, which carry a high risk of the humeral head necrosis. in neer 's classification there are two part anatomical neck, three-part and four-part fracture and those with dislocation of head of humerus. a review of published result suggests that there is no universally accepted form of treatment. conservative management may be associated with non-union, malunion resulting in painful dysfunction. the object of the osteosynthesis is to reduce the displacement (usually rotation) of each fragment and hold it in place with an implant, the greater tuberosity fragment which has usually been displaced proximally and rotated upward by rotator cuff muscles inserted into it is fixed to the major humeral head fragment, lesser tuberosity fragment similarly displaced by subscapularis is fixed. three and four part fractures represent 13% to 16% of proximal humeral fractures. treatment options for these displaced fractures include open reduction and fixation. neer recommended open reduction and internal fixation for displaced two and three parts fractures. the aim of the present study is this study is undertaken to evaluate the functional outcome and complication of proximal humerus fractures treated by philos locking plate. materials and methods prospective study involving adults (>18 yrs.) with proximal humerus fractures admitted to mgm hospital, warangal, over a period of 2.5 years. in this study period, 30 cases of fractures of proximal humerus were treated by open reduction and internal fixation. philos locking plate were evaluated. inclusion criteria-two part, three part, four part proximal humeral fractures, acute fracture, age above 18, patient fit for surgery. exclusion criteria-below 18, associated humerus shaft fracture, associated neurovascular injury. results in our series, majority of the patients were males, elderly aged, with rta being the commonest mode of injury involving 2 part, 3 part and 4 part fractures of proximal humerus. the fractures united in all 30 patients. excellent and satisfactory results were found in 80% of patients with unsatisfactory results in 20% according to neer 's criteria. conclusions in conclusion philos locking plate is an advantageous implant in proximal humeral fractures due to angular stability, particularly in comminuted fractures and in osteoporotic bones in elderly patients, thus allowing early mobilisation and fracture union. the present study was done to evaluate functional outcome and complication following surgical management of proximal humerus fractures treated with philos locking compression plate. from our study, it can be safely recommended that for proximal humerus fractures philos plating is a good choice of surgical treatment.
children's_health	purpose of reviewmetals play major roles in children 's health and are associated with negative health outcomes via deficiency, overload, or toxicity. constantly evolving analytical technology can provide new insight into how metal metabolism and exposure biology are intertwined in a range of biological matrices.recent findingsexposure can occur prenatally as many metals cross the placental barrier. the placenta is permeable to many metal species, some through tightly regulated transporters, and others because of a limited capacity for detoxification. postbirth, metal exposure continues to exert long-term health effects, ranging from exposure to exogenous heavy metals, such as lead, to overload of otherwise essential metals, including manganese. increasing evidence supports the existence of critical developmental windows when susceptibility to toxicants and nutritional deficiencies is highest. elemental imaging technology provides microspatial information on metal uptake and retention across tissue architecture, which provides important insights into exposure and biologic response.summaryimaging the spatial distribution of elements, both essential and toxic, provides information that bulk measures cannot, including cell-specific distributions and timing of exposure.
asthma	purpose of review asthma due to cleaning products has been known for 20 years, and the interest in this topic is still large because of the number of cleaning workers with respiratory problems. in this review, we sought to highlight the most recent findings on the relationship between exposure to cleaning products and asthma and to summarize the specific literature published between 2013 and 2016. recent findings women are confirmed as most of workers exposed to cleaning products and have a higher frequency than men of work-related respiratory symptoms and diseases. many cases of asthma due to cleaning products occur in healthcare occupations. the increased risk of asthma has been shown to be related to the number of years in the job and to early life disadvantage. recent evidence suggests that predisposition to adult-onset asthma may be related to interaction between genes and occupational exposure to low-molecular weight agents/irritants. there is some evidence that an irritant mechanism is more common, although several case reports showed animmunologic mechanism (e.g. disinfectants, amine compounds, aldehydes and fragrances). summary the review updated recent findings on epidemiology, cleaning agents and their mechanism, and prevention of asthma due to cleaning agents. this article provides new information on the level of exposure, which is still high in professional cleaners and even more in domestic cleaners, and on the frequency of asthma in professional and domestic cleaners. an irritant mechanism is more common, although an immunological mechanism is possible, especially in healthcare workers exposed to disinfectants.
atopic_dermatitis	background: food allergy is a growing health problem with very limited treatment options. investigation of the immunologic pathways underlying allergic sensitization to foods in humans has been greatly constrained by the limited availability of intestinal tissue and gut-resident immune cells. although mouse models have offered insights into pathways of food sensitization, differences between rodent and human immune physiology limit the extension of these findings to our understanding of human disease. objective: we sought to develop a strategy for the generation of mice with humanized adaptive immune systems, complete with tissue engraftment by human mast cells that are competent to mount specific ige-mediated responses and drive systemic anaphylaxis on ingestion challenge. methods: nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice lacking the cytokine receptor common gamma chain (gamma(c) (-/-)) and carrying a human stem cell factor transgene were engrafted with human hematopoietic stem cells. the impact of peanut (pn) feeding and ige neutralization on the development of immune responses, mast cell homeostasis, and anaphylactic food allergy was assessed in these animals. results: humanized nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient common gamma chain-deficient stem cell factor (hunsg) mice exhibited robust engraftment with functional human t and b lymphocytes and human mast cells were found in significant numbers in their tissues, including the intestinal mucosa. following gavage feeding with pn, they mounted specific antibody responses, including pn-specific ige. when enterally challenged with pn, they exhibited mast-cell-mediated systemic anaphylaxis, as indicated by hypothermia and increases in plasma tryptase levels. anti-ige (omalizumab) treatment ablated this anaphylactic response. conclusions: hunsg mice provide a novel tool for studying food allergy and ige-mediated anaphylaxis.
stress_management	in present climatic scenario several factors are expected to affect clusterbean (cyamopsis tetragonoloba (l.) taub.) yield parameters, yield and gum content. this is also likely to change crop production practices, especially those related to crop sowing environment and stress management. an experiment was conducted during kharif season of 2014-15 with objectives of this study were to: (a) investigate the impact of changing sowing environments, as an adaptation strategy to current climatic scenarios and (b) simulate the effect of bio-regulators on crop productivity. this paper investigates normal (15 july) and late (30 july) sowing environments and foliar spray of thiourea (500, 1000 ppm) and salicylic acid (50, 100 ppm) at 45 and 60 days after sowing. amongst foliar spray, significantly higher yield parameters, yield and gum content were recorded in foliar spray of thiourea 500 ppm as compared to all other bio-regulators spray level. similarly, salicylic acid 100 ppm found statistically at par with thiourea 500 ppm foliar spray at 45 and 60 das.
anxiety	introductionthis study aimed to describe the mental health status of sulfur mustard-exposed survivors suffering from severe respiratory and ophthalmological problems. methodsout of 450 invited iran-iraq war survivors of sulfur mustard exposure with severe symptoms, 350 participated in this cross-sectional study. mental health status was assessed using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, criteria. fisher exact test, pearson chi-square test, and chi-square test were used to assess any relationship, and the independent-sample t test was employed to compare differences between the veterans with ocular and pulmonary injuries. resultsthere were 60.9% (n=213) survivors who suffered from mental disorders. among them, 39.7% (n=139) were previously untreated and required the initiation of psychiatric treatment. the prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders among all survivors was 40.6% (n=142) and 32.0% (n=112), respectively. the most common anxiety and mood disorders were posttraumatic stress disorder (32.9%, n=115) and major depressive disorder (22.3%, n=78), respectively. psychiatric disorders were more prevalent in cases with severe pulmonary chemical injury than in subjects with severe ophthalmologic chemical injury. significant relationships were found between the types of psychiatric disorders and age, education, and occupation (p<.05). conclusionthe psychiatric morbidity in the chemically injured populations was remarkable and significantly different between the populations. the prevalence of mental illness in these groups highlights the need for the appropriate provision of mental health services.
psoriatic_arthritis	objectives: to induce disease remission, early arthritis patients should adhere to their disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmard) in the first months after diagnosis. it remains unknown why some patients are non-adherent. we aimed to identify patients at risk for non-adherence in the first 3 months of treatment. methods: adult dmard-naive early arthritis patients starting synthetic dmards filled out items on potential adherence predictors at baseline. adherence was measured continuously. non-adherence was defined as not opening the electronically monitored pill bottle when it should have been. items were reduced and clustered using principal component analysis. the most discriminating items were identified with latent trait models. we used a multivariable logistic regression model to find non-adherence predictors. results: 301 patients agreed to participate. adherence was high and declined over time. principal component analysis led to 7 dimensions, while subsequent latent trait models analyses led to 15 dimensions. two dimensions were associated with adherence, one dimension was associated with nonadherence. conclusions: information seeking behavior and positive expectations about the course of the disease are associated with adherence. patients who become passive because of pain are at risk for non-adherence. practice implications: rheumatologists have cues to identify non-adherence, and may intervene on nonadherence through implementing shared decision making techniques.

stress_management	the effects of exogenously added cacl2 (0.25 mm) on photopigments, photosynthetic o-2-evolution, antioxidative enzyme activity, membrane damage, expression of two heat shock genes (groel and groes) and apoptotic features in anabaena 7120 under heat stress (45 degrees c) for up to 24 h were investigated. heat stress lowered the level of photopigments; however, ca2+-supplemented cultures showed a low level reduction in chl a but induced accumulation of carotenoids and phycocyanin under heat stress. photosynthetic o-2-evolving capacity was maintained at a higher level in cells from ca(2+)supplemented medium. among the antioxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase activity was unaffected by the presence or absence of ca2+ in contrast to increases in catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in cells grown in ca(2+)supplemented medium. lower levels of lipid peroxidation were recorded in anabaena cells grown in ca(2+)supplemented medium in comparison to cells from ca2+-deprived medium. target cells grown in ca(2+)deprived medium developed apoptotic features in the early stages of heat shock, while ca2+ application seemed to interfere with apoptosis because only a few cells showed such features after 24 h of heat exposure, indicating a role for ca2+ in maintaining cell viability under heat stress. there was also continuous up regulation of two important heat shock genes (groel and groes) in ca(2+)supplemented cultures, exposed to heat shock, again indicating a role for ca2+ in stress management.

addiction	previously, we created an 8-h limited-access dual bottle drinking paradigm to deliver methylphenidate (mp) to rats at two dosages that result in a pharmacokinetic profile similar to patients treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. chronic treatment resulted in altered behavior, with some effects persisting beyond treatment. in the current study, adolescent male sprague-dawley rats were split into three groups at four weeks of age: control (water), low-dose mp (ld), and high-dose mp (hd). briefly, 4 mg/kg (low dose; ld) or 30 mg/kg (high dose; hd) mp was consumed during the first hour, and 10 mg/kg (ld) or 60 mg/kg (hd) mp during hours two through eight. following three months of treatment, half of the rats in each group (n = 8-9/group) were euthanized, and remaining rats went through a 1-month abstinence period, then euthanized. in vitro receptor autoradiography was performed to quantify binding levels of dopamine transporter (dat), dopamine type 1 (d1r)-like receptors, and dopamine type 2 (d2r)-like receptors using [h-3] win35,428, [h-3] sch23390, and [h-3] spiperone, respectively. immediately following treatment, hd mp-treated rats had increased dat and d1r-like binding in several subregions of the basal ganglia, particularly more caudal portions of the caudate putamen, which correlated with some previously reported behavioral changes. there were no differences between treatment groups in any measure following abstinence. these findings suggest that chronic treatment with a clinically relevant high dose of mp results in reversible changes in dopamine neurochemistry, which may underlie some effects on behavior.
anxiety	the department of veterans affairs (va) is committed to preventing and ending homelessness among u.s. veterans, but there have been few estimates of the incidence of veteran homelessness and prospective studies to identify predictors of homelessness. this study examines the 1-year incidence of homelessness among veterans seen in va specialty mental health clinics and identified sociodemographic and clinical predictors of homelessness. using a retrospective cohort study design, data were extracted from the va medical records of 306,351 veterans referred to anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder clinics across 130 va facilities from 2008-2012 and followed for 1 year after referral. homeless incidence was defined as new use of any va homeless services or a documented international classification of diseases (9th rev.) v60.0 (lack of housing) code during the year. of the total sample, 5.6% (7.8% for women and 5.4% for men) experienced homelessness within 1 year after referral to va specialty mental health care. veterans who were unmarried or diagnosed with a drug use disorder were more than twice as likely to become homeless; those who were black or had annual incomes less than $25,000 were more than one and a half times as likely to become homeless. together, these findings suggest a notable and important percentage of veterans seen in va specialty mental health clinics newly experience homelessness annually. monitoring early signs of housing vulnerability and preventing homelessness in this vulnerable but treatment-engaged population may be important in the va 's efforts to end veteran homelessness.
children's_health	introduction: second-hand smoke exposure (shs) in children remains as a major pollution problem, with important consequences for children 's health. this study aimed to identify the sources of exposure to shs among 4-year-old children, comparing self-reports to a urinary biomarker of exposure, and characterize the most important variables related to shs exposure in this population. methods: 4-year-old children 's exposure to shs was assessed by a parental-reported questionnaire and by urinary cotinine (uc) measurements in 1757 participants from 4 different areas of the spanish inma (infancia y medio ambiente - environment and childhood) project. the questionnaire about shs included information about smoking habits at home by household members, and about exposure to shs in other places including other homes, bars, restaurants or transportation. the association between quantified uc levels (>4 ng/ml) and sociodemographic variables and the different sources of shs exposure was examined using logistic regression. results: based on parental reports, 21.6% of the children were exposed to shs at home and 47.1% elsewhere; making a total 55.9% of the children exposed to shs. in addition, 28.2% of the children whose parents reported being not regularly exposed to shs had quantified uc values. children from younger mothers (= 39.4 y) had a higher odds of exposure to shs [or (95% ci): 2.28(1.70-3.05) per year], as well as from families with a lower educational level [or secondary: 2.12 (1.69-2.65); primary or less: 2.91 (2.19-3.88)]. the odds of quantifiable uc in children dropped after the smoking ban in public places [or=0.59 (0.42-0.83)]. regarding the sources of shs exposure we observed that quantifiable uc odds was increased in children whose parents smoked at home in their presence [or mother occasionally: 1339 (7.03-25.50); mother often: 18.48 (8.40-40.66); father occasionally: 10.98 (6.52-18.49); father often: 11.50 (5.96-22.20)] or in children attending other confined places, mainly other houses where people smoked [or: 2.23 (1.78-2.80)]. conclusions: children 's shs exposure is nowadays an unresolved major public health problem in spain. after the ban of smoking in public places health care professionals should put more emphasis to the parents on the importance of controlling the exposure of their children in private spaces.

osteoporosis	the adult human skeleton is a multifunctional organ undergoing continuous remodeling. homeostasis of bone mass in a healthy adult requires an exquisite balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts; disturbance of such balance is the root cause for various bone disorders including osteoporosis. to develop effective and safe therapeutics to modulate bone formation, it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing osteoblast differentiation and activity. due to their specialized function in collagen synthesis and secretion, osteoblasts are expected to consume large amounts of nutrients. however, studies of bioenergetics and building blocks in osteoblasts have been lagging behind those of growth factors and transcription factors. genetic studies in both humans and mice over the past 15 years have established wnt signaling as a critical mechanism for stimulating osteoblast differentiation and activity. importantly, recent studies have uncovered that wnt signaling directly reprograms cellular metabolism by stimulating aerobic glycolysis, glutamine catabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation in osteoblast-lineage cells. such findings therefore reveal an important regulatory axis between bone anabolic signals and cellular bioenergetics. a comprehensive understanding of osteoblast metabolism and its regulation is likely to reveal molecular targets for novel bone therapies.
rheumatoid_arthritis	induction of tolerance to autoantigens in vivo is a complex process that involves several mechanisms such as the induction of regulatory t cells and changes in the cytokine and chemokine profiles. this approach represents an attractive alternative for treatment of autoimmune diseases. apl-1 is an altered peptide ligand derived from a novel cd4 + t cell epitope of human heat-shock protein of 60 kda (hsp60), an autoantigen involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). we have shown previously that this peptide efficiently inhibited the course of adjuvant-induced arthritis in lewis rats and induced regulatory t cell (treg) in ex vivo assay with pbmc isolated from ra patients. this study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic effect of apl-1 and its combination with methotrexate (mtx) in collagen-induced arthritis (cia). cia was induced in male dba/1 mice at 8 weeks of age by immunization with chicken collagen. apl, mtx or both were administrated beginning from arthritis onset. therapeutic effect was evaluated by arthritis and joint pathologic scores. in addition, tnf alpha and il-10 in sera were measured by elisa. treg induction was assessed by facs analysis. apl-1 inhibits efficiently the course of arthritis in cia, similar to mtx. in addition, therapy with apl-1 plus mtx reduced cia in mice, associated with an increase in treg. these facts reinforce the therapeutic possibilities of apl-1 as a candidate drug for treatment of ra.
lymphoma	autoinflammatory diseases are caused by defects in genes that regulate the innate immunity. recently, the scope of autoinflammation has been broadened to include diseases that result from dysregulations in protein modifications by the highly conserved ubiquitin (ub) peptides. thus far these diseases consist of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (lubac) and otulin deficiencies, and haploinsufficiency of a20. the lubac is critical for linear ubiquitination of key signaling molecules in immune response pathways, while deubiquitinase enzymes, otulin and tnfaip3/a20, reverse the effects of ubiquitination by hydrolyzing linear (met1) and lys63 (k63) ub moieties, respectively, from conjugated proteins. consequently, otulin or a20-deficient cells have an excess of met1 or k63 ub chains on nemo, ripk1, and other target substrates, which lead to constitutive activation of the nf-kappa b pathway. mutant cells produce elevated levels of many proinflammatory cytokines and respond to therapy with cytokine inhibitors. patients with an impairment in lubac stability have compromised nf-kappa b responses in non-immune cells such as fibroblasts, while their monocytes are hyperresponsive to il-1 beta. discoveries of germline mutations in enzymes that regulate protein modifications by ub define a new category of autoinflammatory diseases caused by upregulations in the nf-kappa b signaling. the primary aim of this review is to summarize the latest developments in our understanding of the etiology of autoinflammation.
hereditary_angioedema	angioedema is an asymmetric non-pitting oedema on face, lips, tongue and mucous membranes; any delay in diagnosis and treatment can be fatal. treatment with lisinopril as an angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor, can be a reason of angioedema. here we report a case who developed oral-facial edema four years after using lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide. laryngeal oedema is a main cause of death in angioedema. the treatment of choice in angioedema including fresh frozen plasma, c1 inhibitor concentrations and brk-2 antagonists (bradykinin b2 receptor antagonists) were used. in this case; a 77 years old female patient suffering from hypertension was considered. this patient was suffering two days from swelling on her face and neck. non-allergic angioedema was distinguished in five major forms; acquired (aao), hereditary (hae), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) blocker-dependent, pseudoallergic angioedema (pas) and an idiopathic angioedema (iao). she was admitted to our clinic with the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema. patient had skin edema and life threatening laryngeal edema. in emergency department treatment was started using intravenous methylprednisolone, diphenydramine as well as inhaled and subcutaneous epinephrine simultaneously. despite the initial treatment, the patient died due to the insufficient respiration and cardiac arrest. the patient has no history of kidney disease.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a devastating, progressive and ultimately fatal lung disease. the combination of poor prognosis, uncertainty of disease course and severe symptom burden heavily impacts patients' and their families' quality of life. though new antifibrotic drugs have been shown to decrease disease progression, the effect on health-related quality of life (hrqol) has not been convincingly demonstrated. in a relentless disease such as ipf, striving to optimize hrqol should complement the endeavour to prolong life. unfortunately, there is a paucity of interventions improving symptoms and functionality for patients with ipf, and research focusing on symptom improvement, and assessing and optimizing hrqol, is limited. this review summarizes the most recent insights into measuring and improving quality of life for patients with ipf, and discusses challenges in the management of this devastating disease. moreover, we postulate a new model for continuous care in ipf - 'the abcde of ipf care': assessing patients' needs; backing patients by giving information and support; delivering comfort care by focusing on treating symptoms and taking into account comorbidities; striving to prolong life by disease modification; helping and preparing patients and their caregivers for the eventual end-of-life events that are likely to occur.
asthma	airway remodeling is resultant of a complex multicellular response associated with a progressive decline of pulmonary function in patients with chronic airway disease. here, repeated infections with respiratory viruses are linked with airway remodeling through largely unknown mechanisms. although acute activation of the toll-like receptor (tlr) 3 pathway by extracellular polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[i:c]) induces innate signaling through the nf-kappa b transcription factor in normal human small airway epithelial cells, prolonged (repetitive or tonic) poly(i:c) stimulation produces chronic stress fiber formation, mesenchymal transition, and activation of a fibrotic program. chronic poly(i:c) stimulation enhanced the expression of core mesenchymal regulators snail family zinc finger 1, zinc finger e-box binding homeobox, mesenchymal intermediate filaments (vimentin), and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin-1), and collagen 1a. this mesenchymal transition was prevented by silencing expression of nf-kappa b/rela or administration of a small-molecule inhibitor of the i kappa b kinase, bms345541. acute poly(i:c) exposure in vivo induced profound neutrophilic airway inflammation. when administered repetitively, poly(i:c) resulted in enhanced fibrosis observed by lung micro-computed tomography, second harmonic generation microscopy of optically cleared lung tissue, and by immunohistochemistry. epithelial flattening, expansion of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, and enhanced snail family zinc finger 1 and fibronectin 1 expression in airway epithelium were also observed. repetitive poly(i:c)-induced airway remodeling, fibrosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition was inhibited by bms345541 administration. based on this novel model of viral inflammation-induced remodeling, we conclude that nf-kappa b is a major controller of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and pulmonary fibrosis, a finding that has potentially important relevance to airway remodeling produced by repetitive viral infections.
addiction	background: against the background that crystal methamphetamine (colloquially known as ""tik"") is extensively used by the emerging working class coloured youth in cape town, south africa, this exploratory qualitative study was conducted to explore the experience of mothers whose children use methamphetamine. methods: the researchers conducted one-to-one semi-structured in-depth interviews with sixteen (16) purposively selected caregivers (mothers) whose sons use methamphetamine. interviews were recorded and simultaneously translated and transcribed. thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to the experiences of caregivers of youth with methamphetamine problems. results: findings showed that youth misbehaviour provided a context that led to feelings of shame and embarrassment. participants also experienced personal challenges which included emotional problems, fear and self-blame. participants also expressed family disruptions and financial drain as adverse experiences as a results of their sons' misbehaviour. conclusion: the study results highlight the psychosocial challenges for caregivers of children who use methamphetamine. these findings underscore the need for effort to be directed at the development of formal support interventions for mothers of youth who are troubled with addiction.
osteoporosis	background: while current therapies for osteoporosis focus on reducing bone resorption, the development of therapies to regenerate bone may also be beneficial. promising anabolic therapy candidates include phytoestrogens, such as daidzein, which effectively induce osteogenesis of adipose-derived stromal cells (ascs) and bone marrow stromal cells (bmscs). purpose: to investigate the effects of glyceollins, structural derivatives of daidzein, on osteogenesis of ascs and bmscs. study design: herein, the osteoinductive effects of glyceollin i and glyceollin ii were assessed and compared to estradiol in ascs and bmscs. the mechanism by which glyceollin ii induces osteogenesis was further examined. methods: the ability of glyceollins to promote osteogenesis of ascs and bmscs was evaluated in adherent and scaffold cultures. relative deposition of calcium was analyzed using alizarin red staining, bichinchoninic acid protein assay, and alamar blue assay. to further explore the mechanism by which glyceollin ii exerts its osteoinductive effects, docking studies of glyceollin ii, rna isolation, cdna synthesis, and quantitative rt-pcr (qpcr) were performed. results: in adherent cultures, ascs and bmscs treated with estradiol, glyceollin i, or glyceollin ii demonstrated increased calcium deposition relative to vehicle-treated cells. during evaluation on plga scaffolds seeded with ascs and bmscs, glyceollin ii was the most efficacious in inducing asc and bmsc osteogenesis compared to estradiol and glyceollin i. dose-response analysis in ascs and bmscs revealed that glyceollin ii has the highest potency at 10 nm in adherent cultures and 1 mu m in tissue scaffold cultures. at all doses, osteoinductive effects were attenuated by fulvestrant, suggesting that glyceollin ii acts at least in part through estrogen receptor-mediated pathways to induce osteogenesis. analysis of gene expression demonstrated that, similar to estradiol, glyceollin ii induces upregulation of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation. conclusion: the ability of glyceollin ii to induce osteogenic differentiation in ascs and bmscs indicates that glyceollins hold the potential for the development of pharmacological interventions to improve clinical outcomes of patients with osteoporosis.

atopic_dermatitis	atopic dermatitis is characterized by the interplay of skin barrier defects with the immune system and skin microbiome that causes patients to be at risk for infectious complications. this article reviews the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and the mechanisms through which patients are at risk for infection from bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. although these complications may be managed acutely, prevention of secondary infections depends on a multipronged approach in the maintenance of skin integrity, control of flares, and microbial pathogens.
stress_management	young gay and bisexual men are at increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. research suggests that the stress associated with being a stigmatized minority is related to negative mental health outcomes, substance use, and condomless sex. however, interventions aimed at reducing hiv risk behaviors in young gay and bisexual men have failed to address these important variables. the purpose of the present paper is to assist cognitive and behavioral therapists who work with young gay and bisexual men to conduct therapy for stress management and hiv prevention. this paper provides an overview of the research on stress and coping among gay and bisexual men and its relation with condomless sex among young gay and bisexual men. the treatment described here integrates minority stress theory (e.g., meyer, 2003) and stress and coping theory (e.g., lazarus, 2000) in a small group counseling framework that uses psychoeducation, cognitive reframing, and role plays to help young gay and bisexual men to manage stress, reduce substance use, and reduce condomless sex. the application of empirically supported theory and a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques to reduce both psychological distress and hiv risk behavior for young gay and bisexual men is illustrated using three case examples. the present treatment may help therapists working with young hiv-negative gay and bisexual men who engage in condomless sex and who wish to remain hiv-negative by decreasing their hiv risk behavior.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	purpose of review a number of recent studies have explored the possibility to apply personalized medicine to interstitial lung diseases (ilds), particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), the most common and deadly of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. in our review, we summarize and discuss the most recent literature on personalized medicine in ipf as well as hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis, with emphasis on patient subgroups for which a personalized approach to disease prognostication and management may become a reality in the near future. recent findings most of the studies that have explored the applicability of personalized medicine to ilds have been conducted in patients with ipf. such studies have suggested the existence of several distinct disease subgroups defined by similar genetic profiles, molecular pathways, exposures and individual lifestyles. personalized medicine in hypersensitivity pneumonitis is in its infancy. the development and applicability of personalized medicine to sarcoidosis, on the other hand, remains problematic for several reasons, including the lack of a diagnostic gold standard, the highly variable and unpredictable disease course, particularly across patients of different ethnicities, the poor correlation between disease activity and disease severity and the lack of a validated management algorithm. summary a number of distinct patient subgroups have been identified in ilds. although available data need to be validated longitudinally, the possibility to study homogeneous groups of patients may allow prediction of disease behavior and response to treatment with dramatic clinical implications.
children's_health	objective: the purpose of this study was to examine the association between asthma diagnosis and obesity among adolescents exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ets). methods: the sample included 28 807 adolescents (13-17 years old) from the national survey of children 's health (nsch) (2011-2012). study design: the nsch is a us cross-sectional telephone survey that included at least one child between the ages of 0 and 17 years residing at a household during the time of the interview. descriptive statistics were used to describe sample characteristics and assess the prevalence of asthma among adolescents with obesity exposed to ets. logistic regression models were built to assess the effect of obesity on asthma diagnosis within the context of ets exposure. results: the prevalence of asthma among adolescents was 10.4% and the obesity was 13.2%. adolescents with obesity exposed to ets within the home were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to have an asthma diagnosis (23%) compared with non-obese (10.9%) residing in similar households. adjusted odds ratios showed that adolescents with obesity were 2.07 (95% ci, 1.15, 3.70) times more likely to have asthma if they were exposed to ets inside their homes. conclusion: the findings indicate that adolescents with obesity are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma if they are exposed to ets in the household. it is important that the association between obesity and asthma is examined within the context of environmental risk factors in future studies, as this may shed some light to underlying mechanisms between these two serious public health issues.
mental_health	background: there is an increasing need for evidence-based efficiency in providing a growing amount of cancer care. one example of a quality gap is the use of multiple-fraction palliative radiation for patients with advanced cancer who have uncomplicated bone metastases; evidence suggests similar pain outcomes for treatment regimens with a lower burden of treatments. methods: during the first phase of quality improvement work, we used rand/ucla appropriateness methodology to understand how radiation oncologists at one academic medical center rate the appropriateness of different treatment regimens for painful uncomplicated bone metastases. we compared radiation oncologist appropriateness ratings for radiation treatments with radiation therapy provided by these oncologists to patients with painful bone metastases between july 2012 and june 2013. results: appropriateness ratings showed that single-fraction (8 gy) treatment (a low burden treatment) was consistently considered an appropriate option to treat a variety of uncomplicated bone metastases. the use of >10 fractions was consistently rated as inappropriate regardless of other factors. eighty-one patients receiving radiation therapy for painful bone metastases during the study period had an available medical record for chart abstraction. almost one-third of metastases were considered complicated because of a concern of spinal cord compression, a history of prior irradiation, or an associated pathological fracture. among uncomplicated bone metastases, 25% were treated with stereotactic body radiation treatment (sbrt). among the 54 uncomplicated bone metastases treated with conformal radiation, only one was treated with single-fraction treatment and 32% were treated with greater than 10 fractions. conclusions: treatment at the study site demonstrates room for improvement in providing low-burden radiation oncology treatments for patients with painful bone metastases. choosing a radiation treatment schedule for patients with advanced cancer and painful bone metastases requires consideration of many medical and patient-centered factors. our experience suggests that it will take more than the existence of guidelines to change practice in this area.
healthy_sleep	objective: the purpose of this study was to examine the associations of sleep disturbances during pregnancy with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. methods: in this prospective study, 688 healthy women with singleton pregnancy were selected from three hospitals in chengdu, china 2013-2014. self-report questionnaires, including the sleep quantity and quality as well as exercise habits in a recent month were administered at 12-16, 24-28, and 32-36 weeks' gestation. data on type of delivery, gestational age, and the neonates' weight were recorded after delivery. after controlling the potential confounders, a serial of multi-factor logistic regression models were performed to evaluate whether sleep quality and quantity were associated with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. results: there were 382 (55.5%) women who had cesarean deliveries and 32 (4.7%) who delivered preterm. women with poor sleep quality during the first (or: 1.87, 95% ci [1.02-3.43]), second (5.19 [2.25-11.97]), and third trimester (1.82 [1.18-2.80]) were at high risk of cesarean delivery. women with poor sleep quality during the second (5.35 [2.10-13.63]) and third trimester (3.01 [1.26-7.19]) as well as short sleep time (<7h) during the third trimester (4.67 [1.24-17.50]) were at high risk of preterm birth. conclusions: sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery and preterm birth throughout pregnancy. obstetric care providers should advise women with childbearing age to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: to investigate association of the sociodemographic factors, characteristics of rape and social support to the development of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder at 6 months after the rape. method: a cross-sectional survey with female survivors of rape was carried out in 3 provinces of south africa 6 months after the rape. results: one hundred female survivors s of sexual assault were interviewed. more than half (53%) were from limpopo, 25% from western cape, and 22% from kwazulu-natal (kzn). 87% reported high levels of ptsd and 51% moderate to severe depression post rape. the major risk factors for ptsd and depression were the unmarried survivors of rape and those living in kzn. the female survivors of rape in kzn province were 7 times more likely to experience symptoms of depression compared to other provinces, while married/cohabiting female rape survivors were 6 times less likely to report symptoms of depression compared to the unmarried female rape survivors. conclusion: these findings add support to existing literature on ptsd and depression as common mental health consequence of rape and also provide evidence that survivors' socio-demographics-marital status, employment status-are significant contributors to the development of symptoms of depression and ptsd after rape. the results have research and clinical practice relevance for ensuring that ptsd and trauma treatment focuses on an in-depth understanding of the various aspects of the sociodemographic factors and rape characteristics that contribute to survivors' mental state and how these compound stress and depression symptoms over time post rape victimization.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective. to determine feasibility of tnf inhibitor (tnfi) dose reduction for severe as and psa patients. methods. a retrospective study in a real-world setting. criteria for dose reduction of tnfi included basdai4 in as or das28-esr >3.2 in psa) were re-escalated to standard treatment dose. results. twenty-six per cent (33/125) of as and 18% (15/83) of psa patients fulfilled criteria and underwent tnfi dose reduction. fifty-eight per cent (19/33) of as and 60% (9/15) of psa patients maintained tnfi dose reduction for mean (s.d.) of 1.0 (0.8) years. reinstating standard dose of tnfi recaptured low disease activity in all patients who failed dose reduction within 24 weeks, with no statistically significant difference in mean basdai compared with those maintaining tnfi dose reduction in as at 24 weeks [mean (s.d.) basdai 2.4 (1.1) vs 1.9 (1.5), respectively (p = 0.229)]; however in psa, those who failed dose reduction had higher disease activity compared with patients maintained on tnfi dose reduction at 24 weeks [mean (s.d.) das28-esr 2.7 (0.6) vs 1.3 (0.5), respectively (p a (c) 1/2 0.001)]. in psa, a lower das28-esr prior to dose reduction of tnfi was associated with more successful dose reduction. conclusions. in a real-world setting, 60% of individuals with severe as and psa who achieve low disease activity can successfully reduce the dose of tnfi therapy by a third for a mean of 1 year.
healthy_sleep	sleep thermal comfort is one of the critical factors affecting sleep quality. in recent years, research not only investigates ways and products to improve whole body thermal comfort, but attaches great importance to local thermal comfort of peripheral skin. healthy sleep containing cycle position change is considered to regulate body temperature. mattress design contacted to human body provides direct impact on sleep comfort. twelve healthy participants had general level in bmi were recruited in 2-day sleep monitoring in simulated laboratory condition to evaluate two different design mattresses, one due to body segment location on the mattress, the other is according to position change during sleep. sleep position, sleep quality data and skin temperature were examined. through statistical analysis, this study deduced the relation between mattress design and all dependent variables of appraisement. all night sleep position change cycle and skin temperature in supine was slightly more stable was more regular and had less short phase body movement of the design due to sleep position change. furthermore, the design due to position change contributed to reduction of sleep disturbance. also, it promoted distal skin warming. the consequence indicated mattress design on the basis of posture change conformed particularly demands of local thermal comfort and enhanced sleep quality.

crohn's_disease	background and aims: infliximab and adalimumab are increasingly used to prevent postoperative recurrence in crohn 's disease patients. the impact of previous exposure to one or more anti-tumour necrosis factor [tnf] agents before surgery on the efficacy of anti-tnf therapy on postoperative recurrence is unknown. methods: we performed a retrospective analysis of crohn 's disease patients who underwent surgical bowel resection with anastomosis and prophylactic treatment with anti-tnf therapy between january 2005 and june 2013. results: a total of 57 consecutive crohn 's disease patients with bowel resection and anastomosis followed by prophylactic treatment with anti-tnf were included; 21 [37%] and 24 [42%] patients had a previous exposure to one and more than one anti-tnf agents, respectively; 39 patients [68%] had a surveillance colonoscopy. cumulative rates of postoperative endoscopic recurrence at 2 years were 45.5% [26.6-69.6%] in patients exposed to two or more anti-tnf alpha as compared with 29.1% [11.5-48.1%] in patients exposed to one or to zero anti-tnfa before surgery [p = 0.07]. cumulative rates of clinical recurrence at 1 year were 21.6% [9.6-44.4%] in patients exposed to two or more anti-tnfa as compared with 6.9% [1.8-25.1%] in patients exposed to zero or one anti-tnf alpha before surgery [p = 0.02]. multivariable analysis identified smoking and previous exposure to two or more anti-tnfa as risk factors for crohn 's disease clinical or endoscopic postoperative recurrence (hazard ratio [hr] = 3.17; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.3-7.8, p = 0.01 and hr = 4.2; 95% ci: 1.8-10.2, p = 0.001, respectively). conclusions: previous exposure to two or more anti-tnf agents was associated with a higher risk of postoperative recurrence in crohn 's disease patients.
migraine	background: migraine is one of the most severe primary headache disorders. the nature of the headache and the associated symptoms during the attack suggest underlying functional alterations in the brain. in this study, we examined amplitude, the resting state fmri fluctuation in migraineurs with and without aura (mwa, mwoa respectively) and healthy controls. methods: resting state functional mri images and t1 high-resolution images were acquired from all participants. for data analysis we compared the groups (mwa-control, mwa-mwoa, mwoa-control). the resting state networks were identified by melodic. the mean time courses of the networks were identified for each participant for all networks. the time-courses were decomposed into five frequency bands by discrete wavelet decomposition. the amplitude of the frequency-specific activity was compared between groups. furthermore, the preprocessed resting state images were decomposed by wavelet analysis into five specific frequency bands voxel-wise. the voxel-wise amplitudes were compared between groups by non-parametric permutation test. results: in the mwa-control comparison the discrete wavelet decomposition found alterations in the lateral visual network. higher activity was measured in the mwa group in the highest frequency band (0.16-0.08 hz). in case of the mwa-mwoa comparison all networks showed higher activity in the 0.08-0.04 hz frequency range in mwa, and the lateral visual network in in higher frequencies. in mwoa-control comparison only the default mode network revealed decreased activity in mwoa group in the 0. 08-0.04 hz band. the voxel-wise frequency specific analysis of the amplitudes found higher amplitudes in mwa as compared to mwoa in the in fronto-parietal regions, anterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum. discussion: the amplitude of the resting state fmri activity fluctuation is higher in mwa than in mwoa. these results are in concordance with former studies, which found cortical hyperexcitability in mwa.
autism	objective: despite widespread use, there is little data investigating the long-term impact of micronutrients on psychiatric disorders. this study investigated the naturalistic outcome 1-year post-baseline of a randomized controlled trials (rct) that compared micronutrients with placebo in 80 adults with adhd. method: all participants were contacted and clinician-rated questionnaires completed. results: a total of 72 (90%) of the sample participated; although there was significant regression in psychiatric functioning from the end-of-trial on all measures, outcomes remained significantly improved from baseline. dominant treatment from the end-of-treatment to follow-up was investigated as a mediator of outcome; those staying on the micronutrients performed better than those who switched to medications or discontinued micronutrients. cost was the most substantial reason why people stopped micronutrient treatment. conclusion: for the small number of participants who stayed on micronutrients, the benefits conferred through the controlled trial were maintained. the results are limited by small sample, lack of blinding, expectation, and reliance on self-report of symptoms.
lymphoma	the 8p11 eosinophilic myeloproliferative syndrome (ems) is an aggressive neoplasm driven by translocation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and often transforms to leukemias and lymphomas that are refractory to treatment. the first case was identified in 1983, and to date over 70 cases have been reported in the literature. despite those reports, no consensus exists on management of this condition, and inconsistency in treatment regimens is even more pronounced in the pediatric literature. we report a case of a male infant with the 8p11 ems, review the published pediatric experience with ems, and discuss treatment strategies for this enigmatic hematological disorder.
kidney_health	background: chronic kidney disease (ckd) patients and their clinicians seek ways to mitigate the risk of ckd progression and its associated complications. emerging data suggest that dietary modifications may be beneficial adjuvant approaches to reducing the risk of adverse ckd outcomes. summary: this review focuses on several different dietary patterns, including the dietary approaches to stop hypertension and mediterranean diets, and their kidney health benefits. we discuss how healthful dietary patterns are lower in dietary acid load and how improving diet quality may slow the progression of ckd. we also discuss some barriers that may impede socially disadvantaged individuals from following healthful diets. key points: dietary patterns low in dietary acid load might slow the progression of ckd. current evidence suggests that a reduction in dietary acid load could be beneficial in patients with ckd, but the supremacy of any particular diet is yet to be established. additional randomized controlled dietary interventions among ckd patients are needed to inform evidence-based recommendations, which can be tailored to an individual 's preferences and ability to access healthful foods.

atrial_fibrillation	av node innervation by the right vagus nerve introductionradiofrequency isolation of pulmonary vein can be accompanied by transient sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular nodal (avn) block, suggesting an influence on vagal cardiac innervation. however, the importance of the atrial fat pads in relation with the vagal innervation of avn in humans remains largely unknown. the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ganglionated plexi (gp) in the innervation of the avn by the right vagus nerve. methods and resultsdirect epicardial high-frequency stimulation (hfs) of the gp (20 patients) and the right vagus nerve (10 patients) was performed before and after fat pad exclusion or destruction in 20 patients undergoing thoracoscopic epicardial ablation for the treatment of persistent af. asystole longer than 3 seconds or acute r-r prolongation over 25% was considered as a positive response to hfs. prior to the ablation, positive responses to hfs were detected in 3 gps in 7 patients (35%), 2 gps in 5 patients (25%), and one gp in 8 patients (40%). after exclusion of the fat pads, all patients had a negative response to hfs. all the patients who exhibited a positive response to right vagus nerve stimulation (n = 10) demonstrated negative responses after the ablation. conclusionthe integrity of the gp is essential for the right vagus nerve to exert physiological effects of on avn in humans.
osteoporosis	screening in a standardized manner for osteoporosis in non-vertebral fracture patients aged 50 and older independently of both gender and level of trauma energy yielded the indication for osteoporotic therapy for every fourth male high-energy fracture patient. purpose this study aimed to identify the rate of osteoporosis in patients of both genders after fracture independently of the underlying level of trauma energy. methods a random cohort of patients aged 50 or older with non-vertebral fractures participated in a standardized diagnostic protocol to evaluate the indication for treatment of osteoporosis (number needed to screen (nns)). univariate and multivariate analysis as well as correlation testing were performed to determine statistical relationships. significance was set at p < 0.05. results of 478 fracture patients with a mean age of 69.3 + 11.8 years, 317 (66.3%) were female and 161 (33.7%) male. one hundred nineteen patients (24.9%) sustained high-energy fractures (hefs) and 359 (75.1%) low-energy fractures (lefs). twenty-eight percent of males and 47% of females qualified as osteoporotic in densitometry dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa)), resulting in a nns of 2.1 for women and 3.6 for men. the indication for treatment of osteoporosis increased to an nns of 1.5 for females and 2.4 for males if the fracture risk assessment tool (frax) was included in the diagnostics (dxa and frax). with regard to the energy of trauma, the nns for treatment following dxa and frax was 1.5 for lef and 2.9 for hef. subgroup analysis revealed that hef males within the decennia 50+ and 80+ had an nns of around 3, i. e., comparable to females and about twice as high as lef patients. conclusions these preliminary findings appear to confirm the pragmatic approach to screening in a standardized manner for osteoporosis in all non-vertebral fracture patients aged 50 and older-independently of both gender and level of trauma energy.
stress_management	purpose. to perform the validation of the brazilian version of the voice disability coping questionnaire (b-vdcq) using procedures according to the scientific advisory committee of medical outcomes trust and psychometric analyses to determine the scales validity and reliability. methods. in the preliminary procedures, the vdcq was administered to 14 patients to determine if items were culturally valid and propose possible adaptations for a b-vdcq. the sample of this study consisted of a data set of 178 individuals, 87 with vocal complaint, comprising 19 men and 68 women, with mean age of 34.1 years and 91 without vocal complaint, comprising 29 men and 62 women, with mean age of 32.4 years. to demonstrate validity, the b-vdcq scores were compared to vocal self-assessment and perceptual analysis. to determine the reliability and test-retest reproducibility, 14 voice patients repeated the measurement between 3 and 14 days after the first administration. results. principal component analyses of the patients with vocal complaint yielded four coping strategies: venting, support seeking, minimisation, and avoidant acceptance. subscales of the questionnaire showed acceptable internal consistency and reproducibility values, apart from the minimisation subscale. b-vdcq validity was demonstrated through relationships with perceptual analyses and vocal self-assessment and subscale score differences between the two groups. conclusions. the b-vdcq has been submitted to essential steps necessary for cultural adaptation and validation. it is a simple instrument to administer and shows to be specific for evaluating patients with voice problems. the b-vdcq can be an important addition to the voice evaluation of patients with dysphonia.
healthy_sleep	study objectives: to examine the association between race/ethnicity and sleep curtailment from infancy to mid-childhood, and to determine the extent to which socioeconomic and contextual factors both explain racial/ethnic differences and are independently associated with sleep curtailment. methods: we studied 1,288 children longitudinally in project viva, a pre-birth cohort study, from 6 months to 7 years of age. the main exposure was the child 's race/ethnicity. the main outcome was a sleep curtailment score from 6 months to 7 years. the score ranged from 0-13, where 0 indicated maximal sleep curtailment and 13 indicated never having curtailed sleep. results: the mean (standard deviation) sleep curtailment score was 10.2 (2.7) points. in adjusted models (beta [95% ci]), black (-1.92, [-2.39, -1.45] points), hispanic (-1.58, [-2.43, -0.72] points), and asian (-1.71, [-2.55, -0.86] points) children had lower sleep scores than white children. adjustment for sociodemographic covariates attenuated racial/ethnic differences in sleep scores for black (by 24%) and hispanic children (by 32%) but strengthened the differences for asian children by 14%. further adjustment for environmental and behavioral variables did not substantially change these differences. independently, low maternal education, living in households with incomes <$70,000, viewing more tv, and having a tv in the child 's bedroom were associated with lower sleep scores. conclusions: chronic sleep curtailment from infancy to mid-childhood was more prevalent among black, hispanic, and asian children. these differences were partially but not entirely explained by socio-contextual variables. independently, children from lower socioeconomic status and those with greater exposures to tv also had greater sleep curtailment.
anxiety	parents' perceptions about their strategies to deal with children 's anxiety have been minimally explored. based on a mixed-method approach, the current study compared the strategies that parents said they use more frequently to deal with their child 's anxious behaviors and the strategies they actually used during two mildly anxiogenic interactions with their child. forty-two parents of children with anxiety disorders, aged 9-12 years, participated in the study. semi-structured interviews were administered to identify parental perceptions about their strategies to deal with their children 's anxiety. subsequently dyadic interactions were observed and coded by two independent coders. we found discrepancies relating to four strategies. significantly more parents used strategies based on overinvolvement and anxious behavior during the interactions than had been reported by them in the interviews. in contrast, reassurance and reinforcement of avoidance/dependence were used in interactions by fewer parents than would be expected, according to the interviews. relevant implications for assessment and intervention with families of anxious children are suggested.
children's_health	backgroundessential trace elements are vital to human health. in this study, our aim was to establish reference intervals of and to evaluate relationships among ca, fe, cu, mg, and zn for children. methodswe collected blood samples of 3210 children aged 0-14 years from lu'an, china, and concentrations of the above elements were determined by atomizer absorption spectrophotometer. a nonparametric method was used to establish the reference intervals. resultsgender-related differences in concentrations were not statistically significant for the elements, except for fe. there were strong positive and negative correlations between age and fe (r = 0.305, p < 0.001), zn (r = 0.573, p < 0.001); and age and ca (r = -0.372, p < 0.001), cu (r = -0.127, p < 0.001), respectively. correlations between ca-mg (r = 0.222 similar to 0.384, p < 0.001), fe-mg (r = 0.495 similar to 0.614, p < 0.001), and fe-zn (r = 0.239 similar to 0.471, p < 0.001) were the strongest compared with others. in multivariable linear regression, after adjusted for confounding factors, the associations between zn-fe and mg-fe were the strongest with per concentration quintile increase of fe caused zn and mg increasing by 4.19% ( = 0.041; 95% ci: 0.037, 0.045; p < 0.001) and 3.87% ( = 0.038; 95% ci: 0.036, 0.040; p < 0.001), respectively. conclusionsgender- and age-based reference intervals of ca, fe, cu, mg, and zn for children were established, and correlations between them were quite complex. more works are needed to illuminate these relationships and their impacts on children 's health.
lymphoma	the objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and factors associated with sexual problems and their relationship to health-related quality of life (hrqol) in male and female non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) survivors. in this cross-sectional study, 738 nhl survivors (425 men and 313 women; mean time since diagnosis, 6.2 years) in south korea completed the six-item instrument of adult sexual behavior used by the national health and social life survey in the united states. hrqol was measured by two subscales of the eortc qlq-c30. sexual problems were reported by a greater proportion of women (range, 31.9 to 64.4%) than men (range, 23.3 to 49.1%). among four items common to both sexes, three (lacking interest in sex, unable to achieve orgasm, sex not pleasurable) were significantly more prevalent in women. significant factors associated with multiple sexual problems in men were older age and being unemployed; in women, they were marital status and comorbidity. lastly, more significant associations between sexual problems and hrqol were observed in men than in women. male and female nhl survivors differ in the prevalence of sexual problems and the factors associated with them as well as their associations with hrqol. these findings can be used to develop sex-specific interventions to improve sexual function in this population.
autism	brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) plays an important role in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. altered blood bdnf levels have been frequently identified in people with autism spectrum disorders (asd). there are however wide discrepancies in the evidence. therefore, we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at qualitative and quantitative synthesis of studies that measured blood bdnf levels in asd and control subjects. observational studies were identified through electronic database searching and also hand-searching of reference lists of relevant articles. a total of 183 papers were initially identified for review and eventually twenty studies were included in the meta-analysis. a meta-analysis of blood bdnf in 887 patients with asd and 901 control subjects demonstrated significantly higher bdnf levels in asd compared to controls with the smd of 0.47 (95% ci 0.07-0.86, p = 0.02). in addition subgroup meta-analyses were performed based on the bdnf specimen. the present meta-analysis study led to conclusion that bdnf might play role in autism initiation/ propagation and therefore it can be considered as a possible biomarker of asd.
healthy_sleep	study objectives: despite several polysomnographic normative studies and multiple surveys of sleep disorders in the general population, few data have been collected on healthy sleepers. we aimed to survey the characteristics of healthy sleep. methods: we prospectively investigated the sleep history of 100 subjects of a representative population sample who reported undisturbed sleep and in whom relevant sleep disorders were ruled out by a two-step screening procedure. approximately four subjects had to be contacted for identifying 1 eligible subject who participated. results: the median reported time in bed was from 23: 00 (21:30-02:00) to 07:00 (05:30-11:00). the total sleep duration was 7.3 h (5-10 h), varying from 7.5 h in the age group60 years (p = 0.002). the median sleep efficiency was high (93.3%, range: 55.6% to 100%). fifty-one subjects reported occasional snoring. forty-five subjects reported sporadic non-bothersome sleep-related movement disorders (25 sleep-related leg cramps, 22 lifetime bruxism, 5 restless legs syndrome), and 36 had a history of sporadic non-bothersome parasomnias (27 nightmares, 12 sleepwalking, 1 sleep paralysis). conclusion: in this population of healthy sleepers, snoring is the most common finding. moreover, non-bothersome forms of recognizable sleep-related movement disorders and parasomnias are surprisingly common. these findings may suggest that diagnostic criteria of sleep disorders should not only be based on the presence of symptoms but also account for a minimum frequency or discomfort.
dementia	between 2013 and 2030, older adults 65 years and older of racial/ethnic populations in the u.s. is projected to increase by 123% in comparison to the whites (non-hispanics). to meet this demand, training of ethnically diverse health staff in long-term care facilities in palliative and hospice care is imperative. the purpose of this study was to evaluate a palliative and hospice care training of staff in two nursing homes in hawaii - (a) to evaluate knowledge and confidence over three time periods, and (b) to compare staff and family caregiver satisfaction at end of program. the educational frameworks were based on cultural and communication theories. fifty-two ethnically diverse staff, a majority being asian (89%), participated in a 10-week module training and one 4 hour communication skills workshop. staff evaluation included knowledge and confidence surveys, pre- and post-test knowledge tests, and famcare-2 satisfaction instrument. there were nine asian (89%) and pacific islander (11%) family caregivers who completed the famcare-2 satisfaction instrument. the overall staff knowledge and confidence results were promising. the staff rated overall satisfaction of palliative care services lower than the family caregivers. implications for future research, practice, and education with palliative and hospice care training of ethnically diverse nursing home staff is to include patient and family caregiver satisfaction of palliative and hospice care services, evaluation of effectiveness of cross-cultural communication theories in palliative and hospice care staff training, and support from administration for mentorship and development of these services in long term care facilities.
psoriatic_arthritis	psoriatic arthritis (psa) is a chronic condition characterized by a diverse set of symptoms, from swollen joints to nail disease to skin disease. a variety of treatment options are available, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (tnfis). little is known about treatment persistence in patients with psa who initiate tnfi therapy, with and without prior biologic use. this study assessed persistence in these subgroups of patients with psa and identified factors associated with persistence. this retrospective study utilized data from the corrona registry of patients with psa-with or without prior biologic experience-who initiated tnfi therapy between october 1, 2002, and march 21, 2013. kaplan-meier curves estimated median time to nonpersistence (discontinuation or switch to another biologic). cox proportional hazards models identified factors associated with tnfi nonpersistence. a total of 1241 tnfi initiations were identified: 549 by biologic-na < ve and 692 by biologic-experienced patients. through 4 years of follow-up, more biologic-na < ve than biologic-experienced patients remained persistent. biologic-na < ve patients had a greater mean time to nonpersistence compared with biologic-experienced patients: 32 vs 23 months (p = 0.0002). moderate and high disease activities based on clinical disease activity index and disease duration were associated with persistence in both biologic-na < ve and biologic-experienced patients. additionally, in the biologic-experienced patients, the number of prior medications and skin disease were associated with persistence. the majority of patients with psa in this study were persistent with their tnfi therapy; biologic-na < ve patients had greater persistence compared with biologic-experienced patients. predictors of persistence differed slightly between biologic-na < ve and biologic-experienced patients.
digestive_health	advances in medical treatment for gastric ulcer (gu) and duodenal ulcer (du) have lead to an increase in the number of cases where surgical interventions implied resection and vagotomy. a classic or laparoscopic approach is required by perforated du, diagnosis responsible for the high percentage of deaths. in this case it is excluded the conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors and the eradication of the infection with helicobacter pylori (hp). our study presents observations on the treatment of postoperative du on a group of elderly patients (>60 years) with associated chronic diseases. the studied group includes patients hospitalized between 2005 - 2010 in the department of surgery, in sf. pantelimon, sf. loan, and coltea hospitals. of 186 emergency presentations, 23 were duodenal ulcer relapse, 126 perforated du and gu 37 were cases of perforated gu. 15-16% were aged >60 years, mainly males. for cases of duodenal ulcer recurrence in the first aggressive manifestation or recurrent duodenal ulcer, treatment was instituted along with the terapeutical association regarding the type of diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, cirrhosis. for this situation, as for the treatment after surgery we considered national and international guidelines, as the consensus in 1996 in maastricht ""european concept in the management of helicobacter pilory infection"" and the 1997 u.s. ""american digestive health foundation.
atrial_fibrillation	objective: this study was conducted to determine the effect of cognitive-behavioral stress management (cbt) on reducing psychological stress in diabetic pregnant women.method: this randomized controlled trial applied through pretest and post-test with control group was conducted on 88 eligible women with gestational diabetes. women who had a stress score more than 15, randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. intervention group received stress management training within six two-hour sessions for three weeks. stress and fbs were measured before intervention and two weeks after the last session. data were analyzed using the spss version 19.0. results were analyzed using chi-square, paired t test and independent sample t test.results: in cbt training group, stress significantly decreased two weeks after the training (p<0.001). in the control group, the stress scores were significantly different before and after the intervention and women had a significant increase in the stress scores (p=0.028). there was a significant difference between two groups in stress scores, two weeks after intervention (p=0.001).conclusion: cognitive-behavioral stress management reduces stress in women with gestational diabetes and reducing stress may also improve the pregnancy outcomes, especially whose glycemic along with stress is not adequately controlled by medication.
psoriatic_arthritis	objective to evaluate levels of the calcium-binding proteins s100a8 and s100a9 in the skin of patients with psoriatic arthritis. methods skin punch biopsies were obtained from patients with psoriatic arthritis and healthy control subjects. s100a8/a9 were semiquantified via immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. results the study included biopsies from nine patients with psoriatic arthritis and nine control subjects. s100a8 and s100a9 were present at visibly higher levels in psoriatic plaques compared with normal skin samples. s100a8 and s100a9 rna levels were significantly higher in the peripheral region of plaques compared with the central region. conclusion both s100a8 and s100a9 may represent good therapeutic targets in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
psoriatic_arthritis	introduction: adaptive immunity in intestinal inflammation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of crohn 's disease. in particular, interleukin (il)-23 may be a key mediator in chronic intestinal inflammation by inducing the differentiation of naive cd4+t cells into th17, with the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. furthermore, il-23 induces interferon- (ifn- ) production from activated t cells, a critical cytokine in innate and adaptive immunity against infections.areas covered: we aim to review the available data from literature regarding the role of il-23, with a more specific focus on the recent progresses in the therapeutic modulation of this cytokine.expert commentary: increased knowledge regarding the role of il-23 has allowed for the development of effective therapeutic progresses by blocking the il-23 mediated pathways. primary or secondary loss of response to anti-tnf therapies in crohn 's disease patients during the first year is widely described in literature: the development of new drugs, with alternative mechanisms of action, is thus a key point to consider for the optimal management of these subjects. drugs blocking the il-12/23 pathway showed a good efficacy and safety profile in immune-mediated diseases further studies are necessary regarding the role of the single blockade of il-23.
psoriasis	the incidence of psoriasis in africa and the middle east (afme) is high as in other regions and represents a significant problem for both dermatologists and patients. psoriasis co-morbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and psoriatic arthritis (psa) are also particularly common in these regions and may be under-recognized and under-treated. despite this, regional guidelines to aid physicians on the appropriate use of biologic agents in their clinical practice are limited. a group of expert dermatologists from across the afme region were surveyed to help establish best practice across the region, alongside supporting data from the literature. although biologics have significantly improved patient outcomes since their introduction, the results of this survey identified several unmet needs, including the lack of consensus regarding their use in clinical practice. discrepancy also exists among afme physicians concerning the clinical relevance of immunogenicity to biologics, despite increasing data across inflammatory diseases. significant treatment and management of challenges for psoriasis patients remain, and a move towards individualized, tailored care may help to address these issues. the development of specific local guidelines for the treatment of both psoriasis and psa could also be a step towards understanding the distinct patient profiles in these regions.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	lung diseases impose a huge economic and health burden worldwide. a key aspect of several adult lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), including emphysema, is aberrant tissue repair, which leads to an accumulation of damage and impaired respiratory function. currently, there are few effective treatments available for these diseases and their incidence is rising. the planar cell polarity (pcp) pathway is critical for the embryonic development of many organs, including kidney and lung. we have previously shown that perturbation of the pcp pathway impairs tissue morphogenesis, which disrupts the number and shape of epithelial tubes formed within these organs during embryogenesis. however, very little is known about the role of the pcp pathway beyond birth, partly because of the perinatal lethality of many pcp mouse mutant lines. here, we investigate heterozygous looptail (lp) mice, in which a single copy of the core pcp gene, vangl2, is disrupted. we show that these mice are viable but display severe airspace enlargement and impaired adult lung function. underlying these defects, we find that vangl2lp/+ lungs exhibit altered distribution of actin microfilaments and abnormal regulation of the actin-modifying protein cofilin. in addition, we show that vangl2lp/+ lungs exhibit many of the hallmarks of tissue damage, including an altered macrophage population, abnormal elastin deposition and elevated levels of the elastin-modifying enzyme, mmp12, all of which are observed in emphysema. in vitro, disruption of vangl2 impairs directed cell migration and reduces the rate of repair following scratch wounding of human alveolar epithelial cells. moreover, using population data from a birth cohort of young adults, all aged 31, we found evidence of an interactive effect between vangl2 and smoking on lung function. finally, we show that pcp genes vangl2 and scrib are significantly downregulated in lung tissue from patients with emphysema. our data reveal an important novel role for the pcp pathway in adult lung homeostasis and repair and shed new light on the genetic factors which may modify destructive lung diseases such as emphysema.
migraine	unnecessary confusion still surrounds the use of combined hormonal contraceptives (chcs) in the setting of migraine with aura (mwa). clearing this confusion is a key issue for headache specialists, since most women with migraine have menstrual-related migraine (mrm), and some chcs can prevent this particularly severe migraine. their use, however, is still restricted by current guidelines due to concerns of increased stroke risk - concerns that originated over half a century ago in the era of high dose contraceptives. yet studies consistently show that stroke risk is not increased with today 's very low dose chcs containing 20-25 mu g ethinyl estradiol (ee), and continuous ultra low-dose formulations (10-15 mu g ee) may even reduce aura frequency, thereby potentially decreasing stroke risk. this article clarifies the stroke risk of chcs and examines their impact on migraine. it also examines how stroke risk is altered by the estrogen content of the chc, by contributing factors such as smoking, age and hypertension, and by aura frequency. and finally, it puts these risks into a meaningful context with a risk/benefit assessment.
bipolar_disorder	replicated evidence indicates that perinatal complications are associated with increased markers of oxidative stress and with mental health problems in children. however, there are fewer reports on the impact of perinatal complications in later phases of development. we aimed to investigate the estimated effects of perinatal complications on levels of lipid peroxidation and on psychopathology in children and adolescents. the study is part of the high risk cohort study for psychiatric disorders; the population was composed by 554 students, 6-14 years of age. serum levels of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, were measured by the tbars method. a household interview with parents and caregivers was conducted and included inquiries about perinatal history, the child behavior checklist (cbcl), and parent 's evaluation, using the mini international psychiatric interview (mini). we created a cumulative risk index, conceptualized as each individual 's cumulative exposure to perinatal complications. results indicate that perinatal complications were associated with higher levels of tbars. after adjusting for age, gender, socio-economic status, cbcl total problems score, parental psychopathology, and childhood maltreatment, children exposed to 3 or more perinatal complications had an 26.9% (95% ci 9.9%, 46.6%) increase in tbars levels, relative to the unexposed group. exploratory mediation analysis indicated that tbars levels partially mediated the association between perinatal complications and externalizing problems. in conclusion, an adverse intrauterine and/or early life environment, as proxied by the cumulative exposure to perinatal complications, was independently associated with higher levels of lipid peroxidation in children and adolescents.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective: to determine rdw and mpv levels in ankylosing spondylitis (as) and to investigate their relations with disease activity. materials and methods: 133 patients with as (male: 80, female: 53) and age-sex matched 133 controls (male: 79, female: 54) were enrolled. demographic data, disease activity scores, complete blood count (cbc), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were recorded. results: the mean ages of patients and controls were 41.9 +/- 11.2 and 39.7 +/- 14.2 years respectively (p = 0.16). rdw (14.5 +/- 1.6% and 13.2 +/- 0.8%, p4) and those with inactive as (basdi < 4) patients (14.84 +/- 1.79fl, 14.24 +/- 1.37fl, p = 0.035 respectively). rdw was positively correlated with basdai (r = 0.33, p < 0.0001), esr (r = 0.45, p < 0.0001) and crp (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001) and plt levels (r = 0.24, p = 0.004). while mpv was not correlated with basdai, it was negatively correlated with esr (r = -0.19, p = 0.03), cpr (r = -0.26, p = 0.004) and plt levels (r = -0.39, p = < 0.0001). conclusions: rdw and mpv were significantly higher in the patients with as than in the controls. while rdw was correlated with basdai and aprs, mpv was only correlated with aprs.
children's_health	when children doodle, the way of graffiti is completely unconscious. they might want to show their emotions through graffiti. as a result of the high degree of attention to children 's graffiti, appreciation education can not only stimulate their potential, but also can promote the growth of children 's health and happiness. this article is mainly about the feelings after a chinese father 's passport was doodled by his son. through the children 's graffiti without awareness, using appreciation education to appreciate, understand and accept the child 's results properly can correctly guide children 's early paintings.
crohn's_disease	background and aims: to investigate the efficacy and safety of three different dosages of embryonated, viable eggs of trichuris suis [tso] versus placebo for induction of remission in mildly-to-moderately active ileocolonic, uncomplicated crohn 's disease [cd]. methods: adults with active cd [n = 252] randomly received six fortnightly doses of 250, 2500, or 7500 tso/15 ml suspension/day [tso 250, tso 2500, tso 7500], or 15 ml placebo solution/day, in a double-blind fashion, with 4 weeks' follow-up. primary endpoint was the rate of clinical remission [crohn 's disease activity index [cdai] < 150] at end of treatment, ie at week 12 or withdrawal. secondary endpoints included the course of clinical remission, rate of clinical response, change in cdai, change in markers of inflammation, mucosal healing, and physician 's global assessment. results: clinical remission at week 12 occurred in 38.5%, 35.2%, and 47.2% of tso 250, tso 2500, and tso 7500 patients, respectively, and in 42.9% of placebo recipients. tso induced a dose-dependent immunological response. there was no response regarding laboratory markers of inflammation. other secondary efficacy variables also showed no advantage of tso over placebo for treatment of active cd. administration of tso did not result in any serious adverse drug reaction. review of non-serious suspected adverse drug reactions following tso did not reveal any safety concerns. conclusions: administration of 250-7500 tso fortnightly over 12 weeks was safe and showed a dose-dependent immunological response, but no tso dose showed a clinically relevant effect over placebo for induction of clinical remission or response in mildly-to-moderately active, ileocolonic cd.
autism	background: inclusion in schools of students with autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a source of stress for teachers and requires a certain amount of adaptation to deal with it. the effects of perceived self-efficacy on burnout in professionals have been substantiated but the indirect effects, mediated by transactional processes of stress and coping, have never been explored in this specific context. this study aims to test the mediating effect of perceived stress and coping strategies on the relationship between perceived self-efficacy and burnout. method: a sample of 203 teachers of students with asd filled out four self-report questionnaires measuring perceived self-efficacy, perceived stress, coping strategies, and burnout. a multiple mediation analysis was carried out using the bootstrap procedure. results: after controlling for the direct effect of perceived self-efficacy on burnout, the indirect effects through transactional processes were significant. the lower the teachers' feeling of self-efficacy, the more they implemented emotion-focused coping strategies, which predict higher burnout in all three of its dimensions. moreover, the lower the teachers' feeling of self-efficacy, the more they perceived the stressful situation in question as a threat or loss, perceptions that generate more emotional exhaustion. conclusion: these results enable us to formulate some ideas for improving both the wellbeing of teachers working with students with asd and the management of such students, and thus their learning abilities and wellbeing in school.

osteoporosis	previous reports demonstrated that bone density decreased rapidly during the initial few months of steroid therapy and continued decreasing at a rate of 2 to 4% annually. our data indicates that denosumab can also play a role in the treatment of osteoporosis in the steroid-taking population. introduction respiratory physicians are often faced with the dilemma that long-term steroid use will deteriorate bone mineral density and quality. previous reports demonstrated that bone density decreased 8 to 12% during the initial few months of steroid therapy then continued decreasing at a rate of 2 to 4% annually. several prospective trials revealed that denosumab increased bone density in patients with osteoporosis [2-4] and decreased the rate of occurrence of fractures. the long-term efficacy of denosumab for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, however, has not yet been proven. materials this has been an ongoing prospective study since 2014. in our respiratory centre, the first preventative measure used to combat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (gio) is oral bisphosphonates. thirty-six patients were enlisted, and their treatment courses were changed from oral bisphosphonate, if administered, to the subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60 mg every 6 months, combined with a daily oral intake of denotas (r) chewable combination tablets. the primary efficacy measures were changes in lumbar spine (ls) bone mineral density (bmd) and femoral bmd from baseline at 4, 8, 12 and 28 months. results at the 12-month follow-up, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine area of these patients increased by 3.2%, while bone mineral density in the hip area showed no significant increase. at the 28-month follow-up, 25 patients were still included in this study. femoral bmd at 28 months increased significantly from the 12 -month follow -up (p = 0.0259), though the first 12 months showed no significant increase. ls bmd continued to increase through the 28-month period. conclusions very little is known regarding the active prevention of gio. our data indicates that denosumab can play a promising role in the treatment of gio.
osteoarthritis	background: metabolic syndrome (mets) is a collection of clinical conditions, including central obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. the long-term inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction associated with mets may contribute to osteoarthritic processes leading up to total joint arthroplasty (tja). the purpose of this study was to investigate levels of metabolic biomarkers and the prevalence of mets in patients undergoing tja. methods: under irb approval, citrated plasma samples were collected from 41 patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (tha/tka) preoperatively and day 1 postoperatively. control group consisted of 25 healthy human plasma samples (female and male, 18-35 years old) purchased from george king biomedical inc. (overland park, ks, usa). samples were profiled for c-peptide, ferritin, il-6, insulin, resistin, tnf-alpha, il-la, leptin, and pai-1 using metabolic biochips purchased from randox co. (antrim, northern ireland). ncep/atp iii guidelines were used to evaluate which patients met mets criteria. results. levels of il-6, resistin, tnf-a, il-la, leptin, and pai-i were significantly elevated in patients uridergoing tja compared to normal. c-peptide and insulin were both decreased in tja compared to normal. no significance was found when comparing tja to normal for ferritin. tnf alpha was significantly lower in tja+mets compared to tja-mets, while other biomarkers showed no diffbrence in tja mets populations. insulin & c-peptide both showed a significant decrease in tja-mets compared to normal, but levels in tja+mets patients were not significantly different from controls. resistin showed significant increases in tja+mets vs. normal, but not in tja-mets vs. normal. conclusions: overall, the differing metabolic profile seen in patients undergoing tja suggest ongoing metabolic dysfunction. insulin and c-peptide patterns among the different test groups hint toward a complex and dysfunctional metabolic process involved, with leptin and underlying insulin resistance playing a role. increased resistin in tja+mets, but not in tja-mets, compared to normal, suggests that while elevated resistin levels may be associated with the osteoarthritic process, levels are further attenuated by mets, which is highly prevalent in this population. increased tnfa in tja-mets compared to tja+mets may be an artifact of differing sample populations or a true complication of the complex pathophysiology and medical regimen seen in patients with both oa and mets. the lack of difference seen in the remaining biomarkers suggest that having mets as a comorbidity does not contribute to the elevated levels seen in patients undergoing tja.
psoriasis	introduction. - the etiologies of intertrigo in adults are numerous and different. the objective of our work was to study the epidemiological, clinical and the risk factors of intertrigo in adults. methods. - we conducted a prospective study for a period of seven months in two dermatology units in dakar (senegal). all adults patient with intertrigo seen during this period who gave consent were included. results. - one hundred and three patients with intertrigo were diagnosed with a hospital prevalence of 2.54%. the sex-ratio was 0.63 and the average age was 41. the study of habits and lifestyles of the patients found a history of intensive skin lightening, sport, wearing synthetic clothes and smoking in 26, 22, 20 and 22 cases, respectively. infectious complications mainly bacterial (3.88%) and viral (1.94%) were reported in nine cases (8.7%). a dry erythroderma was noted in 3 cases (2.9%). it was found that the intertigo was commonly caused by fungal infections with a prevalence of 48.5% followed by immuno-allergic reactions with a prevalence of 34.9%, suppurative hidradenitis and inverse psoriasis with the same prevalence of 2.9%. fifty-eight percent of cases with tinea and 63% of cases with candidiasis were women. thirty-five percent of tinea cases and 45% of candidiasis cases were found to have a history of intensive skin lightening. conclusion. - the cause of intertrigo in adults are mainly infectious, particularly fungi, infections and immuno-allergic diseases. there are predisposing factors and some professions are more at risk.

atrial_fibrillation	atp and mortality in 69,000 icd patients aimsantitachycardia pacing (atp) is an effective treatment for ventricular tachycardia (vt) and can reduce the frequency of shocks in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd). the association between survival and atp, as compared to a shock, has not been confirmed in a large patient population. this study aims to determine if patients with an icd receiving atp have lower mortality, as compared to those receiving shock. methodssixty-nine thousand three hundred and sixty-eight patients underwent icd implantation between october 2008 and may 2013 and were enrolled in the remote monitoring network (st. jude medical, st. paul, mn, usa). patients were categorized into three groups based on the type of icd therapy received during follow-up: no therapy (n = 47,927), atp (n = 8,049), and shock (n = 13,392) groups. survival was determined by linking implant records to the social security death index. resultsthe no therapy (hazard ratio [hr] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.56-0.64, p < 0.001) and atp (hr 0.70, 95% ci 0.64-0.77, p < 0.001) groups were associated with a lower mortality risk than the shock group. these results were unaffected by age, gender, device type, atrial fibrillation (af) burden, or ventricular rate. atp was effective in 85% of episodes and atp effectiveness was dependent on the ventricular rate. conclusionsmortality rates were higher in icd patients who received only atp compared to no therapy, but icd patients who received a shock had higher mortality compared to both groups. furthermore, the data suggest that age, gender, device type, af burden, and rate of arrhythmia do not change the trend of higher mortality in patients receiving icd shock compared to atp alone.
addiction	tobacco use is the leading cause df preventable death in the united states, and exposure to tobacco smoke harms children from conception forward. there is no safe level of tobacco exposure. although overall smoking rates have declined, the advent of new products, such as electronic cigarettes, threatens to perpetuate nicotine addiction without clear health benefits. in addition to reviewing traditional and new tobacco products, we discuss the unique role that pediatricians should play in tobacco treatment and control efforts. new policies and technologies can empower pediatric clinicians and pediatric health care sys-tems to help parent smokers quit, and new policies outside of the health care setting might help prevent smoking initiation as well as improve cessation treatments. future research is needed to continue to study the consequences of tobacco use exposure as well as the best ways to help patients and parents stop tobacco use.
psoriasis	innate lymphoid cells (ilc) are members of a heterogeneous family with a lymphoid origin that mimics the t helper (th) cytokine profile. ilc are involved in early effector cytokine-mediated responses during infections in peripheral tissues. ilc also play an important role in chronic skin inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. although classical ilc express cd127, it has been recently reported that the presence of non-classical cd127-ilc populations and an early ilc precursor (eilp) cd127(low). ilc development has predominately been investigated in mouse models. however, in humans, different transcription factors have been described for ilc identification. nfil3 (nuclear factor, il-3 regulated) is crucial for ilc development in response to il-7. cd123 (il-3r alpha) is usually used to exclude basophils during ilc identification, however, it is unknown if in response to il-3, nfil3 could be relevant to induce ilc features in lin-cd123(+) populations in addition, is also unknown whether peripheral blood (pb) population with ilc features may have skin-homing potential to participate in skin inflammatory chronic diseases. here, we report a lin-cd123(+) cd127(low) cd7(+) cla(+) population that share some phenotypic properties with basophils, but expresses several transcription factors for ilc commitment such as inhibitor of dna binding 2 (id2), nfil3, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (plzf), thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box protein (tox), and t cell factor-1 (tcf-1). in addition, this population expresses different ilc markers: cd132, cd90, cd161, alpha 4 integrin, c-kit, crth2, ahr, and il-23r. il-3 prevents apoptosis and increases their nfil3, tox, and plzf expression. in pb, the cd123(+) cd127low population is predominantly a conspicuous population that expresses t-bet and ror gamma t. the lin-cd123(+) cd127(low) population in pb has a limited th type cytokine expression and highly expresses il-8. the lin-cd123(+) cd127(low) population expresses skin-homing receptors (cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and cxcr4) and transmigrates through endothelial cells in response to sdf-1. an equivalent lin-cd123(low) population was identified in control skin, which shows a broader phenotypic diversity and cytokine production, including il-22 and il-17. remarkably, the cd123(low) population in the lesion and non-lesion skin of psoriasis patients expresses il-17 and il-22. our findings suggest the identification of an alternative lin-cd123(+) cd127(low) population with ilc features endowed with migratory capabilities that might contribute to immunopathological hallmarks of psoriasis.
children's_health	introduction: family-centered care (fcc) is a health-care delivery approach endorsing the support and participation of families. to date, little research has addressed the associations between fcc and adaptation outcomes specifically in the context of pediatric cancer. the main objective of this research was to identify the direct and indirect associations, through caregiving burden, between parents' fcc and quality of life (qol) and life satisfaction. method: participants were 204 parents of children diagnosed with cancer. parents answered the measure of processes of care questionnaire to evaluate their perceptions of fcc in 2 domains: family-centered services and provision of general information. perceptions of caregiving burden (revised burden measure), qol (eurohis-qol-8), and life satisfaction (satisfaction with life scale) were also assessed. pediatric oncologists provided information on the child 's diagnosis and treatment status. results: findings showed that when parents perceived their children 's health care as more family-centered, they also reported lower caregiving burden. family-centered services were indirectly linked to qol and life satisfaction through caregiving burden. discussion: this research suggests that the way parents perceive formal care, namely as being more or less family-centered, may influence the burden they experience as caregivers of a child with cancer and, indirectly, their adaptation. these findings highlight the relevance of gaining greater understanding of the interaction between the family and the health-care systems in the context of pediatric cancer.
lymphoma	although aplastic anemia (aa) and myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) are separate entities with different management, distinction between the two can be difficult on morphological basis due to hypocellularity of bone marrow. mds is one of the serious complications of aa. karyotyping is definitive in the diagnosis of mds. better and robust investigations like f-18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (f-18-fdg pet-ct) are essential in high risk patients with haematological malignancies and in those relapsing within a short period of time after initiation of therapy or having refractory disease. it might be helpful in the development of individual treatment algorithms for these high-risk patients. there may be unique problems in hematological malignancies where the transformation of one pathology into another may be silent with no biomarkers that can predict this transformation e.g. transformation of mds from aa. studies have shown that immune suppression can lead to a variety of haematological and lymphoproliferative disorders which may co-exist. f-18-fdg pet-ct may be useful in identifying the primary or occult sites of malignancy and also can direct the site from which biopsy can be attempted. we present a patient with carcinoma right breast who developed hematological and lymphoproliferative disorders during the course of her treatment. in this case, aa transformed to mds with abnormal karyotype (chromosome 9 mutation) and then progressed further to manifest cutaneous t cell lymphoma before patient succumbed to her illness. immune mediated suppression of haemopoiesis has been considered the most important mechanism in this case.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: programmed cell death protein 1 (pd-1) plays an important role in immune response regulation as a co-inhibitory signal during t cell activation. however, there is little known about the serum autoantibody profile of pd-1 in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), a disease characterized by the breakdown of immune tolerance to self-antigens and an excessive production of autoantibodies. thus, we aim to investigate the serum levels and function of anti-pd-1 in patients with new-onset sle. methods: serum levels of anti-pd-1 igg and igm isotypes were detected in new-onset sle patients (n = 90), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 50), primary sjogren 's syndrome (n = 50), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 25), and healthy controls (hc) (n = 80) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the correlation of anti-pd-1 with clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of patients with new-onset sle was analyzed. the effects of purified anti-pd-1 igg from sle patients on t cell proliferation were measured using flow cytometry. results: the data revealed increased levels of anti-pd-1 igg, but not igm, especially in new-onset sle patients, and the positive rate of anti-pd-1 igg was 30 (33.3%). the level of anti-pd-1 igg was closely associated with malar rash (or = 15.773), arthritis (or = 22.937), serositis (or = 16.008), hematological (or = 35.187), renal (or = 8.306), and neurological involvement (or = 37.282). moreover, the serum levels of anti-pd-1 igg were positively correlated with the sle disease activity index (sledai) score (r = 0.296, p = 0.0046) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) (r = 0.2446, p = 0.0201). in vitro examination showed that purified anti-pd-1 igg obtained from sle patients enhanced t cell proliferation when co-cultured with dendritic cells (dcs). conclusions: the current study indicates, for the first time, that the serum levels of co-inhibitor autoantibodies against pd-1 are elevated in new-onset sle patients and are associated with disease activity in sle. autoantibodies against pd-1, facilitating t cell proliferation, revealed a new insight into the function of negative regulation signals involved in the pathogenesis of sle.
autism	there is a critical need for evidence-based, broadband behavioral, and asd screening measures for use in pediatric and early educational settings to ensure that young children at risk for developing social-emotional disorders and/or asd are provided with early intervention services to optimize long-term outcomes. the bitsea is a 42-item screener designed to identify social-emotional/behavioral problems and delays/deficits in social-emotional competence among 11-48-month-olds; 19 items describe behaviors consistent with asd. secondary data analysis was employed to develop cut-scores for asd subscales using receiver operating curves, discriminating children with (n = 223) and without (n = 289) asd. cut-scores demonstrated moderate-to-high discriminative power, sensitivity, specificity, and ppv. findings highlight feasibility of using a broadband social-emotional competence and behavior problem screener to improve early detection of asd.
healthy_sleep	healthy sleep is essential for human well-being. sleep analysis is a necessary process for the majority of sleep disorders diagnosis. in this work we propose to analyze brain activity through electroencephalogram analysis in order to identify sleep stages variation. we focus on the classification phase. most works in sleep stages classification are based on prior experts signal scoring which is a hard task. so many available unlabeled data remain unused. to explore more these data and enrich the study of sleep classification, we propose a hybrid approach based on learning classifier systems and artificial neural networks. the effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using real eelectroencephalography data. good results were reached comparing to supervised learning methods usually used. the proposed approach provides also, an explicit model that could be analyzed a posteriori by experts.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are among the most common chronic diseases and their prevalence is increasing. each of these diseases is characterized by the secretion of cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules which are thought to play a critical role in their pathogenesis. moreover, immune cells, particularly neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells as well structural cells such as epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells are also involved in the pathogenic cycle of these diseases. there is a pressing need for the development of new therapies for these pulmonary diseases, particularly as no existing treatment has been shown to reduce disease progression. hmgb1 (high-mobility group box 1), originally identified as a nuclear non histone protein with dna-binding domains can be secreted by living and dying cells and it is now regarded as an important endogenous danger signaling molecule. besides as a signal of tissue injury, hmgb1 is considered a powerful mediator of inflammation and high levels of hmgb1 are found in chronic lung diseases. the role of hmgb1 in respiratory diseases is still elusive nevertheless these studies suggest an involvement of this cytokine in their pathogenesis. nucleic acid-based drugs (nabds) are a novel class of pharmaceuticals including antisense oligonucleotides, dna-zymes, and rna interference as mediated by small interfering rna (sirna), which are used to dampen the expression of disease-causing genes having therapeutic potential for controlling chronic airway diseases. due to their inherent difficulties, such as for example sensitivity to endonucleases, their delivery in vivo should be assured by vectors. non-viral lipid-and polymer-based nanosystems have acquired much importance in this context. in this review, we will discuss these emerging tools in gene therapy of chronic lung diseases, particularly the use of sirna in the down-regulation of critical molecules in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, with particular emphasis on hmgb1 as therapeutic target.
osteoarthritis	neurons in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (vme) have an axon that branches peripherally to innervate the orofacial region and projects centrally to the trigeminal motor nucleus (vmo). they function as the primary neurons conveying proprioceptive messages. the present study aimed to demonstrate the presence of a periodontal-vme-vmo circuit and to provide evidence for its involvement in an experimental unilateral anterior crossbite (uac) model, which can induce osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joint. cholera toxin b subunit (ctb) was injected into the inferior alveolar nerve of rats to help identify the central axon terminals of vme neurons in the vmo. the levels of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vglut1) expressed in the periodontal region, vme, vmo, and masseter, and the level of acetylcholinesterase (ache) expressed in the masseter, were assessed in uac rats and controls. in ctb-treated rats, many ctb-labeled cell bodies and endings were identified in the vme and in the vmo, respectively. in uac rats, vglut1 was expressed at a statistically significantly higher level in the periodontal ligament, vme, vmo, and masseter than it was in control rats. the level of ache protein was 1.97 times higher in uac rat masseter compared with control rat masseter. these findings reveal a trigeminal mechanism underlying masseter hyperactivity induced by an altered occlusion.
stress_management	background although the serum adiponectin level is inversely correlated to body mass index and closely associated with obesity and related diseases, neither the impact of weight loss on the adiponectin level nor other factors that might influence the adiponectin level during weight loss intervention are well documented. objective the objective of the study is to assess the change in the serum adiponectin level during weight loss intervention and to determine if sleep parameters affect the serum adiponectin level. methods ninety women with overweight or obesity aged 25 to 65 years completed a 7-month cognitive behavioural therapy based weight loss intervention that included dieting, exercise and stress management. serum adiponectin level, body fat percent, symptoms of depression and anxiety and objective sleep parameters, assessed by actigraphy, were measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. results the serum adiponectin level was significantly increased after the weight loss intervention (p < 0.001). in a multiple regression analysis, the change of the adiponectin level was positively associated with the magnitude of body fat loss (beta = -0.317, p < 0.001) and an increase of sleep minutes (beta = 0.210, p = 0.043). conclusion an increase in objective sleep duration was related to a significantly increased serum adiponectin level independently of the change of body fat during the weight loss intervention.
bipolar_disorder	background: major depressive disorder (mdd) is a disabling mood disorder, and despite a known heritable component, a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies revealed no replicable genetic risk variants. given prior evidence of heterogeneity by age at onset in mdd, we tested whether genome-wide significant risk variants for mdd could be identified in cases subdivided by age at onset. methods: discovery case-control genome-wide association studies were performed where cases were stratified using increasing/decreasing age-at-onset cutoffs; significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested in nine independent replication samples, giving a total sample of 22,158 cases and 133,749 control subjects for subsetting. polygenic score analysis was used to examine whether differences in shared genetic risk exists between earlier and adult-onset mdd with commonly comorbid disorders of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alzheimer 's disease, and coronary artery disease. results: we identified one replicated genome-wide significant locus associated with adult-onset (>27 years) mdd (rs7647854, odds ratio: 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.21, p = 5.2 x 10(-11)). using polygenic score analyses, we show that earlier-onset mdd is genetically more similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than adult-onset mdd. conclusions: we demonstrate that using additional phenotype data previously collected by genetic studies to tackle phenotypic heterogeneity in mdd can successfully lead to the discovery of genetic risk factor despite reduced sample size. furthermore, our results suggest that the genetic susceptibility to mdd differs between adult-and earlier-onset mdd, with earlier-onset cases having a greater genetic overlap with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
addiction	background: ukraine 's hiv epidemic is concentrated among people who inject drugs (pwid), however, coverage with opioid agonist therapies (oats) available mostly at specialty addiction clinics is extremely low. oat integrated into primary healthcare clinics (phcs) provides an opportunity for integrating comprehensive healthcare services and scaling up oat. methods: a pilot study of phc-based integrated care for drug users conducted in two ukrainian cities between 2014 and 2016 included three sub-studies: 1) cross-sectional treatment site preference assessment among current oat patients (n=755); 2) observational cohort of 107 pwid who continued the standard of care versus transition of stabilized and newly enrolled pwid into phc-based integrated care; and 3) pre/post analysis of attitudes toward pwid and hiv patients by phc staff (n=26). results: among 755 oat patients, 53.5% preferred receiving oat at phcs, which was independently correlated with convenience, trust in physician, and treatment with methadone (vs. buprenorphine). in 107 pwid observed over 6 months, retention in treatment was high: 89% in pwid continuing oat in specialty addiction treatment settings (standard of care) vs 94% in pwid transitioning to phcs; and 80% among pwid newly initiating oat in phcs. overall, satisfaction with treatment, subjective self-perception of well-being, and trust in physician significantly increased in patients prescribed oat in phcs. among phc staff, attitudes towards pwid and hiv patients significantly improved over time. conclusions: oat can be successfully integrated into primary care in low and middle-income countries and improves outcomes in both patients and clinicians while potentially scaling-up oat for pwid.

children's_health	the home environment can influence childhood allergies and respiratory health but there is little information on associations between early life exposure at home and new onset. and remission of the asthmatic or allergic symptoms in preschool children. a questionnaire survey was performed in a random cluster sample of 4246 preschool children in urumqi, china. information on the home environment (perceptions of odors and indicators of pollution sources) and children 's health (wheeze, rhinitis and eczema) was collected for the first 2 years of life and the last year (before answering the questionnaire) from one of the parents or another guardian of the child. associations between the home environment the first 2 years of life and new onset and remission of childhood symptoms were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. home environment factors reported for the first 2 years of life were consistently positively associated with new onset of symptoms and negatively associated with remission of symptoms. visible mold (or 1.46,95% cl 1.12-1.90), moldy odor (or 2.15, 95% cl 1.45-3.18), air dryness (or 1.31, 95% cl 1.08-1.59), stuffy odor (or 1.25, 95% cl 1.01-1.54) and parental smoking (or 1.36, 95% cl 1.13-1.65) were associated with new onset of symptoms. these factors were negatively associated with the remission of symptoms. in conclusion, mold contamination at home (moldy odor/visible mold), poor indoor air quality (stuffy odor, air dryness) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ets) in the first 2 years of life can increase the incidence of asthmatic and allergic symptoms and decrease the remission from these symptoms in preschool children.

children's_health	this study aimed to investigate the functional and developmental outcomes in school age children diagnosed with global developmental delay before 2 years old and to verify the association between their final diagnosis and environmental and biological factors. forty-five brazilian children (26 boys), mean age 95.84 (7.72) months, who attended regular school and were diagnosed with global developmental delay before they were 2 years old had their functions evaluated. children with global developmental delay were diagnosed with several conditions at school age. students with greater chances of receiving a diagnosis were those whose mothers were younger at the time their children were born (or = 1.47, ci = 1.04-2.09, p = .03), who had impaired motor performance, specially balance (or = 1.33, ci = 1.01-1.75, p = .04), and who needed help during cognitive and behavioral tasks at school (or = 1.08, ci = 1.00-1.17, p = .048). interdisciplinary evaluation contributed to defining the specific diagnosis and to identifying the necessity of specialized support.
crohn's_disease	background evaluating the impact of steroid or immunosuppressants (si) therapy prior to colectomy in crohn 's disease (cd) patients on postoperative septic and colectomy-specific outcomes using the american college of surgeons (acs)-national surgical quality improvement program (nsqip)-targeted colectomy database. methods all cd patients undergoing colectomy were retrieved from the 2012-2013 nsqip-targeted database. thirty-day postoperative outcomes were compared for patients who were on steroids or immunosuppressants (si) within the 30 days prior to colectomy to the others using univariable and multivariable analyses. results of 2208 cd patients, 1387 (63%) were on si. patients in the si group were younger, and a greater proportion underwent laparoscopic surgery (p\ 0.05). si use was associated with a higher rate of sepsis (7.6 vs. 5.2%), anastomotic leak (5.6 vs. 3.5%), and return to operating room (6.8 vs. 3.3%). on multivariable analysis, si was associated with sepsis, septic shock, and anastomotic leak [odds ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.27]. conclusions these results suggest that si use within 30 days of colectomy is associated with a higher rate of sepsis and septic shock and anastomotic leak in cd patients. withholding si prior to surgery, or the selective use of an ostomy to mitigate the consequences of a leak and hence sepsis need due consideration prior to surgery.
children's_health	divorced parents face distinct challenges in providing care for chronically ill children. children 's residence in two households necessitates the development of family-specific strategies to ensure coparents' supervision of regimen adherence and the management of children 's health care. utilizing a risk and resilience perspective, a grounded theory study was conducted with 14 divorced parents of children with chronic illnesses. the importance of trust, gender, and relationships with third-party care providers emerged as key themes related to the development of effective coparenting relationships for maintaining children 's health. divorced parents were best able to support the management of their children 's chronic conditions when care providers operated as neutral third parties and intermediaries. collaborative family care may require health care practitioners to avoid being drawn into contentious inter-parental conflicts.
autism	we examined the effect of a modified dialogic reading intervention on levels of verbal participation and vocabulary growth in nine preschool children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) using single-case design methodology. baseline book reading resulted in consistently low levels of verbal participation followed by an immediate increase in verbal participation during dialogic book reading sessions for all children. dialogic reading also resulted in greater gains in book-specific vocabulary for all children, as compared with baseline book reading sessions. the improvement in verbal participation was characterized by more frequent responses to the adults' question prompts during reading. no improvements in children 's independent initiations of comments or questions during the book reading activity were observed.
atrial_fibrillation	pulmonary vein isolation by point-by-point radiofre-quency catheter ablation constitutes the cornerstone of catheter ablation strategies for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. however, despite advances in pulmonary vein isolation ablation strategies, long- term success rates after ablation remain suboptimal, which highlights the need to develop techniques to achieve more durable lesions. strategies proposed to improve the durability of pulmonary vein isolation can be divided into two groups: those addressed to improving the quality of the lesion and those that optimize the detection of acute pv reconnection during the ablation procedure. this manuscript reviews the role and potential benefits of these techniques according to current clinical evidence.
children's_health	background and objectives: despite recognised disparities in child health outcomes associated with sleep, the majority of research has been based on small, homogeneous samples. using a nationally-representative sample of us children and adolescents, we examined trends and social determinants of inadequate sleep across age groups. study design: comparison of cross-sectional studies. methods: our study used the 2003 (n = 68,418), 2007 (n = 63,442), and 2011/2012 (n = 65,130) waves of the national survey of children 's health, a nationally-representative survey of 6-17-year-olds. parents reported whether the child had inadequate sleep (0-6 days of not getting enough sleep vs 7 days). results: from 2003 through 2011/12, inadequate sleep increased from 23 to 36% among 6-9-year-olds, 30 to 41% among 10-13-year-olds, and 41 to 49% among 14-17-year-olds. among 10-17-year-olds, those from households with more than a high school degree were more likely to have inadequate sleep (adjusted ors 1.2). although for 10-13-year-olds there was a gradient in inadequate sleep across income (aors 1.2-1.3), for 14-17-year-olds, only those from the two highest income levels were more likely to have inadequate sleep (aors 1.3-1.4). parents' reports that neighbours did not watch out for other 's children was associated with an increased risk for inadequate sleep across all ages (aors 1.1-1.3). conclusions: inadequate sleep occurred as young as age six years and increased with age, became more prevalent, and was socially patterned. in order to prevent inadequate sleep across the life course, surveillance and monitoring are needed across all age groups to identify critical periods for intervention.

mental_health	objective: we examined the association between older adults' mealtime interactions at senior centers in shanghai and their life satisfaction. competing hypotheses, derived from socioemotional selectivity theory and activity theory, were tested. method: data were obtained from the 2011 shanghai senior center service utilization survey (n = 320). relationships between respondents' mealtime interactions and life satisfaction were tested using multilevel regression modeling. results: after adjusting for demographics, interactions with tablemates (companionship, self-disclosure, and instrumental support) were positively associated with respondents' life satisfaction. these associations varied by senior centers. however, the number of tablemates was not significantly associated with respondents' life satisfaction. discussion: findings support the activity-theory-based hypothesis that mealtime interactions are related to older adults' life satisfaction independent of the number of tablemates. this study illuminates the value of social interactions in the context of community dining programs for the rapidly increasing older population in urban china.
migraine	the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of ponticulus posticus among patients with dental angle class i, ii, and iii malocclusions in middle anatolian population. a total of 1246 cephalometric radiographs were examined in a 6 months period. each patient was assigned an identification number, and demographic information, absence/presence of pp, if present, type of pp and type of dental malocclusion were recorded by two observers. in cases where there was any disagreement, a third observer was consulted. distributions of obtained values were analysed using pearson 's chi-square test. the mean age of subjects was 20.98 +/- 6.95 years (range 10-39). in the analysed sample, pp had a prevalence of 18.8 % (complete form 9.6 %, incomplete form 9.2 %). there was a significant difference between genders (p = 0.002) (more prevalent in male patients: 119/522; 23 %). no significant difference was found between age groups (p >0.05). pp was most frequently detected in angle class iii patients (78/351; 22.2 %) but there was no significant difference between malocclusion groups (p >0.05). in the present study, pp is found to be a relatively common anomaly in patients with dental malocclusions. although angle class iii patients showed a higher frequency of pp, statistically no significant difference was found among dental malocclusion groups.
digestive_health	the canadian digestive health foundation initiated a scientific program to assess the incidence, prevalence, mortality and economic impact of digestive disorders across canada in 2009. the current article presents the updated findings from the study concerning irritable bowel syndrome.
psoriasis	psoriasis, a chronic, immune-mediated skin disease characterized by red, scaly plaques, affects approximately 0.3% of the population in japan. the aim of this open-label study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ixekizumab, a humanized, anti-interleukin-17a monoclonal antibody, in japanese patients with plaque psoriasis (n = 78, including 11 psoriatic arthritis), erythrodermic psoriasis (n = 8) and generalized pustular psoriasis (n = 5). ixekizumab was administrated s.c. at baseline (week 0, 160 mg), from weeks 2 to 12 (80 mg every 2 weeks), and from weeks 16 to 52 (80 mg every 4 weeks). at week 52, 92.3% of patients with plaque psoriasis achieved psoriasis area and severity index (pasi) 75, 80.8% achieved pasi 90, 48.7% achieved pasi 100, and 52.6% had remission of plaques (by static physician global assessment, spga [0]). difficult to treat areas of psoriasis (nail or scalp) also responded to ixekizumab. all patients with psoriatic arthritis who were assessed (5/5) achieved an american college of rheumatology 20 response. most patients with erythrodermic psoriasis or generalized pustular psoriasis responded to ixekizumab and the clinical outcome was maintained over 52 weeks (75% and 60% of patients achieved spga [0, 1] at week 52, respectively). mostly mild or moderate treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 79 of 91 patients; the most common were nasopharyngitis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, urticaria and injection site reactions. in conclusion, 52-week ixekizumab treatment was efficacious and well tolerated in japanese patients with plaque psoriasis. efficacy was also observed in patients with erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
anxiety	among anxious populations, attention has been demonstrated to be preferentially biased to threatening material compared to neutral or other valenced material. individuals who have high levels of trait worry, such as those with generalized anxiety disorder (gad), may be biased to threat but research has produced equivocal findings. this review aimed to systematically review the extant experimental literature to establish the current evidence of attentional bias to threat among trait worriers compared to healthy controls and other clinical populations. twenty-nine published articles were included in the final review. there was strong evidence of a bias to threat among gad patients compared to other groups and this was found across most experimental paradigms. few studies had investigated this bias in non-clinical trait worriers. among gad patients this bias to threat was most strongly evidenced when visual threat material was in a verbal-linguistic format (i.e., words) rather than when in pictorial form (i.e., images or faces). the bias was also found across several domains of negative material, supporting the general nature of worry. further research should look to examine the specific components of the threat bias in gad, as well as investigating the bias to threat in trait worriers.
psoriasis	epidermal proliferation, inflammatory changes and microvascular augmentation are prominent features of chronic cutaneous psoriatic lesions. the objective of this study was the investigation of blood and lymphatic microvascular changes in relation to epidermal changes and inflammatory infiltration in dermis. immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to cd34, podoplanin, vascular endothelial growth factorsa and c (vegf-a and c) and morphometric software were used for quantification of the following parameters: blood and lymphatic vessel area (bva and lva), vegf-a and vegf-c positive area, inflammatory cell infiltration in dermis (cia) and epidermal area (ea). in comparison to healthy skin psoriatic lesions showed remarkable elevation of all measured parameters with the following average increase: bva (2.8-times increased), lva (2.6-times increased), vegf-a and vegf-c area (in epidermis 29-times and 19-times increased, in dermis 25-times and 15-times increased, respectively), and ea (3-times increased). statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between cia and ea in psoriatic samples. blood vessels area and vegf-a expression in epidermis showed mild positive correlation with epidermal hyperplasia and weak positive correlation with dermal inflammatory infiltration. vegf-a expression in epidermis also significantly correlated with blood vessels area. as for the lymphatic microcirculation we found a statistically significant positive correlation between lymphatic vessels area and the cellular infiltration in dermis but only weak correlation with epidermal hyperplasia. we hypothesize that angiogenesis in psoriasis is to a greater extent responding to epidermal hyperplasia and in a lesser way to inflammatory infiltration in dermis. however, lymphangiogenesis is significantly related to dermal inflammatory infiltration.
osteoarthritis	objective: to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing group-based outpatient physiotherapy with usual care in patients following total knee replacement. design: a feasibility study for a randomized controlled trial. setting: one secondary-care hospital orthopaedic centre, bristol, uk. participants: a total of 46 participants undergoing primary total knee replacement. interventions: the intervention group were offered six group-based exercise sessions after surgery. the usual care group received standard postoperative care. participants were not blinded to group allocation. outcome measures: feasibility was assessed by recruitment, reasons for non-participation, attendance, and completion rates of study questionnaires that included the lower extremity functional scale and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score. results: recruitment rate was 37%. five patients withdrew or were no longer eligible to participate. intervention attendance was high (73%) and 84% of group participants reported they were very satisfied' with the exercises. return of study questionnaires at six months was lower in the usual care (75%) than in the intervention group (100%). mean (standard deviation) lower extremity functional scale scores at six months were 45.0 (20.8) in the usual care and 57.8 (15.2) in the intervention groups. conclusion: recruitment and retention of participants in this feasibility study was good. group-based physiotherapy was acceptable to participants. questionnaire return rates were lower in the usual care group, but might be enhanced by telephone follow-up. the lower extremity functional scale had high responsiveness and completion rates. using this outcome measure, 256 participants would be required in a full-scale randomized controlled trial.
rheumatoid_arthritis	th17 cells are often associated with autoimmunity and been shown to be increased in cd11b(-/-) mice. here, we examined the role of cd11b in murine collagen-induced arthritis (cia). c57bl/6 and cd11b(-/-) resistant mice were immunized with type ii collagen. cd11b(-/-) mice developed arthritis with early onset, high incidence, and sustained severity compared with c57bl/6 mice. we observed a marked leukocyte infiltration, and histological examinations of the arthritic paws from cd11b(-/-) mice revealed that the cartilage was destroyed in association with strong lymphocytic infiltration. the cd11b deficiency led to enhanced th17-cell differentiation. cd11b(-/-) dendritic cells (dcs) induced much stronger il-6 production and hence th17-cell differentiation than wild-type dcs. treatment of cd11b(-/-) mice after establishment of the treg/th17 balance with an anti-il-6 receptor mab significantly suppressed the induction of th17 cells and reduced arthritis severity. finally, the severe phenotype of arthritis in cd11b(-/-) mice was rescued by adoptive transfer of cd11b(+) dcs. taken together, our results indicate that the resistance to cia in c57bl/6 mice is regulated by cd11b via suppression of il-6 production leading to reduced th17-cell differentiation. therefore, cd11b may represent a susceptibility factor for autoimmunity and could be a target for future therapy.
bipolar_disorder	background: autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by difficulties in social communication, unusually restricted, repetitive behavior and interests, and specific abnormalities in language and perception. the precise etiology of asd is still unknown and probably heterogeneous. in a subgroup of patients, toxic environmental exposure might lead to an imbalance between oxidative stress and anti-oxidant systems. previous serum and postmortem studies measuring levels of glutathione (gsh), the main cellular free radical scavenger in the brain, have supported the hypothesis that this compound might play a role in the pathophysiology of autism. methods: using the method of single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs), we analyzed the gsh signal in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dacc) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) of 24 asd patients with normal or above average iqs and 18 matched control subjects. we hypothesized that we would find decreased gsh concentrations in both regions. results: we did not find overall group differences in neurometabolites including gsh, neither in the dorsal acc (wilks' lambda test; p = 0.429) nor in the dlpfc (p = 0.288). in the dacc, we found a trend for decreased gsh signals in asd patients (p = 0.076). conclusions: we were unable to confirm our working hypothesis regarding decreased gsh concentrations in the asd group. further studies combining mrs, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid measurements of gsh metabolism including other regions of interest or even whole brain spectroscopy are needed.
osteoarthritis	the aim of our study was to cross-sectionally compare patient-reported knee function outcomes between people who chose non-surgical treatment for acl injury and those who chose acl reconstruction. we extracted knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos) and euroqol-5d data entered into the swedish national acl registry by patients with a non-surgically treated acl injury within 180days of injury (n=306), 1 (n=350), 2 (n=358), and 5years (n=114) after injury. these data were compared cross-sectionally to data collected pre-operatively (n=306) and at 1 (n=350), 2 (n=358), and 5years (n=114) post-operatively from age- and gender-matched groups of patients with primary acl reconstruction. at the 1 and 2year comparisons, patients who chose surgical treatment reported superior quality of life and function in sports (1year mean difference 12.4 and 13.2 points, respectively; 2year mean difference 4.5 and 6.9 points, respectively) compared to those who chose non-surgical treatment. patients who chose acl reconstruction reported superior outcomes for knee symptoms and function, and in knee-specific and health-related quality of life, compared to patients who chose non-surgical treatment.
atrial_fibrillation	aim: we evaluated soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (supar) levels in different stroke subtypes and assessed their prognostic value regarding 5-year outcomes. materials and methods: the study included 117 stroke patients (81 males; mean=age 61 +/- 11 years) with suspected cardioembolic stroke whose plasma supar concentration was assessed. altogether, 20 (17.1%) patients suffered from stroke as a result of cardioembolism, 12 (10.3%) from large-artery atherosclerosis, 9 (7.7%) from small-vessel disease, 11 (9.4%) from both large-artery and cardioembolic etiology, and 65 (55.6%) had cryptogenic stroke. the mean followup period was 5 years. results: supar concentration was higher in patients who suffered from stroke/transient ischemic attack due to large-artery atherosclerosis (3.2 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) compared to small-vessel disease (2.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, p<0.001). an elevated plasma supar concentration was associated with all-cause mortality during the followup period (p=0.003). conclusion: elevated plasma supar concentrations predicted all-cause mortality during the 5-year follow-up after ischemic stroke. supar was not able to differentiate patients with cardioembolic stroke from those with other stroke types.
atrial_fibrillation	objectives. atrioventricular nodal ablation (avna) is recommended for patients (pts) with cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) having atrial fibrillation (af) and incomplete ventricular capture (class iia, level b). avna reduces mortality and improves the new york heart association (nyha) functional class during intermediate term follow-up. the objectives were to study the long-term outcome regarding quality of life (qol) and survival of our crt pts after avna. design. 37 crt-pts undergoing avna due to inadequate biventricular pacing were included in the study. data were retrospectively obtained from clinical records and through telephone interviews. results. twenty pts died during the follow-up period of average 30.6 +/- 24 months. after avna the ventricular capture improved significantly from 68.4 +/- 23% to 98.5 +/- 2% (p < 0.001). a significant and sustained improvement of average 0.3 +/- 0.5 ( p +/- 0.001) in nyha functional class was found. additionally a large percentage of pts discontinued taking rate reducing drugs with potential severe side effects. conclusion. avna in crt pts was safe and effective. the treatment resulted in a sustained improvement in qol, including long-term improvement in nyha functional class.
medicare	the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) provides critical nutrition assistance to over 40 million americans each month. low-income older adults (60 and older) and disabled participants experience additional budgetary constraints because of high out-of-pocket medical expenses. in recent years, some states have adopted a ""standard medical expense deduction"" (smed) for senior and disabled beneficiaries, making it easier to report medical expenses in the snap application process. we conduct a descriptive national analysis that shows increases in benefit levels and reporting of medical expenses for states that have implemented smed. we then present descriptive findings from medicare claims data among a sample of low-income older adults in need of food assistance in georgia. average medical expenses among this sample approach $ 200 per month, whereas those for persons diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions exceed $ 300 per month. policy implications of this analysis include the need for more states to consider adoption of smed or alternative estimating approaches, leading to increases in benefit levels for the neediest beneficiaries and decreases in administrative burden among state agencies. we present two possible policy approaches states might take to receive approval for these changes from u.s. department of agriculture.
smoking_cessation	background: in spain, the law 28/2005, which came into effect on january 2006, was a turning point in smoking regulation and prevention, serving as a guarantee for the progress of future strategies in the direction marked by international organizations. it is expected that this regulatory policy should benefit relatively more to lower socioeconomic groups, thus contributing to a reduction in socioeconomic health inequalities. this research analyzes the effect of tobacco regulation in spain, under law 28/2005, on the initiation and cessation of tobacco consumption, and whether this effect has been unequal across distinct socioeconomic levels. methods: micro-data from the national health survey in its 2006 and 2011 editions are used (study numbers: 4382 and 5389 respectively; inventory of statistical operations (iso) code: 54009), with a sample size of approximately 24,000 households divided into 2,000 census areas. this allows individuals' tobacco consumption records to be reconstructed over five years before the initiation of each survey, as well as identifying those individuals that started or stopped smoking. the methodology is based on ""time to event analysis"". cox 's proportional hazard models are adapted to show the effects of a set of explanatory variables on the conditional probability of change in tobacco consumption: initiation as a daily smoker by young people or the cessation of daily smoking by adults. results: initiation rates among young people went from 25% (95% confidence interval (ci), 23-27) to 19% (95% ci, 17-21) following the implementation of the law, and the change in cessation rates among smokers was even greater, with rates increasing from 12% (95% ci, 11-13) to 20% (95% ci, 19-21). however, this effect has not been equal by socioeconomic groups as shown by relative risks. before the regulation policy, social class was not a statistically significant factor in the initiation of daily smoking (p >0.05); however, following the implementation of the law, young people belonging to social classes iv-v and vi had a relative risk of starting smoking 63% (p = 0.03) and 82% (p = 0.02) higher than young people of higher social classes i-ii. on the other hand, lower social class also means a lower probability of smoking cessation; however, the relative risk of cessation for a smoker belonging to a household of social class vi (compared to classes i-ii) went from 24% (p < 0.001) lower before the law to 33% (p < 0.001) lower following the law 's implementation. conclusion: law 28/2005 has been effective, as after its promulgation there has been a decrease in the rate of smoking initiation among young people and an increase in the rate of cessation among adult smokers. however, this effect has not been equal by socioeconomic groups, favoring relatively more to those individuals belonging to higher social classes.
lymphoma	exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, demonstrated cytoprotective actions beyond glycemic control in recent studies. the aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of exendin-4 on high glucose (hg)-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the possible mechanisms. rat cardiomyocytes were divided into 3 groups: normal glucose group (ng group), hg group and hg +exendin-4 group (hg+ex group). cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by double-staining with annexin v-fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)/propidium iodide (pi) and flow cytometry. intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) production was detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (dchf-da) incubation and fluorescence microscopy. ly294002 (ly), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) pathway inhibitor, was added to the medium of the hg+ex+ly group for further western blot analysis. the proteins analyzed involved oxidative stress-associated proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) and nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 (nrf-2), and apoptosis-associated proteins, caspase-3, bax/b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) and p-akt/akt. hg treatment induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (p = 0.00) and clearly upregulated ros production (p = 0.00); exendin-4 co-incubation also ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (p = 0.004) and decreased ros (p = 0.00) level significantly. ho-1 and nrf-2 protein expression levels decreased significantly in the hg group (p < 0.05), but the levels were elevated by exendin-4 intervention (p < 0.05). furthermore, exendin-4 attenuated hg-induced higher protein expression, including cleaved caspase-3 and bax, increased the expression of bcl-2 protein (p < 0.05). however, these impacts of exendin-4 were counteracted significantly by co-incubation with ly294002. in addition, exendin-4 ameliorated hg-induced p-akt/akt lower expression, and this impact was also suppressed by ly294002. exendin-4 ameliorates hg-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and the mechanisms may involve anti-oxidative stress via the ho-1/nrf-2 system, as well as intervention of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway.
migraine	migraine is responsible for high rates of disability. in addition, it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. this association is not limited to the brain in the form of stroke, but includes cardiac ischemia. the increased risk is most consistently described in the female population and in particular for migraine with aura. this article reviews the current knowledge on migraine and the associated risk of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on female-specific factors.

bipolar_disorder	aimpsychiatric side-effects are the main reason for discontinuation of interferon (ifn)-based therapy. recent developments in near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) have enabled non-invasive clarification of brain functions in psychiatric disorders. we prospectively evaluated brain activation in 20 chronic hepatitis c patients with or without ifn-based therapy by using nirs during a verbal fluency task (vft). methodsthe relative concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin were measured while patients completed a questionnaire survey at the start of treatment and at 4 and 12weeks during treatment, using nirs. resultsthe vft performance did not change among the two groups. patients with ifn-based therapy showed significantly lower activation during vft in frontal channels at 12weeks than those at the start of treatment and control (p<0.05). their center for epidemiologic studies depression scale scores were significantly higher at 12weeks than those at the start of treatment, although major depressive symptoms were not found (8.37.9 vs. 13.2 +/- 6.0, p<0.001). conclusionthe decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations of the frontal lobe detected using nirs in this study reflects hypofunction of the frontal lobe. this functional decline that was caused by ifn-based therapy may be associated with the prodromal phase of depression.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objectives: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) are the cornerstone of treatment in axial spondyloarthritis (axspa). we aimed to describe the real life nsaid use in early axspa according to the disease characteristics. methods: the desir cohort is an observational study of patients presenting with inflammatory back pain suggestive of axspa for less than 3 years. patients who attended all 6 visits (every 6 months during the first 2 years and yearly at 3 years) were analysed. data collected at every visit over 3 years was nsaid intake and the asas-nsaid score for the 6 months preceding the visit, where 100 reflects the full daily intake of an nsaid. results: in all, 627 patients were assessed: 46.1% males, mean age: 33.7 (standard deviation: 8.7) years, mean symptom duration: 1.5 (0.9) year and mean basdai: 44.3 (25.3). over the 6 months preceding inclusion, 92.8% had received nsaids; this proportion significantly decreased over time, to 73% patients after 3 years (p < 0.001). this decrease was not different with regard to the fulfillment (or not) of the asas criteria at baseline, nor with regard to the ""arm"" of the asas criteria fulfilled (i.e. imaging vs. clinical). the median asas-nsaid score was 36 [interquartile range: 13-72] at inclusion, and substantially decreased to reach 7 [0-44] after 3 years (p<0.001), although basdai at 3 years was 33.8 (21.7). conclusion: nsaid prescription was very frequent in this early axspa cohort, but the intake was low, and decreased significantly over time, even though symptoms remained present. early axspa patients may not be sufficiently treated with nsaids.

autism	healthy sexual development is important for adolescents with and without disabilities, yet the topic of sexuality is often ignored in the disabled population. adolescents with mild or moderate degrees of disability have rates of sexual activity and reproductive health needs comparable to their typically developing peers. their need for support, risk reduction, and education in sexual health may exceed that of their peers. the medical provider may support healthy sexual development through education, anticipatory guidance, menstrual and contraceptive management, and by expanding the notion of sexuality to include a broader conceptualization of sexual behavior and expression.
crohn's_disease	background: vedolizumab (vdz) is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody effective in ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn 's disease (cd). the aim of this study was to examine the ""real world"" efficacy and safety of vdz in a large national patient cohort. methods: patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with vdz were prospectively followed for 14 weeks. patients who completed the induction protocol (week 0/2/6/14) or discontinued the treatment before week 14 for adverse events (aes) or primary nonresponse were included. the primary outcome was induction of clinical remission at week 14; secondary outcomes included clinical response and corticosteroid-free clinical remission. results: a total of 204 patients (cd-130, uc-69, inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified-5) from 8 centers in israel were included. fifteen (7.4%) of the patients were anti-tumor necrosis factor naive and 46 (35.4%) had a previous surgery. for patients with cd, 69/130 (53.1%) responded to treatment; 45 (34.6%) achieved clinical remission; and 38 (29.2%) achieved corticosteroid-free remission at week 14. fourteen (10.7%) patients discontinued vdz before week 14 due to primary nonresponse or aes. for uc, 32/74 (43.2%) responded to treatment; 20 (28.4%) achieved clinical remission, and 18 (24.3%) achieved corticosteroid-free remission at week 14. fifteen (20.3%) patients with uc did not complete the induction due to primary nonresponse or aes. aes were reported by 29 (14.2%) patients (cd and uc combined), most common being nasopharyngitis and skin eruptions. conclusions: in a large real-world israeli cohort of anti-tumor necrosis factor-experienced patients with inflammatory bowel disease, vdz was effective and safe in induction of clinical remission and steroid-free clinical remission.
osteoarthritis	the objective of this study is to assess pain, function, and morbidity in patients undergoing synovectomy during primary total knee arthroplasty (tka) for osteoarthritis (oa). a meta-analysis, which included randomized controlled trials comparing tka with and without synovectomy for oa, was completed. the primary outcome was postoperative knee pain. secondary outcomes included performance, perioperative complications, validated functional scores, operation length, and hospitalization length. a literature search produced 487 unique references, of which 3 randomized controlled trials were selected for inclusion. a total of 304 patients (354 knees) were included, with an average age of 67 years. follow-up intervals between studies ranged from 26 weeks to 12 months. included studies were ofmoderate-to high-quality evidence with low risk of bias. there was no significant difference between the two groups in regard to postoperative pain, knee society score, or postoperative range of motion. postoperative blood loss was significantly lower in synovium-retaining tka group (md = 99.41 ml; 95% confidence interval, 45.08-153.75). based on these results, there is currently no evidence to support the use of synovectomy in tka for primary oa, as it provides no clinical benefit and increases postoperative blood loss.
osteoarthritis	introduction: quadriceps strength after arthroscopic knee procedures is frequently diminished several years postoperation. blood flow restriction (bfr) training uses partial venous occlusion while performing submaximal exercise to induce muscle hypertrophy and strength improvements. the purpose of this study was to evaluate bfr as a postoperative therapeutic intervention after knee arthroscopy. methods: a randomized controlled pilot study comparing physical therapy with and without bfr after knee arthroscopy was conducted. patients underwent 12 sessions of supervised physical therapy. subjects followed the same postoperative protocol with the addition of 3 additional bfr exercises. outcome measures included thigh girth, physical function measures, knee osteoarthritis outcome score (koos), veterans rand 12-item health survey (vr12), and strength testing. bilateral duplex ultrasonography was used to evaluate for deep venous thrombosis preintervention and postintervention. results: seventeen patients completed the study. significant increases in thigh girth were observed in the bfr group at 6-cm and 16-cm proximal to the patella (p = 0.0111 and 0.0001). all physical outcome measures significantly improved in the bfr group, and the timed stair ascent improvements were greater than conventional therapy (p = 0.0281). the vr-12 and koos subscales significantly improved in the bfr group, and greater improvement was seen in vr-12 mental component score (p = 0.0149). the bfr group displayed approximately 2-fold greater improvements in extension and flexion strength compared with conventional therapy (74.59% vs 33.5%, p = 0.034). no adverse events were observed during the study. conclusions: this study suggests that bfr is an effective intervention after knee arthroscopy. further investigation is warranted to elucidate the benefits of this intervention in populations with greater initial impairment.
osteoporosis	we aimed to develop and validate the fracture health search (fra-hs) score for prediction of risk of osteoporotic fractures in primary care in italy. we selected a cohort of patients aged 40 years between 1999 and 2002. they were followed until the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, death, end of data registration, or end of data availability (december 31, 2012). age, sex, history of osteoporotic fractures, secondary osteoporosis, long-term use of corticosteroids, rheumatoid arthritis, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol abuse/alcohol-related diseases, and the interaction terms sex*use of corticosteroids and age*secondary osteoporosis were entered in a competing-risk regression (fine and gray method) to predict the risk of hip/femur or overall major osteoporotic fractures. the coefficients were combined to obtain the fra-hs for individual patients. explained variance, discrimination, and calibration measures were computed to evaluate the models accuracy. the final model was tested using an independent data source. the fra-hs explained 47.36 and 20.6% of the variation for occurrence of hip/femur and overall major osteoporotic fractures, respectively. area under curve was 0.77 and 0.73, respectively. predicted/observed ratios revealed a margin of error lower than 30% in the 80% of the population. after stratifying by sex, prediction models for hip/femur fractures confirmed acceptable accuracy in both sexes, while poor explained variance (< 20%) was observed for overall major fractures. these findings indicate that fra-hs might be implemented in primary care for risk prediction of hip/femur fractures. general practitioners could be therefore supported by this tool in clinical decision making.
anxiety	backgroundinsomnia is comorbid with internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders. however, the extent to which the etiologic influences on insomnia and common psychopathology overlap is unclear. there are limited genetically informed studies of insomnia and internalizing disorders and few studies of overlap exist with externalizing disorders. methodswe utilized twin data from the virginia adult twin studies of psychiatric and substance use disorders (total n = 7,500). insomnia, internalizing disorders (major depressive disorder [mdd], generalized anxiety disorder [gad]), and alcohol abuse or dependence (aad) were assessed at two time points, while antisocial personality disorder (aspd) was assessed once. cholesky decompositions were performed in openmx and longitudinal measurement models were run on available phenotypes to reduce measurement error. resultsthe latent additive genetic influences on insomnia overlapped significantly (56% for females, 74% for males) with mdd and were shared completely (100%) with gad. there was significant overlap of latent unique environmental influences, with overlap ranging from 38 to 100% across disorders. in contrast, there was less genetic overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders, with 18% of insomnia 's heritability shared with aad and 23% with aspd. latent unique environmental overlap between insomnia and both externalizing disorders was negligible. conclusionsthe evidence for substantial genetic overlap between insomnia and stable aspects of both internalizing disorders suggests that there may be few insomnia-specific genes and investigation into unique environmental factors is important for understanding insomnia development. the modest overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders indicates that these disorders are genetically related, but largely etiologically distinct.
atrial_fibrillation	background the number of anticoagulated trauma patients is increasing. trauma patients on warfarin have been found to have poor outcomes, particularly after intracranial hemorrhage (ich). however, the effect of novel oral anticoagulants (noas) on trauma outcomes is unknown. we hypothesized that patients on noas would have higher rates of ich, ich progression, and death compared with patients on traditional anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. methods this was a prospective observational trial across 16 trauma centers. inclusion criteria was any trauma patient admitted on aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. demographic data, admission vital signs, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores, laboratory values, and interventions were collected. outcomes included ich, progression of ich, and death. results a total of 1,847 patients were enrolled between july 2013 and june 2015. mean age was 74.9 years (sd 13.8), 46% were female, 77% were non-hispanic white. at least one comorbidity was reported in 94% of patients. blunt trauma accounted for 99% of patients, and the median injury severity score was 9 (interquartile range, 4-14). 50% of patients were on antiplatelet agents, 33% on warfarin, 10% on noas, and 7% on combination therapy or subcutaneous agents. patients taking noas were not at higher risk for ich on univariate (24% vs. 31%) or multivariate analysis (incidence rate ratio, 0.78; confidence interval 0.61-1.01, p = 0.05). compared with all other agents, patients on aspirin (90%, 81 mg; 10%, 325 mg) had the highest rate (35%) and risk (incidence rate ratio, 1.27; confidence interval, 1.13-1.43; p < 0.001) of ich. progression of ich occurred in 17% of patients and was not different between medication groups. study mortality was 7% and was not significantly different between groups on univariate or multivariate analysis. conclusion patients on noas were not at higher risk for ich, ich progression, or death. level of evidence prognostic/epidemiologic study, level iii.
atrial_fibrillation	aims to determine tolerability and the optimal dose regimen of the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator vericiguat in patients with chronic heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (hfpef). methods and results socrates-preserved was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, phase 2b dose-finding study in patients with hfpef (ejection fraction >= 45%). patients received vericiguat once daily at 1.25 or 2.5 mg fixed doses or 5 or 10mg titrated from a 2.5 mg starting dose, or placebo for 12 weeks. the two primary endpoints were change from baseline in log-transformed n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) and left atrial volume (lav) at 12 weeks. patients (n = 477; 48% women; mean age 73 +/- 10 years; baseline atrial fibrillation 40%) were randomized within 4 weeks of hf hospitalization (75%) or outpatient treatment with intravenous diuretics for hf (25%) to vericiguat (n = 384) or placebo (n = 93). in the pooled three highest dose arms change in lognt-probnp (vericiguat: +0.038 +/- 0.782 log(pg/ml), n = 195; placebo: -0.098 +/- 0.778 log(pg/ml), n = 73; one-sided p = 0.8991, two-sided p = 0.2017), and change in lav [vericiguat: -1.7 +/- 12.8 ml (n = 194); placebo: -3.4 +/- 12.7 ml (n = 67), one-sided p = 0.8156, two-sided p = 0.3688] were not different from placebo. vericiguat was well tolerated (adverse events: vericiguat 10 mg arm, 69.8%; placebo, 73.1%), with low discontinuation rates in all groups, and no changes in blood pressure at 10 mg compared with placebo. the pre-specified exploratory end-point of kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire clinical summary score improved in the vericiguat 10 mg arm by mean 19.3 +/- 16.3 points [median 19.8 (interquartile range 10.4-30.7)] from baseline (mean difference from placebo 9.2 points). conclusion vericiguat was well tolerated, did not change nt-probnp and lav at 12 weeks compared with placebo but was associated with improvements in quality of life in patients with hfpef. given the encouraging results on quality of life, the effects of vericiguat in patients with hfpef warrant further study, possibly with higher doses, longer follow-up and additional endpoints.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is an incurable, debilitating disease which impairs lung function and eventually leads to death. currently, there is a lack of effective modifying therapies and treatments for ipf as the underlying epidemiological mechanism is not clearly understood. this leads to difficulty in diagnosing and managing ipf, which results in a high incurment of disease-associated cost. even though ipf poses a substantial economic burden, there is a lack of research available on cost triggers and healthcare utilization, which can be a barrier to future economic evaluations of new medicines for ipf. we aimed to conduct a systematic literature review (slr) to identify the key cost-generating events of ipf and to gather any related costing information. the data showed that the main events triggering high resource use in patients were the symptoms of ipf progression along with comorbidities and lung transplantations. these events result in a high economic impact through the use of medications, health care professionals, and hospital stays. more research is needed to identify the direct, and indirect, relationships between ipf events and the costs they generate. this would help to further evaluate the area of need for future health technologies and to understand what events should be targeted to reduce the global economic burden of ipf.
crohn's_disease	introduction: conventional thiopurines are effective for the maintenance of remission of crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis, however, up to half of patients are intolerant or unresponsive to these medications. thioguanine is an alternative thiopurine that has shown efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease, and is particularly useful to circumvent certain side effects associated with conventional thiopurines, for example, pancreatitis. its association with nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver has hindered its widespread use.areas covered: we aim to outline the rational use of thioguanine, including safety monitoring, with particular regard to hepatotoxicity. a literature search was performed: pubmed was searched for full papers and abstracts published in english since january 2000 using the following terms, alone and in combination: azathioprine', thiopurine', crohn 's disease', inflammatory bowel disease', nodular regenerative hyperplasia', mercaptopurine', thioguanine', ulcerative colitis'. further relevant papers were identified from the reference lists of selected papers.expert commentary: despite optimisation strategies such as metabolite measurements and the use of allopurinol, a significant proportion of patients will remain intolerant to thiopurines, especially those with allergic reactions, including pancreatitis. for this subgroup of patients we suggest that low dose thioguanine is an alternative to other therapies that are either parenteral or expensive.
osteoporosis	after single or multilevel cervical corpectomy for the treatment of different diseases, many surgical options have been proposed over the years. as a single device, a winged expandable titanium cage (wetc) has been developed. we report the use of this device and our clinical results at 24 months of follow-up in a prospective series of 34 patients who underwent single or multilevel corpectomy for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. thirty-four consecutive patients underwent single or multilevel cervical corpectomy followed by the insertion of a wetc for the treatment of cervical spondylosis at department of neurology and psychiatry ""sapienza"" university of rome, italy, from may 2011 to may 2013. patients affected by cervical spondylosis with cervical lordosis >0 degrees were included. patients affected by cervical lordosis < 0 degrees, osteoporosis, or other cervical diseases were excluded. the mean postsurgical nurick 's grade was significantly lower than the mean presurgical nurick 's grade (mean = 0.98 for postsurgical nurick 's grade and mean = 2.42 for presurgical nurick 's grade). four patients (11.7 %) presented subsidence respectively of 1, 2, 2, and 3 mm at 24 months of radiological follow-up. postoperative complications occurred in five patients (14.7 %). our case series at 24 months of follow-up demonstrates that the use of a wetc obtains good clinical results after single or multiple corpectomy in patients not affected by osteoporosis who do not require cervical lordosis correction. during the insertion of the device, an adequate preparation of the end plates is suggested and their over distraction should be avoided.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: the idea that undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (uspa) represents the early undifferentiated stage of ankylosing spondylitis (as) and other well-defined spa subtypes is well known. the gist of this study is to assess the rate estimate of patients with uspa evolved to as during long-term follow-up. methods: a systematic search was implemented to identify pertinent articles. the primary outcome was the rate estimate that patients with uspa fulfilling the diagnosis of as according to the modified new york criteria during follow-up. the rate estimate and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% ci) were pooled by the random-effects model in stata 11.0 software. meta-regression analyses were adopted to explore the sources of heterogeneity. the quality assessment was conducted by the national institutes of health quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies and the begg test and the egger test were applied to assess publication bias. results: sixteen papers were finally included in this study after screening 1299 citations. the pooled rate of patients with uspa progression to as synthesized from the 16 papers was 0.323 (95% ci 0.257-0.389). subgroup analysis based on the length of follow-up showed that the rate at the time-point of 5, 8, and 10 years follow-up was 0.220 (95% ci 0.110-0.330), 0.291 (95% ci 0.257-0.325), and 0.399 (95% ci 0.190-0.608), respectively; while the rate in asia, europe, and latin america was 0.367 (95% ci 0.282-0.452), 0.228 (95% ci 0.066-0.390), and 0.269 (95% ci 0.209-0.329), respectively. meta-regression analysis indicated that the length of follow-up alone accounts for 45.23% of the total heterogeneity. nearly half of the papers scored fair quality and none publication bias was identified based on the begg test and the egger test. further, line chart describes an obviously increased trend for the patients with uspa fulfilling the diagnosis of as over time. conclusion: the progression rate of patients with uspa evolved into as was variable in different time-point, this variation can mostly be explained by the length of follow-up. thus, more studies with similar time point of follow-up are needed to clarify the full spectrum of uspa.
atrial_fibrillation	background: previous studies have suggested pitx2, kcnn3 and zfhx3 as atrial fibrillation (af) susceptibility genes. single common genetic polymorphisms of those genes have been linked with af phenotypes and rhythm outcome of af catheter ablation although their mechanisms remain elusive. new gene-based association tests may help clarifying genotype-phenotype correlations. therefore, we hypothesized that pitx2, kcnn3 and zfhx3 associate with left atrial enlargement and persistent af and subsequently with ablation outcome. methods and results: samples from 660 patients with paroxysmal (n = 370) or persistent af (n = 290) undergoing af catheter ablation were genotyped for similar to 1,000,000 snps. gene-based association was investigated using two different gene-based association tests (vegas, minsnp). among the three candidate genes, only zfhx3 associated with left atrial dilatation and af recurrence after catheter ablation. conclusion: this study suggests a contribution of zfhx3 to af remodeling and response to therapy. future and larger studies are necessary to replicate and apply these findings with an emphasis on designing af pathophysiology-based multi-locus risk scores.
psoriasis	micrornas (mirnas) are small non-coding rna molecules, which function in rna silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by the dysfunction of keratinocytes, with the immune dysregulation. we reviewed the recent studies on the roles of mirnas in psoriasis and showed that mirnas play key roles in psoriasis, including the regulation of hyperproliferation, cytokine and chemokine production in keratinocyte, as well as mediating immune dysfunction in psoriasis. furthermore, mirnas, particularly, circulating mirnas may serve as novel biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring therapy response and reflecting the disease severity. thus, targeting specific mirnas may be used to develop new therapeutic methods for psoriasis.
children's_health	objectiveto examine social and environmental factors that affect moderate to vigorous physical activity (mvpa) in mid-adolescent hispanic females. design and samplesecondary data analysis to examine social and environmental level factors related to mvpa levels in (n=897) mid-adolescent hispanic females. measuresdata were retrieved from the national survey of children 's health (2011/12). logistic regression was used to estimate associations for factors with mvpa. resultssignificant mid-adolescent predictors were english speaking, or 1.64 (95% ci, 1.03-2.61); parental attendance of activities, or 0.50 (95% ci, 0.31-0.81); peer support, or 2.74 (95% ci, 1.75-4.29); supportive neighborhood, or 1.52 (95% ci, 1.03-2.32); and safe school environment, or 1.67 (95% ci, 1.01-2.74). conclusionfindings highlight the need for the development of age and culturally appropriate interventions to aid the improvement of participation levels in mvpa among the latina adolescent population. additionally, findings suggest recommendations for policy and future research.
anxiety	vascular dementia (vad) is the second most common cause of dementia. it occurs when the cerebral blood supply is reduced by disarrangement of the circulatory system. environmental enrichment (ee) has been associated with cognitive improvement, motor function recovery, and anxiety relief with respect to various neurodegenerative diseases and emotional stress models. the purpose of this study was to determine whether long-term ee influenced cognitive impairment in a rat model of chronic hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (bccao). the y-maze and morris water maze tests were performed to evaluate the rats' cognitive functions. also, the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), phosphorylated camp-calcium response element binding protein (pcreb), and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) were confirmed by western blot. the microvessels and angiogenesis-associated proteins in the hippocampal region were investigated using immunohistochemistry. the vad + ee group showed significantly better cognitive functions than the vad group in both the y-maze and mwm tests. in addition, the vad + ee group showed significantly increased expression of bdnf, pcreb, and vegf in the hippocampus compared to the vad group. rats in the vad + ee group also had increased length of microvessels and vegf expression in the hippocampus. these results suggest that long-term ee exerts neuroprotective effects against cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion through the enhancement of bdnf, pcreb, and vegf expression and indicate that ee may be a good nursing intervention in vascular dementia patients.
hereditary_angioedema	the contact system is a plasma protease cascade initiated by factor xii (fxii) that activates the proinflammatory kallikrein-kinin system and the procoagulant intrinsic coagulation pathway. anionic surfaces induce fxii zymogen activation to form proteolytically active fxiia. bacterial surfaces also have the ability to activate contact system proteins, indicating an important role for host defense using the cooperation of the inflammatory and coagulation pathways. recent research has shown that inorganic polyphosphate found in platelets activates fxii in vivo and can induce coagulation in pathological thrombus formation. experimental studies have shown that interference with fxii provides thromboprotection without a therapy-associated increase in bleeding, renewing interest in the fxiia-driven intrinsic pathway of coagulation as a therapeutic target. this review summarizes how the contact system acts as the cross-road of inflammation, coagulation, and innate immunity.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a progressive disease of dysregulated wound healing leading to unremitting scarring and loss of lung function. the predominant symptoms are dyspnea on exertion and a persistent dry cough. for patients with ipf, cough is more than just bothersome; it has a significant negative impact on quality of life and is a marker of disease severity and progression. the etiology of cough in ipf is unclear but may be due to architectural distortion of the lungs, increased sensitivity of the cough reflex, airway inflammation, or changes in mucus production and clearance. there also may be an overlap between ipf cough and cough due to other common etiologies such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper airway cough syndrome, and medications. there are no approved therapies to specifically treat ipf cough, and recently approved medications for ipf have not been evaluated in cough. few clinical trials have focused on treatments for ipf cough. to date, there is only one randomized, placebo control therapeutic study for ipf cough with thalidomide, which significantly reduced ipf cough and improved quality of life. two additional cohort studies report that interferon-alpha and prednisolone also decrease ipf cough. however, no medication is approved to treat ipf cough. currently, the mainstay of therapy for ipf cough is standard cough suppressants, which have limited efficacy and often intolerable side effects. future studies are needed to determine an effective therapy to alleviate this particularly debilitating symptom and improve overall quality of life for patients suffering with ipf.

crohn's_disease	the surgical treatment of a long proximal ureteral stricture is a challenging situation for reconstructive surgeons. despite the underlying morbidities, ileal interposition and autotransplantation are the options available to treat complex cases of long segment ureteral stricture. buccal mucosa has shown excellent results in urethroplasty. however, its use in ureteral reconstruction is infrequent. we report on a 64-year-old female patient with multiple comorbidities and prior abdominal surgeries for crohn 's disease who underwent a successful total substitution of a long segment of the proximal ureter using buccal mucosa. regular postoperative isotope scans showed improvement in renal function. based on the pleasant outcome of this case and review of the literature, buccal mucosa might be a viable option with low morbidity in selected cases.
psoriasis	free radicals play important roles in the mechanisms underlying lichen planus (lp). uric acid (ua) is an important anti-oxidant in plasma. prolactin (prl) is an immunomodulatory hormone that may promote lp, as has been documented in other autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. prl has multiple immune-stimulatory effects and promotes the development of such autoimmune disorders. prolactin and uric acid may serve as biomarkers of disease activity in lichen planus. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the roles of depression, stress, and anxiety in lp, as well as serum levels of ua and prl as potential biomarkers of disease activity and compare these findings with those of the control group. thirty-nine patients clinically diagnosed with oral lp (study group) and 39 age-and sex-matched controls (control group) were selected in this study. serum ua and prl levels were measured. the depression anxiety stress scale-21 was used for psychometric evaluation of lp patients and controls. serum ua level was found to be significantly higher in the control group as well as during the remission phase of disease in the study. there was no significant difference in serum prl levels between cases and controls. depression and stress scores were higher in the study group.
atopic_dermatitis	purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare cutaneous surface parameters in lesional and non-lesional skin of psoriatic patients and in corresponding areas of control subjects. methods: sixty-six psoriatic patients (of any grade of severity, with or without arthritis, without any therapy other than systemic biologic drugs) and 28 healthy controls were enrolled in this observational, case control study. exclusion criteria were current or past sebo-psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, pustular or erithrodermic psoriasis; treatment with immune-suppressive agents, retinoids, or ultraviolet phototherapy in the last 6 months; topical treatment in the last 2 weeks. corneometry, sebumetry, and phmetry were evaluated on non-lesional skin of forehead, cheek, chin and volar region of forearm, and on a psoriatic plaque (on elbow or neighboring areas); in controls, the same areas were considered. results: corneometry values were significantly lower in psoriatic plaques vs. elbows of controls. sebumetry showed significantly higher values in non-lesional forearm skin and plaques of psoriatic patients vs. corresponding areas of controls. ph was significantly lower in all areas in psoriasis. no differences were found between patients treated or not with biologics and with or without arthritis. conclusion: evaluating surface skin parameters in psoriasis is useful to better understand the etiopathogenic mechanism and could suggest new therapeutic approaches.
atrial_fibrillation	background: radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has become an important therapy for af; however, recurrence rates remain high. we proposed to determine whether aggressive blood pressure (bp) lowering prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation (af) after catheter ablation in patients with af and a high symptom burden. methods: we randomly assigned 184 patients with af and a bp >130/80 mm hg to aggressive bp (target <120/80 mm hg) or standard bp (target30 seconds, determined 3 months beyond catheter ablation by a blinded end-point evaluation. results: the median follow-up was 14 months. at 6 months, the mean systolic bp was 123.2+/-13.2 mm hg in the aggressive bp treatment group versus 135.4+/-15.7 mm hg (p= 61 years of age had a lower primary outcome event rate with aggressive bp (hazard ratio=0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.97; p=0.013). there was a higher rate of hypotension requiring medication adjustment in the aggressive bp group (26% versus 0%). conclusions: in this study, this duration of aggressive bp treatment did not reduce atrial arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation for af but resulted in more hypotension.
psoriatic_arthritis	apremilast (ap) {systematic name: (s)-2-[1-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]-4-acetamidoisoindoline-1,3-dione} is an inhibitor of phosphodieasterase-4 (pde4) and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. the ability of ap to form solvates has been investigated and three solvatomorphs of ap, namely, the ap ethyl acetate hemisolvate, c22h24n2o7s center dot 0.5c(4)h(8)o(2), the ap toluene hemisolvate, c22h24n2-o7s center dot 0.5c(7)h(8), and the ap dichloromethane monosolvate, c22h24n2o7s center dot ch2cl2, were obtained. the three ap solvatomorphs were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. single-crystal x-ray diffraction was used to analyze the structures, crystal symmetry, packing modes, stoichiometry and hydrogen-bonding interactions of the solvatomorphs. in addition, dissolution analyses were performed to study the dissolution rates of different ap solvatomorph tablets in vitro and to make comparisons with commercial apremilast tablets (produced by celgene); all three solvatomorphs showed similar dissolution rates and similar values of the similarity factor f(2) in a comparison of their dissolution profiles.
atopic_dermatitis	introduction. the polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (pas) type hi is a rare condition defined as the coexistence of autoimmune thyroid disorder with other endocrine autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, without adrenal dysfunction. pas may associate with other non-endocrine autoimmune diseases, overlapping with the multiple autoimmune syndromes (mas). we present a case of pas iii/mas type 3, including autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune diabetes, vitiligo, lupus erythematosus, associated with adult-onset atopic dermatitis, a combination not reported previously. case report. a 40 years old woman, registered as nurse working in dialysis unit, previously diagnosed with vitiligo, euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis and disseminated granuloma annulare, with personal and familial history of atopic disorders, presented in our clinic for disseminated eczematous and lichenoid cutaneous rashes. she was tested positive for antinuclear, anti-double stranded dna and anti-histone antibodies, with inflammatory syndrome and marginal lymphopenia and she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). subsequently, moderate hyperglycemia, positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and low c-peptide level prompted the diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes. recurrent flexural eczematous rashes, with negative epicutaneous tests but positive specific ige tests for common allergens fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. the clinical, immunological and glycemic status were controlled with low doses of oral prednisone (<0.5 mg/kg), methotrexate (10mg/week), antimalarials, metformin, emollients and photoprotection. after changing her workplace, the immunosuppressive treatment could be discontinued, and the patient maintained normal immunological and biochemical profile at 6 months follow-up. this case brings a unique perspective on the evolution, associations spectrum and the management challenges of endocrine polyautoimmunity associated with atopic diathesis.
asthma	osthole, an active coumarin extracted from the dried fruits of cnidium monnieri (l) cusson, is known to possess a variety of pharmacological activities. in the present study, we investigated and illuminated the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of osthole in an experimental model of allergic asthma. our results show that osthole treatment significantly reduced the ova-induced increase in serum ige and inflammatory cytokines (il-4, il-5, il-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), and decreased the recruitment of inflammatory cells in balf and the lung. it also effectively attenuated goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus overproduction in lung tissue. in addition, western blot analysis demonstrated that osthole blocked nf-kappa b activation, which may be associated with a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production. these data suggest that osthole attenuated ova-induced allergic asthma inflammation by inhibiting nf-kappa b activation. the present study identified the molecular mechanisms of action of osthole, which support the potential pharmaceutical application of osthole treatment for asthma and other airway inflammation disorders.

medicare	background-there is a paucity of data on heart failure (hf) incidence among low-income and minority populations. our objective was to investigate hf incidence and post-hf survival by race and sex among low-income adults in the southeastern united states. methods and results-participants were 27 078 white and black men and women enrolled during 2002 to 2009 in the sccs (southern community cohort study) who had no history of hf and were receiving centers for medicare and medicaid services. incident hf diagnoses through december 31, 2010 were ascertained using international classification of diseases 9th revision codes 428. x via linkage with centers for medicare and medicaid services research files. most participants were black (68.8%), women (62.6%), and earned <$ 15 000/ y (69.7%); mean age was 55.5 (10.4) years. risk factors for hf were common: hypertension (62.5%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), myocardial infarction (8.6%), and obesity (44.8%). over a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 4341 participants were diagnosed with hf. the age-standardized incidence rates were 34.8, 37.3, 34.9, and 35.6 / 1000 person-years in white women, white men, black men, and black women, respectively, remarkably higher than previously reported. among hf cases, 952 deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 2.3 years. men had lower survival; hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.63 (1.27-2.08), 1.38 (1.11-1.72), and 0.90 (0.73-1.12) for white men, black men, and black women compared with white women. conclusions-in this low-income population, hf incidence was higher for all race-sex groups than previously reported in other cohorts. the sccs is a unique resource to investigate determinants of hf risk in a segment of the population underrepresented in other existing cohorts.
atopic_dermatitis	background. allergic contact dermatitis is known to occur in children with and without atopic dermatitis, but more data are needed on contact sensitization profiles in these two groups. objectives. to identify frequent allergens in children with and without atopic dermatitis suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis. methods. a retrospective analysis of children aged 0-17 years patch tested between 1996 and 2013 was performed. results. of all 1012 children tested because of suspected contact dermatitis, 46% developed one or more positive reactions, the proportions for children with (n= 526) and without (n= 395) atopic dermatitis being 48% and 47%, respectively. children with atopic dermatitis reacted more often to lanolin alcohol (30% pet., p= 0.030), amerchol l-101 (p= 0.030), and fragrances [ fragrance mix i (p= 0.048) and myroxylon pereirae (p= 0.005)]. allergens outside the european baseline series that frequently gave positive reactions in these groups included cocamidopropyl betaine and amerchol l-101. reactivity to these allergens was significantly more common in atopic dermatitis children. conclusion. sensitization prevalences in children with and without atopic dermatitis were similar, but children with atopic dermatitis reacted significantly more often to lanolin alcohol and fragrances. testing with additional series besides the european baseline series may be necessary, as reactions to, for example, cocamidopropyl betaine and amerchol l-101 may otherwise be missed.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( tgf-beta 1) and gene variants have been extensively studied in various human diseases. for example, tgf-beta 1 polymorphisms were associated with fibrosis and pneumoconiosis, but the data remained controversial. the aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the association between tgf-beta 1-509 c>t[ rs1800469], + 869 t>c [rs1800470], and + 915 g>c [rs1800471] polymorphisms and pneumoconiosis. methods: a comprehensive literature search was conducted through searching in pubmed, embase, the chinese biomedical database, and the wei pu ( chinese) database by the end of april 2016. eleven publications with 21 studies were included in this meta-analysis, covering a total of 4333 patients with pneumoconiosis and 3478 controls. study quality was assessed, and heterogeneity and publication bias were measured. all statistical analyses were performed using stata version 12.0 (statacorp, college station, tx, usa) software. results: the data showed significant associations between tgf-beta 1 -509 c>t polymorphism and the risk of pneumoconiosis development (t vs. c, odds ratio [or] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.00-1.81, p = 0.046); between tgf-beta 1 + 915 g>c polymorphism and the pneumoconiosis risk (c vs. g, or = 1.69, 95% ci: 1.19-2.40, p = 0.004; cg vs. gg, or = 1.79, 95% ci: 1.23-2.60, p = 0.002; cc+ cg vs. gg, or = 1.80, 95% ci: 1.24-2.61, p = 0.002). in addition, the subgroup analysis of ethnicity versus pneumoconiosis types indicated a significant association of silicosis among asian populations but not that of coal workers' pneumoconiosis in caucasian populations. in contrast, no significant association was exhibited between tgf-beta 1 + 869 t>c polymorphism and risk of pneumoconiosis. conclusion: the polymorphisms of both tgf-beta 1 -509 c>t and + 915 g>c are associated with increased risk of pneumoconiosis. >
osteoarthritis	the use of animals in research is under increasing scrutiny from the general public, funding agencies, and regulatory authorities. our ability to continue to perform in-vivo studies in laboratory animals will be critically determined by how researchers respond to this new reality. this perspectives article summarizes recent and ongoing initiatives within ors and allied organizations to ensure that musculoskeletal research is performed to the highest ethical standards. it goes on to present an overview of the practical application of the 3rs (reduction, refinement, and replacement) into experimental design and execution, and discusses recent guidance with regard to improvements in the way in which animal data are reported in publications. the overarching goal of this review is to challenge the status quo, to highlight the absolute interdependence between animal welfare and rigorous science, and to provide practical recommendations and resources to allow clinicians and scientists to optimize the ways in which they undertake preclinical studies involving animals.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	myofibroblasts, the primary effector cells that mediate matrix remodeling during pulmonary fibrosis, rapidly assemble an extracellular fibronectin matrix. tensin (tns) 1 is a key component of specialized cellular adhesions (fibrillar adhesions) that bind to extracellular fibronectin fibrils. we hypothesized that tns1 may play a role in modulating myofibroblast-mediated matrix formation. we found that tns1 expression is increased in fibroblastic foci from lungs with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta profoundly up-regulates tns1 expression with kinetics that parallel the expression of the myofibroblast marker, smooth muscle a-actin. tgf-beta-induced tns1 expression is dependent on signaling through the tgf-beta receptor 1 and is rho coiled-coiled kinase/actin/megakaryoblastic leukemia-1/serum response factor dependent. small interfering rna-mediated knockdown of tns1 disrupted tgf-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation, without affecting tgf-beta/smad signaling. in contrast, loss of tns1 resulted in disruption of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, focal adhesion formation, and actin stress fiber development. finally, tns1 was essential for the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the assembly of nascent fibronectin and collagen matrix in myofibroblasts. in summary, our data show that tns1 is a novel megakaryoblastic leukemia1- dependent gene that is induced during pulmonary fibrosis. tns1 plays an essential role in tgf-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation and myofibroblast-mediated formation of extracellular fibronectin and collagen matrix. targeted disruption of tns1 and associated signaling may provide an avenue to inhibit tissue fibrosis.
atopic_dermatitis	background. information concerning health-related quality of life (hrqol) and comorbidities of adult dermatitis patients stratified by loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (flg) is limited. objective. to investigate hrqol, skin symptoms and comorbidities in adult flg mutation carriers. methods. this cross-sectional study included patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and/or hand eczema (n= 520). patients completed questionnaires about dermatitis, skin symptoms, hrqol, and comorbidities, including actinic keratosis, and atopic and mental disorders. results. flg mutations (r501x, 2282del4, and r2447x) were identified in 16.9% of patients, and were significantly associated not only with atopic dermatitis, but also independently with skin fissures on the fingers and heels, and self-reported actinic keratosis. although flg mutations were significantly associated with reducedhrqol, as measured by use of the dermatology life quality index (dlqi), no association with self-reported anxiety or depression was identified. notably, the highest median dlqi score, reflecting greater impairment, was reported by patients with both flg mutations and atopic dermatitis. overall, 19.7% of patients with both atopic dermatitis and flg mutations reported a 'large or extremely large' impact on their lives; this represents twice the prevalence seen in patients with atopic dermatitis and wild-type flg (9.6%). conclusion. patients with both atopic dermatitis and common flg mutations are more frequently affected by reduced hrqol.
stress_management	aimsto present a methodological exemplar of integrating findings from a quantitative and qualitative review on the same topic to provide insight into components of care that contribute to supportive care that is acceptable to men with prostate cancer. backgroundmen with prostate cancer are likely to live a long time with the disease, experience side effects from treatment and therefore have ongoing supportive care needs. quantitative and qualitative reviews have been published but the findings have yet to be integrated. designintegration of quantitative and qualitative synthesized evidence. data sourcetwo previously published systematic reviews. review methodssynthesized evidence on supportive care for men with prostate cancer was integrated from two previously published systematic reviews: a narrative quantitative review and a qualitative review with thematic synthesis. these two streams of synthesized evidence were synthesized using concurrent narrative summary. data from both reviews were used to develop a set of propositions from which a summary of components of care that likely to contribute to supportive care acceptable to men with prostate cancer were identified. resultsnine propositions were developed which covered men 's supportive care focusing on the role of health professionals. these propositions were used to compose nine components of care likely to lead to supportive care that is acceptable to men with prostate cancer. some of these components are no/low cost such as developing a more empathic personalized approach, but more specific approaches need further investigation in randomized controlled trials, for example, online support. conclusionthis methodological exemplar demonstrates the integration of quantitative and qualitative synthesized data to determine components of care likely to lead to provision of supportive care acceptable to men with prostate cancer.
asthma	helminthiasis may ameliorate inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and asthma. information about immunomodulators from ascaris lumbricoides is scarce, but could be important considering the co-evolutionary relationships between helminths and humans. we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of a recombinant cystatin from a. lumbricoides on an acute model of dextran sodium sulphate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. from an a. lumbricoides cdna library, we obtained a recombinant cystatin (ral-cpi). protease activity inhibition was demonstrated on cathepsin b and papain. immunomodulatory effects were evaluated at two intraperitoneal doses (0.5 and 0.25 mu g/g) on mice with dss-induced colitis. body weight, colon length, disease activity index (dai), histological inflammation score, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, gene expression of cytokines and cytokines levels in colon tissue were analysed. treatment with ral-cpi significantly reduced dai, mpo activity and inflammation score without toxic effects. also, il-10 and tgf-b gene overexpression was observed in ral-cpi-treated group compared to dss-exposed control and healthy mice. furthermore, a reduction in il-6 and tnf-a expression was found, and this was confirmed by the levels of these cytokines in colonic tissue. in conclusion, ral-cpi reduces inflammation in a mouse model of dss-induced colitis, probably by increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and reducing pro-inflammatory ones.
osteoporosis	background: the accurate and reliable measurement of foot bone density is challenging and there is currently no gold standard technique. such measurement is particularly valuable in populations at risk of foot bone pathology such as in those with long term diabetes. with research and development, computed tomography may prove to be a useful tool for this assessment. the aim of this study was to establish the reliability of a novel method of foot bone density measurement in people with diabetes using computed tomography. methods: ten feet in people with diabetes were scanned with computed tomography twice with repositioning. bone density (in hounsfield units) was assessed in the trabecular and cortical bone in all tarsals and metatarsals. reliability was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (95% confidence intervals), limits of agreement and standard error of measurement. results: the reliability of the trabecular density of most bones was excellent with intra-class correlation coefficients ranging from 0.68 to 0.91. additionally, cortical bone density showed fair to good reliability at the talus (0.52), calcaneus (0.59), navicular (0.70), cuboid (0.69), intermediate cuneiform (0.46) and first metatarsal (0.61). conclusions: the study established the reliability of a practical method of assessing the trabecular and cortical foot bone density using computed tomography scanning. this methodology may be useful in the investigation of foot bone disease occurring in diabetes and its early diagnosis, intervention and assessment of treatment efficacy. further development of this method is warranted.
ankylosing_spondylitis	introduction: to date, there are no descriptions in the literature on gynecologic and sexual function evaluation in female patients with dermatomyositis (dm) and polymyositis (pm). objective: to assess sexual function in female patients with dm/pm. patients and methods: this is a monocentric, cross-sectional study in which 23 patients (16 dm and 7 pm), with ages between 18 and 40 years, were compared to 23 healthy women of the same age group. characteristics on sexual function were obtained by applying the questionnaires female sexual quotient (fsq) and female sexual function index (fsfi) validated for the brazilian portuguese language. results: the mean age of patients was comparable to controls (32.7 +/- 5.3 vs. 31.7 +/- 6.7 years), as well as the distribution of ethnicity and socioeconomic class. as for gynecological characteristics, patients and healthy controls did not differ with respect to age at menarche and percentages of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, premenstrual syndrome, pain at mid-cycle, mucocervical secretion, and vaginal discharge. the fsq score, as well as all domains of the fsfi questionnaire (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm and satisfaction), were significantly decreased in patients versus controls, with 60.9% of patients showing some degree of sexual dysfunction. conclusions: this was the first study to identify sexual dysfunction in patients with dm/pm. therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is essential for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, in order to provide prevention and care for their sexual life, providing a better quality of life, both for patients and their partners.

medicare	objectiveto examine the relative influence of hospital and skilled nursing facilities (snfs) on 30-day rehospitalization. data sources/settingselderly medicare beneficiaries newly admitted to a snf following hospitalization. study designwe ranked hospitals and snfs into quartiles based on previous years' adjusted rehospitalization rates (arrs) and examined how rehospitalizations from a given hospital vary depending upon the admitting snf arr quartile. we examined whether the availability of snfs with low rehospitalization rates influenced hospitals' snf readmission rates and whether changes in a hospital 's arr over 3years is associated with changes in the snfs to which they discharge. principal findingshospital readmission rates from snfs varied 5 percentage points between patients discharged to snfs in the lowest and the highest rehospitalization quartiles. low rehospitalization rate hospitals sent a larger fraction of their patients to the lowest rehospitalization snfs available in the area. a 10 percent increase in hospital 's share of discharges to the lowest rehospitalization quartile snfs is associated with a 1 percentage point reduction in hospital 's arr. conclusionsthe snf rehospitalization rate has greater influence on patients' risk of rehospitalization than the discharging hospital. identifying high-performing snfs may be a powerful strategy for hospitals to reduce rehospitalizations.
atrial_fibrillation	introduction: the impact of atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) value for predicting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (paf) in ischemic stroke patients remains uncertain. methods: the consecutive 222 ischemic stroke patients (median 77 [iqr 68-83] years old, 93 females) within 48 hours after onset were retrospectively studied. plasma anp and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) levels were simultaneously measured at admission. of all, 158 patients had no evidence of atrial fibrillation (af) (sinus rhythm [sr] group), 25 patients had paf (paf group), and the other 39 patients had chronic af (caf group). we investigated predicting factors for paf, with focus on anp, bnp, and anp/bnp ratio. results: anp value was significantly higher in the paf than in the sr group (97 [50-157] mg/dl versus 42 [26-72] mg/dl, p < .05) and further increased in the caf group (228 [120-392], p < .05 versus paf and sr groups). similarly, the bnp value was higher in the paf than in the sr group (116 [70-238] mg/dl versus 34 [14-72] mg/dl, p <.05) and further increased in the caf group (269 [199-423], p < .05 versus paf and sr groups). anp/ bnp ratio was lower in the paf and caf groups than in the sr group (. 6 [. 51.2] and.7 [.5-1.0] versus 1.3 [. 8-2.4], both p < .05]. multivariate analysis in the sr and paf groups (n = 183) demonstrated that age, congestive heart failure, anp, and bnp, but not anp/bnp ratio, were independent predictors for detecting paf. receiver operating characteristic curve analysis further showed that area under the curve was similar between anp and bnp (. 76 and .80). conclusions: anp may be clinically useful for detecting paf in ischemic stroke patients as well as bnp.

healthy_sleep	objective: we examine concurrent and longitudinal associations between sleep duration (sd) and body mass index (bmi) from adolescence to young adulthood, controlling for physical activity and internalising symptoms. sex and age group differences (early adolescent group ages 12-15years and late adolescent group ages 16-18years) are examined.design: a randomly selected community-based sample of youth (n=662; 48.3% males) were surveyed biannually from 2003 (t1) to 2014 (t6).results: we found sex and age group differences for the concurrent and longitudinal associations between sd and bmi. for males, shorter sd at baseline was concurrently related to higher bmi. for females, shorter sd at baseline was associated with longitudinal increases in bmi, for the late adolescent group only.conclusion: findings show that the association between sd and bmi, previously shown in childhood, continues to be significant in adolescence and young adulthood. developmentally appropriate and sex-specific strategies for motivating and supporting healthy sleep habits in adolescence that may help to prevent weight gain into young adulthood are discussed.
migraine	backgroundcraniocervical dystonia is a focal or segmental dystonia in its distribution, classically known as spasmodic torticollis when in its pure cervical presentation. although craniocervical dystonia has been recognized as a possible cause of headache since the publication of the second version of international classification of headache disorders, there are few studies about this entity. methodthis was a narrative review. resultscraniocervical dystonia was associated with muscle pain in 67-89% of the cases. headaches of any kind affected approximately 60% of patients with craniocervical dystonia, and were located mainly in the occipital and cervical regions. headache attributed to craniocervical dystonia specifically was rarely found, and it was described in only one patient out of 80 in one study. treatment with botulinum neurotoxin is considered to be the first-line treatment for focal dystonias, including craniocervical dystonia, and besides reducing clinical severity, impairment, and pain scores among the patients with craniocervical dystonia, there were also descriptions of improvements in headaches attributed to craniocervical dystonia and other headaches associated with this dystonia. conclusionsheadache attributed to craniocervical dystonia has been poorly studied. there is a need for more studies to evaluate its characteristics and treatment.
stress_management	objective: programs that view individuals as capable of taking an active role in managing their illness have gained importance in europe and the united states. this article describes the implementation and evaluation of group psychoeducational and cognitive behavioral treatment programs at the department of psychiatry and psychotherapy, ludwig maximilian university, munich, germany, over the past 20 years. methods: implementing psychoeducational programs was the first step to establish cognitive behavioral psychotherapy and dispel the myth of schizophrenia for patients. programs are also provided for patients with mood disorders, substance use disorders, or both. these groups include topics such as psychoeducation about the illness, establishing rewarding activities, stress management, cognitive therapy, and relapse prevention. results: more than 1000 patients with schizophrenia or mood disorders (380 schizophrenia, 563 major depression, and 110 bipolar) have participated in illness management groups to learn about their illness and its treatment, and to learn skills to manage their illness. patients have expressed satisfaction with the programs, and research has supported their effectiveness. conclusions: individuals with severe disorders can benefit from psychoeducational and cognitive treatment programs if the programs are adapted to the level of neuropsychological functioning and compensate for cognitive deficits and emotional overload. these findings suggest that providing information about the illness and coping skills for patients and relatives are important for treatment outcome.
atrial_fibrillation	aims: to test the safety of new buprenorphine oral lyophilisate wafer (""bup-lyo"") versus standard sub-lingual buprenorphine (""bup-sl""). design: randomised (2: 1) openlabel study; opioid-dependent subjects; subsequent partial cross-over. settings: specialised clinical trials facility and addictions treatment facility. participants: opioid-dependent subjects (n = 36) commencing buprenorphine maintenance (personalised dose-titration) including patients cousing alcohol, cocaine and benzodiazepines (below thresholds). measurements: respiratory function (respiratory rate, pulse-oximetry); medication hold and dose adequacy; opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms; tablet disintegration times; treatment retention. pharmacokinetics (pk) for plasma buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine (n = 11). findings: oral lyophilised buprenorphine (""bup-lyo"") completely dissolved within 2 min for 58 vs. 5% for ""bup-sl."" dose titration resulted in similar maintenance dosing (10.8 vs. 9.6 mg). there were no significant between-group differences in opiate-withdrawal phenomena, craving, adequacy of ""hold,"" respiratory function. no serious adverse events (aes), nor ""severe"" aes, although more aes and treatment-emergent aes with ""bup-lyo"" (mostly ""mild""). pk found greater bioavailability of buprenorphine with ""bup-lyo"" (but not norbuprenorphine). conclusions: orally disintegrating buprenorphine oral lyophilisate wafer disintegrated rapidly. no increased respiratory depression was found and clinically no difference between medications was observed. pk found substantially increased bioavailability of buprenorphine (but not of nor-buprenorphine) with ""buplyo"" relative to ""bup-sl."" in supervised dosing contexts, rapidly disintegrating formulations may enable wider buprenorphine prescribing.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background and objective: acute respiratory failure (arf) in patients with interstitial lung disease (ild) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. recommended assessment for acute exacerbation (ae) of ild includes exclusion of secondary causes via fibreoptic bronchoscopy. our aim is to assess the role of bronchoscopy during arf-ild. methods: consecutive ild patients (2002-2014) hospitalized with arf who underwent bronchoscopy were included. baseline demographics, underlying ild diagnoses and presenting clinical features were reviewed. characteristics of bronchoscopy including diagnostic findings, management and complications were collated. results: one hundred and six patients accounted for 119 unique bronchoscopies. sixteen (13%) were abnormal (12 infections and 4 haemorrhages). baseline presenting clinical features did not differ between those with and without abnormal findings. about half were performed in an intensive care unit (icu) (53%), with 25% of bronchoscopies performed in a general floor setting resulting in icu transfer; 71% of whom resulted in immediate mechanical ventilation. overall management of arf in those with positive bronchoscopy findings was similar to those without, resulting in similar in-hospital mortality. conclusion: bronchoscopy in the clinical assessment of arf-ild is often performed with only a 13% yield in this large retrospective cohort. as management and inhospital mortality were similar, routine diagnostic bronchoscopy in arf-ild should be further studied given its low yield and high procedural risk.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	fibrosis after solid organ transplantation is considered an irreversible process and remains the major cause of graft dysfunction and death with limited therapies. this remodeling is characterized by aberrant accumulation of contractile myofibroblasts that deposit excessive extracellular matrix (ecm) and increase tissue stiffness. studies demonstrate, however, that a stiff ecm itself promotes fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, stimulating further ecm production. this creates a positive feedback loop that perpetuates fibrosis. we hypothesized that simultaneously targeting myofibroblast contractility with relaxin and ecm stiffness with lysyl oxidase inhibitors could break the feedback loop, reversing established fibrosis. to test this, we used the orthotopic tracheal transplantation (ott) mouse model, which develops robust fibrotic airway remodeling. mice with established fibrosis were treated with saline, mono-, or combination therapies. although monotherapies had no effect, combining these agents decreased collagen deposition and promoted re-epithelialization of remodeled airways. relaxin inhibited myofibroblast differentiation and contraction in a matrix-stiffness-dependent manner through prostaglandin e-2 (pge(2)). furthermore, the effect of combination therapy was lost in pge(2) receptor knockout and pge(2)-inhibited ott mice. this study revealed the important synergistic roles of cellular contractility and tissue stiffness in the maintenance of fibrotic tissue and suggests a new therapeutic principle for fibrosis. in an orthotopic tracheal transplant mouse model, targeting two components of the biophysical microenvironmentnamely, myofibroblast contractility and extracellular matrix stiffnesscan break the autocrine-fibrogenic positive feedback loop to facilitate self-repair and attenuate airway fibrosis.
crohn's_disease	inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has a significant negative impact on quality of life (qol); however, the direct impact of ibd on several aspects of patients' lives is unknown. the impact survey was conducted in europe in 2010-2011 to determine this impact. we conducted the impact survey in japan and compared the results between subgroups of patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn 's disease (cd). the 52-item impact survey questionnaire assessing treatment and the impact of ibd on patients' lives was translated into japanese and administered to ibd patients recruited through patient advocacy groups. between june 2013 and january 2014, 172 japanese ibd patients completed the questionnaire (including 84 uc and 83 cd patients). half of all patients (84/172, 48.8 %) were satisfied with their treatment plan, and half of those who had undergone surgery were satisfied with the outcome (46/87, 52.9 %). although 34.9 % (60/172) of patients had not been hospitalized in 5 years, 50.0 % (86/172) had been hospitalized for more than 10 days. during the most recent flare, 49.4 % (85/172) of patients had to reschedule appointments because of ibd. moreover, 32.0 % (55/172) of patients had to make adjustments such as working part-time or at home to avoid taking sick days; 35.5 % (61/172) of patients felt that they had lost a job because of ibd. our survey results indicate that ibd patients' lives and social activities are affected by the deterioration of qol due to ibd and its symptoms.
children's_health	backgroundwhile research has investigated negative stereotyping of fat body shapes, little has focused on young children 's understanding of the mechanisms, motivations and consequences of weight change. objectivesto investigate children 's understanding of how weight change is achieved, people 's motivation for weight change, and the consequences of weight loss or weight gain. methodsone hundred children (mean age 5.2, 38 girls) read a book in which one of the main characters (male/female according to the child 's sex) was either healthy weight or overweight. afterwards, this character was described as gaining or losing weight, and drawings which depicted the child in the story as either healthy weight or overweight were presented to the child and discussed. an audio-recorded semi-structured interview followed and transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. resultsnearly all children described the weight/shape change and attributed this to food more frequently than exercise. weight loss was viewed positively and both motivations and consequences grouped under two master themes (physical and social reasons). no clear gender differences were observed in these responses. conclusionstalking with 5-year-olds showed them to be observant and knowledgeable, especially about motivations for and consequences of weight change. for those working to improve children 's health literacy, this suggests receptiveness to early and fact-based education.
osteoarthritis	purpose based on previous investigations on the vascular blood supply to the femoral head, a technique for anatomical reduction after slipped capital femoral epiphysis was developed. this technique is a modification of the original technique by dunn using a retinacular soft-tissue flap. this allows the visual control of the epiphyseal vascular blood supply. we report the experience at the inventor 's institution with a critical discussion of the available literature. methods using a trochanteric osteotomy for surgical dislocation of the hip, a retinacular soft tissue flap is created containing the deep branch of the medial femoral circumflex artery, the external rotators and the capsule. the femoral epiphysis can be mobilised safely and reduced on the femoral neck after resection of the almost constantly present reactive metaphyseal callus. results in our institution, the rate of avascular necrosis with 2% is comparably low to dunn 's original results. it is only present in cases where no bleeding was already evident before reduction of the epiphysis. the ten-year long-term results are favorable in these cases with a good functional result and only little progression of osteoarthritis. however, other authors have reported higher rates of avascular necrosis up to 24% in their initial experience. conclusions in experienced hands using the correct meticulous surgical technique, the results are favorable regarding the rates of avascular necrosis, the functional outcome and the development of radiographic osteoarthritis-even in acute and severe cases. avascular necrosis is rare but can be observed if there is no evidence of intra-operative femoral head perfusion before and after reduction of the epiphysis.
osteoarthritis	background: developmental dysplasia of the hip (ddh) is a common pathological condition of the musculoskeletal system in infants which results in a congenital and developmental malformation of the hip joint. ddh is a spectrum of pathologies affecting the infant hip ranging from asymptomatic subtle radiographic signs through mild instability to frank dislocations with acetabular dysplasia. a saudi family with three affected individuals with ddh was identified and genetic analysis was performed to detect the possible genetic defect(s) underlying ddh in the affected members of the family. methods: we performed whole genome genotyping using illumina humanomni 2.5 m array and whole exome sequencing (wes) using nextera rapid capture kit and illumina nextseq500 instrument in four individuals of a family with ddh. results: snp data analysis did not identify any runs of homozygosity and copy number variations. identity-by-descent (ibd) analysis on whole genome genotyping data identified a shared haplotypes on chromosome 1 in affected individuals. an analysis of the wes data identified rare heterozygous variants in hspg2 and atp2b4 genes in the affected individuals. multiple prediction software predicted that the variants identified are damaging. moreover, in silico analysis showed that hspg2 regulates atp2b4 expression using a variety of transcription factors. conclusion: our results indicate that there might be a functional epistatic interaction between hspg2 and atp2b4, and ddh in the family studied is due to a combined effect of both variants. these variants are also present in the asymptomatic mother suggesting that the variants in hspg2 and atp2b4 are incompletely penetrant. this study provides the first evidence of digenic inheritance of ddh in a family and extends the spectrum of genetic heterogeneity in this human disorder.
anxiety	objective: to identify predictors of delayed recovery in children who sustained a concussion and sought care in a pediatric hospital. design: retrospective cohort study design. setting: montreal children 's hospital concussion clinic database. patients: children who sustained a concussion and sought care within 10 days of the injury, with complete medical history and postconcussion symptom scale (pcss) score available. independent variables: total symptom score on the pcss, sex, age, history of concussion, sleep disturbances, anxiety, learning disabilities, attention problems, and depression. main outcome measure: delayed recovery (28 days or more). results: a total of 213 children (f = 76, m = 138) with a mean age of 13.89 +/- 2.55 years were included. only total pcss score at 10 days postinjury was identified as a significant predictor of delayed recovery (odds ratio: 1.019, p = 0.01). conclusions: this study demonstrates the potential for clinicians to identify, with the sole use of the pcss, children at risk of experiencing symptoms for longer periods of time.
addiction	lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. tobacco use remains the single most important preventable cause of cancer and is responsible for 80% of all cases of lung cancer. implementation of tobacco control measures, including preventing initiation and treating dependence, are pivotal to address the lung cancer epidemic. new evidence continues to emerge on the significant positive impact of incorporating tobacco dependence treatment within all lung cancer treatment protocols. evidence and guidelines on how to implement these strategies exist and present an opportunity for nurses to make a difference in reducing suffering and preventing deaths from lung cancer.
anxiety	play has been proposed as an indicator of positive emotions and welfare in higher vertebrates. this study investigated playfulness in male rats by exploring its consistency across motivational states (with/without prior short social isolation) and two age points at early and late adolescence. twenty-four male lister hooded rats housed in cages of four underwent two play tests: conspecific play-in-pairs and tickling by the experimenter, which were compared with play in the home cage and basal anxiety levels. play-in-pairs measures were consistent across age and motivational states, and were independent from anxiety. positively valenced vocalizations in the tickling test were also consistent across age, yet were negatively related to anxiety. play-in-pairs and tickling play contexts, as well as social and solitary play types, were unrelated. therefore, this study supports the existence of consistent individual differences in playfulness in rats, and suggests that different play contexts and types represent motivationally distinct systems.
crohn's_disease	background: exclusive enteral nutrition (een) therapy using a polymeric formula (pf) can substantially attenuate intestinal inflammation in crohn 's disease (cd) patients. however, the mechanism(s) by which een suppresses inflammation are not yet fully understood. the aims were to examine cellular mechanism(s) through which een may suppress inflammation and investigate potential pathways to enhance anti-inflammatory properties of een. methods: glutamine, arginine, vitamin d-3, and linolenic acid (ala), present in pf, along with curcumin, were identified as immunoactive nutrient therapies. tumor necrosis factor (tnf)--exposed ht-29 colonic epithelial cells were used to investigate the immunosuppressive activity of the nutrients by assessing their effect on cell viability, cell activity, chemokine response (interleukin-8 [il-8]), nuclear factor (nf)-b, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, ib kinase (i), and nitric oxide (no). results: cellular viability and activity were maintained with all nutrient treatments. glutamine, arginine, and vitamin d-3, but not ala, significantly attenuated il-8 production. glutamine and arginine led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling components in nf-b and p38 pathways, reduction in kinase activity, and enhancement in no production. combining glutamine, arginine, and curcumin at optimal concentrations completely abolished the il-8 response. conclusions: these data indicate that glutamine, arginine, and vitamin d-3 can suppress inflammation at concentrations equivalent to those used in pf. the mechanisms of this action were mediated through influencing the nf-b and p38 cascades. glutamine and arginine-fortified pf with curcumin might be a promising option to enhance the effectiveness and expand the scope of een therapy in cd treatment.
anxiety	background: data on psychological harm in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (men2) are scarce. objectives: the aim of this study was to assess anxiety, depression, quality of life, and coping in long-standing men2 patients. patients and methods: patients were 43 adults (age >= 18 years) with clinical and genetic diagnosis of men2 and long-term follow-up (10.6 +/- 8.2 years; range 1-33 years). this was a cross-sectional study with qualitative and quantitative psychological assessment using semi-directed interviews and hads, eortc qlq c30, and mini-mac scales. adopting clinical criteria from 2015 ata guidelines on men2, biochemical cure (39%; 16/41), persistence/recurrence (61%; 25/41), and stable chronic disease (22/41) of medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc) were scored. pheochromocytoma affected 19 (44%) patients, with previous adrenalectomy in 17 of them. results: overall, anxiety (42%; mean score 11 +/- 2.9; range 8-18; anxiety is defined as a score >= 8) and depression (26%; mean score 11 +/- 3.8; range 8-20; depression is defined as a score >= 8) symptoms were frequent. patients who transmitted ret mutations to a child had higher scores for weakness-discouragement/anxious preoccupation and lower scores for cognitive, emotional, and physical functioning (p < 0.05). feelings of guilt were present in 35% of patients with mutation-positive children. lower mean score values for depression and anxiety and higher scores for role, cognitive, and emotional functioning were noticed in 33 patients who were well-informed about their disease (p < 0.05). fighting spirit was more frequently found in patients with multiple surgical procedures (p = 0.019) and controlled chronic adrenal insufficiency (p = 0.024). patients with men2-elated stress-inducing factors had lower scores for fighting spirit and cognitive functioning and higher scores for insomnia and dyspnea (p < 0.05). eleven patients required sustained psychotherapeutic treatment. mean global health status was relatively good in men2 cases (68.1 +/- 22.3), and the cured group had higher physical functioning (p = 0.021). conclusions: psychological distress is likely chronic in men2 patients. this study identified diverse men2-related factors (degree of information on disease, mutation-positive children, number of surgeries, comorbidities, stress-inducing factors, and cure) interfering positively or negatively with the results of the psychometrics scales. the active investigation of these factors and the applied psychological assessment protocol are useful to identify men2 patients requiring psychological assistance.
migraine	objective: the objective of this article is to obtain detailed quantitative assessment of cerebellar function and structure in unselected migraine patients and controls from the general population. methods: a total of 282 clinically well-defined participants (migraine with aura n = 111; migraine without aura n = 89; non-migraine controls n = 82; age range 43-72; 72% female) from a population-based study were subjected to a range of sensitive and validated cerebellar tests that cover functions of all main parts of the cerebellar cortex, including cere-brocerebellum, spinocerebellum, and vestibulocerebellum. in addition, all participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the brain to screen for cerebellar lesions. as a positive control, the same cerebellar tests were conducted in 13 patients with familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (fhm1; age range 19-64; 69% female) all carrying a cacna1a mutation known to affect cerebellar function. results: mri revealed cerebellar ischemic lesions in 17/196 (8.5%) migraine patients and 3/79 (4%) controls, which were always located in the posterior lobe except for one control. with regard to the cerebellar tests, there were no differences between migraine patients with aura, migraine patients without aura, and controls for the: (i) purdue-peg-board test for fine motor skills (assembly scores p = 0.1); (ii) block-design test for visuospatial ability (mean scaled scores p = 0.2); (iii) prism-adaptation task for limb learning (shift scores p = 0.8); (iv) eyeblink-conditioning task for learning-dependent timing (peak-time p = 0.1); and (v) body-sway test for balance capabilities (pitch velocity score under two-legs stance condition p = 0.5). among migraine patients, those with cerebellar ischaemic lesions performed worse than those without lesions on the assembly scores of the pegboard task (p<0.005), but not on the primary outcome measures of the other tasks. compared with controls and non-hemiplegic migraine patients, fhm1 patients showed substantially more deficits on all primary outcomes, including purdue-peg assembly (p<0.05), block-design scaled score (p<0.001), shift in prism-adaptation (p<0.001), peak-time of conditioned eyeblink responses (p<0.05) and pitch-velocity score during stance-sway test (p<0.001). conclusions: unselected migraine patients from the general population show normal cerebellar functions despite having increased prevalence of ischaemic lesions in the cerebellar posterior lobe. except for an impaired pegboard test revealing deficits in fine motor skills, these lesions appear to have little functional impact. in contrast, all cerebellar functions were significantly impaired in participants with fhm1.
psoriasis	objective: to determine how and under which conditions psoriasis is related to the psychological impairments, in particular, to social anxiety and depression, the current study tested the interplay of selected factors such as gender, age of onset of psoriasis, cognitive and affective elements of body image, experiences of stigmatization, and patients' subjective perceptions of severity of the disease. methods: adult psoriasis patients (n = 193) completed the appearance schemas inventory-revised, the stigmatization scale, the body emotions scale, the beck depression inventory, and the social anxiety questionnaire. the disease severity was defined based on the body surface area (bsa) index. results: the effect of psoriasis on social anxiety was moderated by age of onset: higher severity of the disease was associated with higher levels of social anxiety, but only for patients with pre-adult onset psoriasis. hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that in patients with adult-onset (.2:18 years of age) the importance of appearance to one 's sense of self-worth was the main contributor to social anxiety, while in patients with pre-adult onset, social anxiety was most strongly related to experiences of stigmatization. moreover, the results indicated that negative body-related emotions mediated the relationship between severity of the disease and depression. additionally, the relationship between severity of psoriasis and body image emotions was moderated by gender. conclusions: findings significantly extend previous studies by confirming and highlighting the role of age of onset of psoriasis in psychological impairments, and provide more insight into factors that contribute to social anxiety in this group of patients.(c) 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
anxiety	background and objectives: patients with social anxiety disorder suffer from pronounced fears in social situations. as gaze perception is crucial in these situations, we examined which factors influence the range of gaze directions where mutual gaze is experienced (the cone of gaze). methods: the social stimulus was modified by changing the number of people (heads) present and the emotional expression of their faces. participants completed a psychophysical task, in which they had to adjust the eyes of a virtual head to gaze at the edge of the range where mutual eye-contact was experienced. results: the number of heads affected the width of the gaze cone: the more heads, the wider the gaze cone. the emotional expression of the virtual head had no consistent effect on the width of the gaze cone, it did however affect the emotional state of the participants. angry expressions produced the highest arousal values. highest valence emerged from happy faces, lowest valence from angry faces. conclusion: these results suggest that the widening of the gaze cone in social anxiety disorder is not primarily mediated by their altered emotional reactivity. implications for gaze assessment and gaze training in therapeutic contexts are discussed. limitations: due to interindividual variability, enlarged gaze cones are not necessarily indicative of social anxiety disorder, they merely constitute a correlate at the group level.

asthma	objectivesreviewed the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, mechanisms, and treatment of tuberculosis associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. data sourcewe searched pubmed, embase, and the cinahl from inception to june 2016. we used the following search terms: tuberculosis, copd, tuberculosis associated copd, and so forth. all types of study were chosen. results and conclusionchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and tuberculosis are significant public health problems, particularly in developing countries. although, smoking is the conventional risk factor for copd, nonsmoking related risk factors such as biomass fuel exposure, childhood lower-respiratory tract infections, chronic asthma, outdoor air pollution, and prior history of pulmonary tuberculosis have become important risk factors of copd, particularly in developing countries. past history of tuberculosis as a risk factor of chronic airflow obstruction has been reported in several studies. it may develop during the course of tuberculosis or after completion of tuberculosis treatment. developing countries with large burden of tuberculosis can contribute significantly to the burden of chronic airflow obstruction. prompt diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis should be emphasized to lessen the future burden of chronic airflow obstruction.
bipolar_disorder	there has been limited consideration and empirical studies on treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (trbd). this exploratory study was designed to identify factors contributing to trbd in patients with a bipolar (i or ii) disorder. patients were categorized with ""low,"" ""medium,"" or ""high"" levels of treatment resistance based on a) the total number of psychiatric medications received and, for a second analysis, b) the number of mood stabilizer medications received. the study identified a number of factors associated with trbd, such as being female and older and having an older age at illness onset, a higher incidences of family depression, less likelihood of being in paid employment, a higher number of lifetime stressors, medical conditions and comorbid anxiety disorders, a different personality and temperament profile, and more regular use of benzodiazepines. there were few factors associated with trbd when defined by number of mood stabilizers trialed. potential explanations for these findings were explored.
psoriatic_arthritis	psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease occurring in a subgroup of patients suffering from psoriasis. this article gives an overview of the complexity of psoriatic arthritis, looking at several aspects of this heterogeneous disease, such as epidemiology, important clinical features and comorbidities as well as current concepts of the pathophysiology and subsequent insights in novel treatment targets.
rheumatoid_arthritis	no previous study has examined the differences in treatments and outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (ami) between patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis (ra) in a setting where coronary reperfusion therapy was readily available. this study aimed to examine whether coexisting ra affected likelihood of receiving coronary reperfusion therapy and in-hospital mortality among ami patients in a japanese nationwide setting where coronary reperfusion therapy was readily available. using the diagnosis procedure combination database, we retrospectively identified patients admitted with ami between 2010 and 2014 and created a matched-pair cohort of patients with and without ra based on age, sex, hospital, and admission year at a maximum ratio of 1:5. we performed multivariable logistic regression analyses for associations of ra with likelihood of coronary reperfusion therapy and 30-day in-hospital mortality. there were no significant differences between the ra group (n = 938) and non-ra group (n = 3839) in the proportions of patients receiving coronary reperfusion therapy (on the day of admission 75.8% vs. 77.2%, p = 0.364; during hospitalization 87.1% vs. 87.3%, p = 0.913) and 30-day in-hospital mortality (5.9% vs. 5.9%, p = 1.000). multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that ra was not significantly associated with either likelihood of receiving coronary reperfusion therapy during hospitalization (odds ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.82-1.27; p = 0.837) or 30-day in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval 0.81-1.65; p = 0.419). coexisting ra did not affect likelihood of receiving coronary reperfusion therapy or in-hospital mortality among ami patients in a setting where reperfusion therapy was readily available.
psoriasis	objective: this study aimed to determine the prevalence of subclinical enthesopathy in patients with psoriasis using power doppler ultrasonography (pdus) and its association with other disease parameters. material and methods: a total of 50 patients with psoriasis (31 females) aged 19-70 years underwent a thorough clinical examination that included assessment of body mass index (bmi) and psoriasis area and severity index (pasi) score. measurements of inflammatory markers, c-reactive protein (crp), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), serum uric acid, and plain radiography of the heels, knees, and sacroiliac joints were performed for all patients. patients without clinical evidence of arthritis or enthesitis underwent an ultrasonographic (us) examination. according to the us examination, patients were classified into group i (patients with enthesitis) and group ii (patients without enthesitis). results: in group i, achilles enthesis was the most common site of us enthesitis (33.3%), followed by distal patellar enthesis (22.2%), proximal patellar enthesis (16.7%), quadriceps enthesis (16.7%), and plantar aponeurosis enthesis (11.1%). there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the occurrence of enthesitis and the patient 's age, disease duration, pasi score, bmi, and hyperuricemia (p0.05 for each). conclusion: in addition to the importance of pdus as a complimentary tool for examining enthesis in patients with psoriasis, the presence of high pasi score, increased bmi and hyperuricemia, and a long disease duration can be considered as predictive parameters for the presence of psoriatic enthesitis.
hereditary_angioedema	introduction: hereditary angioedema with c1 inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) is a rare disease, characterized by recurrent, unpredictable episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal edema. bradykinin, released by the activation of the contact system, binds to bradykinin b2 receptors on the endothelial cell surface to enhance vascular permeaility, which leads to angioedema.areas covered: c1-inh-hae therapy is aimed at the inhibition of bradykinin release, as well as at the blockage of its effects mediated by its receptor. three controlled trials, three open-label extensions, and two open-label studies, and a prospective, observational study have confirmed the safety and efficacy of the bradykinin b2 receptor antagonist, icatibant administered as acute treatment for hae attacks in adult patients with c1-inh-hae.expert commentary: the ready-to-use, pre-filled syringes of icatibant can be self-administered easily, effectively, safely and, importantly, conviently. - this has resulted in patients being able to quickly treat an attack and realize a dramatic change for the better in their lives.
kidney_health	the exact number of patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) in asia pacific is uncertain. in numeric terms, the region is home to the largest population of patients with untreated chronic kidney failure. the climatic, geographic, social, cultural, economic, and environmental diversity within this region is higher than in any other part of the world. large parts of the region face a climate-related burden of infectious diseases. infections contribute to the development and progression of ckd and complicate the course of patients with pre-existing ckd (especially those on dialysis therapy or who are immuno-suppressed), increase the cost of ckd care, and contribute to mortality and morbidity. kidney involvement is a feature of several infectious diseases prevalent in asia pacific. examples include malaria, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, tuberculosis, hepatitis b and c virus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and hantaan virus infections. the contribution of infection-associated acute kidney injury to the overall burden of ckd has not been evaluated systematically. research is needed to quantify the impact of infections on kidney health by undertaking prospective studies. nephrologists need to work with infectious disease research groups and government infection surveillance and control programs.

stress_management	approximately 10 % of first year medical students have clinically relevant anxiety or depression which may affect academic success and quality of life. this study tested the effects of a stress management intervention on indicators of anxiety, depression and self-efficacy in self-selected first year medical students. forty two medical students volunteered to participate and provided informed consent. an eight session intervention was offered and focused on building relaxation skills, adaptive coping, and basic nutrition. anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy were assessed pre and post intervention. this group of students had significantly higher baseline values of depression and anxiety but lower self-efficacy compared to a previous study of medical students at the same institution (p < 0.03). after the intervention, statistically significant improvements were observed in anxiety (p < 0.05), and self-efficacy (p < 0.05), but not in depression. the entering levels of anxiety and depression in this group suggested that these students were at risk for later clinical syndromes. intervention directed to decreasing the effects of stress was associated with improvement in indicators of distress and may modify the longer term risk.
anxiety	in classical earthquake risk assessment, the human behavior is actually not taken into account in risk assessment. agent-based modeling is a simulation technique that has been applied recently in several fields, such as emergency evacuation. the paper is proposing a methodology that includes in agent-based models the human behavior, considering the anxiety effects generated by the crowd and their influence on the evacuation delays. the proposed model is able to take into account the interdependency between the earthquake evacuation process, and the corresponding damage of structural and non-structural components that is expressed in term of fragility curves. the software repast hpc has been used to implement the model, and as a case study, the earthquake evacuation by a mall located in oakland has been used. the human behavior model has been calibrated through a survey using a miscellaneous sample from different countries. the model can be used to test future scenarios and help local authorities in situations where the human behavior plays a key role. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
digestive_health	the effects of kiwifruit on large bowel health were investigated in healthy rats. four-week old sprague-dawley rats were given diets containing 10% homogenized green kiwifruit, gold kiwifruit or 10% glucose solution (control) over 4 or 6 wk. green kiwifruit increased the fecal output compared to control. growth of certain bacterial species in cecum was influenced by both green and gold kiwifruit. a significant increase in cecal lachnospiraceae in rats fed the green kiwifruit diet was observed at week 4. at week 6, green and gold kiwifruit diets assisted in improving colonic barrier function by upregulating the expression of mucin (muc)-2, muc3, toll-like receptor (tlr)-4 or trefoil factor-3 genes. gold kiwifruit consumption increased the colonic goblet cells per crypt at week 6. significant negative correlations between e. coli and beta-defensin 1 and tlr4 expression were observed. consuming green and gold kiwifruit for 6 wk significantly altered the biomarkers of large bowel health; indicating that regularly consuming kiwifruit helps attain optimal digestive health.
osteoporosis	objective: to build mouse osteoblast mc3t3-e1 and mouse osteoclast raw264.7 co-culture system and to study the effect of icariin on the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the co-culture system. methods: in vitro acquisition and cultivation of mouse osteoblasts mc3t3-e1 and mouse raw264.7 cells were conducted. osteoblast and osteoclast activities of cells were detected by cck-8 staining experiment, alizarin red staining and tartaric-resistant acid phosphatase (trap) staining. we used different concentrations of icariin to interfere in osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture system. the effects of icariin on various genes were detected by pcr and western blot methods the correction between the expression of ppar gamma and bmd was analyzed in patients with osteoporosis. results: mouse osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture system was built, and the osteogenic differentiation effect was enhanced. icariin can improve the mc3t3-e1 osteogenic differentiation activity, enhance the expression of opg and rankl gene protein, reduce the nf-(k)b gene and protein expression, increase of alp, tgf-b1 and rankl gene expression level and reduce rank gene expression. icariin can act on mc3t3-e1 cells-raw264.7 cells co-culture system, and promote the osteogenic activity of mc3t3-e1 cells, inhibit the osteoclast activity of raw264.7 cells and reduce the level of bmscs adipogenic differentiation. the expression level of ppar-g gene was negatively correlated with the level of bmd. conclusions: mouse mc3t3-e1 cells and mouse raw264.7 cells could be co-cultured in vitro, and icariin could improve the osteogenic activity of mc3t3 cells-raw264.7 cells and decrease the osteoclast activity. icariin could inhibit adipogenic differentiation of bmscs in the osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture, promoting osteogenic differentiation and inhibiting osteoclast differentiation.

dementia	thiamine (vitamin b1) is essential to the health of all living organisms and deficiency has long been associated with diseases in animals such as fish, birds, alligators, and domesticated ruminant mammals. thiamine is also implicated in several human diseases including alzheimer 's, diabetes, dementia, depression and, most notably, wernicke-korsakoff syndrome and beriberi disease. yet, highly sensitive and specific detection of thiamine remains an analytical challenge, as pm to nm levels of thiamine need to be detected in environmental and human samples, respectively, various phosphorylated variants need to be discriminated, and rapid on-site detection would be highly desirable. furthermore, appropriate sample preparation is mandatory, owing to the complexity of the relevant sample matrices including fish tissues, ocean water, and body fluids. this review has two objectives. first, it provides a thorough overview of analytical techniques published for thiamine detection over the last 15 years. second, it describes the principles of analytical approaches that are based on biorecognition and may open up new avenues for rapid and high-throughput thiamine analysis. most notably, periplasmic binding proteins, ribozymes, and aptamers are of particular interest, as they function as bioaffinity recognition elements that can fill an important assay technology gap, owing to the unavailability of thiamine-specific commercial antibodies. finally, the authors provide brief evaluations of key outcomes of the major assay concepts and suggest how innovative techniques could help develop sensitive and specific thiamine analytical test systems.
stress_management	purpose: previous research determined the relevance of masticatory performance with regard to nutritional status, cognitive functions, or stress management. in addition, the measurement of masticatory efficiency contributes to the evaluation of therapeutic successes within the stomatognathic system. however, the question remains unanswered as to what extent modern techniques are able to reproduce the subtle differences in masticatory efficiency within various patient groups. the purpose of this review is to provide an extensive summary of the evaluation of masticatory performance by means of a color-changeable chewing gum with regard to its clinical relevance and applicability. study selection: a general overview describing the various methods available for this task has already been published. this review focuses in depth on the research findings available on the technique of measuring masticatory performance by means of color-changeable chewing gum. described are the mechanism and the differentiability of the color change and methods to evaluate the color changes. subsequently, research on masticatory performance is conducted with regard to patient age groups, the impact of general diseases and the effect of prosthetic and surgical treatment. results: the studies indicate that color-changeable chewing gum is a valid and reliable method for the evaluation of masticatory function. conclusion: apart from other methods, in clinical practice this technique can enhance dental diagnostics as well as the assessment of therapy outcomes.

addiction	background: substance use in pregnancy is associated with severe maternal and fetal morbidities and substantial economic costs. however, few studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of substance use treatment programs in pregnant women. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of a behavioral intervention that integrated motivational enhancement therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (met-cbt) for treatment of substance use in pregnancy, in comparison with brief advice. methods: we conducted an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial by collecting data on resource utilization and performing a cost minimization analysis as met-cbt and brief advice had similar effects on clinical outcomes (e.g., alcohol and drug use and birth outcomes). costs were estimated from the health care system 's perspective and included intervention costs, hospital facility costs, physician fees, and costs of psychotropic medications from the date of intake assessment until 3-month postpartum. we compared effects of met-cbt on costs with those of brief advice using wilcoxon rank sum tests. results: although the integrated met-cbt therapy had higher intervention cost than brief advice (median = $ 1297/participant versus $ 303/participant, p < 0.01), costs of care during the prenatal period, delivery, and postpartum period, as well as for psychotropic medications, were comparable between the two groups (all p values = 0.55). there was no statistically significant difference in overall cost of care (median total cost = $ 26,993/participant for met-cbt versus $ 27,831/participant for brief advice, p = 0.90). conclusions: the met-cbt therapy and brief advice resulted in similar clinical outcomes and overall medical costs. further research incorporating non-medical costs, targeting women with more severe substance use disorders, and evaluating the impact of met-cbt on participants' quality of life will provide additional insights.
asthma	rhinoviruses are the most common causes of the common cold. their many distinct lineages fall into ""major"" and ""minor"" groups that use different cell surface receptors to enter host cells. minor-group rhinoviruses are more immunogenic in laboratory studies, although their patterns of transmission and their cold symptoms are broadly similar to those of the major group. here we present evolutionary evidence that minor-group viruses are also more immunogenic in humans. a key finding is that rates of amino acid substitutions at exposed sites in the capsid proteins vp2, vp3, and vp1 tend to be elevated in minor-group relative to major-group viruses, while rates at buried sites show no consistent differences. a reanalysis of historical virus watch data also indicates a higher immunogenicity of minor-group viruses, consistent with our findings about evolutionary rates at amino acid positions most directly exposed to immune surveillance. the increased immunogenicity and speed of evolution in minor-group lineages may contribute to the very large numbers of rhinovirus serotypes that coexist while differing in virulence. importance most colds are caused by rhinoviruses (rvs). those caused by a subset known as the minor-group members of rhinovirus species a (rv-a) are correlated with the inception and aggravation of asthma in at-risk populations. genetically, minor-group viruses are similar to major-group rv-a, from which they were derived, although they tend to elicit stronger immune responses. differences in their rates and patterns of molecular evolution should be highly relevant to their epidemiology. all rv-a strains show high rates of amino acid substitutions in the capsid proteins at exposed sites not previously identified as being immunogenic, and this increase is significantly greater in minor-group viruses. these findings will inform future studies of the recently discovered rv-c, which also appears to exacerbate asthma in adults and children. in addition, these findings draw attention to the difficult problem of explaining the long-term coexistence of many serotypes of major-and minor-group rvs.
kidney_health	chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a common and costly health problem in the middle east the incidence of ckd is still unknown, and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (esrd) is estimated at 100 - 140 incident cases per million population in the middle east countries most of the available statistics about prevalence are of treated esrd published population-based studies for incidence and prevalence of ckd and esrd are still lacking in most of the middle east countries this negatively affects the health planning and effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic measures in the region the prevalence of renal replacement therapy vanes among the different countries in the middle east the infrastructure for these services is also variable among these countries and affects the outcome, which as yet cannot be measured accurately the low gross national income of the middle east countries is a major factor in negating the implementation of research, planning, and improvement of the services for ckd patients to overcome the obstacles for the renal services in the middle east countries, the constraints on health expenditure need to be surmounted, which is not an easy task, and related appropriately to the gross national income awareness within the medical community and the public at large about the advances of therapeutic and preventive measures is also an important factor for progress toward better kidney health in the middle east
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the destruction of lung tissue architecture and the formation of fibrous foci, currently has no satisfactory treatment. emodin is a component of chinese herb that has been reported to be medicament on pancreatic fibrosis and liver fibrosis. however, its role in pulmonary fibrosis has not been established yet. in the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that emodin plays an inhibitory role in tgf-beta 1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) of alveolar epithelial cell, and emodin exerts its effect through the notch signaling pathway. emodin inhibits the proliferation of rat alveolar type ii epithelial cells rle-6tn in a concentration-dependent manner; reduces the expression of collagen i, alpha-sma and vimentin, promotes the expression of e-cadherin. moreover, emodin could regulate the expression patterns of the notch signaling pathway-related factors and reduce the notch-1 nucleus translocation. knockdown of notch-1 enhances the inhibitory effect of emodin on tgf-beta 1-induced emt in rle-6tn cells. in conclusion, the data of the present study suggests that emodin suppresses top-beta 1-induced emt in alveolar epithelial cells through notch signaling pathway and shows the potential to be effective in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

children's_health	objectivesparents have general influence over their children 's health and health behavior. however, given the dearth of specific literature regarding knowledge level and social and cultural factors influencing hpv vaccination behaviors among cambodian american (ca) parent, it is difficult to develop an effective, evidence-based public health hpv vaccination program. therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the hpv vaccine uptakes among ca teenagers and to examine factors influencing hpv vaccine uptakes. design and samplea descriptive, cross-sectional survey design and a combination of network and targeted sampling methods were used. resultsca mothers (n=130) completed a health survey through face-to-face interviews in either english or khmer language. girls vaccination rates were 29% while that of boys was 16%. awareness and knowledge of hpv among ca mothers was very low, and many believed that their daughters, who speak english and were educated in the u.s., had more knowledge about health than they did. logistic regression analysis showed that ca girls had significantly higher odds of vaccination when their mothers possessed a higher level of english reading ability and had greater awareness and knowledge of hpv. conclusionsthe strikingly low rates of hpv vaccination among ca girls and boys underscore the need to improve vaccination outreach, education, and uptake. the findings can be used to develop targeted public health hpv vaccination programs for cas, which will reduce cervical cancer disparities.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ae-ipf) have been defined as events of clinically significant respiratory deterioration with an unidentifiable cause. they carry a significant mortality and morbidity and while their exact pathogenesis remains unclear, the possibility remains that hidden infection may play a role. the aim of this pilot study was to determine whether changes in the respiratory microbiota occur during an ae-ipf. bacterial dna was extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with stable ipf and those experiencing an ae-ipf. a hyper-variable region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene (16s rrna) was amplified, quantified and pyrosequenced. culture independent techniques demonstrate ae-ipf is associated with an increased bal bacterial burden compared to stable disease and highlight shifts in the composition of the respiratory microbiota during an ae-ipf.
addiction	the aim of this study was to explore the relation between problematic gaming behaviour (pgb) and specific psychological factors (gaming motives, self-awareness of problematic gaming behaviour) and structural factors (game genres) among finnish adolescents and young adults. a national survey of 271 respondents, aged 13 to 24, participated in the study. the study sample was randomly selected from the population register center. multiple regression analysis was used as a means of examining links between game genres, gaming motives and pgb. in addition, pairwise comparisons of a non-problematic gaming behavior group and a problematic gaming behavior group were used as a means of examining differences across game genre use and self-awareness of pgb. pgb was particularly associated with the use of a group of games encompassing role-playing, progression (e.g., character development), action and strategy features. the findings indicated that entertainment-achievement, social and escapism motives were associated with pgb. on the whole, this study emphasized that specific game genres and playing motives are involved in problematic use of digital game playing.
atrial_fibrillation	evidence-based interventions that increase social support have the potential to improve the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq) youth. hatch youth is a group-level intervention that provides services four nights a week to lgbtq youth between 13 and 20 years of age. each hatch youth meeting is organized into three 1-hour sections: unstructured social time, consciousness-raising (education), and a youth-led peer support group. youth attending a hatch youth meeting between march and june 2014 (n = 108) completed a cross-sectional survey. covariate adjusted regression models were used to examine the association between attendance, perceived social support, depressive symptomology, self-esteem, and coping ability. compared to those who attended hatch youth for less than 1 month, participants who attended 1 to 6 months or more than 6 months reported higher social support (beta(1-6mo.) = 0.57 [0.07, 1.07]; beta(6+mo.) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [ci; 0.14, 0.75], respectively). increased social support was associated with decreased depressive symptomology (beta = -4.84, 95% ci [-6.56, -3.12]), increased self-esteem (beta = 0.72, 95% ci [0.38, 1.06]), and improved coping ability (beta = 1.00, 95% ci [0.66, 1.35]). hatch youth is a promising intervention that has the potential to improve the mental health and reduce risk behavior of lgbtq youth.
stress_management	college can be a time of immense stress. mindfulness meditation has been shown to be an effective stress management technique. a significant limitation of the mindfulness literature, however, is a reliance on inactive control groups. we compared a mindfulness intervention with both an ecologically valid, active control (interacting with a dog during a group study break) and a no-treatment control. participants (n = 74) were randomly assigned to groups, with the treatment groups completing 4 weekly sessions (duration: 1 hr). by the end of the 4th session, those in the mindfulness group exhibited significantly lower state anxiety compared with those in the other groups, while the dog group was also significantly less anxious than the control group. in addition, both the dog and the mindfulness groups exhibited significantly less dysphoric affect than the control group. all of the participants came in for a posttreatment assessment during which they were given a cognitive stressor challenge. electrocardiogram data were collected during the cognitive challenge allowing us to assess heart rate variability (hrv)-a measure of the body 's ability to modulate the physiological stress response. participants in the mindfulness group exhibited significantly higher hrv during the cognitive challenge than those in the other 2 groups, signifying a more-adaptive response to stress (p < .05). individuals in the dog group, meanwhile, were no different from control participants. these preliminary findings suggest that brief mindfulness training can help college students manage their stress in response to the ubiquitous academic and cognitive challenges of college life.
osteoporosis	purpose of review the purpose of this review is to provide an update on osteoporosis epidemiology. the focus is on fractures because fractures are the most important clinical consequence of osteoporosis. studies published over the past 18 months are identified and reviewed. finally, the clinical impact of these new findings is discussed. recent findings important research in 2015-2016 include analyses of screening and rescreening in younger women and older men, risk factors for hip fractures in older men, obesity and weight loss/gain, and risk of fracture. several dietary factors, including adherence to a mediterranean diet and a diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables and maintenance of physical function with increasing age represent modifiable nonpharmacologic risk factors that improve bone health. sarcopenia may have a more important role in fracture in men than women. important biomarkers for fracture include low 25-hydroxyvitamin d and hemoglobin a1c. summary updated literature on fracture epidemiology have identified important risk factors for fracture.
stress_management	objective: medical students are exposed to various psychosocial problems and challenges. specific consultations services and programs can support them. christian vajda 1 1 medical university of graz, department of medical ""peer2peer"" is such a consultation program and was implemented at the medical university of graz. it focusses on crisis intervention, psychology and psychosocial stress management, junior mentoring as well as student psychotherapy, graz, austria education in this field. besides, it also offers student tutors of the program practical skills trainings. the program was restructured in winter term 2014/15. methods: on the one hand, ""peer2peer"" gives insights into topics such as the current state of research concerning the students' psychological strain and psychosocial crises in acutely stressful situations and preventive approaches for coping with these kinds of situations on the other hand. these aspects are taught by means of elective courses, lectures and workshops. furthermore, ""peer2peer"" provides consultation services by student tutors who give face-to-face advice if required. these tutors receive ongoing training in organizational and professional issues. results: since the summer term of 2015, 119 students have been trained (via lectures and elective courses), while 61 contacts (short consultation) and 33 contacts (full consultation) have been supervisied. in total, two psychotherapeutic and one psychosocial follow ups were recommended. there are seven students who participate as tutors in the program. conclusions: the "" peer2peer"" program is intended to enable a low-threshold access for medical students facing psychosocial crises situations and to help them in dealing with stress and learning problems. an increase in support contacts from the summer term of 2015 to the winter term of 2015/16 can be considered a success. a first evaluation of the different components of the program started in the winter semester of 2015/16. the student tutors have not only acquired practical skills in dealing with students in crises situations but also various organizational skills.
atrial_fibrillation	spreading depolarizations (sd) are waves of abrupt, near-complete breakdown of neuronal transmembrane ion gradients, are the largest possible pathophysiologic disruption of viable cerebral gray matter, and are a crucial mechanism of lesion development. spreading depolarizations are increasingly recorded during multimodal neuromonitoring in neuro-critical care as a causal biomarker providing a diagnostic summary measure of metabolic failure and excitotoxic injury. focal ischemia causes spreading depolarization within minutes. further spreading depolarizations arise for hours to days due to energy supply-demand mismatch in viable tissue. spreading depolarizations exacerbate neuronal injury through prolonged ionic breakdown and spreading depolarization-related hypoperfusion (spreading ischemia). local duration of the depolarization indicates local tissue energy status and risk of injury. regional electrocorticographic monitoring affords even remote detection of injury because spreading depolarizations propagate widely from ischemic or metabolically stressed zones; characteristic patterns, including temporal clusters of spreading depolarizations and persistent depression of spontaneous cortical activity, can be recognized and quantified. here, we describe the experimental basis for interpreting these patterns and illustrate their translation to human disease. we further provide consensus recommendations for electrocorticographic methods to record, classify, and score spreading depolarizations and associated spreading depressions. these methods offer distinct advantages over other neuromonitoring modalities and allow for future refinement through less invasive and more automated approaches.
migraine	chronic migraine (cm) is a severely disabling neurological condition characterized by episodes of pulsating unilateral or bilateral headache. the united states food and drug administration (fda) approved onabotulinumtoxina (botox (r)) for the prophylactic treatment of cm in 2010. it has been shown that onabotulinumtoxina is effective in the reduction of headache frequency and severity in patients with cm. treatment is well tolerated by the patients. this review reports on the history of botulinum neurotoxin (bont) in cm and presents the current clinical evidence for the use of onabotulinumtoxina in the treatment of cm.
psoriasis	angiogenesis is an important process being involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and promises new potential parameter for diagnosis and screening of treatment. this study investigated the levels of signal peptide-cub-egf (epidermal growth factor-like protein) family domain-containing protein (scube) 1 and 3. potential value as a novel marker of angiogenesis in patients with psoriasis is also evaluated by assessing possible relation of scube-1 and 3 with disease activity in conjunction with vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) levels, as an established marker of angiogenesis. forty-eight patients with psoriasis (aged >18 years) and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. detailed information was obtained through history and physical examination. psoriasis area and severity index (pasi) scores were calculated. blood scube 1 and 3, and vegf levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean pasi score of the patients was 6.7 +/- 4.1. patients' serum scube 1 and 3 and vegf levels were significantly higher than those of the controls (p = 0.001). the sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 83 and 62% for the 0.67 ng/ml cut-off level of scube 1, and 63 and 71% for the 2.57 ng/ml cut-off level of scube 3, respectively. a cut-off vegf level of 310 ng/ml predicted the presence of psoriasis with a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 77%. the results of this pioneering study indicate that scube protein family appears to have a probable role in the pathogenesis and angiogenesis development in psoriasis and scube 1 and 3 may be novel markers of angiogenesis in psoriasis.
addiction	cancer cell metabolism is a complex, dynamic network of regulated pathways. interrogation of this network would benefit from rapid, sensitive techniques that are adaptable to high-throughput formats, facilitating novel compound screening. this requires assays that have minimal sample preparation and are adaptable to lower-volume 384-well formats and automation. here we describe bioluminescent glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate detection assays that are well suited for high-throughput analysis of two major metabolic pathways in cancer cells: glycolysis and glutaminolysis. the sensitivity (1-5 pmol/sample), broad linear range (0.1-100 mu m), and wide dynamic range (>100-fold) are advantageous for measuring both extracellular and intracellular metabolites. importantly, the assays incorporate rapid inactivation of endogenous enzymes, eliminating deproteinization steps required by other methods. using ovarian cancer cell lines as a model system, the assays were used to monitor changes in glucose and glutamine consumption and lactate and glutamate secretion over time. homogeneous formats of the lactate and glutamate assays were robust (z' = 0.6-0.9) and could be multiplexed with a real-time viability assay to generate internally controlled data. screening a small-compound library with these assays resulted in the identification of both inhibitors and activators of lactate and glutamate production.
hereditary_angioedema	background: hereditary angioedema due to c1 inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) may affect health-related quality of life (hrqol). a specific hrqol questionnaire for adult patients with c1-inh-hae, the hae-qol, has recently been developed in spain. objective: the objective of this study was to perform a cross-cultural validation and psychometric study of the hae-qol in an international setting. methods: cross-cultural adaptation of the spanish hae-qol draft version and an international rating phase with experts were performed. the resultant version of the hae-qol, a clinical questionnaire, and short form 36-item health survey version 2.0 (sf-36v2) were pilot tested internationally. item reduction was based on both descriptive and exploratory factor analysis. psychometric properties were assessed. results: cross-cultural adaptation of the hae-qol was performed in 18 countries. the draft version of the hae-qol was pilot tested in 332 patients, and accurate data were obtained from 290 patients from 11 countries. the reduction process resulted in a new version with 25 items and 7 dimensions (treatment difficulties, physical functioning and health, disease-related stigma, emotional role and social functioning, concern about offspring, perceived control over illness, and mental health). strong psychometric properties were observed (cronbach 's alpha 0.92; test-retest reliability 0.87). convergent validity showed mild to moderate correlations with sf-36v2 physical and mental component summaries (0.45 and 0.64, respectively) and with sf-36v2 dimensions (p < .004). hae-qol scores discriminated significantly among severity groups (median: asymptomatic 133.5 vs severe 84.0; p < .001); between patients with and without long-term prophylaxis (median: 101 vs 90; p [.001); and between patients with and without psychiatric and/or psychological care (median: 74 vs 103; p <= .001). conclusions: the hae-qol, currently available in 18 languages, showed good reliability and validity evidence.

autism	among the most co-occurring conditions in autism spectrum disorders (asd), there are sleep disorders which may exacerbate associated behavioral disorders and lead to intensification of existing autistic symptoms. several studies investigating the use of melatonin in the treatment of sleep disorders in asd have shown comparative efficiency in sleep with little or no side effects. here we report a case of asd with non-24-hour rhythm and the effect of melatonin in circadian parameters by actigraphy. visual analysis of the first 10 days recorded and the periodogram suggest that this patient showed a non-24-hour rhythm. this asd subject showed before melatonin administration an activity/rest rhythm lower than 24 hours. the results show that melatonin increased approximately 4.7 times the regularity of circadian activity rhythm and resting staying on average between 00:00 and 06:00 and showed positive effects in improving the quality of sleep and behavior. so, the actigraphy showed an asd subject with a non-24-hour activity/rest rhythm which changed this rhythm to a 24-hour rhythm after melatonin administration. this result reinforces the prospect of therapy with melatonin for synchronization (increased regularity) of endogenous rhythms and improve sleep quality and hence behavior and indicates the actigraphy as a choice tool to characterize several parameters of the activity/rest rhythm of asd individuals.
bipolar_disorder	background: a large number patients struggle with migraine which is classified as a chronic disorder. the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability of prophylactic medications for migraine play a key role in managing this disease. methods: we conducted an extensive literature search for popular prophylactic medications that are used for migraine patients. pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (nma) were carried out sequentially for determining the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability of prophylactic medications. summary effect for migraine headache days, headache frequency, at least 50% reduction in headache attacks, all-adverse events, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, withdrawal and withdrawal due to adverse events were produced by synthesizing both direct and indirect evidence. results: patients with three interventions exhibited significantly less average migraine headache days compared with those treated by placebo (topiramate, propranolol, divalproex). moreover, topiramate and valproate exhibited a significantly increased likelihood of at least 50% reduction in migraine headache attacks compared to placebo. patients with topiramate and propranolol also exhibited significantly reduced headache frequency compared to those with placebo. on the other hand, patients with divalproex exhibited significantly higher risk of nausea compared to those with placebo, topiramate, propranolol, gabapentin and amitriptyline. finally, divalproex was associated with an increased risk of withdrawal compared to placebo and propranolol. conclusions: topiramate, propranolol and divalproex may be more efficacious than other prophylactic medications. besides, the safety and tolerability of divalproex should be further verified by future studies.
mental_health	the current study aimed to investigate the specific pathways in the offence process for mentally disordered firesetters. in a previous study, an offence chain model was constructed (i.e., the firesetting offence chain for mentally disordered offenders, foc-md) using offence descriptions obtained from 23 mentally disordered firesetters, detailing the sequence of contextual, behavioural, affective, and cognitive factors that precipitate an incidence of firesetting for this population. the current study examines the prevalence of the specific pathways to firesetting for the original 23 mentally disordered firesetters and a further sample of 13 mentally disordered firesetters. three distinct pathways to firesetting are identified within the foc-md: fire interest-childhood mental health, no fire interest-adult mental health, fire interest-adult mental health. in this article, we describe these three pathways in detail using illustrative case studies. the practice implications of these identified pathways are also discussed.
asthma	lipids play a central role in lung physiology and pathology; however, a comprehensive lipidomic characterization of human pulmonary cells relevant to disease has not been performed. the cells involved in lung host defense, including alveolar macrophages (ams), bronchial epithelial cells (becs), and alveolar type ii cells (atiis), were isolated from human subjects and lipidomic analysis by lc-ms and lc-ms/ms was performed. additionally, pieces of lung tissue from the same donors were analyzed by maldi imaging ms in order to determine lipid localization in the tissue. the unique distribution of phospholipids in atiis, becs, and ams from human subjects was accomplished by subjecting the large number of identified phospholipid molecular species to univariant statistical analysis. specific maldi images were generated based on the univariant statistical analysis data to reveal the location of specific cell types within the human lung slice.(jlr) while the complex composition and function of the lipidome in various disease states is currently poorly understood, this method could be useful for the characterization of lipid alterations in pulmonary disease and may aid in a better understanding of disease pathogenesis.
kidney_health	backgroundchronic kidney disease (ckd) is a major public health issue and early detection may prevent morbidity and mortality. screening for ckd is simply assessed using the kidney health check (khc), a compilation of blood pressure (bp), estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) and urinalysis (ua). khc screening of high risk hospital inpatients is recommended, but its implementation and cost-effectiveness is unknown. aimswe aimed to determine the proportion of patients currently tested for all components of the khc during an acute hospital admission, and to compare the estimated costs of screening and subsequent follow-up with other screening programs. methodsa retrospective audit was conducted of consecutively admitted adult patients, and the frequency of bp, egfr and ua testing recorded. using published data, the likely costs and benefits of components of the khc were estimated. resultstwo hundred patients (median age 75 years, range 20-98) were assessed. all had a documented bp and egfr, and 55% had a ua, representing a complete khc. of the total, 141 (71%) had one or more abnormalities detected, and of 71 with an egfr <60ml/min per 1.73m(2), only 22 (31%) had a recorded diagnosis of ckd. estimated costs of opportunistic in-hospital khc screening are below those of current australian screening programs. conclusionshospital in-patients frequently have a full khc and most have abnormalities detected. opportunistic inpatient khc screening would have little impact on hospital costs, but may result in significant health benefits. the khc should be included in routine discharge documentation. summary at a glance opportunistic inpatient kidney health check (khc) screening has little impact on hospital costs, but may result in significant health benefits. the khc should be included in routine discharge documentation.
children's_health	purpose: united states (us) pediatric legislation (pl) was introduced in 1997 to improve children 's health. the european union pl (eupl) has been in force since 2007. both pls facilitate additional pediatric research on primarily adult drugs. the eupl declares that the forces of the market are not sufficient for children. without a pediatric investigation plan, new drugs can no longer be registered with the european union. new ways on how to facilitate drug development for rare pediatric diseases are being proposed. methods: us pl, eupl, and implications of modern labels for medical decision making are discussed. findings: modern drug labels constituted a step from eminence-based towards data-based medical decision making. however, approval by regulatory authorities did not replace knowledge transfer in medicine, which continued in university education, through conferences, consensus papers, and so on. children were successfully treated with off-label drugs in pediatric oncology and in many other diseases. describing children as ""therapeutic orphans"" reflected an overestimation of drug labels and an underestimation of nonregulatory systematic clinical testing. therapeutic breakthroughs have occurred, for example, in acute myelogenous leukemia and cystic fibrosis. rare diseases need new innovative drugs and therapeutic concepts for further breakthroughs.

atopic_dermatitis	excessive exposure to solar uv (suv) is related with numerous human skin disorders, such as skin inflammation, photoaging and carcinogenesis. t-lak cell-originated protein kinase (topk), an upstream of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and c-jun n-terminal kinases (jnks), plays an important role in suv-induced skin inflammation, and targeting topk has already been a strategy to prevent skin inflammation. in this study, we found that the expression of topk, phosphorylation of p38 or jnks was increased in human solar dermatitis tissues. the level of phosphorylation of p38 or jnks increased in a dose and time dependent manner in hacat cells or jb6 cl41 cells after suv treatment. paeonol is an active component isolated from traditional chinese herbal medicines, and mts (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2h-tetrazdium) assay showed that it has no toxicity to cells. microscale thermophoresis (mst) assay showed that paeonol can bind topk ex vivo. in vitro kinase assay showed paeonol can inhibit topk activity. ex vivo studies further showed paeonol suppressed suv-induced phosphorylation level of p38, jnks, msk1 and histone h2ax by inhibiting topk activity in a time and dose dependent manner. paeonol inhibited the secretion of il-6 and tnf-alpha in hacat and jb6 cells ex vivo. in vivo studies demonstrated that paeonol inhibited suv-induced increase of topk, the phosphorylation of p38, jnks and h2ax, and the secretion of il-6 and tnf-alpha in babl/c mouse. in summary, our data indicated a protective role of paeonol against suv-induced inflammation by targeting topk, and paeonol could be a promising agent for the treatment of suv-induced skin inflammation.
crohn's_disease	endoscopy remains the main technique in the diagnosis and treatment of crohn 's disease (cd); nevertheless, the recent development of innovative and non-invasive imaging techniques has led to a new tool in the exploration of small bowel in cd patients. this paper reviews the available data on ultrasound imaging used for the evaluation of cd, highlighting the role of small intestine contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with the use of oral and intravenous contrast agents.
osteoporosis	background: sleep has been reported to be an important factor in bone metabolism, and sympathetic nervous system activity has been reported to regulate bone metabolism. in this study, we evaluated the association between sleep, sympathetic nervous system activity, and bone mass. methods: the study subjects were 221 individuals (108 males; 113 females; mean age: 55.1 +/- 7.0 years) divided into two groups: those who slept for less than 6 h a day (short sleep [ss] group), and those who slept 6 h or longer (normal sleep [ns] group). the groups were compared with regard to lifestyle, cortical bone thickness, cancellous bone density, bone metabolism markers, blood leptin levels, and sympathetic nervous system activity as evaluated by heart rate variability analysis. results: significant differences were observed between the two groups in cortical bone thickness, blood tracp-5b, and leptin levels. the l/h ratio (an index of sympathetic nervous system activity) was higher in the ss group than in the ns group. significant negative correlations were observed between cortical bone thickness and both the l/h ratio and leptin levels, and a significant positive correlation was observed between the l/h ratio and leptin levels. conclusions: short sleep was associated with a decline in cortical bone thickness due to the promotion of bone resorption and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity in the middle-aged group. leptin levels and cortical bone thickness were found to be closely related, suggesting that cortical bone mass may be regulated via interaction with the leptin-sympathetic nervous system.

atrial_fibrillation	catheter ablation (ca) provides the most effective treatment option for patients suffering from symptomatic atrial fibrillation (af). the procedural cornerstone of all ablation strategies and for all entities of af is the electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (pv). ca with the use of radiofrequency (rf) in conjunction with a 3-dimensional electroanatomical mapping system is the most established ablation approach, but it demands a long learning curve and recurrences of af are commonly the result of recovered pv conduction. as a consequence, novel ablation systems such as the cryoballoon (cb) have been evolved aiming at facilitation and increased efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation (pvi). cb ablation is characterized by a short learning curve as well as short procedure times and demonstrated non-inferiority with regard to safety and efficacy when being directly compared to rf ablation for treatment of paroxysmal af. however, rf ablation is first choice for treatment of persistent af, in particular when expanded ablation strategies beyond pvi are intended in order to improve clinical outcomes.
mental_health	introductionwe investigated the prevalence rates for probable ptsd and used generalized estimating equations to identify risk factors for probable ptsd in children and adolescents exposed to the lushan earthquake. methodsa total of 1623 participants completed 3 assessments, including the children 's revised impact of event scale, at 2weeks, 3, and 6months after experiencing the lushan earthquake. additionally, demographic variables and variables related to everyday functioning were evaluated at 2weeks after the earthquake via a self-constructed questionnaire. resultsthe percentages of children and adolescents who changed from having no ptsd to probable ptsd and probable ptsd to no ptsd at each time point were approximately 8% and 20% of the sample, respectively. the percentage of participants without ptsd increased from 41.1% at the 2-week to 3-month time point to 54.3% at the 3-month to 6-month time point, and the percentage with persistent probable ptsd decreased from 29.6% to 16.4% at the 2 time points, respectively. female gender, a sedentary lifestyle, and actively helping others were significant risk factors for probable ptsd, whereas initiating communications with others, actively playing with classmates and friends, and the ability to concentrate on academic studies after resuming class were factors that helped protect against probable ptsd. discussionresistance to ptsd and persistent ptsd symptoms were both common occurrences in child and adolescent survivors. specific variables related to everyday functioning may be risk factors for probable ptsd. these findings have implications for agencies that provide mental health services after an earthquake.
medicare	objective. persistent concern exists about the variable and possibly inappropriate utilization of high-cost imaging tests. the purpose of this study is to assess the influence of appropriate use criteria attributes on altering ambulatory imaging orders deemed inappropriate. materials and methods. this secondary analysis included medicare imaging demonstration data collected from three health care systems in 2011-2013 via the use of clinical decision support (cds) during ambulatory imaging order entry. the cds system captured whether orders were inappropriate per the appropriate use criteria of professional societies and provided advice during the intervention period. for orders deemed inappropriate, we assessed the impact of the availability of alternative test recommendations, conflicts with local best practices, and the strength of evidence for appropriate use criteria on the primary outcome of cancellation or modification of inappropriate orders. expert review determined conflicts with local best practices for 250 recommendations for abdominal and thoracic ct orders. strength of evidence was assessed for the 15 most commonly triggered recommendations that were deemed inappropriate. a chi-square test was used for univariate analysis. results. a total of 1691 of 63,222 imaging test orders (2.7%) were deemed inappropriate during the intervention period; this amount decreased from 364 of 11,675 test orders (3.1%) in the baseline period (p < 0.00001). of 270 inappropriate recommendations with alternative test recommendations, 28 (10.4%) were modified, compared with four of 1024 inappropriate recommendations without alternatives (0.4%) (p < 0.0001). seventy-eight of 250 recommendations (31%) conflicted with local best practices, but only six of 69 inappropriate recommendations (9%) conflicted (p < 0.001). no inappropriate recommendations that conflicted with local best practices were modified. all 15 commonly triggered recommendations had an oxford centre for evidence-based medicine level of evidence of 5 (i.e., expert opinion). conclusion. orders for imaging tests that were deemed inappropriate were modified infrequently, more often with alternative recommendations present and only for appropriate use criteria consistent with local best practices.
osteoarthritis	background: knee osteoarthritis is common. the evidence regarding the effectiveness of braces and orthoses for patients with knee osteoarthritis is inconclusive according to english-language literature. english- language reviews to date have not included japanese-language studies. objectives: this study aimed to collect and synthesise japanese-language randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of braces and orthoses for patients with knee osteoarthritis. study design: systematic review. methods: eight databases were systematically searched from inception to 29 july 2015. only japanese-language randomised controlled trials were included. risk of bias was assessed using physiotherapy evidence database scale. a meta-analysis was not appropriate due to the heterogeneity in the included studies. results: seven randomised controlled trials with low to high risks of bias were included. six of seven included studies were conducted by the same author group. limited evidence supported the positive effects of short-lever elastic knee braces to improve pain and functional disability in specific outcomes. no evidence was found to support the use of foot orthoses, such as laterally wedged insoles, medial arch support and metatarsal arch pad. conclusion: our systematic review found no conclusive evidence about the effectiveness of any braces and orthoses for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis. future japanese-language studies should address methodological flaws exposed in this review and strengthen the international evidence base.
addiction	zebrafish have become a popular animal model for studying the development of alcohol addiction. several behavioral paradigms for studying alcohol addiction have been developed for zebrafish, including conditioned place preference, alcohol-induced tolerance, and withdrawal. however, alcohol choice preference tasks have not been established in zebrafish as of yet. the ability of zebrafish to detect alcohol in their environment is required in alcohol choice or preference tasks. to our knowledge, it is currently unknown whether zebrafish are able to detect alcohol in their environment immediately following bath immersion. in the current study, we analyzed the time course of alcohol-induced behavioral changes of zebrafish while being immersed in alcohol solution in a 1.5 l tank. we recorded each trial in high-definition and quantified behavioral responses using automated video tracking-based and manual observation-based methods to quantify temporal changes in alcohol-induced behaviors. as alcohol is known to require several minutes of bath immersion to reach the brain in zebrafish, we argued that behavioral responses before this time point would prove zebrafish 's ability to detect this substance in the water. our results show that a 60-min exposure to 1% alcohol alters behavioral responses in a time-dependent manner. notably, alcohol exposure significantly increased absolute turn angle, decreased distance to bottom, and variance of distance to bottom within the first 3 min immediately following exposure, a response that occurred before alcohol could reach the brain of the subjects in measurable amounts. these results imply that zebrafish are able to detect alcohol in their environment immediately following immersion into the drug solution.
mental_health	we explored associations between torture history and physical health symptoms of 111 karen refugees newly arrived to the united states. we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of electronic health data collected at the initial refugee health-screening exam. unique to this analysis was the exploration of relationships between torture exposure, war trauma, and presenting physical and psychological health issues. we identified no unique effects of torture on physical health above and beyond trauma exposure. overall, in our sample we found a high prevalence of underlying infectious conditions, pain, and hypercholesterolemia, regardless of torture exposure. we discuss effects of war trauma and torture experiences on physical exam findings and implications for future research.
autism	research exploring parents' experiences of having offspring with autism spectrum disorder (asd) currently underrepresents fathers. this study aimed to develop an understanding of the experience of fathers, with a view to facilitating improved support. eight fathers participated in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences of fathering children with asd. fathers described their experiences as a path towards acceptance, with independence and integration for their offspring being key goals. fathers saw themselves as advocates fighting obstructive services to access appropriate care. the value placed on formal and informal support varied, although the need for personalised support was emphasised. enabling fathers to see their experiences as a journey, whilst engaging them on the important topics of independence and integration, may improve their experience.
autism	what is known and objectivespsychopharmacologic therapy has so far focused on ameliorating disruptive behaviours to improve patient 's function and quality of life. due to the complicated neurobiological aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (asd), a traditional pharmacist intervention may be insufficient to initiate the optimal care for this vulnerable population. we evaluate the impact of providing specialty psychiatry (ps) pharmacist intervention in identifying and resolving drug-related problems (drps) among children with asd associated with disruptive behaviours. methodsan eight-week-long, prospective, randomized open-label study was conducted. children between 2.5 and 12years of age with asd and showing disruptive behaviours were included. they were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. patients in the intervention group received pharmacist interventions delivered by a ps pharmacist, while those in control group were cared by a hospital pharmacist. the primary outcome was the number of patients who resolved of at least one drp by the end of the study. the secondary outcome was to compare the mean aberrant behavior checklist-irritability (abc-i) scores between the two groups. resultstwenty-five patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. at week 8, the total number of patients who resolved of at least one drp was 13 (52%) in the intervention group and 4 (16%) in the control group, respectively (p=.016). improper drug selection, medication non-adherence and subtherapeutic dosage were the most common drps. mean abc-i scores improved in the intervention group more than in the control group (9.85.6 vs 17.7 +/- 7.9; p<.001). what is new and conclusionto the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrated that ps pharmacist intervention is an effective strategy to resolve drps in patient with asd. the reduction in common drps mostly resulted from the ps pharmacist interventions, including selection of antipsychotic agent, adjustment of dosage based on abc-i scores and provision of individualized drug counselling. reducing drps led to the improvement of any disruptive behaviour. in addition, multidisciplinary team should develop drug therapy protocols to promote the role of pharmacists in this setting.
osteoarthritis	purpose patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and osteoarthritis (oa) may require revision total knee replacement. few studies have compared post-operative complications, results and risk of re-revision in ra and oa patients. material and methods forty-five ra patients who had undergone revision tka from 1998 to 2010 were selected and matched with 45 oa patients who had revision during the same period. results of the use of a revision posterostabilized implant in osteoarthritis were compared to results of its use in inflammatory arthritis. with a mean follow-up of ten years (range, 5-17 years) we determined differences in comorbidities, risk for peri-operative adverse events, functional and radiological results, and risk of subsequent re-revision, between patients suffering from oa versus ra. results there were higher comorbidities, post-operative (<30 days) adverse events, and mortality at average ten years fu in ra than in oa patients. the mean overall changes in function scores were greater for the ra revision group when compared with the oa revision group. taking steroids (cox 's regression, p = 0.001), and methotrexate or tnf alpha blockers (cox 's regression, p = 0.02) were not significant factors for radiolucent lines in ra \and for loosening. at average ten years followup, patients with ra undergoing revision tkas were not more likely to have a re-revision (4 among 45 patients; 9 %) than patients with oa undergoing revision in our department (7 patients; 15 %). conclusions similar results for the knee were observed in these two forms of arthritis in spite of the fact that the initial local joint status and general health status are worse in inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis than in ""degenerative"" osteoarthritis. however, complications were more frequent with ra.
crohn's_disease	pseudopolyps are a well described entity in the literature and even though the exact pathogenesis of their formation is not completely understood, they are considered non-neoplastic lesions originating from the mucosa after repeated periods of inflammation and ulceration associated with excessive healing processes. their occurrence is less common in crohn 's disease than in ulcerative colitis, and their overall prevalence ranges from 4% to 74%; moreover, they are found more often in colon but have been detected in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract as well. when their size exceeds the arbitrary point of 1.5 cm, they are classified as giant pseudopolyps. clinical evaluation should differentiate the pseudopolyps from other polypoid lesions, such as the dysplasiaassociated mass or lesion, but this situation represents an ongoing clinical challenge. pseudopolyps can provoke complications such as bleeding or obstruction, and their management includes medical therapy, endoscopy and surgery; however, no consensus exists about the optimal treatment approach. patients with pseudopolyps are considered at intermediate risk for colorectal cancer and regular endoscopic monitoring is recommended. through a review of the literature, we provide here a proposed classification of the characteristics of pseudopolyps.
osteoporosis	growth differentiation factor 8 (gdf8), also called myostatin, is a member of the transforming growth factor (tgf)- super-family. as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, gdf8 is also associated with bone metabolism. however, the function of gdf8 in bone metabolism is not fully understood. our study aimed to investigate the role of gdf8 in bone metabolism, both in vitro and in vivo. our results showed that gdf8 had a negative regulatory effect on primary mouse osteoblasts, and promoted receptor activator of nuclear factor b ligand (rankl)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. intraperitoneal injection of recombinant gdf8 repressed bone formation and accelerated bone resorption in mice. furthermore, treatment of aged mice with a gdf8 neutralizing antibody stimulated new bone formation and prevented bone resorption. thus, our study showed that gdf8 plays a significant regulatory role in bone formation and bone resorption, thus providing a potential therapeutic pathway for osteoporosis.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: laboratory examination is a great value to confirm a diagnosis and estimate disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and ankylosing spondylitis (as). since little research related to the diagnosis of ra and as has been done in iran, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnosis markers in patients with ra and as. methods: this study was conducted among 104 patients with ra and 42 patients with as in iran during 2016. inclusion criteria were according to the american college of rheumatology (acr) and european league against rheumatism (eular) criteria. five ml blood samples were collected from all patients. laboratory studies consisted of esr and anti-ccp tests and also determination of the presence of rf and crp in these patients. finally, the statistical analysis test was conducted using spss version 16.0. results: the study patients with ra included 23 males (22.1%) and 81 females (77.9%) with the average age of 50.25 14.34. in ra patients, 82.7% were rf positive and 17.3% were negative. also, 49% were crp positive and 51% were negative. the mean esr in ra patients was 27.76 +/- 20.17 mm/hour. the mean levels of anti-ccp were 109.15 +/- 90.55 iu/ml. the mean ages of 42 patients with as, including 30 male (71.4%) and 12 females (28.6%), were 38.69 +/- 11.82 years. among them, 24 patients (57.1%) were positive for crp and 18 patients (42.9%) were negative. only 2 patients (4.8%) were rf positive. 24 patients (57.1%) were positive for hla-1127 and 18 patients (42.9%) were negative. the mean levels of esr in as patients were 30.30 +/- 26.98 mm/hour. conclusions: early diagnosis of the rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis can help to prevent complications and its progression and help patients to recover more quickly.
lymphoma	background: x-linked lymphoproliferative disease type i (xlp i) is caused by mutations in the sh2d1a gene and characterized mainly by hypogammaglobulinemia and abnormal response to epstein-barr virus with a high predisposition to b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma development. observations: in this article, we describe the experience of 2 centers in belarus and in russia that follow 3 male patients who were diagnosed with xlp i after lymphoma development and treatment. three novel mutations c.51g>c (p. e17d), c. 192g>t (p. w64c), and c. 53insa (p. k18kfsx67) were found in 3 males patients with xlp i. two of them did not have any signs of immunodeficiency before b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma development. conclusions: we propose sh2d1a mutational screening be considered in male patients with or without hypogammaglobulinemia who received rituximab treatment for lymphoma and did not recover immunoglobulin g in a year after b-depleting therapy.
hereditary_angioedema	introduction: hereditary angioedema due to c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae type i) or dysfunction (c1-inh-hae type ii) is a rare disease characterized by recurrent episodes of edema with an estimated frequency of 1: 50,000 in the global population without racial or gender differences. in this study we present the results of a nationwide survey of c1-inh-hae patients referring to 17 italian centers, the italian network for c1-inh-hae, itaca. methods: italian patients diagnosed with c1-inh-hae from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study. diagnosis of c1-inh-hae was based on family and/or personal history of recurrent angioedema without urticaria and on antigenic and/or functional c1-inh deficiency. results: 983 patients (53% female) from 376 unrelated families were included in this survey. since 1973, 63 (6%) patients diagnosed with c1-inh-hae died and data from 3 patients were missing when analysis was performed. accordingly, the minimum prevalence of hae in italy in 2013 is 920:59,394,000 inhabitants, equivalent to 1:64,935. compared to the general population, patients are less represented in the early and late decades of life: men start reducing after the 5th decade and women after the 6th. median age of patients is 45 (iq 28-57), median age at diagnosis is 26 years (iq 13-41). c1-inh-hae type 1 are 87%, with median age at diagnosis of 25 (13-40); type 2 are 13% with median age at diagnosis of 31 (iq 16-49). functional c1inh is <= 50% in 99% of patients. antigen c1inh is <= 50% in 99% of type 1. c4 is50% is95%. this parameter should be therefore considered for initial screening in differential diagnosis of angioedema.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd) is associated with difficulty in processing speech in a noisy background, but the neural mechanisms that underlie this deficit have not been mapped. to address this question, we used magnetoencephalography to compare the cortical responses between asd and typically developing (td) individuals to a passive mismatch paradigm. we repeated the paradigm twice, once in a quiet background, and once in the presence of background noise. we focused on both the evoked mismatch field (mmf) response in temporal and frontal cortical locations, and functional connectivity with spectral specificity between those locations. in the quiet condition, we found common neural sources of the mmf response in both groups, in the right temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (ifg). in the noise condition, the mmf response in the right ifg was preserved in the td group, but reduced relative to the quiet condition in asd group. the mmf response in the right ifg also correlated with severity of asd. moreover, in noise, we found significantly reduced normalized coherence (deviant normalized by standard) in asd relative to td, in the beta band (14-25 hz), between left temporal and left inferior frontal sub-regions. however, unnormalized coherence (coherence during deviant or standard) was significantly increased in asd relative to td, in multiple frequency bands. our findings suggest increased recruitment of neural resources in asd irrespective of the task difficulty, alongside a reduction in top-down modulations, usually mediated by the beta band, needed to mitigate the impact of noise on auditory processing. autism res2016,.

hereditary_angioedema	background: the consensus documents published to date on hereditary angioedema with c1 inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) have focused on adult patients. many of the previous recommendations have not been adapted to pediatric patients. we intended to produce consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with c1-inh-hae. methods: during an expert panel meeting that took place during the 9th c1 inhibitor deficiency workshop in budapest, 2015 (www.haenet.hu), pediatric data were presented and discussed and a consensus was developed by voting. results: the symptoms of c1-inh-hae often present in childhood. differential diagnosis can be difficult as abdominal pain is common in pediatric c1-inh-hae, but also commonly occurs in the general pediatric population. the early onset of symptoms may predict a more severe subsequent course of the disease. before the age of 1 year, c1-inh levels may be lower than in adults; therefore, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis after the age of one year. all neonates/infants with an affected cl-inh-hae family member should be screened for c1-inh deficiency. pediatric patients should always carry a c1-inh-hae information card and medicine for emergency use. the regulatory approval status of the drugs for prophylaxis and for acute treatment is different in each country. plasma-derived c1-inh, recombinant c1-inh, and ecallantide are the only agents licensed for the acute treatment of pediatric patients. clinical trials are underway with additional drugs. it is recommended to follow up patients in an hae comprehensive care center. conclusions: the pediatric-focused international consensus for the diagnosis and management of c1-inh-hae patients was created.
atopic_dermatitis	background/purpose: treatment of atopic dermatitis (ad) and psoriasis requires their differentiation from other eczematoid dermatitis and a determination of disease severity. however, both can be clinically difficult and the findings subjectively interpreted. we investigated the utility of in vivo autofluorescence (af) measurements for diagnosis of both diseases, and determination of severity. materials and methods: thirty patients with ad and 30 with psoriasis were recruited, together with sex- and age-matched patients with healthy skin. af intensity was measured using the ecoskin((r)) fluorescence video dermatoscope. in ad and psoriasis patients, af in non-sun-exposed lesional and non-lesional skin was measured. to identify the locations that reflect characteristics of ad, af was also measured at the other sites in the patients with ad. results: ad was associated with lower af and psoriasis with higher af intensity peaking around 620 nm. in addition, skin af intensity of each disease was associated with severity of lesion. conclusions: non-invasive measurement of skin af in vivo can aid in diagnosis of ad and psoriasis as well as in treatment monitoring.
dementia	sporadic alzheimer 's disease (sad) is a slowly progressive neurological disorder that is the most common form of dementia. cholinergic system dysfunction and amyloid beta formation are the two main underlying pathological mechanisms for the disease development. in recent studies, insulin receptor desensitization and disturbances in the downstream effects of insulin receptor signaling were observed in the brains of alzheimer 's patients. currently, intracereberoventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (stz) is found to induce behavioral, neurochemical, and structural alterations in animals resembling those found in sad patients. valproic acid (vpa), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (hdaci), was recently shown to regulate the transcription of several genes in both in vivo and in vitro models of alzheimer 's disease. the aim of the current study is to investigate the potential effect of different doses of valproic acid, in an icv-stz-induced animal model of sad. streptozotocin-injected mice showed cognitive and spatial memory dysfunction in the y-maze, object recognition test, and morris water maze (mwm) neurobehavioral tests. the mice also exhibited a decrease in acetylcholine (ach) and neprilysin (nep) levels accompanied by an increase in acetylcholinesterase (ache) activity. for the first time to our knowledge, our findings have shown that vpa is capable of restoring ach levels in icv-stz-injected mice, as well as normalizing both nep levels and ache activity. via this mechanism, an enhancement of cognitive functions is observed. thus, vpa is suggested to be a promising therapeutic approach against sad.
asthma	leukotrienes (lts) are a class of lipid mediators implicated in numerous inflammatory disorders. caffeic acid phenethyl ester (cape) possesses potent anti-lts activity through the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-lo), the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of lts. in this study, we describe the design and synthesis of cape analogs as radical scavengers and 5-lo inhibitors. caffeic esters bearing propargyl and allyl linkers between the caffeoyl and aryl moieties (4a-i and 5a-i, respectively) were synthesized by sonogashira and heck cross-coupling reactions to probe the effects of flexibility and aryl substitution on 5-lo inhibition. caffeoyl alcohol and ethers (6, 7a-b) as well as caffeoyl aldehyde and ketones (8a-e) were synthesized to elucidate the importance of the ester linkage for inhibitory activity. all tested compounds proved to be good radical scavengers (ic50 of 10-30 mu m). after preliminary anti-lts activity screening in hek293 cell models, 5-lo inhibition potential of selected compounds was determined in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl). most screened compounds outperformed cape 3 in concentration-dependent assays on pmnl, with ester dimers 4i and 5i along with caffeoyl ethers 7a-b being roughly eight-, seven-, and 16-fold more potent than zileuton, with ic50 values of 0.36, 0.43, and 0.18 mu m, respectively.
digestive_health	tropical fruits such as mango, papaya, pineapple and banana are rich sources of dietary fibre. however, few studies have examined the potential physiological effects of fibre from these tropical fruits. the aim of this study was to characterise the fermentability of dietary fibre found in banana, papaya, pineapple and mango as an estimate of the physiological effects of consuming these fruits. freeze-dried fruit was subjected to in vitro digestion to remove digestible carbohydrates. digestion residues were freeze-dried prior to fermentation. in vitro fermentation was carried for 24 h under anaerobic conditions to simulate conditions in the large intestine. gas volume, ph and short chain fatty acids (scfas) concentration were measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. scfas were analysed by gas chromatography. there was no gas production from 0 to 8 h time points for all samples. mango fibre resulted in more gas at 12 and 24 h than pineapple, papaya and banana fibres. the slurry ph was significantly lower for mango fibre at 12 and 24 h compared to other samples. mango fibre resulted in significantly more propionate at 8 h compared to papaya and pineapple fibres. butyrate concentrations were only significantly different at 4 h. at 24 h total and individual scfa production did not differ among samples. all fruit fibres were fermentable, with mango fibre being the most rapidly fermented. additional work is necessary to confirm a benefit on digestive health.
stress_management	background: although most organizations have comprehensive formal stress management programs, an approach that is most likely to be helpful is the one that is curtailed specifically to the needs of a particular nursing unit. with that aim in mind, a process of daily intensive care unit (icu) multidisciplinary operational debriefings was developed. these operational debriefings use the same concepts as traditional debriefing, yet are offered on a daily basis, rather than being reserved only for major stressful events. furthermore, they are informal, brief (15 minutes), and multidisciplinary (intensivists, icu nurses, chaplain, icu social worker, icu nutritionist, and icu pharmacist). the purpose of this descriptive study was to determine the perceptions of attendees in relation to the implementation of daily operational debriefings. methods: six months into the process, the attendees were requested to fill out an anonymous voluntary survey. questions were simple, straightforward, and close ended. results: of 47 potential respondents (42 nurses, 2 nurse managers, 1 social worker, 1 pharmacist, and 1 nutritionist), 42 completed the survey. results revealed that an overwhelming majority felt that daily operational debriefings provide an effective unit-based support system, a sense of connectedness, and a commitment to the well-being of others. nearly 50% of the respondents felt that the overall stress level in the icu decreased, and 98% indicated operational daily debriefings should continue. conclusion: daily informal multidisciplinary icu operational debriefing provides an effective support system for icu nurses. a modified model could be replicated for non-icu units as well.
addiction	background: pleiotrophin (ptn) is a cytokine found highly upregulated in the brain in different disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation such as neurodegenerative diseases, drug addiction, traumatic injury, and ischemia. in the present work, we have explored whether ptn modulates neuroinflammation and if toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), crucial in the initiation of an immune response, is involved. methods: in immunohistochemistry assays, we studied lipopolysaccharide (lps, 7.5 mg/kg i.p.)-induced changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap, astrocyte marker) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (iba1, microglia marker) expression in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) and striatum of mice with transgenic ptn overexpression in the brain (ptn-tg) and in wild-type (wt) mice. cytokine protein levels were assessed in the pfc by x-map technology. the influence of tlr4 signaling in lps effects in both genotypes was assessed by pretreatment with the tlr4 antagonist (tak-242, 3.0 mg/kg i.p.). murine bv2 microglial cells were treated with ptn (0.5 mu g/ml) and lps (1.0 mu g/ml) and assessed for the release of nitric oxide (no). results: we found that lps-induced microglial activation is significantly increased in the pfc of ptn-tg mice compared to that of wt mice. the levels of tnf-alpha, il-6, and mcp-1 in response to lps were significantly increased in the pfc of ptn-tg mice compared to that of wt mice. pretreatment with tak-242 efficiently blocked increases in cytokine contents in a similar manner in both genotypes. concomitant incubation of bv2 cells with lps and ptn significantly potentiated the production of no compared to cells only treated with lps. conclusions: our findings identify for the first time that ptn is a novel and potent regulator of neuroinflammation. pleiotrophin potentiates lps-stimulated microglia activation. our results suggest that regulation of the ptn signaling pathways may constitute new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased ptn cerebral levels and neuroinflammation.
psoriatic_arthritis	psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular risk factors and major adverse cardiovascular events (mace). active research is ongoing to elucidate this relationship between psoriatic diseases and cardiovascular comorbidities, as well as their shared pathogenic mechanisms. this review focuses on (1) the epidemiologic association between psoriasis and cardiovascular risk factors, (2) the epidemiologic association between psoriasis and mace, (3) the epidemiologic association between psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular risk factors, and mace, and (4) proposed mechanisms for the contribution of psoriatic diseases to cardiovascular diseases. the proposed mechanisms for shared pathogenesis between psoriatic diseases and cardiovascular diseases are inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. there is complex interplay and overlap among these mechanisms and their contributions to shared pathogenesis. future translational research is necessary to elucidate the link between psoriatic diseases and cardiovascular diseases. such findings may be applied clinically to improve the lives of psoriasis patients.
autism	introduction: young adults with autism spectrum disorders often face substantial difficulty finding and retaining paid employment. this study aimed at evaluating the usability of ready, set, work!, a video modeling application for use by adolescents with and without autism spectrum disorders, for participation in the vocational world, and to test whether it can discriminate between these two groups in terms of their response to simulated social dilemmas within vocational contexts. method: twenty adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and 20 typically developing adolescents, aged 16-21 years, were trained to use the application, followed by completion of two usability tools: the intrinsic motivation scale and a relevance questionnaire. result: both groups found the application to be useful and relevant as a job readiness tool. the autism spectrum disorders group had significantly greater difficulty in identifying adaptive and maladaptive responses (z = -2.74, p <= 0.05) and found the application to be more relevant compared to the control group (z = -1.69, p <= 0.05). conclusion: ready, set, work! appears to have good usability and social validity, suggesting the potential of this computerized video modeling tool to provide support for the acquisition and improvement of social vocational skills in adolescents in general and specifically in those with autism spectrum disorders.
smoking_cessation	alternative and complementary procedures were adopted for preparing 2-arylazetidine derivatives in moderate to good yields. preliminary biological evaluation of 2-arylazetidines as ligands of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors allowed to identify chloro-substituted analogs as the most interesting congeners. the title compounds may be considered as suitable hit compounds for developing new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands that may be safer than the currently available drugs targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. our described synthetic approaches enable facile access to a large number of diversely decorated azetidines for studying the structure-activity relationships and for refining the toxico-pharmacological profile of these agents.
psoriasis	although psoriatic nail lesions are small, they cause considerable discomfort for patients and adversely affect quality of life. few studies have evaluated the dermoscopic features of psoriatic nails. the aim of this study was to clarify the dermoscopic features of nail psoriasis and identify those that reflect psoriatic activity. during biologic treatment of psoriasis, six patients with psoriatic nails twice underwent dermoscopic examination, with an interval of 17-42 weeks. we used the modified nail psoriasis severity index score and psoriasis area and severity index score to identify and assess dermoscopic features. we identified 10 dermoscopic findings, of which disappearance of diffuse scaling of the nail plate, transverse step-like notches and splinter hemorrhages of the nail bed, and appearance of erythematous borders of the onycholytic area were associated with improvement in psoriasis area and severity index score. dermoscopy can detect nail changes during psoriasis treatment and should be used to evaluate treatment success.
stress_management	this paper reports on a proof-of-concept microelectromechanical system-based fabry-perot filter that is capable of electrically tuning within the long-wave infrared thermal imaging band of 8-12 mu m. the device employs a single-layer quarter-wavelength thick tensile germanium membrane for the suspended top mirror in order to achieve nanometer-scale as-released mirror flatness across an area of several hundred square micrometers without any extraneous stress management techniques. mechanical and optical characterization of the tunable filters of various sizes are presented and compared. a 200-mu m dimension square filter is demonstrated with <100-nm top mirror bowing and near-theoretical spectral characteristics across the entire tuning range of 8.5-11.5 mu m, namely, peak transmission above 80%, full-width at half-maximum of spectral passband of approximately 500 nm, and out-of-band rejection greater than 40:1. optical modeling shows that this filter can achieve a pixel-to-pixel transmission peak wavelength variation of less than 1.2% across the entire 200 mu m x 200-mu m optical imaging area. these results exceed the optical performance requirements for passive multispectral thermal imaging applications based on large-area focal plane arrays. in comparison, the 500 and 1000-mu m dimension filters are shown to exhibit significant mirror bowing with actuation and, thus, for a pixel-to-pixel transmission peak wavelength non-uniformity of <4%, demonstrate narrower usable spectral tuning ranges of 9.3-11.4 and 10.3-11.3 mu m, respectively. [2015-0252]
digestive_health	in this study, 160 hycole weaned rabbits (35 days old) were randomly divided into four groups of 40. the rabbits were studied throughout a 54-day experimentation period in order to determine the impact of dietary supplementation from herbs composed of 0.2%, 0.4% dry ground lythrum salicaria leaves (ls) and 0.3% cunirel((r)) (cr; a commercial herb mixture containing ls as the main ingredient) on performance, digestibility, health and meat quality. the basal diet was given to the control group. no significant differences were found in performance, 10 rabbits from each group were selected for evaluation regarding apparent digestibility. the rabbits fed the control diet and the diet with the low level of ls had a higher level of cp digestibility than did the animals that were supplemented with the high ls levels and cr (85.7% and 84.9% v. 84.0% and 84.0%, respectively; p<0.05). the ether extract digestibility was lower in the treatment group with 0.4%ls addition and cr as compared with the control group (52.2% and 54.5% v. 62.6%, respectively; p<0.05). the slaughter process was performed on 89-day-old rabbits to study the carcass characteristics, meat quality, blood parameters, caecal contents and gut histology. the total leukocyte counts in the control animals were lower than they were in the rabbits fed 0.2%, 0.4%ls and cr (4.06 v. 8.25, 8.63 and 8.21x10(9)/l, respectively; p<0.05). for caecal fermentation, the caecal contents of the rabbits fed 0.4% of ls, showed higher concentrations of total volatile fatty acid (vfa; 24.1 v. 18.9 mg/kg dry matter (dm); p<0.05) and acetic acid (18.3 v. 14.4 mg/kg dm; p<0.05), but lower ammonia levels (594 v. 892 mg/kg dm; p<0.05) as compared with the control group. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses were performed to evaluate the microbial community in hard faeces, collected at days 35, 42, 49, 56, 70 and 89, whereas the caecal contents were taken after slaughtering. the results demonstrated that between the treatment groups, the similarity of the microbial communities was higher as compared with the control group. moreover, only age was shown to influence microbiota diversity. in conclusion, the results of this study indicated that supplementation of ls in rabbit diets leads to an increase in the total white blood cells, total vfa and acetic acid concentration, and a decrease in the ammonia levels, as well as the digestibility when cr and high level of ls were supplemented, without causing any adverse effects on other parameters.
asthma	background: the rhinovirus c (rv-c), first identified in 2006, produce high symptom burdens in children and asthmatics, however, their primary target host cell in the airways remains unknown. our primary hypotheses were that rv-c target ciliated airway epithelial cells (aecs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known rv-c cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (cdhr3). methods: rv-c15 (c15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (hbec) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. morphology of c15-infected differentiated aecs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. results: c15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. the percentage of cells infected with c15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or muc5ac, p = ns). cdhr3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). c15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing cdhr3 (p < 0.01). during differentiation of aecs, cdhr3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both rv-c binding and replication. conclusions: the rv-c only replicate in ciliated aecs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. cdhr3 expression positively correlates with rv-c binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated aecs. our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and cdhr3 production may be important determinants of rv-c illness severity.
atrial_fibrillation	context: troponin t upstream open reading frame peptide (tntuorf) may be useful as a novel biomarker in acute cardiac syndromes.objective: the study examined the early release kinetics of tntuorf.materials and methods: we analyzed the time course of the release of cardiac troponins i and t and tntuorf in patients (n=31) with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy (tash).results: fifteen minutes after tash, the levels of both troponins increased significantly (ctnt median: 18ng/l versus 27ng/l; ctni median: 15ng/l versus 25ng/l). tntuorf showed no variation.discussion: we observed a significantly greater increase in ctni compared with ctnt.conclusion: our results demonstrate that troponin assays allow early detection of myocardial injury, whereas tntuorf levels remain unchanged in this setting.
autism	early experience and social context interact to alter the phenotype of complex social behaviors. these early experiences can also result in alterations to cortical organization and connections. given the ability of the neuropeptide oxytocin (ot) to modulate social and reproductive behavior, ot is likely involved in these cortical processes. however, little is known about the distribution of ot and ot receptors (otr) within the neocortex. using autoradiographic and neuroanatomical techniques, we characterized the cortical distribution of ot receptors (otr) in prairie voles, a socially monogamous rodent species. we found that otr density was low in the primary sensory areas (including primary somatosensory and auditory regions) but was quite high in association regions (including temporal and parietal association areas, and prelimbic regions). in the primary motor area as well as the temporal and parietal association areas, we observed differences in otr density across cortical layers. specifically, cortical layers 2/3 and 5 exhibited greater otr density than layer 4. our results point to a role for ot in integrating sensory and motor in the prairie vole brain, providing a complementary mechanism for the modulation of social interactions. given the ability of early social experience and developmental manipulations of ot to affect the brain and behavior, these results suggest a novel mechanism for how ot may influence cortical organization.

crohn's_disease	background the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) increases, and thus is more common, in pregnant women. ibd is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (vte) but it is not clear whether ibd predisposes women to an excess risk of vte during pregnancy and the postpartum period. methods this was a nationwide population-based cohort study of all deliveries during 1980-2013 in denmark, using data from two nationwide health registries: the danish national patient registry and the medical birth registry. we computed incidence rates (irs) per 1000 person-years, and crude and adjusted relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for vte during pregnancy and the first 12 postpartum weeks in women with and without ibd. results we included 1 046 754 women with 1 978 701 deliveries. we identified 3465 vte events during pregnancy and 1302 vte events postpartum. the ir for vte during pregnancy was 4.20 (95% ci, 2.83-5.58) in ibd patients and 2.41 (95% ci, 2.33-2.50) in women without ibd, corresponding to an rr of 1.72 (95% ci, 1.22-2.43). adjustment for maternal age and smoking (pregnancies during 1991-2013) yielded an adjusted rr of 1.67 (95% ci, 1.15-2.41). ibd flare was associated with an rr of 2.64 (95% ci, 1.69-4.14) for vte during pregnancy. the ir for postpartum vte was 7.03 (95% ci, 3.87-10.20) among ibd patients and 2.88 (95% ci, 2.72-3.04) in women without ibd, corresponding to an adjusted rr of 2.10 (95% ci, 1.33-3.30). conclusions ibd is a risk factor for vte during pregnancy and postpartum.
migraine	objectivesto assess the prevalence of specific headache disorders in a population older than 65 years seeking consultation due to memory problems or cognitive impairment. methodswe verified the occurrence of headache symptoms and the impact of headaches on daily life. headaches were classified as per the international classification of headache disorders, 2nd edition (ichd-2). all patients were screened with the mini-mental state examination (mmse), followed by the selective reminding test and neuroimaging. participants with severe cognitive impairment or dementia were excluded. resultsa total of 1,237 patients (51.6% women), with mean age of 75.6 years (sd=6.9) were screened from january 2006 to december 2014. of them, 302 (24.4%) patients suffered from headaches. most common individual diagnoses were probable migraine (13.8%), episodic tension-type headache (3.4%), and episodic migraine (3.0%). chronic migraine or probable chronic migraine happened in 3.5%, while chronic tension-type headache affected 0.6%. most patients with headaches routinely used symptomatic medications (55.6%). mean mmse scores were similar in patients with or without headaches, or with different headache diagnoses. conclusionsheadache disorders overall, frequent headaches, and headaches requiring treatment are commonly seen in the elderly seeking care for cognitive decline and should be properly assessed and managed.
bipolar_disorder	background: schizophrenia (sz) is often characterized by cognitive and intellectual impairment. however, there is much heterogeneity across individuals, suggesting different trajectories of the illness. recent findings have shown brain volume differences across subgroups of individuals with psychosis (sz and bipolar disorder), such that those with intellectual and cognitive impairments presented evidence of early cerebral disruption, while those with cognitive but not intellectual impairments showed evidence of progressive brain abnormalities. our aim was to investigate the relations of cognition and intellectual functioning with brain structure abnormalities in a sample of sz compared to unaffected individuals. methods: 92 individuals with sz and 94 healthy controls part of the northwestern university schizophrenia data and software tool (nusdast) underwent neuropsychological assessment and structural magnetic resonance imaging (mri). individuals with sz were divided into subgroups according their estimated premorbid crystallized intellectual (epmc-iq) and cognitive performance. brain volumes differences were investigated across groups. results: sz with epmc-iq and cognitive impairments had reduced total brain volume (tbv), intracranial volume (icv), tbv corrected for icv, and cortical gray matter volume, as well as reduced cortical thickness, and insula volumes. sz with cognitive impairment but intact epmc-iq showed only reduced cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness. conclusions: these data provide additional evidence for heterogeneity in sz. impairments in cognition associated with reduced epmc-iq were related to evidence of broad brain structural alterations, including suggestion of early cerebral disruption. in contrast, impaired cognitive functioning in the context of more intact intellectual functioning was associated with cortical alterations that may reflect neurodegeneration.
asthma	biomarkers may be a key foundation for the precision medicine of the future. in this article, we review current knowledge regarding biomarkers in difficult-to-treat asthma and their ability to guide the use of both conventional asthma therapies and novel (targeted) therapies. biomarkers (as measured by tests including prednisolone and cortisol assays and the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (no) suppression test) show promise in the assessment and management of nonadherence to inhaled and oral corticosteroids. multiple markers of type 2 inflammation have been developed, including eosinophils in sputum and blood, exhaled no, serum ige and periostin. although these show potential in guiding the selection of novel interventions for refractory type 2 inflammation in asthma, and in determining if the desired response is being achieved, it is becoming clear that different biomarkers reflect distinct components of the complex type 2 inflammatory pathways. less progress has been made in identifying biomarkers for use in difficult-to-treat asthma that is not associated with type 2 inflammation. the future is likely to see further biomarker discovery, direct measurements of individual cytokines rather than surrogates of their activity and the increasing use of biomarkers in combination. if the promise of biomarkers is to be fulfilled, they will need to provide useful information that aids clinical decision-making, rather than being 'just another test' for clinicians to order.
children's_health	maternal education differences in children 's academic skills have been strongly linked to parental investment behaviors. this study extended this line of research to investigate whether these same maternal education patterns in parenting are observed among a set of parenting behaviors that are linked to young children 's health. drawing on data from the early childhood longitudinal study, birth cohort (n = 5,000) and longitudinal models incorporating random effects, the authors found that higher levels of maternal education were associated with more advantageous health investment behaviors at each phase of early development (9 months, 2 years, 4 years, 5 years). moreover, these disparities were typically largest at the developmental stage when it was potentially most sensitive for children 's long-term health and development. these findings provide further evidence of a developmental gradient associated with mothers' education and new insight into the salience of mothers' education for the short- and long-term health and well-being of their children.
osteoporosis	the components of renin-angiotensin system (ras) are expressed in the kidney and bone. kidney disease and bone injury are common complications associated with diabetes. this study aimed to investigate the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on the kidney and bone of db/db mice. the db/db mice were orally administered.by gavage with captopril for 8 weeks with db/+ mice as the non-diabetic control. serum and urine biochemistries were determined by standard colorimetric methods or elisa. histological measurements were performed on the kidney by periodic acid-schiff staining and on the tibial proximal metaphysis by safranin 0 and masson-trichrome staining. trabecular bone mass and bone quality were analyzed by microcomputed tomography. quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting were applied for molecular analysis on mrna and protein expression. captopril significantly improved albuminuria and glomerulosderosis in db/db mice, and these effects might be attributed to the down-regulation of angiotensin ii expression and the expression of its down-stream profibrotic factors in the kidney, like connective tissue growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus markedly increased in db/db mice in response to captopril. treatment with captopril induced a decrease in bone mineral density and deterioration of trabecular bone at proximal metaphysis of tibia in db/db mice, as shown in the histological and reconstructed 3-dimensional images. even though captopril effectively reversed the diabetes-induced changes in calcium-binding protein 28-k and vitamin d receptor expression in the kidney as well as the expression of ras components and bradykinin receptor-2 in bone tissue, treatment with captopril increased the osteoclast-covered bone surface, reduced the osteoblast-covered bone surface, down-regulated the expression of type 1 collagen and transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (markers for osteoblastic functions), and up-regulated the expression of carbonic anhydrase ii (marker for bone resorption). captopril exerted therapeutic effects on renal injuries associated with type 2 diabetes but worsened the deteriorations of trabecular bone in db/db mice: the latter of which was at least in part due to the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis and the suppression of osteogenesis by captopril.

stress_management	introduction: although several methods are developed to alleviate stress among college students, logistic limitations in adopting them have limited their utility. aim: hence, we aimed to test a very practical approach to alleviate stress among college students by achieving vestibular stimulation using swings. materials and methods: in this study 60 male and female participants were randomly assigned into vestibular stimulation or control groups. depression, anxiety, stress scores, sleep quality, heart rate, blood pressure, autonomic functions, respiratory, haematological, cognitive function, quality of life were recorded before and after 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th days of vestibular stimulation. results: stais and stait scores were significantly improved on day 28th following vestibular stimulation. diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased and remained within normal limits in vestibular group on day 28th following vestibular stimulation. postural fall in blood pressure was significantly improved on day 14 onwards, following vestibular stimulation. respiratory rate was significantly improved on day 7 onwards, following vestibular stimulation. psqi sleep disturbance, psqi sleep latency, psqi total score and bleeding time was significantly improved following vestibular stimulation. conclusion: our study supports the adoption of vestibular stimulation for stress management. hence, placement of swings in college campuses must be considered, which may be a simple approach to alleviate stress among college students.
addiction	glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and its actions are related to the behavioral effects of psychostimulant drugs. in the last two decades, basic neuroscience research and preclinical studies with animal models are suggesting a critical role for glutamate transmission in drug reward, reinforcement, and relapse. although most of the interest has been centered in post-synaptic glutamate receptors, the presynaptic synthesis of glutamate through brain glutaminases may also contribute to imbalances in glutamate homeostasis, a key feature of the glutamatergic hypothesis of addiction. glutaminases are the main glutamate-producing enzymes in brain and dysregulation of their function have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders; however, the possible implication of these enzymes in drug addiction remains largely unknown. this mini-review focuses on brain glutaminase isozymes and their alterations by in vivo exposure to drugs of abuse, which are discussed in the context of the glutamate homeostasis theory of addiction. recent findings from mouse models have shown that drugs induce changes in the expression profiles of key glutamatergic transmission genes, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate drug-induced neuronal sensitization and behavioral plasticity are not clear.
migraine	the goals of this study are to characterize the temporal dynamics of inter-regional connectivity of the brain in chronic headache (ch) patients versus their age/gender matched controls (conch, n = 28 pairs), and to determine whether dynamic measures reveal additional features to static functional connectivity and correlate with psychometric scores. cortical thickness and inter-regional resting state fmri connectivity were quantified and compared between ch and conch groups. six cortical regions of interest (roi) pairs that exhibited correlated cortical thickness and static functional connectivity abnormalities were selected for temporal dynamic analysis. two methods were used: temporal sliding-window (sw) and wavelet transformation coherence (vvtc). sw analyses using three temporal windows of 30, 60, 120 s revealed that all six roi pairs of ch exhibited higher percentage of strong connectivity (high r values), and smaller fast fourier transform (fft) amplitudes at a very low frequency range (i.e., 0.002-0.01 hz), compared to those of conch. these features were particularly prevalent in the 120 s window analysis. less variable dynamic fluctuation (i.e., smaller standard deviation of r values) was identified in two out of six roi pairs in ch. wtc analysis revealed that time-averaged coherence was generally greater in ch than conch between wavelet decomposition scales 20 to 55 (0.018-0.05 hz), and was statistically significant in three out of six roi pairs. together, the most robust and significant differences in temporal dynamics between ch and conch were detected in two roi pairs: left medial-orbitofrontal left posterior-cingulate and left medial-orbitofrontal left inferior-temporal. the high degrees of sleep disturbance (high psqi score), depression (high hrsd score) and fatigue (low sf-36 score) were associated with high degree of inter-regional temporal coherence in ch. in summary, these dynamic functional connectivity (dfc) measures uncovered a temporal ""lock-down"" condition in a subset of roi pairs, showing static functional connectivity changes in ch patients. this study provides important evidence for the presence of associated psychological wellbeing and abnormal temporal dynamics in between specific cortical regions in ch patients.

asthma	objective: immune responses can change with exercise. we aimed to show the changes in cytokine levels pre-and post-exercise in patients with asthma. methods: in this prospective control trial, data of 32 patients with asthma that was under control were classified into two groups, pre-and post-exercise. serum il-1 beta and monocyte il-1 beta, il-2, and il-10 expressions were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the patients were advised to walk for at least 30 min for 4 days/week for 12 weeks. results: there was no significant difference in demographic properties of the participants. monocyte il-1 beta levels in the pre-and post-exercise groups were 1.99 +/- 0.35 and 1.01 +/- 0.22 pg/ml, respectively (p=0.003). il-10 levels in the pre-and post-exercise groups were 1.64 +/- 0.02 and 1.21 +/- 0.03 pg/ml, respectively (p=0.04). il-2 levels in the pre-and post-exercise groups were 0.64 +/- 0.045 and 0.32 +/- 0.09 pg/ml, respectively (p=0.001). however, there was a significant difference in serum il-1 beta and monocyte il-1 beta, il-2, and il-10 levels between the groups (p=0.02, p=0.003, p=0.04, and p=0.001, respectively). conclusion: systemic inflammatory parameters that are commonly elevated in asthma may improve by exercise. the elucidation of the mechanism of immune control in patients with asthma is useful for the future treatment of asthma.
smoking_cessation	purpose: tobacco/nicotine dependence has a significant heritable component. genome-wide association studies have associated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) rs578776, rs16969968, rs6474412, rs3733829 and rs4105144 with nicotine dependence in western european populations. we examined whether these snps influence nicotine dependence and successful treatment of tobacco dependence in the czech middle-european population. materials and methods: variants were analysed by pcr-rflp or by taqman assay in 807 adult heavy tobacco-dependent smokers - patients of the centre for treatment of tobacco dependence (prague) as well as 1,362 self reported non-smokers. results and discussion: except for rs3733829, association with tobacco dependence was confirmed for all other genetic variants. in agreement with previous studies, the strongest determinant of tobacco dependence was rs16969968 with or (95%ci) 1.32 (1.08-1.62) for a allele carriers vs. gg comparison (p = 0.003). in contrast, none of the analysed variants reached significance with respect to a 1-year course of successful tobacco dependence treatment (all p over 0.18) in a subset of 525 patients. conclusion: we confirmed the association between variants within genes that code nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors (-a3,-a5 and-b3), cyp2a6/b6 and tobacco dependence development in the czech population. the success of the tobacco dependence treatment was not influenced by the analysed snps.

children's_health	literature on children 's internal body knowledge has consistently indicated that knowledge about the body develops in an orderly sequence with increasing age. how much children currently know about their internal organs, however, may be influenced by the increase in health and body information available through school education programmes. as there is little recent research in this area, the present study aimed to provide an update on what australian children currently understand about their anatomy, and to corroborate the developmental trends found in previous research. one hundred and eighty-nine school children aged 7 to 12 years were asked to draw the interior of the body in a body outline provided, with a subset of 54 children also being interviewed about their understanding of their anatomy. the developmental trends found in this study were broadly consistent with those reported in the existing literature on children 's inside body knowledge, and are similar to those documented with children 's human figure drawing; namely, that children 's body knowledge and understanding increased with age. although awareness of the integration of internal body parts amongst children in the present study seemed more developed than suggested in previous studies, the availability of educational resources influencing children 's knowledge about their internal organs remains equivocal. nevertheless, this research has relevance for those involved in children 's health awareness and education, as well as direct implications for paediatric health care procedures.
hereditary_angioedema	hereditary angioedema (hae) is accompanied by an overproduction of bradykinin (bk) as the primary mediator of swelling. although many proteins may be involved in regulating the wide spectrum of hae symptoms, most studies have only focused on c1-inh and fxii. for the first time, a next generation sequencing (ngs) method was applied to develop a robust, time- and cost-effective diagnostic and research tool to analyze selected genes related to hae. the entire coding region and the exon-intron boundaries of 15 genes from 23 subjects of a brazilian family, nine of whom were symptomatic, were analyzed by ngs. one new mutation found uniquely in the nine symptomatic patients, p.ala457pro in the serping1 gene, was estimated as likely to be pathogenic -(polyphen-2 software analysis) and is the main candidate to be responsible for hae in these patients. alterations identified in a few asymptomatic individuals but also found in almost all symptomatic patients, such as p.ile197met (hmwk), p. glu298asp (nos3) and p.gly354glu (b2r), may also be involved in modulating patient-specific symptoms. this ngs gene panel has proven to be a valuable tool for a quick and accurate molecular diagnosis of hae and efficient to indicate modulators of hae symptoms.
hereditary_angioedema	objective: hereditary angioedema due to c1 inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the serping1 gene. it can affect many regions in the body, but potentially life-threatening laryngeal oedemas are of concern.methods: twenty-three subjects from two families were recruited for clinical data evaluation and molecular analysis at general hospital sibenik, croatia.results: decreased levels of c1 inhibitor were detected in 12 adult patients and three young asymptomatic persons. the same novel deletion of two nucleotides on exon 3 (c.74_75delat) was identified in all of them. a history of laryngeal oedema was present in 10 patients (83%), and all patients reported laryngeal attacks at least once a year. the delay in diagnosis decreased noticeably from the first to the last generation.conclusions: we identified a novel causative mutation in serping1 in several affected members of two apparently unrelated families with a high frequency of laryngeal oedema. molecular analysis of large c1-inh-hae families will provide new insights on the genotype-phenotype relationship.key messageshereditary angioedema due to c1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the serping1 gene, and laryngeal oedema is of concern because it can cause death by asphyxiation.a novel causative mutation in serping1, a deletion of two nucleotides on exon 3 (c.74_75delat), was identified in several affected members of two apparently unrelated families with a high frequency of laryngeal oedema.molecular analysis of large c1-inh-hae families will provide new insights on the genotype-phenotype relationship because it appears that the mutation type may affect disease severity.
mental_health	the present study investigated a profile-based perspective of six dimensions of character strengths (i.e., heart strengths, heart/self-focused strengths, heart/others-focused strengths, mind strengths, mind/self-focused strengths, and mind/others-focused strengths), with the aim of identifying an optimal combination of peterson 's (2006) character strengths. a second aim was to examine whether profile membership was associated with mental health markers. we predicted that at least two qualitatively distinct profiles would emerge: the ""heart"" strengths profile and the ""mind"" strengths profile. we also predicted that a ""heart"" strengths profile would be more strongly associated with markers of mental health than a ""mind"" strengths profile. respondents (n = 595, m-age = 34.11 years, sd = 13.18) completed measures assessing endorsement of character strengths and a range of mental health markers. a latent profile analysis identified an optimal 4-profile solution based on these six dimensions of strengths. emergent profiles were profile 1 (low strengths), profile 2 (mind strengths), profile 3 (heart strengths), and profile 4 (high strengths). as expected, profile membership was significantly associated with mental health markers. notably, strengths of the heart (e.g., zest, hope, kindness) contributed to more favorable presentations. therefore, cultivating strengths associated with the heart dimension might enhance mental health.

osteoarthritis	non-invasive techniques for quantifying early biochemical and biomechanical changes in articular cartilage may provide a means of more precisely assessing osteoarthritis (oa) progression. the goals of this study were to determine the relationship between t1 rho magnetic resonance (mr) imaging relaxation times and changes in cartilage composition, cartilage mechanical properties, and synovial fluid biomarker levels and to demonstrate the application of t1rho imaging to evaluate cartilage composition in human subjects in vivo. femoral condyles and synovial fluid were harvested from healthy and oa porcine knee joints. sagittal t1rho relaxation mr images of the condyles were acquired. oa regions of oa joints exhibited an increase in t1rho relaxation times as compared to non-oa regions. furthermore in these regions, cartilage sgag content and aggregate modulus decreased, while percent degraded collagen and water content increased. in oa joints, synovial fluid concentrations of sgag decreased and c2c concentrations increased compared to healthy joints. t1rho relaxation times were negatively correlated with cartilage and synovial fluid sgag concentrations and aggregate modulus and positively correlated with water content and permeability. additionally, we demonstrated the application of these in vitro findings to the study of human subjects. specifically, we demonstrated that walking results in decreased t1rho relaxation times, consistent with water exudation and an increase in proteoglycan concentration with in vivo loading. together, these findings demonstrate that cartilage mr imaging and synovial fluid biomarkers provide powerful non-invasive tools for characterizing changes in the biochemical and biomechanical environments of the joint.

medicare	motivated by a collaborative study with one of the most comprehensive ocular imaging programs in the united states, we investigate the underlying three-way trade-off among operational, clinical, and financial considerations in physicians' decisions about ordering imaging tests. laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients' waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients'waiting times. we use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician 's decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. our further analysis reveals the following: (i) whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) the joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. these and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. we enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage. our findings have implications for other healthcare settings with similar trade-offs.
lymphoma	objective the last large study of second primary tumors (spts) in women with ovarian cancer was published in 1996, prior to major changes in the differential diagnosis and treatment. the present study reports on the incidence of spts in a contemporary cohort of patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. methods ovarian cancer patients with a diagnosis of an ovarian malignancy between 1992 and 2012 were identified and characterized from 13 registries of the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. results of 41,073 women with a diagnosis of an ovarian malignancy between 1992 and 2012, 1831 (4.5%) developed a microscopically confirmed spt. there was no significant difference in the risk of developing an spt at all sites between women with an ovarian cancer and the general population. there was an elevated risk of site-specific spts of the small intestine, vagina, thyroid gland, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in ovarian cancer patients compared with the general surveillance, epidemiology, and end results population. conversely, the risk of lung and non-hodgkin lymphoma was significantly decreased in women with ovarian cancer. an elevated risk of spts was observed in women with mucinous, endometrioid, and germ cell tumors. white women had an overall decreased risk of developing a second primary solid tumor, whereas american indian and asian/pacific islander women had an overall increased risk of an spt at any site. conclusions the incidence of spts in women with ovarian cancer was not significantly different as compared with the general population. however, divergent rates of spts in relation to histology, latency, age, and race were observed.
osteoarthritis	this study addresses a topic that was previously unaddressed in the literature: the normal sonographic appearance of the hoffa 's fat pad (hfp) in young, asymptomatic subjects. the aim of the study is to describe the sonoanatomical features of hfp, including its echostructure, echogenicity, elasticity, and vascularization, in subjects without knee pathology. knees of healthy subjects were examined with grayscale ultrasound (us) to determine the sonographic characteristics of the hfp. echogenicity was assessed by pixel intensity quantification. vascularity was evaluated by color doppler (cd) us. elasticity of the adipose tissue was examined by sonoelastography. the absence of hfp pathology was confirmed clinically in all participants and by magnetic resonance imaging in randomly selected participants. seventy-two knees from 36 subjects were assessed. the hfp presented a characteristic well-defined two-layered echostructure: the superficial adipose tissue was hypoechoic with respect to the nearby patellar tendon and contained septae, whereas the deeper layer was homogeneously hypoechoic and lacked connective tissue septae. echogenicity differed between the superficial and deeper layers (the deeper layer was brighter), suggesting that the degree of acoustic impedance differed between layers. cd detected blood flow in 55.5% of hfps. the superficial hfp layer presented greater elasticity than the deeper hfp layer (88.8 vs. 75.3 kpa; p < .001). our study provides a comprehensive description of the normal sonographic features of the hfp, which is useful to increase the potential of us for the discrimination of pathological findings involving this anatomical area.
autism	experimental intervention studies constitute the current dominant research designs in the autism education field. such designs are based on a knowledge-transfer' model of evidence-based practice in which research is conducted by researchers, and is then transferred' to practitioners to enable them to implement evidence-based interventions. while these research designs contribute important knowledge, they lead to a gap between what the research evidence may prescribe and what happens in practice, with a concomitant disparity between the priorities of researchers and practitioners. this paper discusses findings from the esrc-funded shape' project, which adopted a different model of evidence-based practice, focusing on knowledge co-construction. pupils (n=8), teachers (n=10), a speech and language therapist and a parent in three different school communities investigated creative ways in which children 's social communication skills could be enhanced through technology use. through a participatory methodology, digital stories were used as a method to enable engagement with the practical realities of the classroom and empower practitioners to construct and share their own authentic narratives. participants articulated precise knowledge about the learning opportunities afforded to them and their pupils through quality interactions that were mediated by the technologies, as evidenced through digital stories. the shape project shows that it is feasible to develop methodologies that enable genuine knowledge co-construction with school practitioners, parents and pupils. such co-construction could offer realistic opportunities for pedagogical emancipation and innovation in evidence-based practice as an alternative to the currently dominant and narrow model of knowledge transfer.
anxiety	dipyrone (metamizole), a powerful drug, is widely used as an analgesic and antipyretic; however, the safety of its use during lactation and the potential impact on the offspring are not well established. this study aimed to determine the effect of maternal dipyrone treatment during lactation on offspring development and emotional behavior and on the dam 's maternal behavior. hence, on postnatal day (pnd) 2, drinking water only or drinking water containing dipyrone at doses of 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg/day, were offered to lactating mothers up to pnd9. thereafter, all mice were provided regular drinking water. on pnd2, all litters were culled to 8 pups (4 males and 4 females). maternal behavior was evaluated at pnd3, 6, 9, and 12, and at pnd7 we evaluated locomotor activity in the open field. reflex parameters and physical development of offspring were evaluated during lactation. at pnd7, analysis of ultrasonic vocalization (usv) was performed. when the animals reached adolescence, we evaluated their performance in the open field, elevated plus maze (epm), and marble burying. our data demonstrated that maternal dipyrone treatment during lactation not only altered maternal behavior and the onset of physical and neurodevelopmental landmarks but also had an impact on anxiety-like behavior in offspring.

children's_health	the chernobyl nuclear accident, which occurred on april 26th, 1986, resulted in widespread long-term contamination, mainly due to cs-137, of large territories where populations live. a project was initiated to assess the cs-137 body burden and health status, not limited to radiation-induced pathologies, for all children living in a highly contaminated district in belarus; the aim was to provide detailed information for parents worried about their children 's health, without the intention of quantifying the radiation-induced risk. in total, about 2500 children benefited from these check-ups, which included approximately 30 parameters and were repeated three times between 2005 and 2009. the internal cs-137 burden was rather low; about 50% of children had less than 10 bq kg(-1). the health indicators reported in this paper are the global health status, physical development, and frequencies of thyroid modifications and cardiac dysfunctions. the cs-137 body burden or density deposition did not appear to be strongly associated with these health indicators; other parameters, such as quality of living conditions and rural or urban residence, appeared to be more important. the aim of the project was achieved, as the results provided a global overview of the health status and level of internal contamination of children living in a contaminated territory about 20 years after the accident.
osteoarthritis	background: numerous surgical options exist to treat chondral lesions in the knee, including microfracture (mfx), osteochondral autograft transplantation (oat), first-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (aci-1), and next-generation aci (aci-2). purpose: to compare the cost-effectiveness of mfx, oat, and aci-1. the secondary purpose of this study was to compare the functional outcomes of mfx, oat, aci-1, and aci-2. study design: systematic review; level of evidence, 2. methods: two independent reviewers conducted an online literature search of 2 databases for level 1 and 2 studies using the lysholm, international knee documentation committee (ikdc), knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (koos), and/or hospital for special surgery (hss) knee score. a weighted mean difference in pre- to postoperative functional outcome score was calculated for each treatment. the mean per-patient costs associated with mfx, oat, and aci-1 were determined from a recent publication based on review of a national private insurance database. the cost for each procedure was then divided by the weighted mean difference in functional outcome score to give the cost-per-point change in outcome score. results: a total of 12 studies (6 level 1, 6 level 2) met the inclusion criteria for the functional outcome analysis, including 730 knees (mfx, n = 300; oat, n = 90; aci-1, n = 68; aci-2, n = 272). the mean follow-up was not significantly different between groups (mfx, 29.4 months; oat, 38.3 months; aci-1, 19.0 months; aci-2, 26.7 months). the mean increase in functional outcome score was 23 for mfx, 19 for oat, 20 for aci-1, and 35 for aci-2. the change in functional outcome score was significantly greater for aci-2 when compared with all other treatments (p < .0001). the cost-per-point change in functional outcome score was $200.59 for mfx, $313.84 for oat, and $536.59 for aci-1. conclusion: mfx, oat, aci-1, and aci-2 are effective surgical procedures for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee. all 4 treatments led to an increase in functional outcome scores postoperatively with a short-term follow-up. aci-2 had a statistically greater improvement in functional outcome scores as compared with the other 3 procedures. mfx was found to be the most cost-effective treatment option and aci-1 the least cost-effective.
digestive_health	a general idea of probiotics is given with some links to the dietary fibre. human beings must be associated with microorganisms. the skin has hundreds grams of bacteria although, more surprisingly, the gastric tract is calculated to have i kg of microorganisms, the so-called intestinal flora. in other words, it is up to 10(11-12)/g of faeces. the most dominant genera (10(9-11)/g faeces) belonging to class i are anaerobic bacteria including bifidobacteria. group ii includes facultative bacteria and their numbers are relatively low (10(5-8)/g faeces). the fewest bacteria such as pathogenic clostridium perfringens and e. coli belong to class iii (mitsuoka., 1975). the small intestine possesses relatively low numbers of bacteria. however, this organ is very important because of a particular immune trap for bacteria, peyer 's patch scattering over the area. the large intestine is the largest house for the microbes. aging is known to invite a significant reduction in bifidobacteria, the most beneficial bacteria. diet influences the intestinal flora balance as well. probiotic bacteria should belong to group w. they are usually transient bacteria and proven to give beneficial effects on both digestive and immune systems. for example, bifidobacterium breve strain yakult improved the growth of preterm infants (kitajima et al., 1997). lactobacillus casei shirota was reported to improve the constipation (koebnick et al., 2001), and to increase natural killer cell activity. in this streamline, a habitual intake of this probiotic strain was reported to reduce the risk of bladder cancer (aso et al., 1995, ohashi et al., 2002). in addition there are many reports of other probiotic strains improving digestive health (duggan et al., 2002).
medicare	objective: to evaluate the relationship between hospital teaching intensity, medicare payments, and perioperative outcomes. background: several emerging payment policies penalize hospitals for low-value healthcare. teaching hospitals may be at a disadvantage given the perception that they deliver care less efficiently. methods: using medicare provider and analysis review files, we studied patients from age 65 to 100 years who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) repair (n = 71,422), pulmonary resection (n = 93,056), or colectomy (n = 277,619) from 2009 to 2012. patients' hospitals were categorized into quintiles of teaching intensity (very major, major, minor, very minor, and nonteaching hospitals) based on the resident-to-bed ratio. risk-adjusted 30-day medicare payments were price-standardized to account for graduate medical education payments, disproportionate share costs, and regional wage-index adjustments. risk-adjusted perioperative outcomes were also assessed. results: comparing risk-adjusted medicare payments per episode of surgery, very major teaching hospitals were $14,145 more expensive than nonteaching hospitals for aaa repair ($45,570 vs $31,426; p < 0.001), $9,812 more expensive for pulmonary resection ($39,550 vs $29,738; p < 0.001), and $19,147 more expensive for colectomy ($51,893 vs $32,746; p < 0.001). however, after accounting for social subsidies and regional variation in medicare spending, risk-adjusted medicare payments were not statistically different between very major teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals for aaa repair ($29,946 vs $27,993; p = 0.18) and pulmonary resection ($25,407 vs $26,813; p = 1.00); a statistically significant but attenuated difference persisted for colectomy ($34,949 vs $30,352; p < 0.001). very major teaching hospitals generally had higher risk-adjusted rates of serious complications and readmissions, but lower risk-adjusted rates of failure to rescue and 30-day mortality than did nonteaching hospitals. conclusions: after price-standardization to account for intended differences in medicare spending, risk-adjusted medicare payments for an episode of surgical care were similar at teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals for three complex inpatient operations.
stress_management	this study examines the associations between health and stress management (hsm) practices and mental-health disability claims. data from the salveo study was collected during 2009-2012 within 60 workplaces nested in 37 companies located in canada (quebec) and insured by a large insurance company. in each company, 1 h interviews were conducted with human resources managers in order to obtain data on 63 hsm practices. companies and workplaces were sorted into the low-claims and high-claims groups according to the median rate of the population of the insurer 's corporate clients. logistic regression adjusted for design effect and multidimensional scaling was used to analyse the data. after controlling for company size and economic sector, task design, demands control, gratifications, physical activity and work-family balance were associated with low mental-health disability claims rates. further analyses revealed three company profiles that were qualified as laissez-faire, integrated and partially integrated approaches to hsm. of the three, the integrated profile was associated with low mental-health disability claims rates. the results of this study provide evidence-based guidance for a better control of mental-health disability claims. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
medicare	background: antipsychotic medications are widely used to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia. however, studies have shown that antipsychotic use in patients with dementia is associated with risk of side effects.aims: the aim of this study is to examine antipsychotic prescribing patterns for beneficiaries with dementia enrolled in a medicare advantage program and identify opportunities to improve prescribing practices.methods: this study includes medicare advantage beneficiaries who were 65 years of age or older with dementia. we examined the number of participants that were prescribed an antipsychotic medication. descriptive analysis was performed, and logistic regression models were used to describe the correlates of antipsychotic exposure.results: of the 8688 individuals in the medicare advantage population with a dementia diagnosis, 1061 (12.2%) received an antipsychotic medication. correlates of receiving an antipsychotic medication included older age, dual eligibility for medicare and medicaid, and having a co-morbid diagnosis of depressive disorder or substance use disorder. being female was associated with decreased antipsychotic medication use. regional variations were also noted.conclusions: care management programs under medicare advantage have opportunities to address behavioral health needs of older adults with dementia and to limit inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications.
psoriasis	objective: zeneo(1) is a needle-free injection device. we performed a pharmacokinetic study to investigate the bioequivalence of methotrexate administered subcutaneously using either the needle-free injection device or a conventional needle and syringe. research design and methods: this was a single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blind, randomized crossover study performed in adult healthy volunteers. each participant received two methotrexate injections (each 25mg), one via needle-free injection device and one via conventional injection, with a 21-28day wash-out interval between dosing. for each participant, the administration site for both injections was either the abdomen or the thigh. main outcome measures: the primary pharmacokinetic outcome parameters were auc((0-t)) and c-max. bioequivalence was assessed by standard criteria: whether 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean ratios for the two administration methods were within 80-125%. results: fifty-two individuals completed the study. bioequivalence criteria were met for auc((0-t)), for the overall analysis (both injection sites: 90% confidence interval: 99.4-103.1%), and for each injection site separately. bioequivalence was similarly demonstrated with auc((0-)). bioequivalence criteria for c-max were fulfilled for abdominal administration but not for the overall analysis. injection via the needle-free injection device was well tolerated.limitations: limitations include conducting the study in healthy volunteers and the relatively small subject number (albeit satisfactory for bioequivalence). conclusions: this study shows that methotrexate injection via needle-free injection device is bioequivalent to a conventional needle and syringe in relation to auc((0-t)) and auc((0-)). studies of needle-free injection device use in patients requiring methotrexate therapy are planned.
atrial_fibrillation	background: atrial fibrillation (af) is difficult to treat effectively, owing to uncertainty in where to best ablate to eliminate arrhythmogenic substrate. a model providing insight into the electrical activation events would be useful to guide catheter ablation strategy. method a two-dimensional, 576x576 node automaton was developed to simulate atrial electrical activity. the substrate field was altered by the presence of differing refractory period at varying locations. fibrosis was added in the form of short, randomly positioned lines of conduction block. larger areas of block were used to simulate ablation lesions. anisotropy was imposed in a 2:1 ratio. a premature electrical impulse from one of four grid corners was utilized to initiate activation. results: rotational activity was uninducible when refractory patch dimensions were less than 20x20 mm. for larger refractory regions, a single premature stimulus was capable of inducing an average of 1.19 +/- 1.10 rotors, which often formed near the patch edges. a maximum of 5 rotors formed when refractory patch dimensions approached the size of the entire left atrial virtual field. rotors formed along a refractory patch edge, after wavefront arrival was delayed at turning points or due to the presence of a fiber cluster of sufficient size. however, rotational activity could also occur around a large fiber cluster without the need of spatially variable refractoriness. when obstacles to conduction were lacking in size, nascent rotors drifted and either extinguished, or stabilized upon anchoring at a sufficiently large fiber cluster elsewhere in the field. transient rotors terminated when traversing a region with differing refractory periods, if no obstacle to conduction was present to sufficiently delay wavefront arrival beyond the longest refractory period. other rotors were annihilated when a nearby rotor with faster spin rate gradually interrupted the activation pathway. elimination of anchors by removal, or by simulated ablation over a sufficient region, prevented rotor onset at a particular location where it would otherwise form. conclusions: the presence of obstacles to conduction and spatial differences in refractory period are important parameters for initiating and maintaining rotational activity in this simulation of an atrial substrate.
asthma	to assess the association of indoor environmental risk factors with respiratory function among adults in an acid rain-plagued city in china where coal use is frequent. the subjects were randomly selected in the winter season. information on selected home environmental factors was collected through administered questionnaires. additionally, pulmonary function tests, including forced vital capacity (fvc), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1), fev1/fvc and peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) were also performed in participants. this study showed that, among a variety of risk factors, coal fuel use, cooking oil fumes and active and passive smoking exposure together with asthma in childhood were important factors for deterioration of pulmonary function among adults in the winter season (p < 0.05). additionally, subjects whose kitchen was located in the living room or bedroom, who opened their windows only occasionally or never, who noted the presence of cooking oil fumes and pests, whose bedroom was shared by 3 or more residents and who kept pets tended to exhibit lower values of fvc, fev1 and pefr values compared with non-exposed counterparts (p < 0.05). this study demonstrated impaired pulmonary function among adults who were exposed to indoor risk factors, such as coal fires and cigarette smoking compared to non-users in the winter season and emphasizes the need for public health efforts to decrease exposure to indoor air pollution.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	transforming growth factor-beta (tgfb) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and matrix homeostasis and is intimately involved in fibrosis. tgfb expression is increased in fibrotic lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in chronic inflammatory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. in addition to exhibiting profibrotic activities, the protein exhibits profound immune-suppressive actions involving both innate and adaptive responses, but often this aspect of tgfb biology is overlooked. recent investigations have demonstrated that tgfb causes wide-ranging immune suppression, including blunting of pivotal early innate ifn responses. these activities permit severe virus infections, often followed by secondary bacterial infections, which may last longer, with augmented inflammation, scarring, fibrosis, and loss of lung function. strategies to oppose tgfb actions or to enhance ifn responses may help ameliorate the detrimental consequences of infection in patients with diseases characterized by tgfb overexpression, inflammation, and fibrosis.
ankylosing_spondylitis	epidemiological studies have shown that patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa) are often affected by numerous comorbidities that carry significant morbidity and mortality. reported comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune eye disease, non- alcoholic fatty liver disease, depression, and fibromyalgia. all health care providers for patients with psa should recognize and monitor those comorbidities, as well as understand their effect on patient management to ensure an optimal clinical outcome.
lymphoma	background: diagnosis of syphilis is difficult. follow-up and therapy evaluation of syphilitic patients are poor. little is known about positron emission tomography (pet) in syphilis. this review was to systematically review usefulness of pet for diagnosis, disease extent evaluation, follow-up, and treatment response assessment in patients with syphilis. methods: we searched pubmed, embase, scopus, cochrane library, web of science, clinicaltrials. gov, and three chinese databases (sinomed, wanfang, and cnki) for english and chinese language articles from inception to september 2016. we also collected potentially relevant studies and reviews using a manual search. the search keywords included the combined text and mesh terms ""syphilis"" and ""positron emission tomography"". we included studies that reporting syphilis with a pet scan before and/or after antibiotic treatment. the diagnosis of syphilis was based on serological criteria or dark field microscopy. outcomes include pre-and post-treatment pet scan, pre-and post-treatment computed tomography, and pre-and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging. we excluded the articles not published in english or chinese or not involving humans. results: of 258 identified articles, 34 observational studies were included. thirty-three studies were single-patient case reports and one study was a small case series. all patients were adults. the mean age of patients was 48.3 +/- 12.1 years. in primary syphilis, increased fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) accumulation could be seen at the site of inoculation or in the regional lymph nodes. in secondary syphilis with lung, bone, gastrointestinal involvement, or generalized lymphadenopathy, increased fdg uptake was the most commonly detected changes. in tertiary syphilis, increased glucose metabolic activity, hypometabolic lesions, or normal glucose uptake might be seen on pet. there were five types of pet scans in neurosyphilis. a repeated pet scan after treatment revealed apparent or complete resolution of the asymmetry of radiotracer uptake. conclusion: pet is helpful in targeting diagnostic interventions, characterizing disease extent, assessing nodal involvement, and treatment efficacy for syphilis.
psoriasis	centella asiatica is a herbaceous plant of asian traditional medicine. besides wound healing, this plant is recommended for the treatment or care of various skin conditions such as dry skin, leprosy, varicose ulcers, eczema, and/or psoriasis. triterpene saponins, known as centellosides, are the main metabolites associated with these beneficial effects. considering the interest in these high value active compounds, there is a need to develop biosustainable and economically viable processes to produce them. previous work using c. asiatica plant cell culture technology demonstrated the efficient conversion of amyrin derivatives into centellosides, opening a new way to access these biomolecules. the current study was aimed at increasing the production of centellosides in c. asiatica plant cell cultures. herein, we report the application of a new elicitor, coronatine, combined with the addition of amyrin-enriched resins as potential sustainable precursors in the centelloside pathway, for a positive synergistic effect on centelloside production. our results show that coronatine is a powerful elicitor for increasing centelloside production and that treatments with sustainable natural sources of amyrins enhance centelloside yields. this process can be scaled up to an orbitally shaken cellbag, thereby increasing the capacity of the system for producing biomass and centellosides.
crohn's_disease	background & aims: we aimed to assess levels of education attained, employment, and marital status of adults diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) during childhood or adolescence, compared with healthy individuals in canada. methods: we performed a cross-sectional study of adults diagnosed with ibd in childhood or adolescence at children 's hospital in winnipeg, manitoba from january 1978 through december 2007. participants (n = 112) answered a semi-structured questionnaire on educational achievements, employment, and marital status. patients were matched for age and sex with random healthy individuals from the 2012 canadian community health survey (controls, 5 per patient). conditional binary logistic regression and random-effects ordinal logistic regression models were used for analysis. results: patients were followed for a mean duration of 14.3 years (range, 3.1-34.5 years). persons with ibd were more likely to earn more money per annum and attain a post-secondary school degree or receive a diploma than controls (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.60; p < .01 and odds ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-5.04; p < .01, respectively). there was no significant difference between patients and controls in employment or marital status. conclusions: adults diagnosed with ibd during childhood seem to achieve higher education levels than individuals without ibd. this observation should provide reassurance to children with ibd and their parents.
mental_health	despite the abundance of research on negative intrusive thoughts, far less is known about their positive counterparts. in two studies, we explored how positive spontaneous thoughts are related to people 's favorite activities (i.e., their passions, vallerand et al. in j pers soc psychol 85(4):756-767. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.4.756, 2003), and how passions and associated thoughts contribute to mental health. in study 1, 170 participants reported on the valence and frequency of the spontaneous thoughts they tend to have about several activities. harmonious and obsessive passion both predicted more frequent spontaneous thoughts, but only harmonious passion predicted thought positivity. in study 2, 232 participants completed measures pertaining to physical activity, spontaneous thoughts, and mental health. as predicted, positivity of spontaneous thoughts about physical activity predicted frequency of physical activity. further, positivity of spontaneous thoughts about physical activity mediated the relationship between harmonious passion and indices of mental well-being.
dementia	background: polypharmacy is highly prevalent in residential aged care facilities (racfs). although polypharmacy is sometimes unavoidable, polypharmacy has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. objective: to identify and prioritize a range of potential interventions to manage polypharmacy in racfs from the perspectives of health care professionals, health policy and consumer representatives. methods: two nominal group technique (ngt) sessions were convened in august 2015. a purposive sample (n = 19) of clinicians, researchers, managers and representatives of consumer, professional and health policy organizations were asked to nominate interventions to address the prevalence and appropriateness of medication use. participants were then asked to prioritize five interventions suitable for possible implementation at the system level. results: six of 16 potential interventions were prioritized highest for possible implementation in clinical practice, with two interventions prioritized as second highest. the top interventions in rank order were `implementation of a pharmacist-led medication reconciliation service for new residents,' conduct facility level audits and feedback to staff and health care professionals,' develop deprescribing scripts to assist clinician-resident discussion,' develop or revise prescribing guidelines specific to older people with multimorbidity in racfs,' implement electronic medication charts and records' and 'better support medication advisory committees (macs) to address medication appropriateness.' conclusion: this study prioritized a range of potential interventions that may be used to assist clinicians and policy makers develop a comprehensive strategy to manage polypharmacy in racfs.

addiction	inherited genetic variants contribute to risk factors for developing an alcohol use disorder, and polymorphisms may inform precision medicine strategies for treating alcohol addiction. targeting genetic mutations linked to alcohol phenotypes has provided promising initial evidence for reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. although successful in some studies, there are conflicting findings and the reports of adverse effects may ultimately limit their clinical utility, suggesting that novel pharmacogenetic targets are necessary to advance precision medicine approaches. here, we describe promising novel genetic variants derived from preclinical models of alcohol consumption and dependence that may uncover disease mechanisms that drive uncontrolled drinking and identify novel pharmacogenetic targets that facilitate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.
autism	background and objectives: developmental coordination disorder (dcd) is a prevalent childhood movement disorder, impacting the ability to perform movement skills at an age appropriate level. although differences in grey matter (gm) volumes have been found in related developmental disorders, no such evidence has been linked with dcd to date. this cross-sectional study assessed structural brain differences in children with and without dcd. methods: high-resolution structural images were acquired from 44 children aged 7.8-12 years, including 22 children with dcd (= 20th percentile on mabc-2). structural voxel-based morphology analysis was performed to determine group differences in focal gm volumes. results: children with dcd were found to have significant, large, right lateralised reductions in grey matter volume in the medial and middle frontal, and superior frontal gyri compared to controls. the addition of motor proficiency as a covariate explained the between-group gm volume differences, suggesting that gm volumes in motor regions are reflective of the level of motor proficiency. a positive correlation between motor proficiency and relative gm volume was also identified in the left posterior cingulate and precuneus. conclusions: gm volume reductions in premotor frontal regions may underlie the motor difficulties characteristic of dcd. it is possible that intervention approaches targeting motor planning, attention, and executive functioning processes associated with the regions of reduced gm volume may result in functional improvements in children with dcd.

psoriasis	nail dystrophy is a heterogeneous skin condition and in some subtypes, is associated with autoimmune diseases in particular psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. in this report, we show that tofacitinib, a novel therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, appears to be beneficial in patients with nail disease refractory to other conventional modes of therapy.
osteoporosis	background: defects in tmem165 gene cause a type-ii congenital disorder of glycosylation affecting golgi glycosylation processes. tmem165 patients exhibit psychomotor retardation, important osteoporosis, scoliosis, irregular epiphyses and thin bone cortex. tmem165 protein is highly conserved in evolution and belongs to the family of upf0016 membrane proteins which could be an unique group of ca2+/h+ antiporters regulating ca2+ and ph homeostasis and mainly localized in the golgi apparatus. methods: rt-pcr from human brain tissues revealed tmem165 splice-transcript variants. mrna expression was analyzed by rt-q-pcr. expression plasmids allowed us to visualize isoform proteins and their subcellular localization. their functions on glycosylation were achieved by looking at the gel mobility of highly glycosylated proteins in cells overexpressing isoforms. results: in this study, we highlight, as previously shown for other ion channels, the existence of tmem165 splice transcripts isoforms, in particular the short-form (sf) and the long-form (lf) transcripts, leading to a 129 aa and 259 aa protein isoform, respectively. these proteins both localize in the endoplasmic reticulum and have different effects on glycosylation compared to the wild-type protein (324 aa). we also point out that the sf is expressed at low levels in all human cells and tissues checked, excepted in brain, and forms homodimer. the lf was only expressed in the temporal lobe of human brain. general significance: the finding of numerous splice variants could lead to a family of tmem165 isoforms. this family of tmem165 splice transcripts could participate in the fine regulation of tmem165 isoforms' functions and localizations.

anxiety	several researchers have observed that environmental enrichment (ee) can be effective in reducing stressful conditions and abnormal behavior and may provide better reproductive performance in rodents. in this context, this study aimed to evaluate the reproductive performance of wistar rats reared in three different housing conditions. animals were separated into breeding pairs, one pair per cage and pairs randomly assigned to three experimental groups (ten couples per group): control group were provided cages without any environmental enrichment; pvc group with pvc pipe; and cardboard roll group with a commercially available cardboard tube. to compare the reproductive performance of the three groups, the following were evaluated: number of pups/litter; number of litters; parturition interval; occurrence of cannibalism; weight gain of offspring; as well as the quantity and quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes (cocs) obtained after superovulation of the females born from the first, second and last pregnancy in all groups. moreover, the plasma level of corticosterone in breeding animals was measured. a total of 60 male rats randomly selected from the first- and last-born litters (20 males from each group) were first tested in an elevated plus-maze (epm) and on the following day, were tested in an open field test (oft). significant differences were found in the number and morphological classification of cocs. in the control group, the number of oocytes in grade 4 (unusual shapes and very heterogeneous ooplasm, presenting no layers of surrounding cumulus cells [13]) presented statistically higher rates (225/2535, 8.9%) compared to the other groups, as well as the number of competent oocytes was higher in the enriched groups (p = 0.001). moreover, we find that the males of cardboard roll group differed significantly in weight gain compared to pvc group (p = 0.008). in addition to this, we did not detect occurrence of cannibalism in this group. our findings suggest that environmental enrichment provides improvements in reproductive performance of wistar rats.

ankylosing_spondylitis	objective to assess the impact of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axspa) on patients and society based on real-world evidence from the adelphi nr-axspa disease specific programme, a cross-sectional survey of rheumatologists and their patients in germany, france, spain, italy and the uk. methods physicians completed patient record forms for the next two patients consulting with nr-axspa (diagnosis at the physician 's judgement); patients were invited to complete a patient self-completion form. outcomes were assessed in responders and non-responders and those treated with and without biological agents. results in total, 631 patients were included. fulfilment of classification criteria varied across countries. assessment of spondyloarthritis international society classification criteria were most commonly met; other criteria, including amor and european spondyloarthropathy study group criteria, were applied less frequently. most german and uk patients had their condition classified without formal criteria. despite being diagnosed with nr-axspa, 13% of patients met the criteria for ankylosing spondylitis. euroqol 5-dimensions (3l) utility scores were lower in patients with nr-axspa versus general population matched controls (0.776 vs. 0.884; p<0.001); non-responders to treatment had impaired activity (as measured by the work productivity and activity impairment questionnaire) of 47.4% versus 33.3% in responders (p<0.001). clinical outcomes were consistently better in biological-treated versus-naive patients. average pretreatment pain levels were 6.6 and 6.2, respectively (p=0.072) but reduced to 2.5 and 4.0, respectively (p<0.001) at the time of the survey. conclusion nr-axspa was associated with a significant qol and societal burden in this study of german, french, spanish, italian and uk patients. treatment with biological agents was associated with improved qol. considerable variability in patients' clinical characteristics were observed across the countries studied and further education, aimed at improving awareness of the condition, may be needed.
children's_health	backgroundthe aim of this study was to investigate the association of congenital heart disease (chd) with serum ghrelin, tumor necrosis factor- (tnf-) and interleukin (il)-6. methodsixty-three children with chd, hospitalized between january 2012 and september 2014 at wuhan women and children 's health care center, were selected as the study group. additionally, 28 healthy individuals who had physical examinations at this hospital were selected as the control group. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was used to measure serum ghrelin, tnf- and il-6. spss 18.0 and comprehensive meta-analysis 2.0 were used for data analysis. resultsthere was significant difference in weight, height and body mass index (bmi; all p0.05) between the cyanotic chd (cchd), acyanotic chd (achd) and control groups. on one-way analysis of variance serum ghrelin, tnf- and il-6 in both the cchd and achd groups had a tendency to be higher compared with the control group (all p<0.05), whereas, on pearson correlation analysis, there was a correlation between serum ghrelin and bmi (all p<0.05), and tnf- was negatively, and il-6 positively, correlated with bmi (all p<0.05). meta-analysis further demonstrated that serum ghrelin, tnf- and il-6 in both the cchd and achd groups were higher than in the control group (all p<0.05). conclusionserum ghrelin, tnf- and il-6 are elevated in children with chd, and may play a role in the development and progression of chd.
asthma	background: asthma management may involve a step up in treatment when symptoms are not well controlled. we examined whether budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (mrt) is as effective as higher, fixed-dose budesonide plus as-needed terbutaline in patients requiring step-up from step 2 treatment (low-dose inhaled corticosteroids), stratified by baseline reliever use. methods: a post-hoc analysis utilized data from three clinical trials of 6-12 months' duration. patients aged >= 12 years with symptomatic asthma uncontrolled despite step 2 treatment were included. severe exacerbation rate, lung function and reliever use were analysed, stratified by baseline reliever use (2 occasions/day). results: overall, 1239 patients were included. reductions in severe exacerbation rate with budesonide/formoterol mrt versus fixed-dose budesonide were similar across baseline reliever use levels, and were statistically significant in patients using 1-2 (42%, p = 0.01) and >2 (39%, p = 0.02) reliever occasions/day, but not2 reliever occasions/day (-0.33 and -0.74 occasions/day, respectively). conclusions: treatment benefit with budesonide/formoterol mrt versus higher, fixed-dose budesonide plus short-acting a2-agonist was found in step 2 patients with relatively low reliever use, supporting the proposal that budesonide/formoterol mrt may be useful when asthma is uncontrolled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid.
atrial_fibrillation	excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes requires calcium influx through l-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma, which gates calcium release through sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptors in a process known as calcium-induced calcium release, producing a myoplasmic calcium transient and enabling cardiomyocyte contraction. the spatio-temporal dynamics of calcium release, buffering, and reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum play a central role in excitation-contraction coupling in both normal and diseased cardiac myocytes. however, further quantitative understanding of these cells' calcium machinery and the study of mechanisms that underlie both normal cardiac function and calcium-dependent etiologies in heart disease requires accurate knowledge of cardiac ultrastructure, protein distribution and subcellular function. as current imaging techniques are limited in spatial resolution, limiting insight into changes in calcium handling, computational models of excitation-contraction coupling have been increasingly employed to probe these structure-function relationships. this review will focus on the development of structural models of cardiac calcium dynamics at the subcellular level, orienting the reader broadly towards the development of models of subcellular calcium handling in cardiomyocytes. specific focus will be given to progress in recent years in terms of multi-scale modeling employing resolved spatial models of subcellular calcium machinery. a review of the state-of-the-art will be followed by a review of emergent insights into calcium-dependent etiologies in heart disease and, finally, we will offer a perspective on future directions for related computational modeling and simulation efforts.
kidney_health	background: awareness of chronic kidney disease (ckd) is suboptimal among patients with ckd, perhaps due to poor readability of patient education materials (pems). we reviewed the suitability and readability of common pems that focused on 5 content areas: basics of ckd, risk factors for ckd development, risk factors for ckd progression, complications of ckd and self-management strategies to improve kidney health. methods: three reviewers (nephrologist, primary care physician, patient) used the suitability assessment of materials to rate pems on message content/stimulation of learning, typography, visuals and layout and determined literacy level. mean ratings were calculated for each pem by content area and overall (superior = 70-100; adequate = 40-69; inadequate = <40). linear regression was used to determine the impact of literacy level on mean rating. results: we reviewed 69 pems from 19 organizations, divided into 113 content area sections. most (79%) pem sections were 'adequate' (mean rating, 58.3%). inclusion of patient-centered content and opportunities for patient interaction were associated with 'superior' ratings. mean ratings (sd) were similar across content areas: basics of ckd, 58.9% (9.1); risk factors for ckd development, 57.0% (12.3); risk factors for ckd progression, 58.5% (12.0); ckd complications, 62.3% (15.7), and self-management strategies, 62.2% (12.3).6th grade) was associated with an 11.7 point higher mean rating. conclusion: most pems for kidney disease were adequate. outstanding pems shared characteristics of patient centeredness, a low literacy level, and patient interaction. providers should be aware of strengths and limitations of pems when educating their patients about ckd.

autism	we compared the results of a brief video-based multiple-stimulus without replacement preference assessment with no access to chosen activities (mswo-no) to the results of the same assessment with access (mswo-wa) with four children with autism. we also compared instructor rankings of activities to mswo-wa results. strong to moderate correlations between mswo-no and mswo-wa assessment results were found across all participants. the correlation between mswo-wa and instructor rankings ranged from strong to low across all participants. implications and directions for future research are discussed.
mental_health	background: frequent emergency department (ed) users account for a disproportionately high number of ed visits. studies on case management (cm) interventions to reduce frequent ed use have shown mixed results, and few studies have been conducted within a universal health coverage system. to determine whether a cm intervention-compared to standard emergency care-reduces ed attendance. randomized controlled trial. two hundred fifty frequent ed users (5 or more visits in the prior 12 months) who visited a public urban ed at the lausanne university hospital between may 2012 and july 2013 were allocated to either an intervention (n = 125) or control (n = 125) group, and monitored for 12 months. an individualized cm intervention consisting of concrete assistance in obtaining income entitlements, referral to primary or specialty medical care, access to mental health care or substance abuse treatment, and counseling on at-risk behaviors and health care utilization (in addition to standard care) at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 months. we used a generalized linear model for count data (negative binomial distribution) to compare the number of ed visits during the 12-month follow-up between cm and usual care, from an intention-to-treat perspective. at 12 months, there were 2.71 (+/- 0.23) ed visits in the intervention group versus 3.35 (+/- 0.32) visits among controls (ratio = 0.81, 95 % ci = 0.63; 1.02). in the multivariate model, the effect of the cm intervention on the number of ed visits approached statistical significance (b = -0.219, p = 0.075). the presence of poor social determinants of health was a significant predictor of ed use in the multivariate model (b = 0.280, p = 0.048). cm may reduce ed use by frequent users through an improved orientation to the health care system. poor social determinants of health significantly increase use of the ed by frequent users.
asthma	allergic and hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and asthma exacerbations may occur during air travel. although the exact incidence of in-flight asthma and allergic emergencies is not known, we have concerns that this subject has not received the attention it warrants. there is a need to provide passengers at risk and airlines with the necessary measures to prevent and manage these emergencies. a review of the epidemiology, management and approaches to prevention of allergic and asthma emergencies during air travel is presented with the goal of increasing awareness about these important, potentially preventable medical events.
smoking_cessation	few studies have examined the association between smoking behavior (especially quitters) at the time of diagnosis and mortality among cancer patients. our objective was to examine the benefits of quitting on all-cause mortality among cancer patients. 30,658 eligible cancer patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2009, identified by a hospital-based cancer registry in japan, were followed up for up to 10 years. we evaluated smoking behavior at cancer diagnosis (especially recent quitters vs. current smokers) in association with all-cause mortality using cox-proportional hazards models and covariates-adjusted survival curves. risk of death was estimated to be reduced by 11% in recent quitters compared with current smokers. according to adjusted survival curves, median survival time was 8.25 years for recent quitters versus 7.18 years for current smokers, indicating an absolute difference of 1.07 year for a median survivor. similarly, never and former smokers had 18% and 16% lower risk of death with 1.90 years and 1.77 years gained, respectively, compared with current smokers. in addition to former and never smokers, recent quitters showed consistently higher survival rates than current smokers during the 10-year calendar period after diagnosis among cancer patients. because recent quitters may be similar to patients who stop smoking shortly after cancer diagnosis in terms of smoking duration, the latter may be able to decrease their risk of death, suggesting that smoking cessation could be part of cancer care.
atrial_fibrillation	background: cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. however, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (hf) and particularly hf with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef). radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may increase the risk of hf. methods: we conducted a population-based case-control study of incident hf in 170 female residents of olmsted county, minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998-2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography-assisted radiotherapy planning. controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. mean cardiac radiation dose (mcrd) in each patient was calculated from the patient 's computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan. results: mean age at radiotherapy was 699 years. of hf cases, 38 (64%) had ef50% (hfpef), 18 (31%) had ef<50% (hf with reduced ef), and 3 (5%) did not have ef measured. the ef was 40% in 50 of the 56 hf cases (89%) with an ef measurement. the mean interval from radiotherapy to hf was 5.8 +/- 3.4 years. the odds of hf was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. the mcrd was 2.5 gy (range, 0.2-13.1 gy) and higher in cases (3.3 +/- 2.7 gy) than controls (2.1 +/- 2.0 gy; p=0.004). the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for hf per log mcrd was 9.1 (3.4-24.4) for any hf, 16.9 (3.9-73.7) for hfpef, and 3.17 (0.8-13.0) for hf with reduced ef. the increased odds of any hf or hfpef with increasing mcrd remained significant after adjustment for hf risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of hf. conclusions: the relative risk of hfpef increases with increasing cardiac radiation exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. these data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit mcrd during breast cancer treatment. moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of hfpef.
bipolar_disorder	numerous neuroimaging studies have been undertaken to detect cerebral intrinsic activity in major depressive disorder (mdd) with resting state fmri (rs-fmri). however, the inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the exact neuropathology related to mdd. the current meta-analysis used state-of-the-art conjunction analysis techniques to systematically review and summarize all available neuroimaging studies using rsfmri with amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (alff) and/or fractional alff (falff) on mdd patients and further explored the effect of antidepressants on the intrinsic activity of the brain. the anisotropic effect size version of signed differential mapping (aes-sdm) was applied to investigate changes in alff/falff in depression. we performed a subgroup analysis and group comparison on medicated and drug nave patients to detect drug effect on mdd patients and conjunction analysis to identify congruent results between the two methods. meta-regression was used to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics. adult mdd patients showed a robust increase in intrinsic activity in the resting state in the anterior cingulate cortex (acc) in both alff (p<0.001) and falff (p < 0.01) studies. the subgroup analysis demonstrated that the increased activity in the acc was prominent in medicated patients only and not seen in drug-nave mdd patients, while medication naive patients showed a specific decreased activity in the cerebellum (p<0.01). group comparison showed that the intrinsic acc activity is elevated in medicated mdd patients compared with drug nave mdd patients. meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the increased acc activation was positively correlated with illness duration (p<0.001). our findings suggest that increased activity of the acc is more likely to be associated with antidepressant treatment, while decreased intrinsic activity of the cerebellum might be a specific biomarker for current mdd.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	new anti-fibrotic agents for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) were approved based on the results of forced vital capacity (fvc) trends, although concerns were raised about the reliability of fvc as the only endpoint parameter. we hypothesized that ipf-specific multi-dimensional scores (composite physiologic index-cpi; gender-age-physiology-gap; risk stratification score-rise) would better capture response to therapy. in this pilot study, treated and untreated cohorts of ipf patients, matched for demographic and functional characteristics were prospectively followed for 1 year, at 4-month intervals. progression-free survival was significantly improved in treated patients (p = 0.0093). while no difference in fvc longitudinal trends was observed, mrc dyspnea score (p = 0.0347), diffusing lung capacity (p = 0.0015), 6-min walk distance (p = 0.0007), cpi (p = 0.0457) and rise (p = 0.0005) were significantly stabilized in treated patients, compared to steady worsening in untreated subjects. multi-dimensional scores provide broader spectrum of prognostic information and may facilitate the assessment of efficacy of new drugs for ipf.
bipolar_disorder	nerve growth factor (ngf) plays crucial roles in promoting neural growth and survival, and mediating synaptic and morphological plasticity. several studies investigated the correlation between peripheral ngf levels and major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (scz), major depressive disorder (mdd) and bipolar disorder (bpd); however, the findings were inconsistent. this meta-analysis sought to investigate blood ngf levels in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with healthy subjects and examined potential effects of blood fraction, medication and disease status. a total of 21 eligible studies, encompassing 1342 patients suffering from psychiatric disorders and 1225 healthy subjects, were enrolled in the present meta-analysis. no obvious publication bias was observed either for scz, mdd or bpd by the begg 's test (p >0.05). random-effects meta-analysis showed that scz (z = 2.14, p = 0.033, smd = 1.08, 95% ci = 2.07 to -0.09) and mdd (z = 2.57, p = 0.010, smd = -0.61, 95% ci = -1.08 to -0.14) patients had significantly reduced ngf levels, compared with healthy controls. notably, this decrease was enhanced in un-medicated patients of scz (p = 0.004) and medicated or chronic patients of mdd (p0.05). these results supported an association between the reduction of ngf levels and psychiatric disorders. it remains unclear whether the change of ngf levels is a prerequisite for its function in psychiatric disorders development or merely an epiphenomenon unrelated to the pathophysiologic mechanisms.

medicare	objectivedisparities in epilepsy treatment are not uncommon; therefore, we examined population-based estimates of initial antiepileptic drugs (aeds) in new-onset epilepsy among racial/ethnic minority groups of older us medicare beneficiaries. methodswe conducted retrospective analyses of 2008-2010 medicare administrative claims for a 5% random sample of beneficiaries augmented for minority representation. new-onset epilepsy cases in 2009 had 1 international classification of diseases, ninth revision (icd-9) 345.x or 2 icd-9 780.3x, and 1 aed, and no seizure/epilepsy claim codes or aeds in preceding 365 days. we examined aed use and concordance with quality indicators of epilepsy treatment (quiet) 6 (monotherapy as initial treatment = 30 day first prescription with no other concomitant aeds), and prompt aed treatment (first aed within 30 days of diagnosis). logistic regression examined likelihood of prompt treatment by demographic (race/ethnicity, gender, age), clinical (number of comorbid conditions, neurology care, index event occurring in the emergency room (er)), and economic (part d coverage phase, eligibility for part d low income subsidy [lis], and zip code level poverty) factors. resultsover 1 year of follow-up, 79.6% of 3,706 new epilepsy cases had one aed only (77.89% of whites vs. 89% of american indian/alaska native [ai/an]). levetiracetam was the most commonly prescribed aed (45.5%: from 24.6% ai/an to 55.0% whites). the second most common was phenytoin (30.6%: from 18.8% asians to 43.1% ai/an). quiet 6 concordance was 94.7% (93.9% for whites to 97.3% of ai/an). only 50% received prompt aed therapy (49.6% whites to 53.9% ai/an). race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with aed patterns, monotherapy use, or prompt treatment. significancemonotherapy is common across all racial/ethnic groups of older adults with new-onset epilepsy, older aeds are commonly prescribed, and treatment is frequently delayed. further studies on reasons for treatment delays are warranted. interventions should be developed and tested to develop paradigms that lead to better care.
psoriasis	background: interleukin-23 (il-23) is required for t helper 17 (th17) cell responses and il-17 production in hepatitis b virus infection. a previous study showed that the il-23/il-17 axis aggravates immune injury in patients with chronic hepatitis b virus infection. however, the role of il-23 in acute liver injury remains unclear. objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the role of the inflammatory cytokine il-23 in lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine (lps/galn)-induced acute liver injury in mice. methods: serum il-23 from patients with chronic hepatitis b virus (chb), acute-on-chronic liver failure (aclf) and healthy individuals who served as healthy controls (hcs) was measured by elisa. an il-23p19 neutralizing antibody or an il-23p40 neutralizing antibody was administered intravenously at the time of challenge with lps (10 mu g/kg) and galn (400 mg/kg) in c57bl/6 mice. hepatic pathology and the expression of th17-related cytokines, including il-17 and tnf-alpha; neutrophil chemoattractants, including cxcl1, cxd2, cxcl9, and cxcl10; and the stabilization factor csf3 were assessed in liver tissue. results: serum il-23 was significantly upregulated in aclf patients compared with chb patients and hcs (p < 0.05 for both). serum il-23 was significantly upregulated in the non-survival group compared with the survival group of aclf patients, which was consistent with lps/galn-induced acute hepatic injury in mice (p < 0.05 for both). moreover, after treatment, serum il-23 was downregulated in the survival group of aclf patients (p< 0.001). compared with lps/galn mice, mice treated with either an il-23p19 neutralizing antibody or an il-23p40 neutralizing antibody showed less severe liver tissue histopathology and significant reductions in the expression of th17-related inflammatory cytokine, including il-17 and tnf-alpha; neutrophil chemoattractants, including cxcl1, cxcl2, cxcl9, and cxcl10; and stabilization factors csf3 within the liver tissue compared with lps/galn mice (p < 0.05 for all). conclusion: high serum il-23 was associated with mortality in aclf patients and lps/galn-induced acute liver injury in mice. il-23 neutralizing antibodies attenuated liver injury by reducing the expression of th17-related inflammatory cytoldnes, neutrophil chemoattractants and stabilization factors within the liver tissue, which indicated that il-23 likely functions upstream of th17-related cytokine and chemokine expression to recruit inflammatory cells into the liver.

rheumatoid_arthritis	the present study represents a connection between basic science and clinical applied science through providing a bioanalytical method for the analysis of certain co-administered drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. the studied drugs are esomeprazole, leflunomide and ibuprofen. the proposed bioanalytical method is a simple reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic method using micellar mobile phase. the method is conducted using a shim-pack vp-ods (150mmx 4.6mm id) stainless steel column at ambient temperature with ultraviolet detection at 285 nm. the micellar mobile phase consisted of 0.1 m sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% n-propanol, 0.3% triethylamine in 0.02m orthophosphoric acid (ph 3.5) and is pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. the calibration curve was rectilinear over the concentration range of 0.1-5.0, 0.5-10.0 and 1.0-20.0 mu g/ml for esomeprazole, leflunomide and ibuprofen respectively. the proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of these drugs in dosage forms. the method is extended to the in-vitro, in-vivo determination of these drugs in spiked and real human plasma samples.
bipolar_disorder	objective: traditional pharmacotherapy has undoubtedly improved the outcome of patients with psychiatric disorders, but partial efficacy or poor tolerability persists in a number of these subjects. among different compounds, zonisamide has been used to address unmet needs of standard pharmacotherapy. the purpose of the present article is to provide a review about the use of zonisamide for the treatment of psychiatric conditions. methods: a research in the main database sources has been conducted to obtain an overview of the use of zonisamide in psychiatric disorders or associated conditions (obesity and smoking cessation). results: most available data indicate the possible effectiveness of zonisamide for the treatment of acute phases of bipolar disorder, binge-eating disorder (bed), alcohol misuse, and obesity. a further assessment of the safety and tolerability of zonisamide is made necessary by the fact that, with the exception of bed, for all other disorders at least some data come from studies with combined pharmacological therapies. conclusions: zonisamidemay have some utility, especially as an adjunctive therapy, for the management of acute phases and weight gain in bipolar disorder and for prevention of alcohol misuse. preliminary evidence indicates zonisamide as a candidate compound for the treatment of bed and obesity. however, open-label design and small sample sizes of most available studies prevent from drawing sound conclusions about the utility of this compound in psychiatry.
bipolar_disorder	there has been limited investigation of volume and shape difference in subcortical structures in children with adhd and a paucity of examination of the influence of sex on these findings. the objective of this study was to examine morphology (volume and shape) of subcortical structures and their association with emotion dysregulation (ed) in girls and boys with adhd as compared to their typically-developing (td) counterparts. participants included 218 children ages 8-12 years old with and without dsm-w adhd. structural magnetic resonance images were obtained, and shape analyses were conducted using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (lddmm). compared to td boys, boys with adhd showed reduced volumes in the bilateral globus pallidus and amygdala. there were no volumetric differences in any structure between adhd and td girls. shape analysis revealed localized compressions within the globus pallidus, putamen and amygdala in adhd boys relative to td boys, as well as significant correlations between increased ed and unique subregion expansion in right globus pallidus, putamen, and right amygdala. our findings suggest a sexually dimorphic pattern of differences in subcortical structures in children with adhd compared to td children, and a possible neurobiological mechanism by which boys with adhd demonstrate increased difficulties with ed.
lymphoma	despite an improved understanding of disease biology and the use of multi-agent chemotherapy, the long-term survival of adults with b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (b-all) ranges from 35% to 50%. management of patients with relapsed b-all, a group characterized by dismal outcomes, poses a clinical challenge. to address this unmet need, novel therapeutics are being investigated in the setting of relapsed b-all with encouraging results. cd22 is an important b-cell antigen expressed in 80-90% of b-all cases. cd22 undergoes constitutive endocytosis with antibody ligation, making it an attractive biologic target for immunoconjugates. inotuzumab ozogamicin (io), a cd22-targeted antibody-drug conjugate demonstrated impressive single agent activity even among heavily pretreated relapsed b-all patients. a recent randomized phase iii clinical trial demonstrates superiority of io over standard of care chemotherapy as first- or second-line salvage therapy for relapsed b-all. in this review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical data available to date using io in relapsed b-all.
crohn's_disease	genetic mutations in the innate immune receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (nod2) have demonstrated increased susceptibility to crohn 's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that is hypothesized to be accompanied by changes in the gut microbiota. nod2 responds to the presence of bacteria, specifically a fragment of the bacterial cell wall, muramyl dipeptide (mdp). the proposed site of this interaction is the leucine-rich repeat (lrr) domain. surface plasmon resonance and molecular modeling were used to investigate the interaction of the lrr domain with mdp. a functional and pure lrr domain was obtained from escherichia coli expression in high yield. the lrr domain binds to mdp with high affinity, with a k-d of 212 +/- 24 nm. critical portions of the receptor were determined by mutagenesis of putative binding residues. fragment analysis of mdp revealed that both the peptide and carbohydrate portion contribute to the binding interaction.
hereditary_angioedema	background: earlier studies have shown that the absolute number of neutrophil granulocytes (ngs) may increase during attack of hereditary angioedema due to c1-inhibitor deficiency (c1-inh-hae). whether ngs undergo activation during attack has not yet been investigated. however, as neutrophil elastase (ne) can cleave and inactivate c1-inh which may contribute to the dysregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system and hence, to edema formation. our aim was to investigate the possible activation of ngs during attacks. methods: we studied blood samples obtained from 26 patients with c1-inh-hae during symptom-free periods and during attacks, along with samples from 26 healthy volunteers. ng count (ngc), ne, myeloperoxidase (mpo), pentraxin 3 (ptx3), crp, c5a, factor h, il-8, and tnf-alpha levels were measured. results: ngc was higher during attacks than during symptom-free periods (p = 0.0132), and the same was observed for ne (p = 0.0026), mpo (p = 0.0008), and ptx3 levels (p = 0.0409). there was a strong positive correlation between ne and mpo levels during attacks (p < 0.0001, r = 0.709). furthermore, il-8 (p = 0.0061) and tnf-alpha (p = 0.0186) levels were also elevated during attacks, compared with symptom-free periods. by contrast, c5a and factor h levels were similar in samples obtained during attacks or in symptom-free periods. conclusion: increased ngc was associated with elevated ne and mpo levels - this suggests neutrophil activation during attacks. the strong positive correlation between ne and mpo levels, together with the elevated ptx3 concentration, may indicate the expression of neutrophil extracellular traps. all these processes may contribute to the activation of kallikrein-kinin system, which leads to the onset of an edematous episode.
addiction	cognitive biases may play a significant role in disorders of decision making such as pathological gambling and addiction. understanding the neurobiology of these biases could lead to more effective pharmacological and therapeutic treatments for disorders in which aberrant decision making is prominent. the rodent betting task (rbt) was designed to measure one commonly observed decision-making heuristic in rodents, namely ""escalation of commitment"" in which subjects become more risk averse as the stakes increase, even if the odds of success remain constant. in the rodent task, the animal is presented with a choice between two options of equivalent expected value, such that reward on one option is guaranteed while the other has a 50% chance of double the prize or nothing. past work has shown that a subset of animals (termed wager sensitive) adopt an irrationally risk averse choice preference in which they shift their choice away from the uncertain option as the bet size grows larger. in the current study, the orbitofrontal (ofc), prelimbic (prl), and infralimbic cortex (il) were inactivated to evaluate the contributions made by these regions to choice behavior on the rbt. inactivation of the ofc (but not the il or the prl) selectively ameliorated the risk averse choice pattern characteristic of wager-sensitive animals. this finding suggests that the ofc may have a relatively unique role in promoting this type of non normative decision-making under uncertainty, an effect that is potentially related to its role in representing the subjective value of reinforcing outcomes. this article is part of a special issue entitled: cognitive flexibility.

atrial_fibrillation	major electrophysiological mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation were described around 100 years ago, but important recent improvements in biophysical theory, mapping of cardiac electric activity, and noninvasive imaging have generated significant new and controversial ideas. here, we discuss these ideas, the evidence on which they are based, their significance for arrhythmia research and therapy, and the common underlying molecular mechanisms that may allow for therapeutic improvements even without definitive resolution of the electric processes that maintain atrial fibrillation.
autism	altered sensory perception has been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (asd) and might be related to aberrant sensory perception thresholds. we used the well-established, standardized quantitative sensory testing (qst) protocol of the german research network on neuropathic pain to investigate 13 somatosensory parameters including thermal and tactile detection and pain thresholds in 13 asd adults and 13 matched healthy controls with normal iq values. there were no group differences between somatosensory detection and pain thresholds. two asd patients showed paradoxical heat sensations and another two asd subjects presented dynamic mechanical allodynia; somatosensory features that were absent in controls. these findings suggest that central mechanisms during complex stimulus integration rather than peripheral dysfunctions probably determine somatosensory alterations in asd.
atrial_fibrillation	long-term plasticity is well documented in synapses between glutamatergic principal cells in the cortex both in vitro and in vivo. long-term potentiation (ltp) and -depression (ltd) have also been reported in glutamatergic connections to hippocampal gabaergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (pv+) or nitric oxide synthase (nos+) in brain slices, but plasticity in these cells has not been tested in vivo. we investigated synaptically-evoked suprathreshold excitation of identified hippocampal neurons in the ca1 area of urethane-anaesthetized rats. neurons were recorded extracellularly with glass microelectrodes, and labelled with neurobiotin for anatomical analyses. single-shock electrical stimulation of afferents from the contralateral ca1 elicited postsynaptic action potentials with monosynaptic features showing short delay (9.95 +/- 0.41 ms) and small jitter in 13 neurons through the commissural pathway. theta-burst stimulation (tbs) generated ltp of the synaptically-evoked spike probability in pyramidal cells, and in a bistratified cell and two unidentified fast-spiking interneurons. on the contrary, pv+ basket cells and nos+ ivy cells exhibited either ltd or ltp. an identified axo-axonic cell failed to show long-term change in its response to stimulation. discharge of the cells did not explain whether ltp or ltd was generated. for the fast-spiking interneurons, as a group, no correlation was found between plasticity and local field potential oscillations (1-3 or 3-6 hz components) recorded immediately prior to tbs. the results demonstrate activity-induced long-term plasticity in synaptic excitation of hippocampal pv+ and nos+ interneurons in vivo. physiological and pathological activity patterns in vivo may generate similar plasticity in these interneurons.
bipolar_disorder	background: our objective was to assess the impact of obstetric mode of delivery, and in particular birth by caesarean section (cs), on school performance in adolescents using a large, population-based cohort. methods: we extracted data from the swedish medical birth register and national school register. we included all live singleton births in sweden from 1982-1995 (n = 1,489,925). school grades were reported on a scale from 0 to 320, scores less than 160 (i. e. ""pass"") were considered to be ""poor school performance."" mode of delivery was categorised as: unassisted vaginal delivery (vd), assisted vd, elective cs and emergency cs. we measured the association between mode of delivery and ""poor school performance"" using logistic regression. we then used quantile regression to assess the association between mode of delivery and school performance across the distribution of scores. we adjusted for maternal age, parity, small and large for gestational age, gestational age, maternal country of birth, maternal depression, non-affective disorder or bipolar disorder, parental income at time of birth, and parental social welfare at time of birth. we also conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the association further. results: with logistic regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (aor) of assisted vd and poor school performance, compared to unassisted vd, was 1.06 (95% ci: 1.03-1.08). for elective cs it was 1.06 (95% ci: 1.03-1.09) and for emergency cs it was 1.12 (95% ci: 1.09-1.15). with quantile regression, assisted vd showed little difference in scores, when compared to unassisted vd, at any point across the distribution. elective cs was associated with a 1-3 point decrease in scores, and emergency cs was associated with a 2-5 point decrease in scores. conclusion: a slight association was found between birth by cs and school performance. however, the effect was quite small and given the complex nature of the relationship, should be interpreted with caution.
osteoarthritis	cell-cell and cell-matrix communications play important roles in both cell proliferation and differentiation. gap junction proteins mediate signaling communication by exchanging small molecules and dramatically stimulating intracellular signaling pathways to determine cell fate. vertebrates have 2 gap junction families: pannexins (panxs) and connexins (cxs). unlike cxs, the functions of panxs are not fully understood. in skeletal formation, panx3 and cx43 are the most abundantly expressed gap junction proteins from each family. panx3 is induced in the transient stage from the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoprogenitor cells. panx3 regulates both chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation via the activation of intracellular ca2+ signaling pathways through multiple channel activities: hemichannels, endoplasmic reticulum (er) ca2+ channels, and gap junctions. moreover, panx3 also inhibits osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and promotes cell cycle exit through the inactivation of wnt/a-catenin signaling and the activation of p21. panx3-knockout (ko) mice have more severe skeletal abnormalities than those of cx43-ko mice. a phenotypic analysis of panx3-ko mice indicates that panx3 regulates the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes by promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) 13. based on the generation of panx3(-/-); cx43(-/) (-)mice, panx3 is upstream of cx43 in osteogenesis. panx3 promotes cx43 expression by regulating wnt/a-catenin signaling and osterix expression. further, although panx3 can function in 3 ways, cx43 cannot function through the er ca2+ channel, only via the hemichannels and gap junction routes. in this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the roles of panx3 in skeletal formation and address the potential for new therapies in the treatment of diseases and pathologies associated with panx3, such as osteoarthritis (oa).
stress_management	medical procedures often induce physical pain and psychological distress. cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to fatigue, heightened emotional distress, social isolation, and increased risk of depression, severely reducing quality of life and potential treatment non-adherence and prolonged hospital stays. leveraging emerging virtual reality (vr) technology, we prototyped serenity: a mobile smartphone-based vr cancer coping intervention informed by distraction therapy to help alleviate the symptoms of coping and promote patient empowerment. it leverages emerging low-cost vr to improve accessibility and effectiveness of distraction therapy. we describe the results of a preliminary usability study and lessons learned that apply to future design and evaluation of virtual reality interventions for behavioral health.
ankylosing_spondylitis	background: il-17a is a key driver of human autoimmune diseases, particularly psoriasis. objective: we sought to determine the role of il-17a in psoriasis pathogenesis and to identify a robust and measurable biomarker of il-17a-driven pathology. methods: we studied 8 healthy subjects and 8 patients with psoriasis before and after administration of secukinumab, a fully human anti-il-17a mab, and used a combination of classical techniques and a novel skin microperfusion assay to evaluate the expression of 170 proteins in blood, nonlesional skin, and lesional skin. for validation, we also tested stored sera from 601 patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. results: il-17a was specifically expressed in lesional compared with nonlesional psoriatic skin (9.8 vs 0.8 pg/ml, p <.001). proteomic and gene transcription analyses revealed dysregulated antimicrobial peptides, proinflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil chemoattractants, levels of which returned to normal after treatment with secukinumab. beta-defensin 2 (bd-2) was identified as a biomarker of il-17a-driven pathology by comparing protein expression in patients with psoriasis versus that in healthy subjects (5746 vs 82 pg/ml in serum, p <.0001; 2747 vs <218 pg/ml in dermis, p <.001), responsiveness to secukinumab therapy, and synergistic induction by il-17a and tnf-alpha in epidermal keratinocytes. in a validation set of sera from 601 patients with autoimmune diseases thought to be il-17a driven, we found that bd-2 levels are most highly increased in patients with psoriatic skin lesions, and in patients with psoriasis, bd-2 levels correlated well with il-17a levels (r = 0.70, n = 199, p <.001) and psoriasis area and severity index scores (r = 0.53, n 5 281, p <.001). conclusion: il-17a is a primary driver of skin pathology in patients with psoriasis, and serum bd-2 is an easily measurable biomarker of il-17a-driven skin pathology.
dementia	background: knowledge available about the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (osa) and cognitive impairment after stroke is limited. the evolution of osa and cognitive performance after stroke is not sufficiently described. methods: we prospectively enrolled and examined acute stroke patients without previously diagnosed osa. the following information was collected: (1) demographics, (2) sleep cardio-respiratory polygraphy (pg) at 72 h, day seven, month three, and month 12 after stroke, (3) post-stroke functional disability tests at entry and at months three and 12, and (4) cognition (attention and orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language, and visual-spatial abilities) using the revised addenbrooke 's cognitive examination (ace-r) at months three and 12. results: of 68 patients completing the study, osa was diagnosed in 42 (61.8%) patients. the mean apnea/ hypopnea index (ahi) at study entry of 21.0 +/- 13.7 spontaneously declined to 11.6 +/- 11.2 at month 12 in the osa group (p < 0.0005). the total ace-r score was significantly reduced at months three (p = 0.005) and 12 (p = 0.004) in the osa group. poorer performance on the subtests of memory at months 3 (p = 0.039) and 12 (p = 0.040) and verbal fluency at months 3 (p < 0.005) and 12 (p < 0.005) were observed in the osa group compared to non-osa group. visual-spatial abilities in both the osa (p = 0.001) and non-osa (p = 0.046) groups and the total ace-r score in the osa (p = 0.005) and non-osa (p = 0.002) groups improved. conclusions: a high prevalence of osa and cognitive decline were present in patients after an acute stroke. spontaneous improvements in both osa and cognitive impairment were observed.

smoking_cessation	the normal rotator cuff tendon to bone insertion site is not recreated after repair. instead of the normal fibrocartilaginous transition zone, repaired tendons heal with a layer of interposing scar tissue. this alteration in the biology makes rotator cuff repairs prone to failure. various methods have been proposed to biologically augment rotator cuff repairs including platelet-rich plasma, patches, stem cells, and molecular factors such as cytokines. currently, there is insufficient evidence in the literature to support platelet-rich plasma as an augment for rotator cuff repair. patches should only be used as an augment and are not recommend as a gap-spanning instrument. stem cells and cytokines have promising animal data but sparse data in humans suggestive of positive outcomes. newer possibilities include combinations of the above methods as well as gene therapy. modifiable patient factors such as smoking cessation, glycemic control in diabetics, and limiting the use of anti-inflammatories may be the most readily available ways to improve the biology of rotator cuff healing. goals of further research should build on preclinical work and successes as well as find novel ways to enhance biology of the repair site to improve healing and reduce retears.
smoking_cessation	each year 16-17 million determinations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) are conducted and interpreted in germany. recently acquired data have led to a fundamental reassessment of the clinical significance of hdl-c. this review article is based on a selective literature search. low hdlaeuroc levels usually indicate an increased cardiovascular risk, particularly in primary prevention but the epidemiological relationship between hdlaeuroc and the risk is complex. the hdl plays a role in the back transport and excretion of cholesterol; however, the biological functions of hdl are dependent on the protein and lipid composition, which is not reflected by the hdlaeuroc concentration. if the composition of hdl is pathologically altered it can also exert negative vascular effects. compared with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), hdlaeuroc is of secondary importance for cardiovascular risk stratification and the calculation of the ldl-c:hdlaeuroc ratio is not useful for all patients. low hdlaeuroc levels should prompt a search for additional metabolic and inflammatory pathologies. an increase in hdlaeuroc through lifestyle changes (e.g. smoking cessation and physical exercise) has positive effects and is recommended; however, hdlaeuroc is currently not a valid target for drug therapy.
atopic_dermatitis	heightened cutaneous immune surveillance in atopic patients may inhibit development of melanoma. the aim of this study was to analyse the association between atopy and melanoma (development and outcome). a total of 188 cases of melanoma and 596 healthy controls were interviewed by telephone with a standardized questionnaire on atopic, demographic and melanoma characteristics. cases were matched with controls on important confounders (age, sex, sunburn sensitivity, hair colour, number of moles, sunburn as juvenile, ever sunbed use, familial melanoma). melanoma outcome data (disease relapse and death) within cases were retrieved. analysis showed a general inverse association between atopy and melanoma development, but this was statistically significant only for a history of personal atopy (odds ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.30-0.96, p-value = 0.04). among melanoma patients, atopy did not affect survival or progression. in conclusion, this study suggests an inverse association between a history of atopy and melanoma development, but not with disease progression.
dementia	in our present society, alzheimer 's disease (ad) is the most common dementia form in elderly people and has been a big social health problem worldwide. in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view classification method based on l (2,p) -norm regularization for alzheimer 's disease (ad) diagnosis. unlike the previous l (2,1) -norm regularized methods using concatenated multi-view features, we further consider the intra-structure and inter-structure relations between features of different views and use a more flexible l (2,p) -norm regularization in our objective function. we also proposed a more suitable loss function to measure the loss between labels and predicted values for classification task. it experimentally demonstrated that this method enhances the performance of disease status classification, comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.
lymphoma	correlations between early and late efficacy endpoints were assessed to identify potential surrogate endpoints for overall survival (os) or progression-free survival (pfs) with clinical trial-level data in three non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) subtypes: diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl), follicular lymphoma (fl), and mantle cell lymphoma (mcl). one hundred and eight phase ii-iii trials (129 trial arms) in dlbcl, fl, and mcl were identified and included in the database. correlations between efficacy endpoints were analyzed using weighted linear regression and pearson 's coefficient of determination (r-2). in newly diagnosed dlbcl, 6-month pfs was strongly correlated with 2-year os (r-2 = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.51-0.96). six-month pfs was strongly correlated with 3-year pfs (r-2 = 0.89, 95% ci 0.62-0.96) in fl and was moderately correlated with 2-year os (r-2 = 0.69, 95% ci 0.40-0.91) in mcl trials. linear regression determined that a 10% increase in 6-month pfs would yield a 13% +/- 1.2% increase in 2-year os in dlbcl, a 23% +/- 1.1% increase in 3-year pfs in fl, or a 6.7% +/- 1.0% increase in 2-year os in mcl. both 6-month pfs and complete response (cr) rate were moderately correlated with median pfs in fl trials with r-2 = 0.66 (95% ci 0.52-0.98) and r-2 = 0.69 (95% ci 0.22-0.89), respectively. six-month pfs is a potential surrogate endpoint for 2-year os in newly diagnosed dlbcl and mcl and for 3-year pfs in fl. both 6-month pfs and cr rate are potential surrogate endpoints for median pfs in fl patients. confirmation and validation of these correlations may facilitate early interpretation of nhl trials.
children's_health	purpose: to investigate how breastfeeding initiation and duration affect the likelihood of being overweight and obese in children aged 2 to 5. design: cross-sectional data from the 2003 national survey of children 's health. setting: rural and urban areas of the united states. subjects: households where at least one member was between the ages of 2 and 5 (sample size 8207). measures: parent-reported body mass index, breastfeeding initiation and duration, covariates (gender, family income and education, ethnicity, child care attendance, maternal health and physical activity, residential area). analysis: partial proportional odds models. results: in early childhood, breastfed children had 5.3% higher probability of being normal weight (p = .002) and 8.9% (p < .001) lower probability of being obese compared to children who had never been breastfed. children who had been breastfed for less than 3 months had 3.1% lower probability of being normal weight (p = .013) and 4.7% higher probability of being obese (p = .013) with respect to children who had been breastfed for 3 months and above. conclusion: study findings suggest that length of breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, may be associated with lower risk of obesity in early childhood. however, caution is needed in generalizing results because of the limitations of the analysis. based on findings from this study and others, breastfeeding promotion policies can cite the potential protective effect that breastfeeding has on weight in early childhood.
children's_health	objective: this study examines the uptake by children aged predominantly 0-11 years of an australian primary mental health service - the access to allied psychological services programme - which began in 2001. in particular, it considers access to, and use of, the child component of access to allied psychological services, the child mental health service, introduced in 2010. method: using routinely collected programme data from a national minimum dataset and regional population data, we conducted descriptive and regression analysis to examine programme uptake, predictors of service reach and consumer- and treatment-based characteristics of service. results: between 2003 and 2013, 18,631 referrals for children were made and 75,178 sessions were scheduled via access to allied psychological services, over 50% of which were via the child mental health service in its first 3 years of operation. the rate of referrals for children to the child mental health service was associated with the rate of access to allied psychological services referrals for consumers aged 12+ years. conclusions: the child mental health service has increased services provided within the access to allied psychological services programme for children with emotional and behavioural issues and their families, and is potentially filling a service gap in the area of prevention and early intervention for children who have significant levels of need but are unable to access other mental health services. our findings are policy-relevant for other developed countries with a similar primary mental health care system that are considering means of improving service access by children.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) on cardiac autonomic function and vascular function in patients with psoriatic arthritis. methods: the study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, where 145 patients with psoriatic arthritis were supplemented with 3 g of n-3 pufa or olive oil (control) daily for 24 weeks. blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability (hrv), central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (pwv) and fatty acid composition of granulocytes, were determined at baseline and after supplementation. results: at baseline we found a significant difference in the mean of all normal rr intervals (inverse of heart rate, vary from beat to beat) when comparing subjects with the highest vs the lowest fish intake (p= 0.03). after supplementation for 24 weeks there was a trend towards an increase in rr (p = 0.13) and decrease in heart rate (p = 0.12) comparing the n-3 pufa group with the control group. however, per-protocol analysis showed significantly increased rr (p = 0.01) and lowered heart rate (p = 0.01) in the n-3 pufa supplemented patients compared with controls. blood pressure, pwv and central blood pressure did not change after supplementation with n-3 pufa. adjustment for disease activity and conventional cardiovascular risk factors did not change the results. conclusions: marine n-3 pufa increased rr intervals in patients with psoriatic arthritis which may suggest a protective effect of n-3 pufa against cardiovascular disease in this population.
mental_health	objective: this paper is a report of 4 published papers on posttraumatic stress symptoms (ptss)/ posttraumatic stress disorders (ptsd) and traumas experienced by homeless zimbabwean refugees living in south africa. the general purpose of the papers was to explore how pre- and postmigration difficulties predicts posttraumatic stress symptoms/disorder; to understand gender differences in ptss/ptsd reports using quantitative and qualitative approaches; and finally, to understand the nature of abuses, perpetrators, and sex of perpetrators. method: through focused group discussions (fgd)s, structured in-depth interviews, data were collected from 125 randomly selected homeless zimbabwean refugees in polokwane, limpopo province, south africa. age of participants ranged from 18 years to 48 years with a mean age of 28.3 years (sd = 6.27). participants were assessed on demographic variables, pre- and post-migration difficulties checklists, general health questionnaire 28 (ghq-28), and ptsd checklist (civilian version; pcl-c). results: results (paper 1) indicated that a majority of the participants were significantly traumatized and pre- and postmigration traumas contributed to ptss and ptsd. the qualitative study (paper 2) overwhelmingly shared similar experiences that could be temporally framed into pre-, mid-, and postmigration. many of the challenging sociocultural, structural, and institutional factors that they experienced were seen across all the migration stages. in paper 3, results of a structural equation model (sem) showed that none of the 3 paths (pre- and postmigration stress and poor mental health) on ptsd is significant for men whereas for women, the path from poor mental health to ptsd (beta = .36, p = .013) is significant. finally the fourth paper showed that rape and sexual harassment were common abuses. perpetrators were mainly single male border and police officers. conclusion: the zimbabwean refugees were found to constitute a particularly vulnerable group to have experienced cumulative traumas and therefore reported ptss, ptsd, and poor mental health. these findings were discussed in line with practical implications for refugees in south africa where xenophobic feelings are on the rise.
autism	objective: to assess the diagnostic status, the sociodemographic and health profiles for students with special educational needs (sen) in a public educational system, and to map their use of educational/social services. methods: the sample comprised 1,202 sen students from a total of 59,344 students. results: only 792 students of the 1,202 had an established diagnosis. the most prevalent sen condition was intellectual disability. there was a low percentage (29.4%) of use of specialized educational services or support. it was found that, for some neurodevelopmental disorders, prevalence data suggest an under-reporting in the school system. conclusion: results suggest that there is a mismatch between the diagnostic reports and the sen condition legally recognized according to brazilian law, in addition to the under-reporting and under specialized service use of students with disabilities.
stress_management	background: cerebral palsy (cp) is the most common pediatric disability causing long-term functional limitations. cp remarkably influences the life of those affected and their families. for this reason it is important and necessary to direct attention not only type of the cp, but also the impact the disorder has on the child, parents, siblings and the entire family as a whole. the aim of this study was to assess the impact of cp on the child 's quality of life, considering parents' perceptions about their child 's illness, in order to underline the impact the illness has not only on the child but also his/her family. methods: the study included both parents of the 36 subjects enrolled (19 males and 17 females), with established cp diagnosis. the effect of cp on the families was assessed using the impact of childhood illness scale. this questionnaire assesses the quality of life in children with epilepsy and other chronic pathologies and in their families. all questions refer to effect to the illness family. the scale comprises 30 questions divided into four sections: impact of illness and its treatment; impact on development and child s adjustment; impact on parents and impact on the family. descriptive analyses were used for data analysis and it is also calculated the rank correlation coefficient spearman 's rho. results and conclusion: the mothers' group presents little higher average scores than the group of fathers in two four subscales or in the basement ""impact on the child"" and ""family impact on the organization"". this could be due to the fact that mothers are concerned most of the child 's caregiver, living most of all the difficulties that entails; mothers show greater concerns than fathers. in subscale ""impact on parents"" the average score of the answers of the group of mothers coincide with that of the fathers; the experience and the experience of his son 's illness is analogous for both parents. no significant differences were found from the correlational analysis between the individual items of the subscales and the different forms of cp. in families of children with cp, strategies for optimizing caregiver physical and psychological health include supports for behavioral management and daily functional activities as well as stress management and self-efficacy techniques.
smoking_cessation	background: several risk factors are associated with multiple sclerosis (ms) progression and may be amenable to intervention. objective: to systematically review the evidence for interventions targeting risk factors for ms progression. methods: we searched six databases and existing reviews till march 2015 and consulted with experts to identify randomized controlled trials (rcts) of interventions targeting ms risk factors (prospero 2015: crd42015016461). results: in total, 37 rcts met inclusion criteria. expanded disability status scale (edss) scores after exercise interventions did not differ compared with untreated controls (standardized mean differences (smds): 0.02; confidence interval (ci): -0.40, 0.44; i-2: 0%; seven rcts; very low quality of evidence (qoe)). dietary interventions did not show a statistically significant effect on the relative risk (rr) of progression (rr: 0.86; ci: 0.67, 1.05; i-2: 0%; four rcts; moderate qoe) compared to placebo. edss scores after vitamin d supplementation were not significantly different from placebo (smd: -0.15; ci: -0.33, 0.02; i-2: 0%; five rcts; very low qoe). conclusion: we did not identify any risk factor interventions with significant effects on ms progression, but the overall qoe was limited. more adequately powered trials are needed on vitamin d supplementation, long-term exercise, and smoking cessation.
mental_health	training in ethics is fundamental in higher education among both faith-based and secular colleges and universities, regardless of one 's academic major or field of study. catholic colleges and universities have included moral philosophy, theology, and applied ethics in their undergraduate curricula for generations. the purpose of this investigation was to determine what, if anything, jesuit college psychology departments are doing to educate psychology majors regarding ethical issues. a survey method was used to assess the psychology departments of all 28 jesuits colleges and universities in the united states. a total of 21 of the 28 schools responded and completed the survey. five schools (23%) reported that they offered a course specifically on ethics in psychology, and three (14%) additional schools offered related courses. of the eight (38%) that offered ethics-related courses, only one required its majors to take it, and only if they were enrolled in the mental health or forensic psychology tracks. for two (10%) of the schools, the ethics in psychology course counted as a university core ethics requirement; for two others (10%), the class met an elective university ethics requirement for psychology majors.
lymphoma	due to cytochrome p450 3a (cyp3a) metabolism, clinical trials of ibrutinib-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) patients prohibited concurrent medications metabolized by cyp3a. we evaluated concomitant medication use in 118 ibrutinib-treated cll patients outside the context of clinical trials. seventy-five (64%) patients were on medications that could increase ibrutinib toxicity and 4 (3%) were on drugs that could decrease ibrutinib efficacy. nineteen (16%) patients were on concomitant cyp3a inhibitors (11 moderate, 8 strong), and 4 (3%) were on cyp3a inducers (two patients were on both cyp3a inhibitors and inducers). although the ibrutinib starting dose was changed in 18 patients on cyp3a interacting medications, no difference in 18-month progression-free survival or rate of ibrutinib discontinuation was observed in patients who were not. in routine clinical practice, 2 of 3 cll patients commencing ibrutinib are on a concomitant medication with potential to influence ibrutinib metabolism. formal medication review by a pharmacist should be considered in all patients initiating ibrutinib.
atrial_fibrillation	background: venous thromboembolism (vte) is a common complication that manifests during and/or after hospitalization, as well as postsurgeries including orthopedic surgeries. edoxaban is a new oral direct factor xa inhibitor that has been recently approved for treating vte in patients who have already been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant and for the prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. objectives: the purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of edoxaban for vte prophylaxis after lower limb orthopedic surgery. materials and methods: a comprehensive search was conducted in google scholar, pubmed, medline, and sciencedirect to identify potential records, then titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened using the inclusion criteria to filter out irrelevant studies. moreover, the data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken using standardized tools, and the results were narratively synthesized and presented in tables. results: six studies were included in this systematic review after screening 2989 records. the majority of studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in vte events in the edoxaban group(s) compared to the dalteparin, placebo, or enoxaparin groups (p.05). conclusion: this study helped to amalgamate evidence with regard to the use of edoxaban for vte prophylaxis post-lower limb orthopedic surgery. in line with the results of the reviewed studies, edoxaban seems to be highly effective in reducing vte post-lower limb orthopedic surgery.
dementia	objective: to investigate validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and feasibility of dual task (dt) assessments in patients with dementia. design: validation study. setting: post ward-rehabilitation. participants: geriatric patients (n = 105) with dementia (age 82.7 +/- 5.9, mmse score 21.9). main outcome measures: psychometric quality of dt performance of different dt-tests. analyses were performed for motor and cognitive performance, and relative dt costs (dtcs). results: spearman 's rank correlations (rs) between examined dt-tests were moderate-high for motor tasks (r(s) = 0.29-0.90), small-high for cognitive tasks (r(s) = 0.12-0.55) and small-high for relative dtcs (motor dtcs r(s) = 0.02-0.61, cognitive dtcs r(s) = -0.19 to 0.06, combined dtcs r(s) = -0.11 to 0.31). correlations with external assessment were moderate-high for motor tasks (r(s) = 0.25-0.84), small-moderate for cognitive tasks (r(s) = -0.10 to 0.46) and small-moderate for relative dtcs (motor dtcs r(s) = -0.09 to 0.17, cognitive dtcs r(s) = -0.03 to 0.21, combined dtcs r(s) = -0.07 to 0.26). test-retest reliability was excellent for motor tasks (icc = 0.75-0.96), fair-excellent for cognitive tasks (icc = 0.51-0.88) and poor-good for relative dtcs (motor dtcs icc = 0.10-0.74, cognitive dtcs icc = 0.05-0.65, combined dtcs icc = 0.15-0.71). sensitivity to change was acceptable-excellent for trained dt-tests (p <= 0.01). effect sizes were small-large for gait parameters (srm = 0.30-1.12), large for cognitive tasks (srm = 0.82-0.95) and small-large for relative dtcs (motor dtcs srm = 0.15-0.77, cognitive dtcs srm = 0.56-0.98, combined dtcs srm = 0.40-1.10). completion time ranged from 13.1 to 16.9 min. conclusions: all dt-tests showed acceptable-excellent psychometric properties in patients with dementia with highest quality for the gait-based tests 'walking & counting' and 'walking & reciting abc'.

dementia	measurement of ultra-low (e.g., parts-per-billion) levels of small-molecule markers in body fluids (e.g., serum, urine, saliva) involves a considerable challenge in view of designing assay strategies with sensitivity and selectivity. herein we report for the first time an amperometric nano-bioelectrode design that uniquely combines 1-pyrenebutyric acid units pi-pi stacked with carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes on the surface of gold screen printed electrodes for covalent attachment of nad(+) dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (fdh). the designed enzyme bioelectrode offered 6 ppb formaldehyde detection in 10-times diluted urine with a wide dynamic range of 10 ppb to 10 ppm. fourier transform infrared, raman, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic characterizations confirmed the successful design of the fdh bioelectrode. flow injection analysis provided lower detection limit and greater affinity for formaldehyde (apparent km 9.6 +/- 1.2 ppm) when compared with stirred solution method (apparent km 19.9 +/- 4.6 ppm). selectivity assays revealed that the bioelectrode was selective toward formaldehyde with a moderate crossreactivity for acetaldehyde (similar to 25%) and negligible cross-reactivity toward propanaldehyde, acetone, methanol, and ethanol. formaldehyde is an indoor pollutant, and studies have indicated neurotoxic characteristics and systemic toxic effects of this compound upon chronic and high doses of exposure. moreover, reported chromatography and mass spectrometry methods identified elevated urine formaldehyde levels in patients with bladder cancer, dementia, and early stages of cognitive impairments compared to healthy people. results demonstrate that pyrenyl carbon nanostructures-based fdh bioelectrode design represents novelty and simplicity for enzyme-selective electrochemical quantitation of small 30 da formaldehyde. broader applicability of the presented approach for other small-molecule markers is feasible that requires only the design of appropriate marker-specific enzyme systems or receptor molecules.

asthma	the japanese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases 2017 (jagl 2017) includes a minor revision of the japanese pediatric guideline for the treatment and management of asthma 2012 (jpgl 2012) by the japanese society of pediatric allergy and clinical immunology. the section on child asthma in jagl 2017 provides information on how to diagnose asthma between infancy and adolescence (0-15 years of age). it makes recommendations for best practices in the management of childhood asthma, including management of acute exacerbations and non-pharmacological and pharmacological management. this guideline will be of interest to non-specialist physicians involved in the care of children with asthma. jagl differs from the global initiative for asthma guideline in that jagl emphasizes diagnosis and early intervention of children with asthma at <2 years or 2-5 years of age. the first choice of treatment depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms. pharmacological management, including step-up or step-down of drugs used for long-term management based on the status of asthma control levels, is easy to understand; thus, this guideline is suitable for the routine medical care of children with asthma. jagl also recommends using a control test in children, so that the physician aims for complete control by avoiding exacerbating factors and appropriately using anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists). copyright (c) 2016, japanese society of allergology. production and hosting by elsevier b.v.
osteoarthritis	introduction the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical, radiographic short-term results and complications after surgical hip dislocation in young patients (<= 18 years). materials and methods clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed in patients who underwent a surgical hip dislocation ganz-type approach between 2008 and 2012. diagnosis included legg-calve-perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, femoroacetabular impingement, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, multiple hereditary exostoses and pigmented villonodular synovitis. clinical data, the modified harris hip score, nonarthritic hip score, 12-item short form health survey, the stulberg classification, morphometric indexes, signs of osteonecrosis and osteoarthrosis were used for the evaluation. results after a mean 3 years follow-up (range 0.5-6 years), 53 hips (51 patients) were evaluated. the most common diagnoses were legg-calve-perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, femoroacetabular impingement and multiple hereditary exostoses. mean age at surgery was 14 years (range 10-18 years). through this approach femoral head-neck osteoplasty, dunn-type osteotomy, labrum refixation, synovectomy, femoral head mosaicplasty open reduction and fixation for slipped capital femoral epiphysis were performed, finally in association with pelvic or intertrochanteric osteotomy. at follow-up, better outcome scores were obtained, progression of the osteonecrosis of the femoral head was observed in four cases and three further patients required the implant of a total hip prosthesis. conclusions after 3 years follow-up, results are comparable to previous studies and patients have a high rate of satisfaction, however the effectiveness of those procedures have to be proved on the long term. results and complications seem to be related with preoperative lesion(s) and type of treatment.
lymphoma	background: non-small-cell lung cancers with met amplification may respond to c-met inhibitors. methods: we examined lung adenocarcinoma patients for mutations and amplification status of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk), ros, met. the clinical characteristics of patients with met amplification and their responses to met inhibitor therapy were studied. results: of the 76 patients analyzed, 5 were positive for c-met gene amplification and 4 cases showed an intermediate result. for 12 patients who were egfr positive, a c-met analysis on secondary biopsy tissue was performed following disease progression. all 5 c-met-positive patients were men. the age range in the study was 34-83 years. 4 of the 5 patients were started on crizotinib. 2 of these cases were positive following tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 3 patients showed a response. 1 patient showed no response and was later found to have a concurrent t790m mutation. conclusions: there are 2 categories of met gene amplification in lung cancer patients, de novo and that secondary to tki therapy. these patients can benefit from met inhibitor therapy. dual mechanisms of resistance, egfr t790m mutation and c-met amplification after tki therapy, may suggest a poor prognosis.

children's_health	many studies have highlighted the widespread use of skin-lightening creams containing mercury by women during and after pregnancy to remove dark spots. women, especially pregnant and lactating mothers using these products are at risk of mercury poisoning because sometimes it has no clinical symptoms, particularly during early exposure. studies have shown that prenatal and postnatal mercury exposure can cause permanent neurological damage in children. furthermore, mercury can cause women infertility and birth defects. even though several studies have examined the reproductive and/or developmental consequences of gestational and lactational mercury exposure from fish consumption and/or dental amalgam, no studies have assessed the possible effects of the long-term use of mercury-containing skin-lightening products by women of childbearing age on their pregnancy outcome and children 's health. this commentary aims to collate information on the popular use of mercury-containing skin-lightening creams and sheds the light to the readers about the limitations of the available data on its impact during a prenatal and/or postnatal period. there is an urgent need to assess the adverse health effects of applying these products during pregnancy or lactation on child growth and development through birth cohort studies. until data from these studies are available, women should be advised not to use topical skin-lightening creams during pregnancy and lactation.

asthma	introduction: early origins of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been recognized. impulse oscillometry (ios) is suitable for assessment of lung function also in preschool children, and some novel indices have been connected to assessment of small airway function. however, limited data exist on the sensitivity of these new indices to detect lung function deficits in young symptomatic children. methods: ios measurements of 103 healthy preschool children were evaluated to establish reference equations for the difference between respiratory resistance at 5 and 20 hz (r5-20), the relative difference of r5-20 (r5-20%), and area under the reactance curve (ax). thereafter, ios results of children with late-onset troublesome lung symptoms (n = 20), a history of early wheeze (n = 37), or a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd, n = 8) were compared to healthy children. results: none of the patient groups differed from healthy regarding respiratory resistance at 5hz (r5), and only children with a history of bpd differed from healthy regarding respiratory reactance at 5hz (x5). in contrast, z-scores of r5-20, r5-20%, and ax were significantly higher in all patient groups than in healthy children (p < 0.001), showing improved sensitivity (20-55%) compared to r5 and x5 (5-6%). conclusion: r5-20, r5-20%, and ax are superior to conventional ios parameters in distinguishing children with current or past lower respiratory tract symptoms from healthy, and may prove valuable for screening early lung function deficits.

psoriatic_arthritis	introduction: in numerous clinical practice guidelines, emphasis is placed on the need for coordinated care of psoriatic arthritis (psa) between rheumatologists and the objective was to develop experience-based points to consider facilitating the implementation of multidisciplinary units (dermatology/rheumatology) for the management of patients with psa. methods: a scientific committee of rheumatology and dermatology experts in the management of psa, and with experience in joint care, discussed the critical aspects of multidisciplinary psa units. the discussion became the basis for a delphi survey in two rounds submitted to a panel of 24 specialists in rheumatology and dermatology not involved in psa units. the statements and practices that reached a consensus were summarized and further elaborated. results: after two delphi rounds, agreement was reached for 49 of the 50 proposed statements. these included a justification of the units, objectives, and utilities, as well as operational aspects of the units, such as the minimal and ideal premises, referral criteria, and necessary resources. the statements were compiled in 11 points to consider. conclusions: this consensus offers some points to consider, including premises and recommendations, for the development of specialized units in the management of psa based on expert opinion. we trust these guidelines may facilitate their implementation in the future.
asthma	a shared approach to decision-making framework has been suggested for chronic disease management especially where multiple treatment options exist. shared decision-making (sdm) requires that both physician and patients are actively engaged in the decision-making process, including information exchange; expressing treatment preferences; as well as agreement over the final treatment decision. although sdm appears well supported by patients, practitioners and policymakers alike, the current challenge is to determine how best to make sdm a reality in everyday clinical practice. within the context of asthma, adherence rates are poor and are linked to outcomes such as reduced asthma control, increased symptoms, healthcare expenditures, and lower patient quality of life. it has been suggested that sdm can improve treatment adherence and that ignoring patients' personal goals and preferences may result in reduced rates of adherence. furthermore, understanding predictors of poor treatment adherence is a necessary step toward developing effective strategies to improve the patient-reported and clinically important outcomes. here, we describe why a shared approach to treatment decision-making for asthma has the potential to be an effective tool for improving adherence, with associated clinical and patient-related outcomes. in addition, we explore insights into the reasons why sdm has not been implemented into routine clinical practice.
autism	maternal exposure to environmental pollutants could affect fetal brain development and increase autism spectrum disorder (asd) risk in conjunction with differential genetic susceptibility. organohalogen congeners measured in maternal midpregnancy blood samples have recently shown significant, but negative associations with offspring asd outcome. we report the first large-scale maternal and fetal genetic study of the midpregnancy serum levels of a set of 21 organohalogens in a subset of 790 genotyped women and 764 children collected in california by the early markers for autism (ema) project. levels of pcb (polychlorinated biphenyl) and pbde (polybrominated diphenyl ether) congeners showed high maternal and fetal estimated snp-based heritability (h(g)(2)) accounting for 39-99% of the total variance. genome-wide association analyses identified significant maternal loci for p,p-dde (p = 7.8 x 10(-11)) in the cyp2b6 gene and for bde-28 (p = 3.2 x 10(-8)) near the sh3gl2 gene, both involved in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism. fetal genetic loci contributed to the levels of bde-100 (p = 4.6 x 10(-8)) and pcb187 (p = 2.8 x 10(-8)), near the potential metabolic genes loxhd1 and ptprd, previously implicated in neurodevelopment. negative associations were observed for bde-100, bde153, and the sum of pbdes with asd, partly explained by genome-wide additive genetic effects that predicted pbde levels. our results support genetic control of midgestational biomarkers for environmental exposures by nonoverlapping maternal and fetal genetic determinants, suggesting that future studies of environmental risk factors should take genetic variation into consideration. the independent influence of fetal genetics supports previous hypotheses that fetal genotypes expressed in placenta can influence maternal physiology and the transplacental transfer of organohalogens.
rheumatoid_arthritis	replacement of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints (mcpj) with silastic swanson 's implants can help decrease pain, stiffness and allow for improved function in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). there is a lack of patient reported outcome measure (prom) studies assessing the efficacy of this procedure in ra. the aim of this study was to report any change in function, pain, stiffness and satisfaction following the swanson mcpj replacement using patient reported outcomes in a rheumatoid population. the combined results of 64 ra patients (71 hands) with 284 swanson mcpj arthroplasties (mean follow-up: 75.85 months) were assessed using the validated m-sacrah questionnaire and a separate satisfaction questionnaire. radiographic evaluation was performed to insure correct alignment of the hinged prosthesis postoperatively. no attempt was made to identify other predictors, radiologically or clinically. data analysed in the study was interpreted in the context of the number of hands and survivorship was defined as implant fracture, loosening or revision. the mean total functional outcome score improved by 46.2% and the total pain outcome improved by 60.2%. the total stiffness outcome improved by 56.9% postoperatively and the results obtained from the satisfaction questions revealed that 73.2% of patients would retrospectively elect to have the procedure again. we report two postoperative complications in this group of superficial wound infections. radiographically, all mcpjs showed improved alignment, however five patients reported worsening pain, four patients reported increased stiffness and four reported reduced function postoperatively. there was one re-operation of a 5th mcpj swanson 's, which did not require implant exchange and one implant was revised. implant survivorship was 98.6%. patient satisfaction and functional surrogate markers were overall favourable. our results support the continued use of swanson silastic arthoplasty in advanced ra.
atopic_dermatitis	background: it is assumed that beside alterations in the filaggrin gene (flg), disturbances within genes encoding other cornified envelope proteins are also involved in atopic dermatitis (ad). to identify new potential markers of ad, we studied the polymorphisms of genes encoding repetin (rptn), cornulin (crnn), and their expression in the skin of ad patients. methods: polymorphisms in crnn (rs941934), rptn (rs284544, rs28441202, rs3001978, and rs12117644), and flg mutations (r2447x, s3247x) were analyzed by taqman genotyping assay and by pcr-rflp in the blood samples of 159 ad patients and 108 healthy subjects.the expression levels of crnn and rptn were determined by qrt-pcr in 34 ad skin samples (17 lesional and 17 nonlesional) and in 27 skin biopsies from healthy volunteers. the ad patients were recruited from the clinic of the university hospital between 2012 and 2014. results: crnn rs941934 (a allele) was associated with ad (or 2.095, p = 0.008), a severe course of disease (p = 0.041), elevated ige levels (p = 0.047), eosinophilia (p = 0.018), and concomitant asthma (p = 0.004). the mrna level of crnn was decreased in the ad skin (p = 0.041). in the ad patients without flg mutations, the cc genotype of rptn rs3001978 was associated with ad (or 0.39, p = 0.037), early age at onset (p = 0.033), pruritus (p = 0.021), severity of ad (p = 0.045), and concomitant asthma (p = 0.041). the elevated mrna levels of rptn in lesional (p < 0.001) and nonlesional (p = 0.017) ad skin were observed. conclusions: the single-nucleotide polymorphisms of crnn (rs941934) and rptn (rs3001978, rs28441202) may contribute to ad development, but further studies on a larger group of ad patients are needed to verify this assumption.

bipolar_disorder	background: this study aims to establish if adult patients with major depressive disorder (mdd) and childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) symptoms would be more frequently within the bipolar spectrum than depressed patients without childhood adhd. methods: this study was carried out in outpatients recruited by psychiatrists in private practice, with 3963 participants being included in the final sample. clinicians filled out questionnaires about current depressive symptoms in their patients, lifetime bipolar symptoms, global assessment of functioning and parental history of both major depression and bipolar disorder. patients assessed current level of anxiety and depressive symptoms and antecedents of childhood adhd symptoms. results: depressed adults with significant childhood adhd symptoms had a specific pattern of their major depressive episode compared to depressed patients without such symptoms. subjects with childhood adhd symptoms were more likely to report lifetime symptoms of mania/hypomania and to have a parent with type i or ii bipolar disorder. the developmental trajectories of familial risk for lifetime bipolar symptoms showed that parental bipolar disorder influenced lifetime bipolar symptoms both through a direct pathway and an indirect pathway involving childhood adhd symptoms. childhood adhd and number of depressive symptoms both made direct contributions to lifetime bipolar symptoms.
medicare	study design. a retrospective, observational study. objective. the aim of this study was to determine the utilization of various treatment modalities in the management of degenerative spondylolisthesis within medicare beneficiaries. summary of background data. degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a condition often identified in symptomatic low back pain. a variety of treatment algorithms including physical therapy and interventional techniques can be used to manage clinically significant degenerative spondylolisthesis. methods. this study utilized the 5% national sample of medicare carrier claims from 2000 through 2011. a cohort of beneficiaries with a new international classification of diseases 9th edition (icd-9) diagnosis code for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis was identified. current procedural terminology codes were used to identify the number of procedures performed each year by specialty on this cohort. results. a total of 95,647 individuals were included in the analysis. average age at the time of initial diagnosis was 72.8 +/- 9.8 years. within this study cohort, spondylolisthesis was more prevalent in females (69%) than males and in caucasians (88%) than other racial demographics. over 50% of beneficiaries underwent at least one injection, approximately one-third (37%) participated in physical therapy, one in five (21%) underwent spinal surgery, and one-third (36%) did not utilize any of these interventions. greater than half of all procedures (124,280/216,088) occurred within 2 years of diagnosis. the ratio of focal interventions (transforaminal and facet interventions) to less selective (interlaminar) procedures was greater for the specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation than for the specialties of anesthesiology, interventional radiology, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery. the majority of physical therapy was dedicated to passive treatment modalities and range of motion exercises rather than active strengthening modalities within this cohort. conclusion. interventional techniques and physical therapy are frequently used treatment modalities for symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis. understanding utilization of these techniques is important to determine relative clinical efficacies and to optimize future health care expenditures.
autism	the ability to recursively infer the mental states of others to explain their complex behavior in ambiguous social situation may be called advanced theory of mind (atom). the relations between two components of atom, cognitive and affective, measured on a behavioral level in 151 polish 13-year-olds and 174 16-year-olds was examined. the role of age, gender and friendship style and its relations to the cognitive and affective atom was explored. cognitive atom was only weakly to moderately related to affective atom. across both age groups females scored higher than males. males' atom abilities did not differ according to age, but they scored higher in the cognitive atom than affective tom. also, different aspects of friendship style were significant predictors of both atom abilities. the implications for two atom components within a gendered social context were discussed.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	introduction: while many pharmacologic therapies for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) have been evaluated via randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (rcts) conducted over the past two decades, most therapies have been shown to be ineffective or even potentially harmful. however, a number of recently completed rcts have shown significant efficacy for pirfenidone and nintedanib for the treatment of ipf.areas covered: this manuscript reviews recent advances in the management of ipf and other forms of fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ild) with an emphasis on ipf. the material upon which this discussion is based was obtained from various published texts and manuscripts identified via literature searching (e.g. pubmed).expert commentary: anti-fibrotic drugs are now available for clinical use and perceived as standard-of-care therapies that have the potential to blunt disease progression for many patients with ipf. however, these agents do not necessarily stop disease progression or have a significant impact on mortality, and more effective pharmacologic therapies are needed for patients with ipf. additionally, whether anti-fibrotic agents can be effective therapies for other forms of pulmonary fibrosis, which often have radiologic and histopathologic manifestations that mimic ipf, is being evaluated in a number of rcts.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	purposechronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is an irreversible lung disease characterized by small-airway obstruction and alveolar-airspace destruction. hyperpolarized xe-129 diffusion mri of lung is a promising biomarker for assessing airspace enlargement, but has yet to be validated by direct comparison to lung histology. here we have compared diffusion measurements of hyperpolarized (hp) xe-129 in explanted lungs to regionally matched morphological measures of airspace size. methodsexplanted lungs from five copd patients and two idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) patients were imaged using mri with hyperpolarized xe-129 using a two-b-value gradient-echo diffusion sequence, and 34 histological samples were taken from these lungs for quantitative histology. mean-linear-intercept (l-m) was compared with spatially matched measures of apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) from xe-129 mri. resultsthe mean adc from copd lung samples was 0.0710.011cm(2)/s, and for ipf lungs was 0.033 +/- 0.001cm(2)/s (p<10(-15) between groups). the mean l-m in copd samples was 0.076 +/- 0.027cm and 0.041 +/- 0.004cm in ipf (p=2.7x10(-7) between groups). the pearson-correlation between adc and l-m measurements was r=0.59. conclusionsdiffusion mri of hp xe-129 quantifies regional airspace enlargement in copd. xe-129 adc showed much less overlap between groups than quantitative histology, consistent with our past experience with he-3 diffusion mri in copd. magn reson med 77:265-272, 2017.

asthma	backgroundguidelines and position papers indicate that allergen immunotherapy (ait) is the only disease-modifying treatment, including prevention of the onset of new allergen sensitizations. however, this preventive effect was shown by only a few observational studies. our aim was to systematically review the efficacy of ait in preventing the onset of new allergen sensitizations. methodscomputerized bibliographic searches of medline, embase, and the cochrane library (through june 2015) were supplemented with manual searches of reference lists. observational studies or randomized controlled trials with a long-term observation period were included. paired reviewers extracted data about study characteristics and assessed biases. the end point was the risk difference in the onset of new allergen sensitizations between patients treated with ait and pharmacotherapy. the strength of the evidence was graded based on the risk of bias, consistency, and magnitude of effect, according to the grade working group 's guide. resultseighteen studies (1049 children, 10057 adults) met the inclusion criteria. the risk of bias was high in all but one study. low evidence supports the position that ait prevents the onset of new allergen sensitizations, with 10 of 18 studies reporting a reduction in the onset of new sensitizations in patients treated with ait vs placebo. small studies and studies with a shorter follow-up showed the highest benefit of ait. conclusionsthe overall evidence provides a low-grade level of the evidence supporting the efficacy of ait in preventing the onset of new allergen sensitizations, but high-quality studies could change this estimate.
addiction	pharmaceutical opioid (po) use and harms are increasing dramatically. treatment related stigma may present as a treatment barrier for people who use po. additionally, differences in social support between po and other opioid treatment populations may positively influence treatment outcomes. a scoping methodology was utilised to map current knowledge, with searches performed in medline, psycinfo and embase. eligibility criteria required articles related to stigma and social support in treatment for po use. the search identified 44 relevant articles. stigma themes included individual perceptions of opioid dependence, community perceptions of opioid dependence, blame as a stigmatising factor, language surrounding opioid use, and treatment experience. social support themes included family as support, web-based support, friends as support, partners as support and social network therapy. limited literature was found focussing specifically on stigma and social support in people who use po, highlighting that this is an important area for future work.
bipolar_disorder	background. the purpose of this study was to evaluate a programme of lesion surgery carried out on patients with treatment-resistant depression (trd). method. this was a retrospective study looking at clinical and psychometric data from 45 patients with trd who had undergone bilateral stereotactic anterior capsulotomy surgery over a period of 15 years, with the approval of the mental health act commission (37 with unipolar depression and eight with bipolar disorder). the beck depression inventory (bdi) before and after surgery was used as the primary outcome measure. the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale was administered and cognitive aspects of executive and memory functions were also examined. we carried out a paired-samples t test on the outcome measures to determine any statistically significant change in the group as a consequence of surgery. results. patients improved on the clinical measure of depression after surgery by -21.20 points on the bdi with a 52% change. there were no significant cognitive changes post-surgery. six patients were followed up in 2013 by phone interview and reported a generally positive experience. no major surgical complications occurred. conclusions. with the limitations of an uncontrolled, observational study, our data suggest that capsulotomy can be an effective treatment for otherwise trd. performance on neuropsychological tests did not deteriorate.
atrial_fibrillation	acute stress impairs the hippocampusdependent spatial memory retrieval, and its synaptic mechanisms are associated with hippocampal ca1 long-term depression (ltd) enhancement in the adult rats. endogenous hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is recognized as a novel gasotransmitter and has the neural protective roles. however, very little attention has been paid to understanding the effects of h2s on spatial memory retrieval impairment. we observed the protective effects of nahs (a donor of h2s) against spatial memory retrieval impairment caused by acute stress and its synaptic mechanisms. our results showed that nahs abolished spatial memory retrieval impairment and hippocampal ca1 ltd enhancement caused by acute stress, but not by glutamate transporter inhibitor l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic (tpdc), indicating that the activation of glutamate transporters is necessary for exogenous h2s to exert its roles. moreover, nahs restored the decreased glutamate uptake in the hippocampal ca1 synaptosomal fraction caused by acute stress. dithiothreitol (dtt, a disulfide reducing agent) abolished a decrease in the glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, and nahs eradicated the decreased glutamate uptake caused by 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic)acid (dtnb, a thiol oxidizing agent), collectively, revealing that exogenous h2s increases glutamate uptake by reducing disulfide bonds of the glutamate transporters. additionally, nahs inhibited the increased expression level of phosphorylated c -jun -n terminal kinase (jnk) in the hippocampal ca1 region caused by acute stress. the jnk inhibitor sp600125 eliminated spatial memory retrieval impairment, hippocampal ca1 ltd enhancement and the decreased glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, indicating that exogenous h2s exerts these roles by inhibiting the activation of jnk signaling pathway.

healthy_sleep	primary care is a critical setting for screening and management of pediatric sleep difficulties. this review summarizes studies examining the prevalence of sleep problems in primary care settings as well as current practices in screening, diagnosis, and management, including behavioral recommendations and medications. potential barriers to effectively addressing sleep are also reviewed. despite the high prevalence of pediatric sleep problems in primary care, rates of screening and management are low. primary care providers receive minimal sleep training and have resulting gaps in knowledge and confidence. parents similarly have gaps in knowledge and many factors contribute to their identification of sleep as problematic. recommendations to improve the provision of sleep services in pediatric primary care are made in the areas of research, practice, and education.

bipolar_disorder	visual-spatial working memory measures are widely used in clinical and experimental settings. furthermore, it has been argued that the male advantage in spatial abilities can be explained by a sex difference in visual-spatial working memory. therefore, sex differences in visual-spatial working memory have important implication for research, theory, and practice, but they have yet to be quantified. the present meta-analysis quantified the magnitude of sex differences in visual-spatial working memory and examined variables that might moderate them. the analysis used a set of 180 effect sizes from healthy males and females drawn from 98 samples ranging in mean age from 3 to 86 years. multilevel meta-analysis was used on the overall data set to account for non-independent effect sizes. the data also were analyzed in separate task subgroups by means of multilevel and mixed-effects models. results showed a small but significant male advantage (mean d = 0.155, 95 % confidence interval = 0.087-0.223). all the tasks produced a male advantage, except for memory for location, where a female advantage emerged. age of the participants was a significant moderator, indicating that sex differences in visual-spatial working memory appeared first in the 13-17 years age group. removing memory for location tasks from the sample affected the pattern of significant moderators. the present results indicate a male advantage in visual-spatial working memory, although age and specific task modulate the magnitude and direction of the effects. implications for clinical applications, cognitive model building, and experimental research are discussed.
mental_health	background: there is a shortage of nurses working in the mental health field globally. the aim of the present study was to examine singapore nursing students' attitudes towards specializing in psychiatric nursing by examining the pre-nursing and nursing school factors as well as attitudes towards psychiatry and personality traits. methods: a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 500 nursing students from four nursing institutions in singapore. students' attitudes towards psychiatry (atp-18), perception of psychiatric nursing career aspects relative to other fields, and personality traits (mini-ipip) were assessed. the main outcome measure was likelihood of specializing in psychiatric nursing. logistic regression was used to examine the combined effect of factors upon the outcome. results: twenty-six students (5.2%) rated ""definitely decided to do"" psychiatric nursing. pre-nursing school factors associated with choosing psychiatry included ethnicity, current education, parents' wishes, having personal/family experience of mental illness, prior work experience, interest in psychiatric nursing and psychology module taken prior to current school admission. nursing school factors such as teaching methods and clinical exposure were not associated with choosing psychiatric nursing. positive attitudes towards psychiatry, perception of better career aspects in psychiatric nursing relative to other fields, and the personality traits of extraversion and intellect/imagination were associated with likelihood of choosing psychiatric nursing. logistic regression revealed malay (or: 1.90, 1.14-3.16, p = 0.013) and indian ethnicity (or: 2.56,1.32-4.96, p = 0.005), interest in psychiatry (or: 22.56, 8.22-61.92, p < 0.001), psychology module prior to current school admission (or: 2.31, 1.28-4.17, p = 0.005), better perceived job prospects in psychiatric nursing than other fields (or: 1.91,1.21-3.04, p = 0.006), extraversion (or: 1.09, 1.02-1.17, p = 0.012) and positive attitude towards psychiatry (or: 2.72, 1.75-4.23, p < 0.001) as factors associated with students choosing psychiatric nursing. conclusions: the selection of psychiatry as a specialty by nursing students was affected by pre-nursing school factors. taking these factors into consideration may improve recruitment and alleviate the shortages in the psychiatric nursing field.

addiction	rationale tobacco has a higher rate of dependence than other drugs of abuse. however, the psychopharmacological effects of nicotine are incongruent with the tenacity of tobacco addiction since nicotine does not produce robust euphoria in humans or self-administration in rodents. a potential explanation is that nicotine amplifies the salience of other stimuli that have some incentive value, which could influence the initiation and persistence of smoking. however, the neural mechanisms of this process are unknown. objectives one way that nicotine may amplify the salience of other stimuli is by enhancing reward prediction errors. we hypothesized that nicotine would enhance the neural response to unexpected (relative to expected) rewards compared to placebo. methods twenty-three nonsmokers underwent two fmri scans, following nicotine (1 mg) or placebo administration, while performing an outcome expectation task. in the task, a pair of cues was associated with either a subsequent reward (the image of a $100 bill) or a nonreward (the image of a blurry rectangle). on 20% of trials, the cue was followed by an unexpected outcome. results although nicotine did not affect the magnitude of prediction errors relative to placebo, nicotine did increase bold activation in the anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus and decrease activation in the caudate across all outcome types (including both rewards and nonrewards). conclusions the insula and caudate could play a role in the initial effects of nicotine in nonsmokers, and these changes in baseline may be the mechanism that underlies how nicotine amplifies the salience of nondrug stimuli.
psoriasis	nanotechnology and material surface modification have provided a functional platform for the advancement of several medical fields such as dermatology. furthermore, the smart choice of preparation material was proven to confer unique properties to the develbped nanosystems. in this context, we focused on the sphingolipid ""cer-amide"", whose deficiency was found to negatively affect psoriasis. ceramide was doped into surfactant based vesicular.phospholipid systems to create tubulated vesicles ""cerosomes"" loaded with a model anti-psoriatic drug ""tazarotene"", and their properties were tested as compared to ceramide free vesicles. cerosomes were characterized for their drug entrapment, viscosity, in vitro drug release, morphology, ex vivo drug skin deposition, thermal behavior, and were clinically tested on psoriatic patients. the factorial design study revealed that the surfactant type, the ceramide: surfactant ratio, and the presence of ethanol in the hydration buffer affected the entrapment efficiency and the viscosity of the vesicles. ceramide increased the entrapment of tazarotene, decreased its release while enhancing its deposition within the skin, correlating with better clinical therapeutic outcome compared to the topical marketed product. ceramide was also able to cause significant membrane tubulation in the vesicles, causing them to deviate from the conventional spherical morphology. as a conclusion, cerosomes present a new functional treatment modality for psoriasis which is worthy of future experimentation.(c) 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
atrial_fibrillation	vitamin k antagonists (vkas) have been the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy for more than 50 years. vkas are mainly used for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (af) and the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. in the past 5 years, four new agents-the direct factor xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran [collectively known as direct oral anticoagulants (doacs) or non-vka oral anticoagulants]- have been approved for these and other indications. despite these new treatment options, the vka warfarin currently remains the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant. the availability of doacs provides an alternative management option for patients with af, especially when the treating physician is hesitant to prescribe a vka owing to associated limitations, such as food and drug interactions, and concerns about bleeding complications. currently available real-world evidence shows that doacs have similar or improved effectiveness and safety outcomes compared with warfarin. treatment decisions on which doac is best suited for which patient to maximize safety and effectiveness should take into account not only clinically relevant patient characteristics but also patient preference. this article reviews and highlights real and perceived implications of vkas for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular af, with specific reference to their strengths and weaknesses compared with doacs.
kidney_health	uruguay and bolivia are two countries that show heterogenicity of the latin american region, including the national income, the expenditure on health and the services for renal care. in bolivia, there is manpower shortage for renal care with only 5 nephrologists per million people (pmp) and the prevalence of patients on dialysis is only 200 pmp. this is much lower than the mean prevalence rate of renal replacement therapy for latin america as a whole. uruguay on the other hand has more dedicated renal resources with 50 nephrologists pmp, and renal replacement therapy is provided to similar to 1,000 dialysis patients pmp. in november 2012, a collaborative project financed by the uruguayan international cooperation agency was signed by both the uruguay and bolivia ministries of health, and the goal was to develop a comprehensive program for the prevention and management of all stages of chronic kidney disease (ckd) in bolivia. the specific objectives were to: a) promote renal healthcare in the primary healthcare setting, b) identify kidney disease in populations at risk, and c) optimize patient care at all stages of ckd, including dialysis and transplantation supported with a national esrd registry in bolivia. as a first step, delegates from the bolivian health ministry, visited uruguay in april 2014, primarily to strengthen the development of tools required for developing and maintaining a national registry. in addition, during this visit, a meeting with the president of the latin american society of nephrology and hypertension (slanh) culminated in designing a training program for peritoneal dialysis. this highly cooperative relationship is advancing the prevention and care of ckd in bolivia and may serve as a model for international approaches to advance system level ckd care in countries with limited healthcare resources.
crohn's_disease	prebiotics are non-digestible selectively fermented dietary fibers that specifically promote the growth of one or more bacterial genera in the gastrointestinal tract and thus provide health benefit to the host. the two most investigated prebiotics being the inulin-type fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides. prebiotic specificity is mediated through speciesspecific gene clusters within saccharolytic bacteria controlled by signaling sensors for various substrates. prebiotic health benefits are attributed to immune regulation and bacterial metabolite production. in humans, prebiotic supplementation leads to increased growth of specific gut microbiota (e.g., bifidobacteria), immune modulation, and depending on the bacterial augmentation, short-chain fatty acid production. irritable bowel syndrome and crohn 's disease are gastrointestinal disorders associated with reductions in some gut bacteria and greater mucosal inflammation. prebiotic supplementation studies have shown some promise at low doses for modulation of the gut bacteria and reduction of symptoms in ibs; however, larger doses may have neutral or negative impact on symptoms. studies in crohn 's disease have not shown benefit to bacterial modulation or inflammatory response with prebiotic supplementation. dietary restriction of fermentable carbohydrates (low fodmap diet), which restricts some naturally occurring prebiotics from the diet, has shown efficacy in improving symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome, but it lowers the numbers of some key gut microbiota. further research is required on the effect of prebiotics in gastrointestinal disorders and, in particular, on their use in conjunction with the low fodmap diet.
psoriasis	objective. to compare the screening performance of the psoriasis epidemiology screening tool (pest), psoriatic arthritis screening and evaluation (pase) and early arthritis for psoriatic patients (earp) questionnaires for detecting psa among psoriasis patients in a primary care setting. methods. in a cross-sectional study, 473 primary care psoriasis patients at risk for psa completed the pest, pase and earp questionnaires and were clinically evaluated by a trained research nurse. a psa case was defined by a rheumatologist according to the caspar criteria. sensitivity and specificity were determined for the pest and earp cut-offs (a (c) 3/43) and the pase cut-offs (a (c) 3/4 44 and a (c) 3/4 47). results. psa was diagnosed in 53 patients. the pest had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.71. the pase was validated for two different cut-offs. the cut-off of 47 led to a sensitivity of 0.59 and a specificity of 0.66, whereas the lower cut-off of 44 led to a sensitivity of 0.66 and a specificity of 0.57. for the earp we found a sensitivity of 0.87 with a specificity of 0.34. conclusion. the pest questionnaire has the most favourable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity to screen for psa. however, as the prevalence of psoriasis and psa is fairly low in primary care, screening only psoriasis patients with musculoskeletal complaints may be a better allocation of resources.
osteoporosis	the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of using the time-reversed lamb wave as a new method for noninvasive characterization of long cortical bones. the group velocity of the time reversed lamb wave launched by using the modified time reversal method was measured in 15 bovine tibiae, and their correlations with the bone properties of the tibia were examined. the group velocity of the time-reversed lamb wave showed significant positive correlations with the bone properties (r=0.55-0.81). the best univariate predictor of the group velocity of the time-reversed lamb wave was the cortical thickness, yielding an adjusted squared correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.64. these results imply that the group velocity of the time-reversed lamb wave, in addition to the velocities of the first arriving signal and the slow guided wave, could potentially be used as a discriminator for osteoporosis.

bipolar_disorder	background: medication discontinuation remains a big hurdle for retaining persons with schizophrenia under the treatment ambit. it is imperative to understand reasons for the same to effectively tackle it. methods: the study was carried out in turuvekere, a rural south indian taluk (an administrative block). qualitative interviews were conducted with consenting consecutive nineteen patients (along with their family members) who had discontinued medications. all interviews were transcribed. enlisted reasons were then color coded to synthesize different factors. from the 16th patient onward, no new reason emerged. three more interviews were done to ensure that there was no additional reason. results: the following factors (average 4.26 factors per patient) led to medication discontinuation: (1) lack of support/supervision from family/well-wishers (n = 14/ 19 [73.68%]); (2) lack of insight and cooperation from the patient (n = 11; [57.89%]); (3) lack of awareness about the illness (8 [42.10%]); (4) adverse effects of medications (n = 8; [42.10%]); (5) financial factors (n = 8; [42.10%]); (6) distance/transport (n = 8; [42.10%]); (7) lack of knowledge about treatment process (n = 7; [36.84%]); (8) perceived lack of beneficial effects of treatment (n = 5; [26.32%]); (9) treatment center-related issues (n = 4; [21.05%]); and others. conclusions: medication discontinuation is driven by a diverse set of interrelated factors among community-living persons with schizophrenia. professionals need to be aware of this complexity to effectively manage the problem.
asthma	biologic therapies are emerging as a significant therapeutic option for many with debilitating inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. as expansion in the number of fda-approved agents continue to be seen, more unanticipated adverse reactions are likely to occur. currently, the diagnostic tools, including skin testing and in vitro testing, to evaluate for immediate hypersensitivity reactions are insufficient. in this review, management strategies for common acute infusion reactions, injection site reactions, and immediate reactions suggestive of ige-mediated mechanisms are discussed. desensitization can be considered for reactions suggestive of ige-mediated mechanisms, but allergists/immunologists should be involved in managing these patients.
atrial_fibrillation	background: catheter ablations have been traditionally performed with the use of fluoroscopic guidance, which exposes the patient and staff to the inherent risks of radiation. we have developed techniques to eliminate the use of fluoroscopy during cardiac ablations and have been performing completely fluoroless catheter ablations on our patients for over 5 years. methods: we present a retrospective analysis of the safety, efficacy, and feasibility data from 500 consecutive patients who underwent nonfluoroscopic catheter ablation, targeting a total of 639 arrhythmias, including atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (avrt), atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (avnrt), atrial tachycardia (at), atrial fibrillation (af), premature ventricular contractions (pvcs), and ventricular tachycardia (vt). we perform fluoroless ablations using intracardiac electrograms, electroanatomic mapping, and for most cases intracardiac echocardiography. our experience includes exclusively endocardial cardiac ablations. results: the mean follow-up was 20.5 months. recurrence rate for avrt was 6.5%, for avnrt 2.5%, for macro-reentrant at 6.4%, for focal at 5.4%, for af 22.6%, for pvc 6.7%, and for vt 21.4%. major complications occurred in five patients (1.0%); minor complications occurred in three patients (0.6%). no deaths occurred. fluoroscopy was used in one instance, for 0.3 minutes, to confirm venous access. conclusions: completely fluoroless catheter ablations may be routinely performed for all endocardial ablations without compromising safety, efficacy, or procedural duration.
children's_health	background: this study aimed to determine the frequency of entamoeba histolytica and entamoeba dispar infection in school children in the community of tlaltizapan, in order to understand the dynamics of infection within the school and family spheres of this population. amoebiasis is an unsolved public health problem and an endemic disease in mexico. the incidence rate varies depending on the state; the most affected states show the highest numbers of new cases of amoebiasis per year. previously, we reported the molecular frequency of infection with e. histolytica and/or e. dispar in other rural communities of the state of morelos. methods: children from 3 schools were studied to estimate the frequency of intestinal parasites through microscopic examination of fresh stool samples. the number of studied individuals were 309 school children. the molecular characterization of e. histolytica or e. dispar was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using species-specific primers to amplify short tandem repeats (str) in non-coding sequences associated with the trna gene; the amplified fragments were sequenced and analyzed. results: eight different genotypes were obtained from e. dispar isolates with the molecular marker nkd3-d5. none of the cases in which the species e. histolytica was detected developed symptoms attributable to an invasive process of disease. moreover, the parasitized condition appeared to have no significant impact on the development or nutritional status of affected children. genotype 1, which corresponds to the reference strain e. dispar saw760, considered a non-pathogenic amoeba, was the most prevalent. conclusions: the comparison of the genotypes of entamoeba species did not show a correlation between children and their relatives. in this community, the species entamoeba dispar genotype 1 was the most widespread. based on the indicators of growth, development and nutrition status, the studied community seems to be reasonably adapted to constant exposure to intestinal parasites, since there were no evidences of a serious impact of the parasitized condition on the children 's health.
healthy_sleep	the major function of the lying furniture is to meet the needs of one 's rest and sleep, and to fully regenerate the body energy by its correct positioning. this can be obtained only if the structural types of such furniture comply with the anthropometric measures of the user and other physical and mechanical properties in the interaction man - bed. the paper describes the results of research on bed ergonomics as the function of healthy sleep. presented ale the latest requirements considering the relation between the bed and the anthropometric and other requirements in use. the results show that the shape and dimensions of the lying furniture are determined by the structural shapes, materials and other factors such as the building standards for flats, furniture types, frame structure etc.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	objective. to characterize a cohort of patients with ra who have interstitial lung disease (ild) and to assess the utility of previously developed mortality staging systems [gender, age, lung physiology (gap) and ild-gap]. methods. all patients with ra and ild seen at the mayo clinic from 1998 to 2014 were identified and manually screened for study inclusion. ra disease characteristics and pulmonary findings including high-resolution ct and pulmonary function testing were evaluated. survival was estimated using kaplan-meier methods. gap and ild-gap models were evaluated using c-statistics and standardized incidence ratios. results. the study included 181 patients with ra-associated ild (96% caucasian; 48% females; 37% never-smokers). the mean age at ild diagnosis was 67.4 years (s.d. 9.9). the median time from ra diagnosis to ild was 4.9 years (range-10.9-48.1). the median follow-up was 3.1 years (range 0.01-14.8). age, ra disease duration and low initial diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide were predictive of premature mortality in multivariate modelling. sex, smoking status, obstructive lung disease, seropositivity and erosive disease were not associated with mortality. the 5-year survival rate was 59.7% (95% ci 51.5, 69.2). survival did not differ between usual interstitial pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia and organizing pneumonia (p = 0.42). the gap model performed well in this cohort for both discrimination and calibration (c-statistic 0.71, standardized incidence ratio 0.97). conclusion. in this large single-centre cohort of patients with ra-ild, most patients were seropositive and had a history of smoking. ild most commonly occurred after the ra diagnosis. mortality was high and did not differ among the types. the gap model may be useful in assessing mortality risk.
autism	intellectual disability (id) affects about 3% of the population and has a male gender bias. of at least 700 genes currently linked to id, more than 100 have been identified on the x chromosome, including kiaa2022. kiaa2022 is located on xq13.3 and is expressed in the developing brain. the protein product of kiaa2022, x-linked intellectual disability protein related to neurite extension (xpn), is developmentally regulated and is involved in neuronal migration and cell adhesion. the clinical manifestations of loss-of-function kiaa2022 mutations have been described previously in 15 males, born from unaffected carrier mothers, but few females. using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a cohort of five unrelated female patients with de novo probably gene damaging variants in kiaa2022 and core phenotypic features of id, developmental delay, epilepsy refractory to treatment, and impaired language, of similar severity as reported for male counterparts. this study supports kiaa2022 as a novel cause of x-linked dominant id, and broadens the phenotype for kiaa2022 mutations.
migraine	objective: elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (tmj) are implicated in the underlying pathology of temporomandibular disorders (tmd). tmd are a group of conditions that result in pain in the tmj and/or muscles of mastication, and are associated with significant social and economic burdens. the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of elevated tnf-alpha levels in the tmj capsule on nocifensive behavioral response to mechanical stimulation of trigeminal neurons and regulation of cytokines within the trigeminal ganglion. design: male sprague-dawley rats were injected bilaterally in the tmj capsule with tnf-alpha and changes in nocifensive head withdrawal responses to mechanical stimulation of cutaneous tissue directly over the capsule was determined using von frey filaments. cytokine levels in trigeminal ganglia were determined by protein array analysis at several time points post injection and correlated to nocifensive behavior. results: tnf-alpha caused a significant increase in the average number of nocifensive responses when compared to naive and vehicle treated animals 2 h post injection, but levels returned to control levels at 24 h. based on array analysis, the levels of eight cytokines were significantly elevated above vehicle control levels at 2 h following tnf-alpha injection, but all eight had returned to the vehicle control levels after 24 h. conclusions: our findings provide evidence that elevated levels of tnf-alpha in the joint capsule, which is reported to occur in tmd, promotes nociception in trigeminal ganglia neurons via a mechanism that temporally correlates with differential regulation of several cytokines.

autism	background: autism spectrum disorders (asds) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions that vary in both etiology and phenotypic expression. expressions of asd characterized by a more severe phenotype, including autism with intellectual disability (asd + id), autism with a history of developmental regression (asd + r), and minimally verbal autism (asd + mv) are understudied generally, and especially in the domain of neuroimaging. however, neuroimaging methods are a potentially powerful tool for understanding the etiology of these asd subtypes. scope and methodology: this review evaluates existing neuroimaging research on asd + mv, asd + id, and asd + r, identified by a search of the literature using the pubmed database, and discusses methodological, theoretical, and practical considerations for future research involving neuroimaging assessment of these populations. findings: there is a paucity of neuroimaging research on asd + id, asd + mv, and asd + r, and what findings do exist are often contradictory, or so sparse as to be ungeneralizable. we suggest that while greater sample sizes and more studies are necessary, more important would be a paradigm shift toward multimodal (e. g. imaging genetics) approaches that allow for the characterization of heterogeneity within etiologically diverse samples.
medicare	background: local tumour ablation (lta) may yield better perioperative outcomes than partial nephrectomy (pn), however the impact of each treatment on perioperative mortality and health care expenditures is unknown. the aim of the study was to compare mortality, morbidity and health care expenditures between lta and pn. patients and methods: a population-based assessment of 2471 patients with ctla kidney cancer treated with either lta or pn, between 2000 and 2009, in the seer-medicare database was performed. after propensity score matching, 30-day mortality, overall and specific complication rates, length of stay, readmission rates and health care expenditures according to lta or pn were estimated. multivariable logistic and linear models addressed the effect of each specific lta approach on overall complication rates, length of stay, readmission rates and health care expenditures. results: the 30-day mortality was <2% after either lta or pn (or 2.27, p = 0.2). the overall complication rate was 21% after lta and 40% after pn (or 0.38, p < 0.001). blood transfusions, infection/sepsis, wound infections, respiratory complications, gastrointestinal complications, acute kidney injury, and accidental puncture or laceration/foreign body left during procedure rates resulted lower after lta relative to pn (all p < 0.05). similarly, length of stay and health care expenditures resulted lower after lta relative to pn (all p < 0.05). conversely, readmission rate was not significantly different in lta relative to pn (p = 0.1). conclusions: despite similar perioperative mortality, lta is associated with lower complications rate, shorter length of stay and lower health care expenditure relative to pn.

autism	backgroundif left untreated, obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) can cause significant distress and impact on functioning throughout the lifespan. despite the severity of the disorder, there is often a significant delay between the onset of symptoms and successful treatment. this is in part due to delays in recognising ocd symptoms in young people, particularly if the symptom forms are less common. once ocd is accurately diagnosed, cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) is known to be an efficacious treatment, sometimes in combination with medication, producing good long-term prognosis. it is therefore important to accurately detect ocd in children and young people so that they can be offered timely intervention. use of the best tools in clinical and research settings improves detection and diagnosis, as well as enabling the tracking of progress through treatment. the aim of this current paper was to review measurement tools for ocd in young people with a focus on the practicalities of using tools in busy child mental health clinical settings. methodto discover what measurement tools are available for ocd in young people, we conducted a pragmatic literature of measurement tools for ocd in young people. we searched psycinfo, med-line and the cochrane databases for reports relating to the measurement of ocd. additionally, we sought information from the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) guidance, the child outcomes research consortium (corc) website and the children and young people 's improving access to psychological therapies (cyp iapt) programme. we also reviewed large trials and meta-analyses of the treatment of ocd in young people and communicated with relevant researchers/clinicians. resultsseventeen questionnaire measurement tools, with variable psychometric properties, and four commonly used semistructured clinician administered interview measures were identified. conclusionsthere are several measurement tools with good psychometric properties that are useful for initial screening/identification of ocd, as well as formal diagnosis, symptom tracking and treatment evaluation. with the availability of brief screens, as well as online diagnostic measures, such tools should not be a burden on clinical practice, but rather a helpful aid to support clinicians' assessment and treatment of ocd.
rheumatoid_arthritis	we evaluated the differences in major markers of cardiovascular (cv) risk between inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) and controls by a systematic review and a meta-analysis. we searched pubmed, embase, and cochrane databases for literature comparing cv risk markers in ibds and controls. the overall mean carotid intima-media thickness (cimt), flow-mediated dilation (fmd%), and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfpwv) difference between patients with ibds and control groups were calculated. twenty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 16 studies with data on cimt, 7 studies reporting fmd%, and 9 studies on cfpwv. compared to controls, patients with ibds showed significantly higher cimt (standardized mean difference [smd]: 0.534 mm; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.230 to 0.838; p = .001), significantly lower fmd% (smd, -0.721%; 95% ci, -1.020 to -0.421; p < .0001), and significantly increased cfpwv (smd, 0.849; 95% ci, 0.589 to 1.110; p < .0001). when analyzing subgroups with ulcerative colitis and crohn disease (cd), all results were still significant except cimt in cd. our findings support the current evidence for an elevated cv burden in patients with ibd and support the clinical utility of markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in the management of these patients.
crohn's_disease	background: inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] is considered to result from the interplay between host and intestinal microbiota but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. while ibd in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric ibd. methods: paediatric patients with ibd undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. blood inflammatory markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. the serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra- high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. results: serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric ibd patients were different from healthy controls and categorized crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis [uc] patients into separate groups. in serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in crohn 's disease; in uc also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. in faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in uc in contrast to low or intermediate levels in crohn 's disease. there was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline]. conclusion: characterization of inflammatory pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding disease pathogenesis of paediatric ibd.
autism	the relationships of autism quotient (aq), systematizing (sq), and empathizing (eq), with over-selectivity were explored to assess whether over-selectivity is implicated in complex social skills, which has been assumed, but not experimentally examined. eighty participants (aged 18-60) were trained on a simultaneous discrimination task (ab+cd-), and tested in extinction on the degree to which they had learned about both elements of the reinforced (ab) compound. higher aq and lower eq scorers demonstrated greater over-selectivity, but there was no relationship between sq and over-selectivity. these results imply that high aq scorers perform similarly to individuals with asd on this cognitive task, and that over-selectivity may be related to some complex social skills, like empathy.
crohn's_disease	inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is assumed to be caused by genetic and environmental factors that interact together in promoting intestinal immune dysregulation where cytokines have validated role. however, the underlying intimate mechanisms in the human ibd involving cytokines still needs to be supplemented especially in the clinical context. the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of some inflammatory and regulatory cytokines (il-17a, il-23, il-6, tgf beta 1, and il-10) as well as of the transcription factor foxp3 in mucosal samples of ibd and non-ibd patients. we assessed the mrna relative quantities (rq) of the above-mentioned cytokines and the transcription factor foxp3 in paired colonic samples (inflamed and adjacent normal mucosa) from 37 patients with ibd and in normal mucosal tissue in 12 persons without ibd by performing a qrt-pcr assay and tested the protein levels of target cytokines in serum samples. the patients were divided into three groups: without any therapy (n = 10), on 5-asa (n = 11) and on immunosuppressants (azathioprine +/- 5-asa/corticosteroids) (n = 16) in order to compare the rq values for each therapeutic group. all investigated genes were found upregulated in the inflamed mucosa of ibd patients in the following order: il-6 >foxp3 >tgf beta 1 >il-23 >il-17a >il-10. we also observed that the gene expression of foxp3 and il-6 were substantially higher in the inflamed mucosal tissue of the ibd patients than the adjacent normal mucosa (p = 0.035, p = 0.03 respectively). differences between higher mrna expression of foxp3 and il-6 in inflamed tissue were considered significant in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) (p = 0.011, p = 0.000 respectively) and with crohn 's disease (cd) (p = 0.008, p = 0.000 respectively) in comparison to the normal mucosa of non-ibd persons and we found increased tgf beta 1 in cd patients alone (p = 0.041). furthermore, il-6 and tgf beta 1 were overexpressed (rq >10) in non-inflamed mucosa from ibd patients compared to the normal mucosa from the controls. when we compared the gene expression for paired mucosa in the immunosuppressive treated group with the 5-asa treated group we observed opposite changes in il-6 and tgf beta 1 expression. additionally, we found higher serum levels of il-23 (p = 0.008), tgf beta 1 and il-6 in ibd patients compared to non-ibd patients. the obtained specific expression profile consisting of il-6, tgf beta 1, il-10 and foxp3 may represent a transcriptional hallmark for ibd. furthermore, we found that treatment with immunosuppressive therapy was more beneficial for driving cytokine expression to restore immune regulation in patients with ibd, unlike the 5-asa therapy.

kidney_health	background. the use of biopsies to determine kidney health after kidney transplantation is an invasive procedure with some risk to the patient. consequently, a noninvasive test for transplanted kidney health would provide a significant advantage over current clinical practice. methods. urines from kidney donors before nephrectomy, pretransplant patients with native kidney disease, and posttransplant kidney recipients were examined for protein biomarkers to diagnose or prognose kidney disease. proteins were extracted by c4 reverse phase affinity and analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. results. urine from individuals with healthy kidneys showed few components other than two ubiquitous saposin b glycoisoforms. patients with kidney disease lacked saposin b and showed new components in two patterns: the most common contained beta-2 microglobulin (b2m, m/z = 11,732) plus one or more peaks at m/z = 10,350, 9480, 4337, and 4180. pattern 2 lacked beta-2 microglobulin but contained several degradation products of alpha-1 antitrypsin. other pathologic components included urinary protein 1 (m/z = 15,835), transthyretin (m/z= 13,880), and a component at m/z = 13,350. conclusions. patients with acute rejection showed profiles that ranged from those of kidney donors to those of advanced kidney disease. the range of patterns may be useful for analysis of transplant patients without complications and persons with developing kidney disease before or after transplant.
osteoporosis	osteoporosis is a major comorbidity of cardio-respiratory diseases, but the mechanistic links between pulmonary arterial hypertension and bone remain elusive. the purpose of the stud was to evaluate serum adipokines and endothelin-1 (et-1) levels in the patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah) nyha class iii-iv and to determine its associations with bone mineral density (bmd). pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters, bmd z-scores at the lumbar spine (ls) and femoral neck (fn), serum leptin, adiponectin, visfatin and endothelin-1 (et-1), were evaluated in 32 patients with ipah nyha class iii-iv and 30 healthy volunteers. leptin, adiponectin and et-1 were higher in the patients with ipah than in healthy subjects. visfatin level showed a tendency to increase compared to that of healthy subjects (p = 0.076). the univariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between bmd z-scores at both sites and 6-min walk test, and inverse relation with pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mpap). adiponectin and visfatin showed positive correlations with pvr (p = 0.009 and p = 0.006). serum adiponectin, visfatin and leptin were inversely associated with z-scores. after adjusting for bmi and fmi, such associations persisted between visfatin and adiponectin levels and z-scores at both sites. et-1 related to mpap, cardiac index and pvr. negative correlation was observed between et-1 and fn bmd (p = 0.01). positive correlations have revealed between et-1 and adiponectin (p = 0.02), visfatin (p = 0.004) in ipah patients. these results provide further evidence that adipokine and endothelial dysregulation may cause not only a decrease in bmd, but also an increase in hemodynamic disorders of ipah.
mental_health	objective: hispanic youth in the general community experience traumatic events and display symptoms of psychological distress more frequently than do caucasian youth. however, little is known about how traumatic experiences in this ethnic minority population relate to psychopathology in clinical samples and whether these outcomes vary by gender and are impacted by family functioning. we hypothesized that traumatic stress reactions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and internalizing and externalizing symptoms, would vary by gender and by family functioning in a clinical sample of hispanic youth. method: the current study utilized baseline data from a randomized clinical trial (rct) involving 200 hispanic adolescents (122 boys and 78 girls) referred to treatment for experiencing clinical symptoms of 1 or more behavioral disorders and conflictual family relations. the rate of traumatic events, differences in outcomes depending on trauma exposure, and the effects gender, family functioning, and trauma on psychopathology and ptsd symptoms were examined. results: analyses revealed that 61% of hispanic youth in this clinical sample experienced at least 1 traumatic event. although only 12% of the sample reported ptsd scores in the clinical range, girls reported higher ptsd scores than did boys. poor family cohesion was particularly detrimental to girls compared with boys and related to internalizing and ptsd symptoms. high family conflict predicted ptsd symptoms in boys but not in girls. conclusions: these findings have clinical implications for working with hispanic populations, suggesting that culturally sensitive interventions should incorporate family-based interventions for individuals who experience trauma to strengthen family bonds and decrease family conflict.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	fibrosis, a disease in which excessive amounts of connective tissue accumulate in response to physical damage and/or inflammatory insult, affects nearly every tissue in the body and can progress to a state of organ malfunction and death. a hallmark of fibrotic disease is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix-secreting activated myofibroblasts (mfbs) in place of functional parenchymal cells. as such, the identification of agents that selectively inhibit the trans-differentiation process leading to the formation of mfbs represents an attractive approach for the treatment of diverse fibrosis-related diseases. herein we report the development of a high throughput image-based screen using primary hepatic stellate cells that identified the antifungal drug itraconazole (ita) as an inhibitor of mfb cell fate in resident fibroblasts derived from multiple murine and human tissues (i.e., lung, liver, heart, and skin). chemical optimization of ita led to a molecule (cbr-096-4) devoid of antifungal and human cytochrome p450 inhibitory activity with excellent pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in rodent models of lung, liver, and skin fibrosis. these findings may serve to provide a strategy for the safe and effective treatment of a broad range of fibrosis-related diseases.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: the abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal restorative capacity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) has been recently associated with an accelerated aging process as a key point for the altered wound healing. the advanced glycation end-products (ages) are the consequence of non-enzymatic reactions between lipid and protein with several oxidants in the aging process. the receptor for ages (rages) has been implicated in the lung fibrotic process and the alveolar homeostasis. however, this age-rage aging pathway has been under-explored in ipf. methods: lung samples from 16 ipf and 9 control patients were obtained through surgical lung biopsy. differences in ages and rage expression between both groups were evaluated by rt-pcr, western blot and immunohistochemistry. the effect of ages on cell viability of primary lung fibrotic fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells was assessed. cell transformation of fibrotic fibroblasts cultured into glycated matrices was evaluated in different experimental conditions. results: our study demonstrates an increase of ages together with a decrease of rages in ipf lungs, compared with control samples. two specific ages involved in aging, pentosidine and ne-carboxymethyl lysine, were significantly increased in ipf samples. the immunohistochemistry identified higher staining of ages related to extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins and the apical surface of the alveolar epithelial cells (aecs) surrounding fibroblast foci in fibrotic lungs. on the other hand, rage location was present at the cell membrane of aecs in control lungs, while it was almost missing in pulmonary fibrotic tissue. in addition, in vitro cultures showed that the effect of ages on cell viability was different for aecs and fibrotic fibroblasts. ages decreased cell viability in aecs, even at low concentration, while fibroblast viability was less affected. furthermore, fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation could be enhanced by ecm glycation. conclusions: all of these findings suggest a possible role of the increased ratio ages-rages in ipf, which could be a relevant accelerating aging tissue reaction in the abnormal wound healing of the lung fibrotic process.
migraine	background: there is a growing emphasis on self-monitoring applications that allow patients to measure their own physical health parameters. a prerequisite for achieving positive effects is patients' willingness to self-monitor. the controllability of disease types, patients' perceived self-efficacy and health problems could play an essential role in this. the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between patients' willingness to self-monitor and a range of disease and patient specific variables including controllability of disease type, patients' perceived self-efficacy and health problems. methods: data regarding 627 participants with 17 chronic somatic disease types from a dutch panel of people with chronic diseases have been used for this cross-sectional study. perceived self-efficacy was assessed using the general self-efficacy scale, perceived health problems using the physical health composite score (pcs). participants indicated their willingness to self-monitor. an expert panel assessed for 17 chronic disease types the extent to which patients can independently keep their disease in control. logistic regression analyses were conducted. results: patients' willingness to self-monitor differs greatly among disease types: patients with diabetes (71.0%), asthma (59.6%) and hypertension (59.1%) were most willing to self-monitor. in contrast, patients with rheumatism (40.0%), migraine (41.2%) and other neurological disorders (42.9%) were less willing to self-monitor. it seems that there might be a relationship between disease controllability scores and patients' willingness to self-monitor. no evidence is found of a relationship between general self-efficacy and pcs scores, and patients' willingness to self-monitor. conclusions: this study provides the first evidence that patients' willingness to self-monitor might be associated with disease controllability. further research should investigate this association more deeply and should focus on how disease controllability influences willingness to self-monitor. in addition, since willingness to self-monitor differed greatly among patient groups, it should be taken into account that not all patient groups are willing to self-monitor.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (imids) are a group of complex and prevalent diseases where disease diagnostic and activity monitoring is highly challenging. the determination of the metabolite profiles of biological samples is becoming a powerful approach to identify new biomarkers of clinical utility. in order to identify new metabolite biomarkers of diagnosis and disease activity, we have performed the first large-scale profiling of the urine metabolome of the six most prevalent imids: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, crohn 's disease, and ulcerative colitis. methods: using nuclear magnetic resonance, we analyzed the urine metabolome in a discovery cohort of 1210 patients and 100 controls. within each imid, two patient subgroups were recruited representing extreme disease activity (very high vs. very low). metabolite association analysis with disease diagnosis and disease activity was performed using multivariate linear regression in order to control for the effects of clinical, epidemiological, or technical variability. after multiple test correction, the most significant metabolite biomarkers were validated in an independent cohort of 1200 patients and 200 controls. results: in the discovery cohort, we identified 28 significant associations between urine metabolite levels and disease diagnosis and three significant metabolite associations with disease activity (p-fdr < 0.05). using the validation cohort, we validated 26 of the diagnostic associations and all three metabolite associations with disease activity (pfdr < 0.05). combining all diagnostic biomarkers using multivariate classifiers we obtained a good disease prediction accuracy in all imids and particularly high in inflammatory bowel diseases. several of the associated metabolites were found to be commonly altered in multiple imids, some of which can be considered as hub biomarkers. the analysis of the metabolic reactions connecting the imid-associated metabolites showed an overrepresentation of citric acid cycle, phenylalanine, and glycine-serine metabolism pathways. conclusions: this study shows that urine is a source of biomarkers of clinical utility in imids. we have found that imids show similar metabolic changes, particularly between clinically similar diseases and we have found, for the first time, the presence of hub metabolites. these findings represent an important step in the development of more efficient and less invasive diagnostic and disease monitoring methods in imids.
autism	long-term consequences of anesthetic exposure in humans are not well understood. it is possible that alterations in brain function occur beyond the initial anesthetic administration. research in children and adults has reported cognitive and/or behavioral changes after surgery and general anesthesia that may be short lived in some patients, while in others, such changes may persist. the changes observed in humans are corroborated by a large body of evidence from animal studies that support a role for alterations in neuronal survival (neuroapoptosis) or structure (altered dendritic and glial morphology) and later behavioral deficits at older age after exposure to various anesthetic agents during fetal or early life. the potential of anesthetics to induce long-term alterations in brain function, particularly in vulnerable populations, warrants investigation. in this review, we critically evaluate the available preclinical and clinical data on the developing and aging brain, and in known vulnerable populations to provide insights into potential changes that may affect the general population of patients in a more, subtle manner. in addition this review summarizes underlying processes of how general anesthetics produce changes in the brain at the cellular and systems level and the current understanding underlying mechanisms of anesthetics agents on brain systems. finally, we present how neuroimaging techniques currently emerge as promising approaches to evaluate and define changes in brain function resulting from anesthesia, both in the short and the long-term.

asthma	in 2013, a guideline for occupational allergic diseases was published for the first time in japan. occupational allergic diseases are likely to worsen or become intractable as a result of continuous exposure to high concentrations of causative antigens, and are socioeconomically important diseases with which the patients might sometimes lose jobs due to work interruptions. guidelines for occupational allergic diseases have been published in many countries. this guideline consists of six chapters about occupational asthma, occupational allergic rhinitis, occupational skin diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and occupational anaphylaxis shock, and legal aspects of these diseases. the guideline is characterized with the following basic structure: clinical questions (cqs) are set with reference to minds (medical information network distribution service), statements by the committee are correspondingly listed, recommended grades and evidence levels are defined, and then descriptions and references are indicated. copyright (c) 2017, japanese society of allergology. production and hosting by elsevier b.v.
bipolar_disorder	background: dna methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism involved in gene regulation, with alterations in dna methylation in the nuclear genome being linked to numerous complex diseases. mitochondrial dna methylation is a phenomenon that is receiving ever-increasing interest, particularly in diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction; however, most studies have been limited to the investigation of specific target regions. analyses spanning the entire mitochondrial genome have been limited, potentially due to the amount of input dna required. further, mitochondrial genetic studies have been previously confounded by nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes. methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing is a technique widely used to profile dna methylation across the nuclear genome; however, reads mapped to mitochondrial dna are often discarded. here, we have developed an approach to control for nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes within methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing data. we highlight the utility of this approach in identifying differences in mitochondrial dna methylation across regions of the human brain and pre-mortem blood. results: we were able to correlate mitochondrial dna methylation patterns between the cortex, cerebellum and blood. we identified 74 nominally significant differentially methylated regions (p < 0.05) in the mitochondrial genome, between anatomically separate cortical regions and the cerebellum in matched samples (n = 3 matched donors). further analysis identified eight significant differentially methylated regions between the total cortex and cerebellum after correcting for multiple testing. using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the mitochondrial dna methylome, we were able to identify tissue-specific patterns of mitochondrial dna methylation between blood, cerebellum and cortex. conclusions: our study represents a comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial methylome using pre-existing methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing data to identify brain region-specific patterns of mitochondrial dna methylation.
autism	this study examined associations among head start attendance, individualized education programmes (ieps), parental behaviours and child outcomes in a sample of five-hundred and seventy 3-to 4-year-old children with disabilities. home language, number of disabilities and head start enrollment were associated with having an iep. parents of children with ieps and those who participated in head start used more social services, while social support was more prevalent for parents of non-head start children with ieps. for all children, frequent parental book reading, greater number of books in the home and greater perceived social support among parents were associated with favourable cognitive and social-emotional outcomes. greater social service use was adversely associated with reading scores only for non-head start children. findings highlight the need for inclusive iep policies and head start programmes for parents regarding access to special education supports for children who demonstrate developmental concerns. participation in head start may buffer negative effects of social service use on children 's reading skill development, although more research is needed to uncover the specific mechanisms responsible for this association.
crohn's_disease	introduction: achieving adherence to medications can be a serious challenge for patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). medical treatment is fundamental for inducing and maintaining remission, preventing flares and reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. non-adherence may affect patients' quality of life resulting in unfavourable treatment outcomes, more hospitalizations and higher healthcare-related costs. recognising and improving adherence is therefore a primary aim for the treatment of ibd.areas covered: we critically discuss the current knowledge on medication non-adherence in adult patients affected by ibd, also mentioning a few issues concerning the paediatric and adolescent populations. in particular, we reviewed the literature focusing on the definition and detection of non-adherence, on its extent and on the possible non-modifiable and modifiable factors involved (patient-centred, therapy-related, disease-related and physician-related). furthermore, we analysed the interventional studies performed so far. the literature review was conducted through pubmed addressing medication non-adherence in ibd, using the keywords adherence' and related terms and ibd, ulcerative colitis or crohn 's disease'.expert commentary: adherence to therapy for ibd is a complex yet fundamental issue that cannot be solved by addressing a single aspect only. future studies should focus on patient-tailored and multidimensional interventions.
atopic_dermatitis	since the publication of the last us national burden of skin disease report in 2006, there have been substantial changes in the practice of dermatology and the us health care system. these include the development of new treatment modalities, marked increases in the cost of medications, increasingly complex payer rules and regulations, and an aging of the us population. recognizing the need for up-to-date data to inform researchers, policy makers, public stakeholders, and health care providers about the impact of skin disease on patients and us society, the american academy of dermatology produced a new national burden of skin disease report. using 2013 claims data from private and governmental insurance providers, this report analyzed the prevalence, cost, and mortality attributable to 24 skin disease categories in the us population. in this first of 3 articles, the presented data demonstrate that nearly 85 million americans were seen by a physician for at least 1 skin disease in 2013. this led to an estimated direct health care cost of $75 billion and an indirect lost opportunity cost of $11 billion. further, mortality was noted in half of the 24 skin disease categories.
asthma	allergic asthma is a disease of the airways driven by maladaptive t helper 2 (th2) and th17 immune response against harmless, airborne substances. the hallmarks of this disease are airway hyperresponsiveness (ahr), eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway inflammation and mucus overproduction. distinct dendric cell (dc) subsets together with airway epithelial and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells play critical roles in allergen sensing and in driving t cell differentiation towards th2 and th17 effector or regulatory t cells (treg). previous studies suggested already a pivotal role for the anaphylatoxins (c5a, c3a) in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. during sensitization for example it is described, that c3a promotes, whereas c5a protects from the development of maladaptive immunity during allergen sensitization. here we will discuss the role of the anaphylatoxins (c3a, c5a) and their receptors during the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, and specifically in lung dc biology. we will also have a look on canonical and non-canonical complement activation and we will discuss novel concepts on how the adaptive immune system can regulate the function of atrs also in the context of allergic asthma.

lymphoma	ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death that differs from traditional apoptosis and necrosis and results from iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation. ferroptotic cell death is characterized by cytological changes, including cell volume shrinkage and increased mitochondrial membrane density. ferroptosis can be induced by two classes of small-molecule substances known as class 1 (system x-c(-) inhibitors) and class 2 ferroptosis inducers [glutathione peroxidase 4 (gpx4) inhibitors]. in addition to these small-molecule substances, a number of drugs (e.g. sorafenib, artemisinin and its derivatives) can induce ferroptosis. various factors, such as the mevalonate (mva) and sulphur-transfer pathways, play pivotal roles in the regulation of ferroptosis. ferroptosis plays an unneglectable role in regulating the growth and proliferation of some types of tumour cells, such as lymphocytoma, ductal cell cancer of the pancreas, renal cell carcinoma (rcc) and hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). here, we will first introduce the discovery of and research pertaining to ferroptosis; then summarize the induction mechanisms and regulatory pathways of ferroptosis; and finally, further elucidate the roles of ferroptosis in human tumourous diseases.
dementia	background: depression is a common symptom after stroke, but its neural substrates remain unclear. the ascending serotonergic system originates from the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. we hypothesized that depressive disorder due to brainstem infarction is associated with damage to the raphe nuclei. methods: we prospectively enrolled 19 patients who had the first-ever acute isolated brainstem infarction in an observational cross-sectional study. all patients were evaluated by using the montgomery.ksberg depression rating scale (madrs), the clinician-rated version of apathy evaluation scale (aes-c) and mini-mental state examination (mmse). depressive disorder was diagnosed according to dsm-5 and madrs score of 12 or greater. diffusion tensor imaging and proton density-weighted images were used to identify damage in the raphe nuclei. accordingly, patients were classified into either the raphe-nuclei damaged or intact group. prevalence of depressive disorder and the madrs, aes-c, and mmse scores were compared between the two groups. results: depressive disorder was more frequent in the damaged group (n=6) than in the intact group (n=13) (83% vs. 15%; p=0.01). madrs scores were higher in the damaged group than in the intact group (mean +/- 1 sd, 17.5 +/- 7.9 vs. 7.0 +/- 4.4; p=0.002), whereas the aes-c and mmse scores did not differ between groups. limitations: we did not assess the damage to the ascending projection fibers from the raphe nuclei. conclusions: our results suggest that damage to the raphe nuclei underlies depressive disorder due to brainstem infarction, possibly via serotonergic denervation.
medicare	objectives: australia 's universal health insurance system medicare generates very large amounts of data on out-of-pocket expenditure (dope), but only highly aggregated statistics are routinely published. our primary purpose is to develop indices from the medicare administrative data to quantify changes in the level and distribution of oope on out-of hospital medical services over time. methods: data were obtained from the australian hypertension and absolute risk study, which involved patients aged 55 years and over (n=2653). socio-economic and clinical information was collected and linked to medicare records over a five-year period from march 2008. the fisher price and quantity indices were used to evaluate year-to-year changes in dope. the relative concentration index was used to evaluate the distribution of dope across socio-economic strata. results: our price index indicates that overall oope were not rising faster than inflation, but there was considerable variation across different types of services (e.g. oope on professional attendances rose by 20% over a five-year period, while all other items fell by around 14%). concentration indices, adjusted for demographic factors and clinical need, indicate that dope tends to be higher among those on higher incomes. conclusions: a major challenge in utilizing large administrative data sets is to develop reliable and easily interpretable statistics for policy makers. price, quantity and concentration indices represent statistics that move us beyond the average.

anxiety	older adults are prescribed sedative-hypnotic medications at higher rates than younger adults. these are not recommended for older adults due to risk of sedation, cognitive impairment, and falls. severe generalized anxiety disorder (gad) is a possibly appropriate use of these medications in older people, but little is available on use of sedative-hypnotic medications among older adults with gad. this study examined the frequency and predictors of sedative-hypnotic medication use among older adults screening positive for anxiety. 25.88% (n=125) of participants reported taking sedative-hypnotics over the past 3 months; 16.36% (n=79) reported taking benzodiazepines, and 12.22% (n=59) reported taking hypnotic sleep medications. depressive symptoms were more strongly associated with sedative-hypnotic use than insomnia or worry. major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, but not gad, predicted sedative-hypnotic use. other medications and treatments are more appropriate and efficacious for depression, anxiety, and insomnia in this population.
autism	accessible summary little is known about what fathers think and feel about a diagnosis of autism. fathers experienced strong emotion around diagnosis and were given little support. services should support mother and fathers in ways which meet their individual needs. more positive messages should be given to families at diagnosis. abstractbackground: a diagnosis of childhood autism can be an extremely stressful experience for parents, but little is known concerning paternal perceptions of the process. methods: this study investigated father perspectives on a diagnosis of autism, through an online survey. results: an analysis of 184 replies to an open-ended question identified the following themes: strong initial emotional response and a range of immediate anxieties about the future, struggle to gain a diagnosis; anger in response to insensitive delivery of diagnosis together with insufficient information at the time and lack of support afterwards. conclusion: fathers experienced a range of significant challenges during a diagnostic process in which most felt unsupported. service provision should be more gender-differentiated, taking into account of the particular needs and perspectives of both mothers and fathers at this critical juncture in family life.
smoking_cessation	one strong risk factor of coronary artery disease (cad), which affects the levels of vitamin c in the blood is cigarette smoking. the supplementary effects of coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) is smoking cessation by patients. therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the level of vitamin c in the blood plasma one day before and one month after cabg. human blood were collected from 20 patients (men); 1 day before and 1 month after cabg. all patients were smoker and after cabg they declared their not smoking. the concentration of vitamin c in the blood plasma was assayed by fia method with spectrophotometric detection. the mean value of the vitamin c concentration 1 day before cabg was 12.36 +/- 2.84 mu mol/l (mean +/- sd), 1 month after cabg 40.07 +/- 10.95 mu mol/l (mean +/- sd). the average increase in the concentration of vitamin c was 3.27 +/- 0.73 times (mean +/- sd) and showed significant positive correlations (pearson r = 0.657, p = 0.002). it should be consider incorporating the recommendations of preoperative smoking cessation for at least one month prior to cabg and/or additional supplementation. in addition it would be relevant to monitor the level of vitamin c in the patients' blood in the preoperative period.

hereditary_angioedema	neurofeedback training was performed consisting of rewarding and encouraging 12-15 hz brainwaves (smr), while simultaneously discouraging 4-7 hz brainwaves (theta) and 22-30 hz brainwaves (high beta) in the right dorsal posterior quadrant of the brain (t4, p4) for 20 half-hour nfb sessions to determine the impact on cortisol levels, dhea-s levels, scores on the symptom checklist-90-r (scl-90-r), the quality of life inventory, and acute attack medication usage for a hereditary angioedema patient.
hereditary_angioedema	plasma of patients with types i and ii hereditary angioedema is unstable if incubated in a plastic (i.e., inert) vessel at 37 a degrees c manifested by progressively increasing formation of bradykinin. there is also a persistent low level of c4 in 95 % of patients even when they are symptomatic. these phenomena are due to the properties of the c1r subcomponent of c1, factor xii, and the bimolecular complex of prekallikrein with high molecular weight kininogen (hk). purified c1r auto-activates in physiologic buffers, activates c1s, which in turn depletes c4. this occurs when c1 inhibitor is deficient. the complex of prekallikrein-hk acquires an inducible active site not present in prekallikrein which in tris-type buffers cleaves hk stoichiometrically to release bradykinin, or in phosphate buffer auto-activates to generate kallikrein and bradykinin. thus immunologic depletion of c1 inhibitor from factor xii-deficient plasma (phosphate is the natural buffer) auto-activates on incubation to release bradykinin. normal c1 inhibitor prevents this from occurring. during attacks of angioedema, if factor xii auto-activates on surfaces, the initial factor xiia formed converts prekallikrein to kallikrein, and kallikrein cleaves hk to release bradykinin. kallikrein also rapidly activates most remaining factor xii to factor xiia. additional cleavages convert factor xiia to factor xiif and factor xiif activates c1r enzymatically so that c4 levels approach zero, and c2 is depleted. there is also a possibility that kallikrein is generated first as a result of activation of the prekallikrein-hk complex by heat shock protein 90 released from endothelial cells, followed by kallikrein activation of factor xii.
ankylosing_spondylitis	in the summer of 1967, a relatively complete skeleton of a juvenile was excavated from the ishkeenickh river cave site (now the ksi hlginx river) in british columbia, canada, dating from approximately 2000 years ago. this individual, likely aged between 10 and 12 years at time of death, displays osteological features consistent with a chronic arthropathy. the most striking pathological changes are on the spine, with bony ankylosis present on several of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae. lesions can also be observed on the ribs, the ilia, the femora, and a tibia. the arthritic conditions of juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile-onset adult-type rheumatoid arthritis, along with klippel-feil syndrome, are possible aetiologies discussed as part of a differential diagnosis. the presence of post-mortem damage as well as missing bones makes an absolute diagnosis of a disease impossible, however the lesions present on this skeleton seem to be most consistent with juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis. the majority of published research on these diseases appears in clinical contexts, therefore this case study represents a unique opportunity to observe the bony changes that occur with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the context of palaeopathology.

mental_health	an estimated 10% to 20% of youth in primary care exhibit behavioral symptoms and may go underdetected. most screeners identify risk base of symptoms alone, irrespective of functional impairment. to address this issue, the pediatric symptom checklist-17 (psc-17), a widely used symptom screener, was combined with functional impairment and current behavioral services enrollment items to form the pediatric behavioral health screen (pbhs) and assessed compared to the full child behavior checklist (cbcl). a total of 267 youth between 6 and 16 years of age were administered the screener and the cbcl. areas under the receiver operating curves approached or exceeded 0.90 in all analyses, reflecting excellent classification accuracy. almost no false negatives were observed among currently untreated cases with functional impairment. no differential item functioning was found. performance of the psc-17 as a pediatric primary care behavioral health screener supported previous research, and additional functional impairment items to form the pbhs appeared useful, particularly for interpreting borderline range scores.
autism	quality of life is often relatively lowered in families of children with additional needs, and this may be particularly the case where additional needs are accompanied by an autism spectrum disorder (asd). here we explore the effects of diagnostic status specifically, comparing families with children with an asd diagnosis with others who a) have additional needs but no signs of asd; and b) have additional needs and signs of asd but no diagnosis. mothers (n =76) of children with additional needs completed standardised questionnaires about quality of life, stress, service provision, child behaviour and presence and severity of asd traits. in addition, a group of mothers of typically developing young people (n =17) completed standardised questionnaires on individual and family quality of life and on the behaviour of their son or daughter. mothers of typically developing young people had significantly higher individual and family quality of life scores than each of the three other groups. increased severity of asd was associated with increased maternal stress, which in turn was associated with decreased family and maternal quality of life. the group reporting the lowest quality of life and the highest stress were the mothers of individuals with signs of asd but no diagnosis. this pattern did not seem to be explained by lack of access to services, or rates of intellectual disability or challenging behaviour in this sub-group. the finding that poor quality of life and high stress was most apparent in the sub-group of mothers with children who had signs of asd but did not have a diagnosis of asd suggests that an interesting topic for further investigation is whether receipt of a diagnosis itself can positively influence quality of life and levels of maternal stress.
atrial_fibrillation	introduction: congenital heart disease (chd) is the most common birth defect in humans. in spite of tremendous advance in medical care, chd is still a major contributor to substantial morbidity and mortality. aggregating evidence demonstrates that genetic defects play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chd, and an increasing number of genetic mutations have been identified to be responsible for chd.areas covered: this paper is restricted to the molecular diagnosis of chd, and highlights loss-of-function mutations in the genes associated with chd. the newly-made progress in the molecular genetics of chd is reviewed in this article.expert commentary: heart development is a precisely-coordinated biological process, involving in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and integrated morphogenetic interactions, and interruption of this process predominantly by genetic risk factors leads to chd. to date, mutations in over 60 genes have been causally linked to chd, of which most mutations cause a loss-of-function effect. using next generation sequencing technology and data processing software, new chd-associated genes will be more easily discovered. identification of the chd-causative genes is of significant importance in genetic diagnosis, early prophylaxis and personalized treatment of chd patients.
osteoarthritis	objectives:chronic pain after total knee replacement (tkr) is not uncommon. preoperative impaired conditioning pain modulation (cpm) has been used to predict chronic postoperative pain. interestingly, exercises reduce pain sensitivity in patients with knee osteoarthritis (koa). this pilot study investigated the association between exercise-induced hypoalgesia (eih) and cpm on post-tkr pain relief.methods:before and 6 months post-tkr, 14 patients with chronic koa performed the cold pressor test on the nonaffected leg and 2 exercise conditions (bicycling and isometric knee extension), randomized and counterbalanced. before and during the cold pressor test and after exercises test stimuli were applied to extract the pain sensitivity difference: computer-controlled cuff inflation on the affected lower leg until the participants detected the cuff pain threshold (cppt) and subsequently the cuff pain tolerance (cptt) and manual pressure pain thresholds (ppts) at the legs, arm, and shoulder. clinical pain intensity (numerical rating scale [nrs]) and psychological distress (questionnaires) were assessed.results:clinical pain intensity, psychological distress, cppt, and ppt at the affected leg improved post-tkr compared with pre-tkr (p<0.05). preoperatively, the cpm and bicycling eih assessed by the increase in cptt correlated with reduction in nrs pain scores post-tkr (p<0.05). improved cpm and eih responses after tkr were significantly correlated with reduction in nrs pain scores post-tkr (p<0.05).discussion:in koa patients, hypoalgesia after cold pressor stimulation and aerobic exercise assessed preoperatively by cuff algometry was associated with pain relief 6 months after tkr. eih as a novel preoperative screening tool should be further investigated in larger studies.
asthma	we synthesize optically active (r)-terbutaline 2, which is an anti-asthmatic drug, through recyclable catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (rcath). various chloroketones 4 were prepared and rcath was performed on them. the products exhibit moderate to high enantioselectivity. in particular, the hydrogenation of acyl substituted substrates 4c yields chiral secondary alcohols 5c in good yield and enantioselectivity. furthermore, (r)-terbutaline 2 can be synthesized in one step from the resulting secondary alcohol 5 without racemization.
asthma	the pathogenesis of asthma includes a complex interplay among airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. current evidence suggests that airway structural cells, including bronchial smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, mediate all three aspects of asthma pathogenesis. although studies show a connection between airway remodeling and changes in bronchomotor tone, the relationship between the two remains unclear. transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf-beta 1), a growth factor elevated in the airway of patients with asthma, plays a role in airway remodeling and in the shortening of various airway structural cells. however, the role of tgf-beta 1 in mediating airway hyperresponsiveness remains unclear. in this review, we summarize the literature addressing the role of tgf-beta 1 in airway remodeling and shortening. through our review, we aim to further elucidate the role of tgf-beta 1 in asthma pathogenesis and the link between airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma and to define tgf-beta 1 as a potential therapeutic target for reducing asthma morbidity and mortality.
bipolar_disorder	background: although a significant subset of patients with major depressive disorder (mdd) fail to respond to medical or behavioural therapy, deep brain stimulation (dbs) applied to the subgenual cingulate cortex (scc; sg25) has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in a subset of patients. this area receives projections from neurons in the ca1 region and subiculum of the hippocampus (hc), a brain region implicated in the pathobiology and treatment of mdd. objective: to assess whether high frequency stimulation (hfs) of the infralimbic cortex is associated with changes in cellular morphology in the hc. methods: rats were subjected to either infralimbic hfs or sham-stimulation. measures of cellular morphology, including dendritic length and complexity, were assessed in pyramidal neurons in the ca1 region of the hc by means of the golgi-cox histological stain. results: dendrite length (p = 0.013) and number of branch points (p = 0.004) were significantly increased across the entire dendritic tree in animals subjected to hfs. subsequent scholl analysis revealed that for dendritic length these effects were localized to the region between 80 and 160 mu m from the soma (p < 0.001 for either 40 mu m interval) in the basal dendritic tree, while branch point number was predominantly increased between 120 and 160 mu m from the soma (p < 0.001) in the apical dendritic tree. conclusions: high-frequency stimulation of the infralimbic cortex increases the complexity of apical dendrites and the length of basal dendritic trees of pyramidal neurons located in the cal hippocampal subfield relative to sham-stimulated animals.

asthma	patient: male, 41 final diagnosis: neurosarcoidosis symptoms: fecal incontinence center dot hypothermia center dot loss of balance center dot loss of consciousness medication: - clinical procedure: - specialty: family medicine objective: unusual clinical course background: sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unclear etiology with an estimated prevalence of 10 cases per 100 000 population. although sarcoidosis primarily affects the pulmonary system, it affects the nervous system in 5-10% of patients with the condition. case report: this article describes a case of neurosarcoidosis with the primary presenting finding of hypothermia. a 41-year-old african-american man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, asthma, and anemia, presented to the emergency department after being found unresponsive at home. the patient was found to have a significantly low temperature of 27.0 degrees c on presentation. he was subsequently diagnosed with sarcoidosis by mediastinal biopsy, which revealed non-caseating granulomas with variable stages of sclerosis, consistent with long-standing sarcoidosis. in a subsequent admission, the patient presented with hyperthermia, further suggesting hypothalamic involvement as part of the neurosarcoidosis. conclusions: neurosarcoidosis is a rare variant of sarcoidosis that has varying presentations, including headaches, seizures, ataxia, visual disturbances, loss of sensation, and other neurologic abnormalities. by presenting this case, which to our knowledge is the first to report neurosarcoidosis presenting as hypothermia, our aim is to use it as a teaching moment and for further discussion on clinical presentations and management of such patients.
lymphoma	acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is characterized by clinical and biological heterogeneity. despite the advances in our understanding of its pathobiology, the chemotherapy-directed management has remained largely unchanged in the past 40 years. however, various novel agents have demonstrated clinical activity, either as single agents (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) inhibitors, vadastuximab) or in combination with standard induction/consolidation at diagnosis and with salvage regimens at relapse. the classes of agents described in this review include novel cytotoxic chemotherapies (cpx-351 and vosaroxin), epigenetic modifiers (guadecitabine, idh inhibitors, histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors, bromodomain and extraterminal (bet) inhibitors), fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (flt3) inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates (vadastuximab), as well as cell cycle inhibitors (volasertib), b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) inhibitors, and aminopeptidase inhibitors. these agents are actively undergoing clinical investigation alone or in combination with available chemotherapy.
asthma	background genetic susceptibility to asthma is currently linked to a handful of genes which have a limited ability to predict the overall disease risk, suggesting the existence of many other genes involved in disease development. accumulated evidence from association studies in genes related by biological pathways could reveal novel asthma genes. objective to reveal novel asthma susceptibility genes by means of a pathway-based association study. methods based on summary data from a previous a genomewide association study (gwas) of asthma, we first identified significant biological pathways using a gene-set enrichment analysis. we then mapped all tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) on the genes contributing to significant pathways and prioritized those with a disproportionate number of nominal significant associations for further studies. for those prioritized genes, association studies were performed for selected snps in independent case-control samples (n=1765) using logistic regression models, and results were meta-analysed with those from the gwas. results two biological processes were significantly enriched: the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (p=0.002) and the wnt signalling (p=0.012). from the 417 genes interacting in these two pathways, 10 showed an excess of nominal associations, including a known asthma susceptibility locus (encoding smad family member 3) and other novel candidate genes. from the latter, association studies of 14 selected snps evidenced replication in a locus near the frizzled class receptor 6 (fzd6) gene (p=9.90x10(-4)), which had a consistent direction of effects with the gwas findings (meta-analysed odds ratio=1.49; p=5.87x10(-6)) and was in high linkage disequilibrium with expression quantitative trait loci in lung tissues. conclusions and clinical relevance this study revealed the importance of two biological pathways in asthma pathogenesis and identified a novel susceptibility locus near wnt signalling genes.
asthma	developed a single-walled carbon nanotubes (swcnts)-based electrochemical biosensor for the detection of bacillus subtilis, one of the microorganisms observed in asian dust events, which causes respiratory diseases such as asthma and pneumonia. swcnts plays the role of a transducer in biological antigen/antibody reaction for the electrical signal while 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (1-pbse) and ant-b. subtilis were performed as a chemical linker and an acceptor, respectively, for the adhesion of target microorganism in the developed biosensor. the detection range (10(2)-10(10) cfu/ml) and the detection limit (10(2) cfu/ml) of the developed biosensor were identified while the response time was 10 min. the amount of target b. subtilis was the highest in the specificity test of the developed biosensor, compared with the other tested microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, flavobacterium psychrolimnae, and aquabacterium commune). in addition, target b. subtilis detected by the developed biosensor was observed by scanning electron microscope (sem) analysis.

children's_health	this study was performed to reveal factors associated with dietary supplement use among japanese preschool children in a. nationwide survey. a cross-sectional, internet survey was conducted among 2,058 mothers aged 20-40 y old who had preschool children and were registrants of a japanese social research company in february 2013. the questionnaires assessed dietary supplement use, lifestyle and eating habits in both children and their mothers, eating awareness among mothers and the mothers' sources of health information. the study employed logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between dietary supplement use and other variables. dietary supplements were used by 8.0% of the children. children who used supplements tended to be older in age, less likely to ""get up cheerfully every morning,"" more likely to skip breakfast, eat out more frequently, and have mothers who used supplements, than children who did not use supplements. mothers' level of education and household income were not associated with supplement use among their children. it is likely that mothers' anxiety about their children 's health or unhealthy eating habits has a striking effect on supplement use among children. however, the actual dietary balance and daily rhythms of child supplement users were not irregular or unhealthy. it is necessary to give more accurate information on children 's dietary habits and health to address mothers' anxiety.
atopic_dermatitis	background: the prevalence of atopic dermatitis has increased over the last 10 years. atopic dermatitis tends to run in families and commonly begins to manifest in childhood. the prevalence of atopic dermatitis is as high as 20% in children. thus, early diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis are important. understanding its genetic basis is also needed to facilitate early detection. methods: to identify family-specific candidate genetic variants associated with early-onset atopic dermatitis in koreans, we carried out whole-exome sequencing of three separate families with this condition. additional validation was performed in 112 ad patients and 61 controls using sanger sequencing. results: we focused on both common functional variants with a minor allele frequency higher than 1% and rare variants with a minor allele frequency less than 1%. the relevance of the respective variants was supported by a program that could predict whether the mutations resulted in damaged protein function. fourteen overlapping genes were identified during exome sequencing. three variants of the col6a6 gene appeared in all three families and were in close proximity to atopic dermatitis-related loci on chromosome 3q21. the homozygous frequency for the rs16830494 minor allele (aa) and the rs59021909 (tt) allele and the rs200963433 heterozygous (ct) frequency were all higher in ad cases compared to controls in a population-based case-control study. conclusion: identifying family-specific col6a6 polymorphisms and genetic variants of other candidate genes associated with ad using wes is a novel approach. our study suggests that col6a6 variants may be risk factors for atopic dermatitis. this study provides a genetic basis for early-onset ad diagnosis in korean patients and the development of new therapies.
healthy_sleep	health care researchers have recently developed several home-based sleep monitoring systems and mobile applications that support healthy sleep by monitoring a user 's sleep environment, activities, or sleep quality. this study describes the design and evaluation of an electrooculogram (eog)-based system for an automatic sleep monitoring. compared with polysomnogram or electroencephalogram recordings, eog has the advantage of easy placement and can be operated by the users themselves. we also design an intelligent eye mask that is user friendly for measuring sleep stage and quality. two user experiments were carried out to demonstrate that the proposed system produces valid measurements of sleep stage and sleep quality and has good usability and reliability while not disturbing sleep significantly. these findings suggest that our system can also be applied to long-term sleep monitoring or sleep environment control to improve the user 's sleep quality and make sleep more comfortable.
autism	the purpose of the study was to evaluate the current literature on the use of weighted vests (wv) with individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd). a literature review using the standards recommended by the what works clearinghouse was conducted. the studies included in the review met the following criteria: (a) use of a single case research design; (b) inclusion of at least one individual with asd; (c) examination of the effects of wv on a particular dependent variable; and (d) publication in english in a peer-refereed journal in the past 25 years. the results of the review show that the use of wv with individuals with asd is not an evidence-based practice.

children's_health	past research has demonstrated that parenting style is related to children 's health and eating patterns, and that parenting can vary across time and context. however, there is little evidence about similarities and differences between general, self-reported parenting style and observed parenting during grocery shopping. the goals of this study were to investigate links between general parenting style, parental warmth and limit setting (important dimensions of parenting style) during grocery shopping, and the healthfulness of foods chosen. participants were 153 parent (88 mothers)- child (6-9 years old) dyads. dyads were brought to a laboratory set up like a grocery store aisle and asked to choose two items from each of three categories (cookies/crackers, cereals, chips/snacks). parents were observed in terms of warmth, responsiveness, autonomy granting, and limit setting; children were observed in terms of resistance and negotiation. parents reported behaviors related to general parenting. regression analyses were used to test study hypotheses. observed parental limit setting was related to general parenting style; observed warmth was not. observed limit setting (but not observed warmth or self-reported parenting style) was related to the healthfulness of food choices. limit setting appears to be the dimension of parenting style that is expressed during grocery shopping, and that promotes healthier food choices. implications are discussed regarding consistencies in parenting style across situations as well as contributions of parenting style to the development of children 's healthy eating. published by elsevier ltd.
hereditary_angioedema	aimfew studies have been published on children with hereditary angioedema (hae), an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations on chromosome 11. this study explored various aspects of the disease in the swedish paediatric population. methodsa retrospective questionnaire was sent to all 36 swedish children known to have hae, and a physician carried out follow-up telephone interviews. resultsmost of the questionnaires were completed by the parents of 31 (86%) children with hae, with or without their input, at a median age of nine years (range 1-17), and the physician also interviewed 29. hae symptoms were experienced by 23 children, including abdominal attacks (96%), skin swelling (78%) and swelling in the mouth and/or upper airways (52%). psychological stress was the most common trigger for abdominal attacks and trauma and sports triggered skin swelling. the majority (n = 19) had access to complement-1 esterase inhibitor concentrate at home. current health and quality of life were generally rated as good, independent of whether the child had experienced hae symptoms or not. conclusionmost children with hae had experienced abdominal attacks and skin swelling, but their overall health and quality of life were generally perceived to be good.
osteoporosis	disuse induces a rapid bone loss in humans and animals; hypodynamia/sedentarity is now recognized as a risk factor for osteoporosis. hypodynamia also decreases bone mass but its effects are largely unknown and only few animal models have been described. hypodynamic chicken is recognized as a suitable model of bone loss but the effects on the quality have not been fully explored. we have used ten chickens bred in a large enclosure (free group); ten others were confined in small cages with little space to move around (hypo group). they were sacrificed at 53 days and femurs were evaluated by microcomputed tomography (microct) and nanoindentation. sections (4 a mu m thick) were analyzed by fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (ftir) to see the effects on mineralization and collagen and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qbei) to image the mineral of the bone matrix. trabecular bone volume and microarchitecture were significantly altered in the hypo group. ftir showed a significant reduction of the mineral-to-matrix ratio in the hypo group associated with an increase in the carbonate content and an increase in crystallinity (calculated as the area ratio of subbands located at 1020 and 1030 cm(-1)) indicating a poor quality of the mineral. collagen maturity (calculated as the area ratio of subbands located at 1660 and 1690 cm(-1)) was significantly reduced in the hypo group. reduced biomechanical properties were observed at the tissue level. confined chicken represents a new model for the study of hypodynamia because bone changes are not created by a surgical lesion or a traumatic method. animals have a reduced bone mass and present with an altered bone matrix quality which is less mineralized and whose collagen contains less crosslinks than in control chicken.
asthma	purpose of reviewasthma exhibits significant heterogeneity in occurrence and severity over the lifespan. our goal is to discuss recent evidence regarding determinants of the natural history of asthma during childhood, and review the rationale behind and status of major efforts to alter its course.recent findingsvariations in microbial exposures are associated with risk of allergic disease, and the use of bacterial lysates may be a promising preventive strategy. exposure to air pollution appears to be particularly damaging in prenatal and early life, and interventions to reduce pollution are feasible and result in clinical benefit. e-cigarette use may have a role in harm reduction for conventional cigarette smokers with asthma, but has undefined short-term and long-term effects that must be clarified. vitamin d insufficiency over the first several years of life is associated with risk of asthma, and vitamin d supplementation reduces the risk of severe exacerbations.summarythe identification of risk factors for asthma occurrence, persistence and severity will continue to guide efforts to alter the natural history of the disease. we have reviewed several promising strategies that are currently under investigation. vitamin d supplementation and air pollution reduction have been shown to be effective strategies and warrant increased investigation and implementation.
lymphoma	to determine the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) of [i-131]tositumomab in patients with refractory/recurrent hodgkin lymphoma (hl) and to preliminarily determine if [i-131]tositumomab has activity against hl and if positron emission tomography (pet) with 2-deoxy-2-[f-18]fluoro-d-glucose ([f-18]dg) performed 6 weeks post-therapy predicted 12-week response. separate dose-finding studies were performed for patients with and without prior transplant. a single therapeutic total body radiation dose (tbd) of [i-131]tositumomab was administered. tbd was escalated/de-escalated based on dose-limiting hematologic toxicity (dlt) using a modified continual reassessment method. [f-18]dg-pet/ct scans were performed at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks post therapy. twelve patients (nine classical hl, three lymphocyte-predominant [lp] hl) completed two dosing levels (n = 3 each) in the post-transplant (55 cgy, 79 cgy) and no transplant (75 cgy, 87 cgy) groups. hematologic toxicities were common and transient. twelve weeks after [i-131]tositumomab, 10 patients progressed and two with lphl achieved complete response. [f-18]dg-pet/ct at 6 weeks post therapy appeared more predictive than ct at 6 weeks of a response at 12 weeks. tositumomab and [i-131]tositumomab was well-tolerated in patients with relapsed/refractory hl. complete responses in lphl support a therapeutic effect in this subtype. early metabolic response assessments by [f-18]dg-pet in hl after radioimmunotherapy appear to be more predictive than purely anatomic assessments.
dementia	background: aging naturally triggers a decline in cognition as result of deterioration in cerebral circuits, thus the executive functions (efs) suffer changes that progress from mild to severe states of impairment. exercise instead, works as a strategy for cognitive enhancement by modulating neuronal plasticity through the regulation of bdnf. however, whether the exercise-dependent bdnf may improve higher complexity processes such as the efs is still in a studying process. results: current data on exercise-dependent bdnf changes for aging individuals in a course of cognitive impairment was summarized to investigate whether the exercise regulation of bdnf is effective to pronounce long term changes on executive controls. while the exercise-dependent regulation of bdnf is currently undeniable, the role of exercise dependent bdnf as a tool for the improvement of efs in individuals with dementia is still less clear and seldom discussed. the summary of findings indicate a limited number of studies addressing exercise in order to discuss parameters related to either bdnf or executive functioning in such population conditions (n = 215), further narrowing to a total of 5 studies presenting analysis of both parameters. nonetheless, positive outcomes from bdnf and ef variables were displayed by all the populations exposed to exercise across studies. aerobic exercise was shown to be a major source for the enhancement of the bdnf-dependent executive functioning, when compared to cognitive stimulation. moreover, the effect of exercise-dependent bdnf on domains of executive functioning appears to occur in a dose-dependent manner for the aging individuals, independently of cognitive condition.
osteoporosis	previous publications widely reported that 25-hydroxyvitamin d-1-alpha-hydroxylase (cyp27b1) regulated the metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin d3, which has a close association between altered activity of vitamin d and vascular calcification has been reported in various human diseases, including chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis and atherosclerosis. vascular calcification is a clinically significant component of atherosclerosis and may be promoted by ros associated inflammatory. in this study, we evaluated the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin d-1-alpha-hydroxylase on the atherosclerosis disease both in apolipoprotein (apo) e-/-mice and wild-type mice. we also isolated endothelial cell (ecs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) in aortic from the wild type mice and apoe-/-mice respectively, then investigated that after parathyroid hormone (pth) both of the cyp27b1 and vitamin d receptor (vdr) expressions in apoe-/-ec and apoe-/-vsmc were higher than the wide-type ec and vsmcs. however, the increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis have showed in ec and vsmc compared with the cells from apo e-/-mice. moreover, the index associated with vascular calcification such as intracellular ca2+ concentration and alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity have been tested and the result suggested that the levels of the former index have improved in the apoe-/-ec and apoe-/-vsmc. we got similar conclusions under the pre-treatment with 1, 25(oh) 2d3.

ankylosing_spondylitis	adipokines, pleiotropic molecules produced by white adipose tissue (wat) have attracted the attention of scientists since 1994. the role of adipokines in metabolic syndrome is known and fixed. adipokines exerting a variety of metabolic activities have contributed to the ethiopathogenesis and the consequences of metabolic syndrome. furthermore, adipokines are involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and autoimmunity in the light of pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases. given some evidence for the influence of adipokines in metabolic syndrome, there may be a link between cvds and rheumatic diseases. this review provides an overview of the literature focusing on the role of adipokines in rheumatic diseases by putting special emphasis on the potential role of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, chemerin, visfatin and novel adipokines in connective tissue diseases.
children's_health	background: this study assesses the accuracy and comprehensiveness of online public health education materials from the three australian cities with active lead mines and or smelters: broken hill, mount isa and port pirie. methods: qualitative content analysis of online australian material with comparison to international best practice where possible. results: all materials provided incomplete information about the health effects of lead and pathways of exposure compared to best practice materials. inconsistent strategies to reduce exposure to lead were identified among the australian cities, and some evidence-based best practices were not included. the materials normalised environmental lead and neglected to identify that there is no safe level of lead, or that primary prevention is the best strategy for protecting children 's health. conclusions: health education materials need to clearly state health risks from lead across developmental stages and for sensitive populations, integrate a primary prevention perspective, and provide comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for reducing lead exposure in and around the home. families who rely on information provided by these online public education materials are likely to be inadequately informed about the importance of protecting their children from exposure to lead and strategies for doing so.
rheumatoid_arthritis	neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus patients may present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. common and heterogeneous, their characterization and attribution to systemic lupus erythematosus and non-systemic lupus erythematosus is important and derived from clinical assessment, selection and interpretation of investigations. a standardized approach to assigning attribution has been used in recent studies. the current therapies are largely empiric, based upon known disease mechanisms and treatment of other serious organ disease in systemic lupus erythematosus. further insight on the immunopathogenetic mechanisms and clinical outcome of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus is required to inform the design and execution of therapeutic clinical trials.
children's_health	nurses in swedish child and school healthcare need to balance their assignment of promoting children 's health and development based on the national health-monitoring programme with their responsibility to consider each child 's needs. in this balancing act, they encounter children through directed and pliable strategies to fulfil their professional obligations. the aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which nurses use different strategies when encountering children during their recurrent health visits throughout childhood. a quantitative descriptive content analysis was used to code 30 video recordings displaying nurses' encounters with children (3-16 years of age). a constructed observation protocol was used to identify the codes. the results show that nurses use pliable strategies (58%) and directed strategies (42%) in encounters with children. the action they use the most within the pliable strategy is encouraging (51%), while in the directed strategy, the action they use most is instructing (56%). that they primarily use these opposing actions can be understood as trying to synthesize their twofold assignment. however, they seem to act pliably to be able to fulfil their public function as dictated by the national health-monitoring programme, rather than to meet each child 's needs.
stress_management	the textile industry is the largest manufacturing industry at pakistan that has good reputation in global supply chains. organizations want to achieve excellence by optimally utilizing their human capital. socio-technical complexity of working systems along with high level of expectations, workplace stress management has become an area of deep concern where textile sector is no exception. it is highly important to address stress related issues so that organizations can capitalize benefits related to their human resource by ensuring their well-being at all levels. people involved in management, are expected to be vulnerable to stress because of their critical role in organizations. the objective of this study is to identify causes of workplace stress among managers of textile industry. in this cross-sectional study, data through a questionnaire has been collected from 125 managers from different areas of textile sector like spinning, weaving and apparel manufacturing. exploratory factor analysis has been carried out where factors like physical agents at work, training and development, support at work, family/work interface, work environment and role have been found to be the major causes of workplace stress.
anxiety	this study examined the effects of acculturation on anxiety and stress in latino and non-latino white parents of children undergoing outpatient surgery. participants included 686 parent-child dyads from four major children 's hospitals in the united states. latino parents who grew up in the u.s. reported higher levels of anxiety (p = 0.009) and stress (p < 0.001) compared to parents who grew up in a latin american country. additionally, english-speaking latino parents reported higher anxiety and stress compared to both spanish-speaking latino and non-latino white parents (p 's < 0.05), whereas spanish-speaking latino and non-latino white parents reported similar levels of stress and anxiety. results of the current study were consistent with the immigrant health paradox in that more acculturated latino parents reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than less acculturated latino and non-latino white parents, supporting the need for culturally tailored interventions in the perioperative environment.
children's_health	context: children living in slums are at high risk of being malnourished. there are no published reviews on existing interventions promoting better nutrition for children living in slums and the risk factors for children 's malnutrition. improved understanding of the risk factors for malnutrition in slums communities and the impact of interventions on children 's health can provide guidance to practitioners and decision-makers. the present review is designed to provide this information. methods: the search included 30 electronic bibliographic databases and relevant eligible studies published up to december 2013. results: the search located 1512 citations. full text relevance screening was conducted on 226 studies and on abstracts for 16 studies. the final 58 unique studies included 22 on interventions and 38 on risk. all of the interventions were nutrition-specific, with nutritional intervention being the most dominant type. seventy-three per cent of the interventions were assessed effective. conclusion: the findings stressed the gaps in knowledge in terms of quality assessment and programmatic recommendations to identify children who are the most at risk of malnutrition to appropriately target interventions. finally, the review helped to inform a systematic review (cochrane systematic review protocol 2015) that will examine the impact of interventions on outcome measures.
migraine	background: the large geographical gaps in our knowledge of the prevalence and burden of headache disorders include almost all of eastern mediterranean region (emr). we report a nationwide population-based study in pakistan, an emr country with the sixth largest population in the world, conducted as a project within the global campaign against headache. methods: we surveyed six locations from the four provinces of pakistan: punjab, sindh, khyber pakhtunkhwa and baluchistan. we randomly selected and visited rural and urban households in each. one adult member (18-65 years) of each household, also randomly selected, was interviewed by a trained non-medical interviewer from the same location using a previously-validated structured questionnaire translated into urdu, the national language. we estimated 1-year prevalences of the headache disorders of public-health importance and examined their associations with demographic variables using multivariate analysis. results: there were 4223 participants (mean age 34.4 +/- 11.0 years; male 1957 [46.3%], female 2266 [53.7%]; urban 1443 [34.2%], rural 2780 [65.8%]). participation proportion was 89.5%. headache in the previous year was reported by 3233 (76.6% [95% ci: 75.3-77.8%]). the age-and gender-adjusted 1-year prevalence of migraine was 22.5% [21.2-23.8%] (male 18.0% [16.8-19.2%], female 26.9% [25.6-28.2%]), of tension-type headache (tth) 44.6% [43.1-46.1%] (male 51.2% [49.7-52.7%], female 37.9% [36.4-39.4%]), of probable medication-overuse headache 0.7% [0.5-1.0%] (male 0.7% [0.5-1.0%], female 0.8% [0.5-1.1%]) and of other headache on >= 15 days/month 7.4% [6.6-8.2%] (male 4.4% [3.8-5.0%], female 10.4% [9.5-11.3%]). migraine was more prevalent in females by a factor of 3: 2 although this association barely survived (p = 0.039) after correcting for other factors. tth was more prevalent in males by about 4: 3 (p = 0.026). all headache and migraine were age-related, peaking in the age group 40-49 years; tth peaked a decade earlier. higher education (p = 0.004) and income (p = 0.001) were negatively associated with prevalence of migraine. conclusion: with three quarters of its population affected, headache disorders must be on the public-health agenda of pakistan. worldwide, these disorders are the third leading cause of disability; information from specific enquiry into the burden attributable to headache disorders in this country is needed to inform health policy and priority-setting, and will be reported soon.
digestive_health	low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. in the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called fermentation. as a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. low-digestible carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to avoid bacterial translocation. short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. they are considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. the bifidogenic effect of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention. unfermented carbohydrates increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel syndrome. in conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the maintenance of human digestive health. however, the strength of evidence differs between disease entities.
addiction	the transition from casual to compulsive drug use is thought to occur as a consequence of repeated drug taking leading to neuroadaptive changes in brain circuitry involved in emotion and cognition. at the basis of such neuroadaptations lie changes in the expression of immediate early genes (iegs) implicated in transcriptional regulation, synaptic plasticity and intracellular signalling. however, little is known about how ieg expression patterns change during long-term drug self-administration. the present study, therefore, compares the effects of 10 and 60-day self-administration of cocaine and sucrose on the expression of 17 iegs in brain regions implicated in addictive behaviour, i.e. dorsal striatum, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc). increased expression after cocaine self-administration was found for 6 iegs in dorsal and ventral striatum (c-fos, mkp1, fosb/delta fosb, egr2, egr4, and arc) and 10 iegs in mpfc (same 6 iegs as in striatum, plus bdnf, homer1, sgk1 and rgs2). five of these 10 iegs (egr2, fosb/delta fosb, bdnf, homer1 and jun) and trkb in mpfc were responsive to long-term sucrose self-administration. importantly, no major differences were found between ieg expression patterns after 10 or 60 days of cocaine self-administration, except fosb/delta fosb in dorsal striatum and egr2 in mpfc, whereas the amount of cocaine obtained per session was comparable for short-term and long-term self-administration. these steady changes in ieg expression are, therefore, associated with stable self-administration behaviour rather than the total amount of cocaine consumed. thus, sustained impulses to ieg regulation during prolonged cocaine self-administration may evoke neuroplastic changes underlying compulsive drug use.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	aging is associated with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. aging contributes to common processes including metabolic dysfunction, dna damage, and reactive oxygen species generation. although glycolysis has been linked to cell growth and proliferation, the mechanisms by which the activation of glycolysis by aging regulates fibrogenesis in the lung remain unclear. the objective of this study was to determine if glucose transporter 1 (glut1)-induced glycolysis regulates age-dependent fibrogenesis of the lung. mouse and human lung tissues were analyzed for glut1 and glycolytic markers using immunoblotting. glycolytic function was measured using a seahorse apparatus. to study the effect of glut1, genetic inhibition of glut1 was performed by short hairpin rna transduction, and phloretin was used for pharmacologic inhibition of glut1. glut1-dependent glycolysis is activated in aged lung. genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of glut1 suppressed the protein expression of a-smooth muscle actin, a key cytoskeletal component of activated fibroblasts, in mouse primary lung fibroblast cells. moreover, we demonstrated that the activation of amp activated protein kinase, which is regulated by glut1-dependent glycolysis, represents a critical metabolic pathway for fibroblast activation. furthermore, we demonstrated that phloretin, a potent inhibitor of glut1, significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. these results suggest that glut1-dependent glycolysis regulates fibrogenesis in aged lung and that inhibition of glut1 provides a potential target of therapy of age-related lung fibrosis.
osteoporosis	we assessed osteoporosis management in patients admitted for rehabilitation of acute hip fracture to an open system community hospital before and after institution of a fracture liaison service (fls). pre-fls, we surveyed 60 patients 4-6 months after hip fracture. subsequently, the fls program performed routine consultations, and recommended lab, bone density testing (bmd) and osteoporosis medication. fls program outcomes were assessed by survey in 75 patients after hip fracture. in the pre-fls population, after hip fracture, 55 % changed calcium intake, 48 % changed vitamin d intake, and 35 % obtained a bmd. osteoporosis medication was taken by 38 % before and 33 % after hip fracture. post-fls, 56 % changed calcium intake, 68 % changed vitamin d intake and 65 % obtained a bmd. post- fls, osteoporosis medicationwas taken by 21 % of patients before and 19 % after hip fracture. our fls program in hip fracture patients improved non-pharmacologicmeasures, but not the use of osteoporosis medication.
stress_management	the objectives of this study were to: (1) assess the prevalence of anxiety and stress in indian women; and (2) evaluate the relationship of occupation to the prevalence of anxiety and stress. a cross-sectional study was performed from january 2013 to june 2014, on women (aged 18-50 years) randomly selected from different occupations in gujarat, india. anxiety was evaluated using spielberg 's state and trait anxiety inventory scale and stress was assessed using the international stress management association questionnaire. serum cortisol concentration was measured in a sub-sample. the association of occupation with stress and anxiety was analyzed by a generalized linear model adjusted for age. among all participants, 26% were the most prone and 66% were somewhat more prone to stress; 35% of women showed high anxiety levels. homemakers had 1.2 times higher anxiety and 1.3 times higher stress than working women (p <.05). prevalence of stress (37%, p.05) by occupation. this study revealed high prevalence rates of stress and anxiety in indian women. involvement in activities outside the home may help women to reduce stress.
osteoporosis	sarcopenia is more prevalent in patients with distal radius fracture (drf) than in age-and sex-matched controls. lower appendicular mass index in men and weaker grip strength in both men and women increase the likelihood of drf. introduction sarcopenia is a core component of physical frailty that predisposes older people to falls and negatively impacts the activities of daily living. the objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with drf with that in age-and sex-matched controls without drf; and evaluate the association between sarcopenia and the occurrence of drf. methods we prospectively recruited 132 patients over 50 years of age who sustained drf due to fall and 132 age- and sex-matched controls without drf. a definition of sarcopenia was based on the consensus of the asian working group for sarcopenia. sarcopenic components including appendicular lean body mass, grip strength, and gait speed were compared between the two groups. other factors assessed for the occurrence of drf were age, gender, body mass index (bmi), lumbar, and hip bone mineral density (bmd) values. a conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between sarcopenia and the occurrence of drf. results a total of 39 (30%) of 132 drf patients were sarcopenic, whereas 23 (17%) of the 132 controls were within the sarcopenic criteria (p = 0.048). the patient group had significantly lower lean body mass and weaker grip strength than those of the control group. however, there was no significant difference in gait speed between the two groups. according to regression analysis, lower appendicular mass index in men was associated with an increased incidence of drf (odds ratio [or] = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.72, 0.95) while weaker grip strength and lower total hip bmd values were associated with the occurrence of drf in both men (or = 0.77, 95% ci = 0.63, 0.92; and or = 0.79, 95% ci = 0.64, 0.94, respectively) and women (or = 0.78, 95% ci = 0.64, 0.93, and or = 0.73, 95% ci = 0.52, 0.92, respectively). conclusions sarcopenia is more prevalent in patients with drf than in age-and sex-matched controls. lower appendicular mass in men, weaker grip strength, and lower hip bmd in both men and women increase the likelihood of drf.
rheumatoid_arthritis	one of the gold standards for animal models of rheumatoid arthritis is the murine collagen-induced arthritis model. native type ii collagen together with cfa is injected into susceptible mouse strains. unfortunately, only mice with h-2(q) or h-2(r) mhc haplotypes are susceptible, making the widely used c57bl/6 mouse strain, which carries the h-2(b) haplotype, resistant against the disease. in this issue of the european journal of immunology, stevanin etal. [eur. j. immunol. 2017. 47: 637-645] now convincingly show that although wt c57bl/6 mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis, mice with a homozygous deletion of cd11b on the same genetic background are fully susceptible in this important animal model of rheumatoid arthritis. they clearly demonstrate that the injection of type ii collagen together with cfa leads to early onset of the disease with high incidence and with sustained severity. the authors further characterize this disease with an increase of leukocyte infiltration and enhanced th17 differentiation.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	the field of interstitial lung disease (ild) has undergone significant evolution in recent years, with an increasing incidence and more complex, ever expanding disease classification. in their most severe forms, these diseases lead to progressive loss of lung function, respiratory failure and eventually death. despite notable advances, progress has been challenged by a poor understanding of pathological mechanisms and patient heterogeneity, including variable progression. the diagnostic pathway is thus being continually refined, with the introduction of tools such as transbronchial cryo lung biopsy and a move towards genetically aided, precision medicine. in this review, we focus on how to approach a patient with ild and the diagnostic process.
mental_health	mothers and children often experience negative outcomes following unintended pregnancies. the current study examined for whom and under what conditions unintended pregnancy was associated with negative outcomes among a sample of 682 first-time mothers, recruited as part of the predicting and preventing child neglect in teen mothers study. specifically, maternal demographic characteristics were examined as moderators of the association between pregnancy intention and parenting behaviors when children were 18 months old. results revealed that unintended pregnancy was associated with fewer positive parenting behaviors; however, both maternal race and education moderated the association. among mothers who identified as black or hispanic, those who intended to get pregnant were less likely to demonstrate positive parenting behaviors, and those with less education tended to demonstrate fewer positive parenting behaviors regardless of pregnancy intention. implications for research, prevention, and intervention are discussed.
smoking_cessation	individuals are increasingly turning to the internet to search for health information. however, scholarship has yet to carefully examine how online health information seelcing contributes to post-search health behaviors, including the sharing of information found during the search with others. combining insights from the appraisal theory of emotions and social cognitive theory, this study used a naturalistic experiment (n = 380) to test a model of the role of post-search emotions in shaping post search cognitions and behavior in the context of influenza. moreover, the vast amount of online health information some of it of dubious quality makes the task of finding relevant information difficult. therefore, this experiment also tested an approach to improving the online health information seeking process by tailoring search engine results about influenza to the emotional action tendencies of users. this study finds varied effects for different post-search discrete emotions (fear, hope, contentment, interest, and inspiration) and explores how social cognitive mediators and perceived relevance shape post-search attitudes and behaviors. the results underscore the importance of studying discrete emotional reactions to online health information in order to better predict the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of this popular avenue for acquiring health information.

children's_health	background: although metals can adversely impact children 's health, the distribution of exposures to many metals, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations, is not well characterized. objectives: we sought to determine whether neighborhood deprivation was associated with urinary concentrations of thirteen metals and whether observed relationships varied by race/ethnicity. methods: we obtained neighborhood characteristics from the 2005-2009 american community survey. demographic information and urine samples from 400 healthy young girls in northern california were obtained during a clinical visit. urine samples were analyzed for metals using inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and levels were corrected for creatinine. we ran analysis of variance and generalized linear regression models to estimate associations of urinary metal concentrations with neighborhood deprivation and race/ethnicity and stratified multivariable models to evaluate possible interactions among predictors on metals concentrations. results: urinary concentrations of three metals (barium, lead, antimony) varied significantly across neighborhood deprivation quartiles, and four (barium, lead, antimony, tin) varied across race/ethnicity groups. in models adjusted for family income and cotinine, both race/ethnicity (f-3,f-224 = 4.34, p = 0.01) and neighborhood deprivation (f-3,f-224 = 4.32, p = 0.01) were associated with antimony concentrations, but neither were associated with lead, barium, or tin, concentrations. examining neighborhood deprivation within race/ethnicity groups, barium levels (p(interaction) < 0.01) decreased with neighborhood deprivation among hispanic girls (p(trend) < 0.001) and lead levels (p(interaction) = 0.06) increased with neighborhood deprivation among asian girls (p(trend) = 0.04). conclusions: our results indicate that children 's vulnerability to some metals varies by neighborhood deprivation quartile and race/ethnicity. these differential distributions of exposures may contribute to environmental health disparities later in life.

kidney_health	introduction: chronic kidney disease (ckd) in adults is a common condition and a major public health issue worldwide. there has been related to a high risk of end stage renal disease (esrd), cardiovascular disease and death. given the increasing incidence of ckd and the availability of effective therapeutic measures, is of vital importance perform early detection of risk factors (rf), in order to delay or prevent progression to esrd. the optimal cost-effective strategy seems to be an investigation aimed at patients with one or more risk factors for ckd. in order to detect early indicators of ckd and associated risk factors, we conducted a study in an adult population. methods: in a cross-sectional study was evaluated bp, bmi, blood glucose, serum creatinine and albumin/creatinine ratio in urine sample in 608 people>18 years. participants were classified for stages of ckd according to the presence of albuminuria and / or estimated glomerular filtration rate (mdrd4, ckd-epi and cg). for statistical analysis (stata 11.0) we used fisher 's exact test, ttest and cox regression to explore the association between variables. effect measure rr and 95% ci, was considered significant when p55 years 52.8%, hypertension 39.3% obesity 36.8%, carbohydrate metabolism disorders (chmd)21.2%, diabetes: 14.1% (dbt), smoking 12.31%, albuminuria 11%. ckd was found in 14% of participants, 40% were male, albuminuria in 78.8% and gfr55, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and educational level. the 21.8% of hypertensive patients, 37.3% of those with chmd and 100% with albuminuria did not know that condition. conclusion: in this population to be a male, to have>55 years, hypertension, obesity and diabetes it increases the risk of developing ckd. we identified a high percentage (61.5%) of individuals with rf and erc. the implementation of campaigns for early detection of rf and treatment would reduce the incidence and progression of ckd. we found a frequency of ckd and albuminuria similar to others international reports contributing to the understanding of this disease and its prevalence in argentina.
migraine	introduction: the association between primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (pmne) and behavioral disorders was highlighted frequently, suggesting psychiatric origin. on the other hand, there is no difference between the incidence of mental disorders in children with pmne and controls, although the psychological genesis could provide additional secondary forms, in which the child might react to stressful events with the resumption of involuntary urination at night, with a possible alteration of bowel control due to a high vulnerability to stressors. the purpose of this study is assessing the stressful events of life in a sample of children with pmne. materials and methods: 56 subjects with pmne, (37 males and 19 females) (mean 10.87 years; sd +/- 1.68) were recruited consecutively. all subjects were evaluated for the presence of stressful events (icu) with test coddington life events scales (cles). the control group consists of 98 typically developing children (65 males, 33 females) (p = 0.855) (mean 11.3 years; sd +/- 1.85; p = 0.594). results: individuals with enuresis do not show a significant difference in the prevalence of stressful events than the control group (42.85% vs 41.83%; chi-square = 0.002; p = 0,963) (table 1). conclusions: these results for the first time show that pmne can be regarded as an independent state by stress factors, suggesting that it itself represents a stress factor that can affect the proper psychological and neuropsychological development in children.
migraine	context: neurocognitive test scores are often considered an important aspect of concussion management. to best use these data, clinicians must understand potential factors that may influence baseline performance on these tests. objective: to determine preexisting factors that may influence performance on the immediate post-concussion assessment and cognitive test (impact). design: cross-sectional study. setting: research laboratory. patients or other participants: a total of 486 national collegiate athletic association division i collegiate student-athletes. main outcome measure(s): to determine neurocognitive functioning and total symptom score at baseline, impact was administered. outcomes were verbal memory, visual memory, visual motor speed, reaction time, and total symptom score. a self-report demographic section at the beginning of impact was used to gather information concerning previous treatment for headaches, migraines, and psychiatric conditions; diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and exposure to previous strenuous exercise. we conducted multivariate analyses of variance to determine if the impact composite and total symptom scores differed according to preexisting factors (p < .0083). results: sex showed an effect on verbal memory (p = .001), visual motor speed (p < .001), and reaction time (p = .006), with women performing better than men. a previous diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affected visual motor speed (p = .008). previous treatment for headaches (p < .001), migraines (p = .001), a psychiatric condition (p < .001), or a diagnosis ofattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p < .001) all showed effects on the total symptom score. strenuous exercise did not affect neurocogntive performance or total symptom score. conclusions: based on our findings and the previous literature, we suggest that many preexisting factors influence baseline neurocognitive data. baseline testing is an important aspect of concussion management. sports medicine professionals should be cognizant of these factors when developing concussion-management protocols.
anxiety	depressive delusion is the key symptom of psychotic depression also known as major depressive disorder with psychotic features (icd-10: f 32.3). delusional topics are limited to guilt, impoverishment and hypochondria. kurt schneider described these as being the three primordial fears of human beings. psychotic depression is distinguished by the particular severity and frequency of the episodes of illness as well as by increased suicidal tendencies. although one in five patients with a major depression experiences psychotic symptoms, this condition is all too easily overlooked and the appropriate therapy is not initiated. here we use case histories to illustrate some of the obstacles to diagnosis arising from the difficulty of identifying delusions hidden in a person 's experience of depression, life history and personality. a targeted active exploration of these difficulties is significant taking into account the observable symptoms and not only the subjectively experienced symptoms. a phenomenological approach is chosen to explore the matter of depressive delusion and to investigate the interaction of delusion and affect and the special importance of anxiety for the genesis of delusion. in accordance with the current treatment recommendations and against this background, it is proposed that the pharmacological strategy should be supplemented by the use of benzodiazepines more often than has it has been in the past.
asthma	diffuse panbronchiolitis (dpb) and asthma are obstructive airway diseases, the former being characterized by th1-type and the latter by th2type airway inflammation. differential diagnosis is often a problem, but coexistence has rarely been reported. a 76-year-old man with asthma was admitted to our hospital because of one-month history of dyspnoea on exertion with bilateral diffuse granular shadows. he also had a history of chronic sinusitis. auscultation of the lungs showed coarse crackles and wheezes. laboratory data revealed an elevated total serum immunoglobulin e and a high titre of cold agglutinin. bronchoscopic evaluations of the shadows revealed compatible pathological findings in both dpb and asthma. low-dose macrolide caused a prompt reduction of symptoms, along with improvements in radiographic findings and pulmonary functions, whereas the eosinophilic airway inflammation transiently worsened. when dpb and asthma coexist, the balance of th1/th2 immune response may be reciprocally altered by therapeutic intervention.
smoking_cessation	objectivespharmacists are increasingly providing specialized services. however, no process exists for specialist certification in canada. the aim of this study was to determine the extent to which canadian community pharmacists support the development of a certification system for specialization. methodsthis study utilized a cross-sectional online survey of licensed canadian pharmacists identified through the member databases of national and regional pharmacy associations. a questionnaire was developed (in french and english) and distributed via email, on behalf of the researchers, by multiple pharmacy organizations in january 2015. multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to identify which sub-groups of respondents supported the creation of a certification system and which supported mandatory certification. key findingsa total of 770 responses were received. many respondents were practising specialists (30.0%, 205/683) and the most commonly reported specialty areas were diabetes, smoking cessation and geriatrics. almost 85% (n = 653/770) supported creation of a canadian certification process and 68.5% (n = 447/653) felt certification should be mandatory. respondents believed that the primary benefit of a certification system was greater public confidence in pharmacist specialist skills. they also felt that the most important factor in the development of the system is to create national definitions for specialty practice. the main barrier was the lack of reimbursement for specialty services in canada. conclusionsthe majority of canadian community pharmacist respondents support the creation of a certification process for pharmacist specialization. future study is required to confirm this finding in a larger sample and to determine the optimal model and the financial feasibility of a national system in canada.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and often fatal condition that is believed to be partially orchestrated by macrophages. mechanisms that control migration of these cells into and within the lung remain undefined. we evaluated the contributions of the semaphorin receptor, plexin c1 (plxnc1), and the exocytic calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 7 (syt7), in these processes. we evaluated the role of plxnc1 in macrophage migration by using boyden chambers and scratch tests, characterized its contribution to experimentally induced lung fibrosis in mice, and defined the mechanism for our observations. our findings reveal that relative to control participants, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis demonstrate excessive monocyte migration and underexpression of plxnc1 in the lungs and circulation, a finding that is recapitulated in the setting of scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease. relative to wild type, plxnc1(-/-) mouse macrophages are excessively migratory, and plxnc1(-/-) mice show exacerbated collagen accumulation in response to either inhaled bleomycin or inducible lung targeted tgf-beta 1 overexpression. these findings are ameliorated by replacement of plxnc1 on bone marrow-derived cells or by genetic deletion of syt7. these data demonstrate the previously unrecognized observation that plxnc1 deficiency permits syt7-mediated macrophage migration and enhances mammalian lung fibrosis.
stress_management	the term ""somatization"" refers to the manifestation of multiple somatic complaints not explained by organic changes. according to the literature, 15-25 percent of all medical visits are related to somatization. as medical training does not put enough emphasis on the evaluation of the possible psychological background of certain somatic symptoms, physicians may feel powerless and make unjustified diagnostic and therapeutic efforts. the patients may also feel helpless and frustrated, their anxiety and the intensity of their complaints may increase. as stress is an important factor in the somatization process, stress reduction and improvement of coping are key elements of the treatment guidelines for chronic diseases. evidence based interventions range from short counselling and medication to cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy. reattribution, a short (10-30 minutes) structured intervention that can be implemented in primary or secondary care, in certain cases can result in significant decrease in somatic symptoms and anxiety.
psoriatic_arthritis	psoriasis is a complex inflammatory disorder of the skin that affects up to 3.2% of the people in the united states. it is associated with psoriatic arthritis, a potentially debilitating inflammatory joint condition. psoriatic patients also have an increased risk of lymphoma, heart disease, type ii diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. the degree to which each patient is affected with and by psoriasis can vary greatly. the treatment available for these patients includes topical products, phototherapy, traditional systemic medications, and biologics. with the high cost of healthcare in the united states, as healthcare providers, we must consider the direct and indirect costs of psoriasis. the annual cost of psoriasis in the united states for the year 2013 was approximately $112 billion. current guidelines, which utilize evidence-based practice recommendations, help to provide patients with the most cost-effective treatment to yield the best results.
osteoarthritis	success in cartilage and fibrocartilage tissue engineering relies heavily on using an appropriate cell source. many different cell sources have been identified, including primary and stem cells, along with experimental strategies to obtain the required number of cells or to induce chondrogenesis. however, no definitive method exists to quantitatively evaluate the similarity of the resulting cell phenotypes to those of the native cells between candidate strategies. in this study, we develop an integrative approach to enable such evaluations by deriving, from gene expression profiles, two quantitative metrics representing the nearest location within the range of native cell phenotypes and the deviation from it. as an example application to evaluating potential cell sources for cartilage or meniscus tissue engineering, we examine phenotypic changes of juvenile and adult articular chondrocytes and fibrochondrocytes across multiple passages and subsequent 3d culture. a substantial change was observed in cell phenotype due to the isolation process itself, followed by a clear progression toward the outer meniscal cell phenotype with passage. the new metrics also indicated that 3d culture moderately reduced the passage-induced deviation from the native meniscal phenotypes for juvenile chondrocytes and adult fibrochondrocytes, which was not obvious through examination of individual gene expressions. however, brief 3d culture alone did not move any of the cells towards an inner meniscal phenotype, the most relevant target for meniscal tissue engineering. this integrative approach of examining and combining multiple gene expressions can be used to evaluate various other tissue-engineering strategies to direct cells toward the desired phenotype. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
atrial_fibrillation	dabigatran is an oral, direct thrombin inhibitor approved by international regulatory agencies for stroke prevention in patients with paroxysmal or persistent non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (af). the benefits of dabigatran are widely described, but its use in the geriatric population is not without risk. chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity with af, and thus frequent checks of renal function in elderly patients are recommended. we report a case of dabigatran intoxication in an elderly man affected by heart failure and worsening renal function, who developed acute hepatitis and coma, which was successfully treated with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. although extracorporeal therapy has been suggested as a strategy for clearing dabigatran during acute bleeding, this approach may be useful in other dabigatran-related, life-threatening conditions, such as that described in this report.
atrial_fibrillation	aims the aim of this study is to develop models to aid the decision to prolong dual antiplatelet therapy (dapt) that requires balancing an individual patient 's potential benefits and harms methods and results using population-based electronic health records (ehrs) (caliber, england, 2000-10), of patients evaluated 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (mi), we developed (n= 12 694 patients) and validated (n= 5613) prognostic models for cardiovascular (cardiovascular death, mi or stroke) events and three different bleeding endpoints. we applied trial effect estimates to determine potential benefits and harms of dapt and the net clinical benefit of individuals. prognostic models for cardiovascular events (c-index: 0.75 (95% ci: 0.74, 0.77)) and bleeding (c index 0.72 (95% ci: 0.67, 0.77)) were well calibrated: 3-year risk of cardiovascular events was 16.5% overall (5.2% in the lowest-and 46.7% in the highest-risk individuals), while for major bleeding, it was 1.7% (0.3% in the lowest-and 5.4% in the highest-risk patients). for every 10 000 patients treated per year, we estimated 249 (95% ci: 228, 269) cardiovascular events prevented and 134 (95% ci: 87, 181) major bleeding events caused in the highest-risk patients, and 28 (95% ci: 19, 37) cardiovascular events prevented and 9 (95% ci: 0, 20) major bleeding events caused in the lowest-risk patients. there was a net clinical benefit of prolonged dapt in 63-99% patients depending on how benefits and harms were weighted conclusion prognostic models for cardiovascular events and bleeding using population-based ehrs may help to personalise decisions for prolonged dapt 1-year following acute mi.
osteoarthritis	study design: resident 's case problem. background: although rare in the general population, bone and soft tissue tumors may be more frequently encountered in patients seeking physical therapy because of the propensity of their initial symptoms to mimic those of commonly treated musculoskeletal disorders. screening for tumors requires the physical therapist to be attentive to unexpected findings. the purpose of this paper was to describe the clinical-reasoning and screening processes of physical therapists who facilitated the timely recognition of bone and soft tissue tumors in 3 patients referred through medical channels. diagnosis: the referral diagnoses were lumbar spinal stenosis, calcaneal bursitis, and postexcisional quadriceps weakness. when comprehensively examined, each of the patients had either atypical examination findings or failed to respond to physical therapy treatment. after the physical therapists alerted the appropriate medical providers of the examination findings, diagnoses of high-grade osteosarcoma of the pelvis, chondroma of the knee, and liposarcoma of the thigh followed. discussion: tumors of the lower extremity can initially mimic common musculoskeletal pathology. physical therapists must remain alert for red flags, atypical signs and symptoms, and poor responses to treatment, even when patients are referred through medical channels. particular attention is necessary in the case of unusual symptoms in the lower extremity, where over half of primary malignant tumors occur.
osteoarthritis	introduction: this is a detailed comparative analysis of the effects of direct-current (dc) microcurrent point stimulation (mps) on the autonomic nervous system, when applied in the battlefield acupuncture (bfa) protocol for 8 patients with histories of pain. methods: evaluations entailed a standard baseline visual analogue scale (vas) for pain, saliva cortisol, and a baseline status of 27 autonomic nervous system (ans) functions, for a total of 29 markers, all repeated prior to and following electrotherapy on this cohort of patients. results: the ans response to microcurrent point electrical nerve stimulation reflected a statistically significant pre-post improvement in 8 of the 29 markers collected: (1) pain on the vas scale was reduced by 63% (2.0625 points; 95% ci [confidence interval]: 1.2745-2.8505; p=0.0001); (2) heart rate variability improved by 42% (662.375 points; 95% ci: -1273.675 to -51.075; p=0.037); (3) high frequency-vagal tone improved by 56% (231.25 points; 95% ci: -430.42 to -31.58); p=0.029); (4) exercise tolerance increased by 22% (9.500 points; 95% ci: -16.747 to -2.253; p=0.017); (5) parasympathetic activity improved by 38% (14.000 points; 95% ci: -23.202 to -4.798; p=0.009); (6) stress was reduced by 27% (39.125 points; 95% ci: 1.945-76,305); p=0.042); (7) the ptgi [photoplethysmography index] cardiac marker of endothelial function, arterial blood flow, and ans regulation improved by 48% (21.5125 points; 95% ci: -35.441754 to 7.5832461; p=0.008); (8) cardiac marker ptgvlfi [photoplethysmography very low frequency index]-an ans regulation marker of endothelial function and an indicator of ss-cell activity had a statistically significant reduction of 36% (9.250 points; 95% ci: 1.062-17.438; p=0.032). salivary cortisol decreased by 14% (0.08286 points; 95% ci: -0.1182 to 0.28384; p=0.352). conclusions: the positive and impressive results in this study showed significant improvement in several parameters of ans function and reduction in pain and cortisol levels. if replicated, this study paves the way for use of dc mps applied to the bfa protocol for other pathologies that are known to be affected by sympathetic nervous system activation.
smoking_cessation	non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (cvd), obesity, cancer, pulmonary disease, and diabetes are a very high global health concern. the health costs of risk factors for cvd, such as hypertension (htn), is mounting and are unrelenting. as an example, it is estimated that direct and indirect costs due to htn amounted to $46.4 billion in 2011 and projections of six-fold increases by 2030; the importance of low-cost nonpharmacological interventions involving collaborative teams of health care professionals is at a critical junction. certainly, the data supported by research including some clinical trials for healthy living interventions support deploying health education, nutrition, smoking cessation, and physical activity(pa) in preventing cvd risk, such as htn. exercise training (et) for blood pressure (bp) control has been shown to be an effective and integral component of bp management. however, less is known about what optimization of pa/et modalities with nutrition and lifestyle tracking with modern era technologies will bring to this equation. new research methods may need to consider how to collaborate to collect data in using teams of researchers while interacting with community centers, school systems, and in traditional health care practices. this review will discuss and present what is known about the research that support modern era healthy living medicine and how this data may be integrated in venues that support health lifestyle in the community (i.e. schools and the work place).

healthy_sleep	background: adolescents' sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being are related. however, few studies have examined the relationship between sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being longitudinally across adolescence - a time of profound biological and psychosocial change. the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether shorter sleep duration in adolescents is predictive of lower subjective psychological well-being 6 months and 12 months later or whether lower subjective psychological well-being is predictive of shorter sleep duration. methods: adolescents (age range, 10.02-15.99 years; mean age, 13.05 +/- 1.49 years; 51.8%, female) from german-speaking switzerland (n=886) and norway (n=715) reported their sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being on school days using self-rating questionnaires at baseline (t1), 6 months (t2), and 12 months from baseline (t3). results: cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed that sleep duration decreased with age. longer sleep duration was concurrently associated with better subjective psychological well-being. crossed-lagged autoregressive longitudinal panel analysis showed that sleep duration prospectively predicted subjective psychological well-being while there was no evidence for the reverse relationship. conclusion: sleep duration is predictive of subjective psychological well-being. the findings offer further support for the importance of healthy sleep patterns during adolescence.
digestive_health	the maintenance of gut health is complex and relies on a delicate balance between the diet, the commensal microflora and the mucosa, including the digestive epithelium and the overlying mucus layer. superimposed on this balance is the frequent presence of enteric bacteria with pathogenic potential, the proliferation and metabolic activity of which may perturb digestive function, and lead to diarrhoea, poor growth rates and even death. such enteric infections with pathogenic bacteria are common in young animals and children. diet has an important influence on gut health, including effects on proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, and it can provide either beneficial or harmful input. dietary fibre (df) is a dietary component that has a major influence in this regard. df is a heterogeneous class of components that are not hydrolysed by digestive enzymes of non-ruminant animals, and consequently are the main substrates for bacterial fermentation in the distal part of the gut. this review presents evidence that some components of dietary fibre may improve gut health, or alternatively enhance gut perturbation and subsequent diarrhoea in young animals (including piglets, chickens and children). this review reports and discusses how df interacts with the gut epithelium and mucus, directly or by the way of the microflora, and consequently can protect against or enhance enteric infections.

rheumatoid_arthritis	rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint destruction caused by infiltrating leukocytes including t cells. an important role in t cell co-stimulation is played by the cd28, as a stimulatory signal transducer and the inhibitory ctla-4. ccl5 is produced by circulating t cells and plays an active role in the chemotactic activity of t cells in ra. the aim of this study was to examine the associations between polymorphisms within cd28, ctla-4, and ccl5 genes and ra. we examined 422 patients (340 female, 82 male, mean age 57.5 +/- 12.5 years) with rheumatoid arthritis and 338 healthy subjects (261 female, 77 male). disease activity was determined on the basis of das28 score. the patients with das28 of2.5 were classified as subjects with active form of ra. there were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of studied genotypes and alleles between ra patients and the control group. a statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of ctla4 exon 1 +49a >g rs231775 genotypes between patients with das282.5 where the increased frequency of aa genotype among patients with das28 >2.5 was revealed (or 1.55; 95% ci 1.01-2.38). the results of our study suggest no significant association between cd28 rs1980422, ccl5 rs2107538, ctla-4 exon 1 +49a >g rs231775 and rs3087243 gene polymorphisms and ra in the polish population. our results indicate a possible association between ctla-4 exon 1 +49a >g rs231775 gene polymorphism and ra activity.
dementia	background: in previous years a substantial number of studies have identified statistically important predictors of nursing home admission (nha). however, as far as we know, the analyses have been done at the population-level. no prior research has analysed the prediction accuracy of a nha model for individuals. methods: this study is an analysis of 3056 longer-term home care customers in the city of tampere, finland. data were collected from the records of social and health service usage and rai-hc (resident assessment instrument home care) assessment system during january 2011 and september 2015. the aim was to find out the most efficient variable subsets to predict nha for individuals and validate the accuracy. the variable subsets of predicting nha were searched by sequential forward selection (sfs) method, a variable ranking metric and the classifiers of logistic regression (lr), support vector machine (svm) and gaussian naive bayes (gnb). the validation of the results was guaranteed using randomly balanced data sets and cross-validation. the primary performance metrics for the classifiers were the prediction accuracy and auc (average area under the curve). results: the lr and gnb classifiers achieved 78% accuracy for predicting nha. the most important variables were rai maple (method for assigning priority levels), functional impairment (rai iadl, activities of daily living), cognitive impairment (rai cps, cognitive performance scale), memory disorders (diagnoses g30-g32 and f00-f03) and the use of community-based health-service and prior hospital use (emergency visits and periods of care). conclusion: the accuracy of the classifier for individuals was high enough to convince the officials of the city of tampere to integrate the predictive model based on the findings of this study as a part of home care information system. further work need to be done to evaluate variables that are modifiable and responsive to interventions.
osteoporosis	we conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a population-based patient-centered post-fracture care program with a dedicated case manager, prevention of osteoporosis (prevost), on appropriate post-fracture osteoporosis management. we showed that, compared to usual care, bmd investigation post-fracture was significantly improved (+20%) by our intervention program. our study aims to evaluate the impact of a population-based patient-centered post-fracture care program, prevost, on appropriate post-fracture care. multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolling 436 women aged 50 to 85 years and attending a french hospital, for a low-energy fracture of the wrist or humerus. randomization was stratified by age, hospital department, and site of fracture. the intervention was performed by a trained case manager who interacted only with the patients, with repeated oral and written information about fragility fractures and osteoporosis management, and prompting them to visit their primary care physicians. control group received usual care. the primary outcome was the initiation of an appropriate post-fracture care defined by bone mineral density (bmd) and/or anti-osteoporotic treatment prescription at 6 months. at 6 months, 53% of women in intervention group initiated a post-fracture care versus 33% for usual care (adjor 2.35, 95%ci [1.58-3.50], p < 0.001). post-fracture care was more frequent after wrist than humerus fracture (adjor 1.93, 95%ci [1.14-3.30], p = 0.015) and decreased with age (adjor for 10 years increase 0.76, 95%ci [0.61-0.96], p = 0.02). the intervention resulted in bmd prescription in 50% of patients (adjor 2.10, 95%ci [1.41-3.11], p < 0.001) and in bmd performance in 41% of patients (adjor 2.12, 95%ci [1.40-3.20], p < 0.001) versus 33 and 25% for usual care, respectively. having performed a bmd increased treatment prescription; however, only 46% of women with a low bmd requiring a treatment according to the french guidelines received a prescription. a patient-centered care program with a dedicated case manager can significantly improve post-fracture bmd investigation.
stress_management	physiological effects of a dog-assisted, stress management and communication training program conducted in a prison were investigated by assessing salivary cortisol concentrations of prison inmates before and after the sessions. the program was conducted with groups of inmates with psychiatric and/or developmental disorders. in the program, male inmates interacted with trained pet dogs and their volunteer handlers. inmates evaluated their mood states before and after each session by using a questionnaire. moreover, handlers evaluated the quality of the interaction with inmates after each session. results indicated that the inmates' cortisol values in most cases decreased following their participation in the sessions. the inmates who demonstrated stress reduction by decreasing cortisol values were diagnosed only psychiatric disorders, were aware of their mood improvement, and were evaluated by the handlers as having interacted well during the sessions. this indicated the validity of psychiatrists' diagnoses, inmates' self-evaluation, and handlers' evaluation of inmates. also, inmates who experienced a medium mood without mood changes had decreased cortisol values. it is suggested that these results are useful for predicting and selecting inmates who are expected to obtain effects by participating in the program. moreover, it is suggested that providing feedback to inmates about changes in their salivary cortisol levels could help them better understand their psychophysical state, which could result in more effective stress management.
anxiety	an essential step to wide-scale dissemination is to investigate moderators of intervention effectiveness. this study examined moderators of the effects of a universal school-based mindfulness program on adolescents' depressive symptoms. based on theory and previous research, we identified the following potential moderators: (1) severity of symptoms of depression at baseline, (2) gender, (3) age, and (4) school track. the study uses a pooled dataset from two consecutive randomized controlled trials in adolescents (13-18 years) in secondary schools in belgium. results on effectiveness based on the first trial were published in this journal (raes et al. 2014). a second consecutive trial was conducted to obtain a more equal distribution between school tracks and to enlarge power, yielding a total of 605 students from nine schools. in each school, parallel classes were randomized to the mindfulness condition or usual curriculum control condition. data were collected 1 week before and 1 week after delivery of the training and at 6-month follow-up. moderation was tested longitudinally with multilevel models across the three repeated measures and across condition. we found no moderation effects of gender, age, and school track. six months after the training, we found a marginally significant moderation effect for severity of symptoms of depression at baseline with greater decrease in symptoms for students with high levels of depression. the general absence of differential intervention effects for gender, age, and school track supports the broad scope of the school-based mindfulness group intervention.
anxiety	purpose of review the review focused on associations between temperament dimensions and clinical features in different anxiety disorders, likewise in obsessive-compulsive disorder in clinical samples of adults. a literature search was conducted in the medline and psycinfo databases covering the years 2010-2016. a systematic review and grading of the level of evidence for an association between temperament dimension scores and clinical features in each disorder were performed. recent findings twenty papers reporting 18 different studies were included. five of the papers focused on panic disorder (pd), five on social anxiety disorder (sad), three on post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), one on generalized anxiety disorder (gad), three on obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), and an additional three papers on several anxiety disorders. summary the review consolidates the finding that trait anxiety, especially as assessed by cloninger 's model or the fivefactor model, is a phenomenon common to all anxiety disorders and ocd. more follow-up studies including large samples are needed to differentiate the dimensional profiles of trait anxiety in specific disorders.
atrial_fibrillation	background: autonomic nervous activity plays a critical role in the genesis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (af, paf). however, the role of autonomic nervous activity on af termination has not been elucidated. heart rate variability (hrv) is widely used to evaluate autonomic nervous activity in humans. the purpose of this study was to assess whether autonomic nervous activity assessed by hrv contributes to af termination. methods: electrocardiograms (ecgs) and hrv were studied in patients with termination of sustained (>30 s) paf by 24-hour ambulatory holter monitoring. the 20-minute interval after termination of af was divided into four segments of 5 minutes each, and a frequency analysis was applied to each 5-minute segment. results: in 52 af episodes, the ultra-low-frequency power, very-low-frequency power, low-frequency power (lf), high-frequency power (hf), and total power significantly decreased with time after episodes of af termination. the lf/hf (l/h) ratio, normalized lf (lfnu), and normalized hf (hfnu) significantly changed after af termination. eighteen (35%) episodes had decreased lfnu and increased hfnu (sympathetic withdrawal and vagal activation), which had slower average af ventricular responses (92 +/- 16 beats/min vs 105 +/- 24 beats/min, p65 years) had a higher incidence (n = 27, 75%) of af termination with increased lfnu and decreased hfnu than did younger patients (aged <= 65 years, n = 7, 44%, p < 0.05). conclusion: autonomic changes critically regulate termination of paf, which is modulated by aging.
osteoporosis	cardiac transplantation is associated with a high risk of fracture. african americans (aas) are believed to have a lower risk of osteoporosis than caucasians, but it is not clear whether they are also protected from osteoporosis resulting from the use of glucocorticoids and/or organ transplantation. we examined possible ethnic differences in 33 cardiac transplant recipients (16 aas) in a cross-sectional analysis. in addition to bone mineral density and vertebral fracture assessment, we also compared biochemical variables, trabecular bone score, total body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and disability. overall fracture rates were low in both groups, with only 6 total subjects with fractures on vertebral fracture assessment or history of fracture. while t-scores were similar between groups, z-scores were lower in aa with the difference reaching statistical significance when controlling for important covariates. the trabecular bone score was also lower in aas than in caucasians even when adjusting for age and tissue thickness (1.198 +/- 0.140 vs 1.312 +/- 0.140, p = 0.03). while aas are generally thought to be protected from osteoporosis, our study instead suggests that aas may be at higher risk of bone deterioration after cardiac transplantation and may need to be managed more aggressively than suggested by current guidelines.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	rationale: the relationship between the development and/or progression of interstitial lung abnormalities (ila) and clinical outcomes has not been previously investigated. objectives: to determine the risk factors for, and the clinical consequences of, having ila progression in participants from the framingham heart study. methods: ila were assessed in 1,867 participants who had serial chest computed tomography (ct) scans approximately 6 years apart. mixed effect regression (and cox) models were used to assess the association between ila progression and pulmonary function decline (and mortality). measurements and main results: during the follow-up period 660 (35%) participants did not have ila on either ct scan, 37 (2%) had stable to improving ila, and 118 (6%) had ila with progression (the remaining participants without ila were noted to be indeterminate on at least one ct scan). increasing age and increasing copies of the muc5b promoter polymorphism were associated with ila progression. after adjustment for covariates, ila progression was associated with a greater fvc decline when compared with participants without ila (20 ml; se, +/- 6 ml; p = 0.0005) and with those with ila without progression (25 ml; se, +/- 11 ml; p = 0.03). over a median follow-up time of approximately 4 years, after adjustment, ila progression was associated with an increase in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-10.9; p = 0.01) when compared with those without ila. conclusions: these findings demonstrate that ila progression in the framingham heart study is associated with an increased rate of pulmonary function decline and increased risk of death.
rheumatoid_arthritis	recent studies have revealed fibroblast-like synoviocytes (fls) as a pivotal effector cell in the inflamed joint of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients. fls exhibit high proliferation rates and constitutive expression of cytokines, contributing to the pathogenesis of ra. in this study, we found that the expression of tripartite motif-containing protein 3 (trim3), a candidate tumor suppressor gene, was lower in synovial tissue samples of ra patients than in that of healthy controls. we then investigated the role of trim3 on the proliferation and cytokine secretion of primary cultured fls from ra patients. enforced expression of trim3 in ra fls led to significantly decreased cell proliferation as indicated by cell counting kit-8 assay, reduced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha(tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-1 beta and il-6 as indicated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and decreased p38 phosphorylation as assessed by western blot analysis. the proteins promoting cell cycles (cyclin d1 and pcna) were downregulated and the protein negatively regulating cell cycle progression (p53 and p21) was upregulated after trim3 overexpression. importantly, trim3 knockdown had reverse effects on cell proliferation, which was suppressed by the p38-specific inhibitor sb203580. in conclusion, the current results demonstrated the downregulation of trim3 expression in ra synovial tissues. importantly, trim3 exerted an anti-proliferation role in ra fls via p38 signaling pathway.
stress_management	the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (pmr) as part of a worksite health promotion program on self-perceived stress, anxiety and depression among male automotive assembly-line workers through a quasi-experimental trial. two assembly plants were chosen with one receiving pmr therapy and the other pamphlets. intention to-treat analysis was conducted to test the effectiveness of the relaxation therapy. stress, depression and anxiety levels were measured using the shortened dass-21 questionnaire. data were analyzed using chi-square, independent sample t test and repeated-measures analysis of variance to test the significance of the effects of intervention (time * group) for the measures of stress, depression and anxiety. significant favourable intervention effects on stress were found in the pmr group (effect size = 0.6) as compared to the pamphlet group (effect size = 0.2). there was a significant group *time interaction effect (p < 0.001) on stress levels. depression and anxiety levels were minimal at baseline in both the groups with mild or no reduction in levels. the improvement in stress levels showed the potential of pmr therapy as a coping strategy at the workplace. further research in this field is necessary to examine the beneficial effects of coping strategies in the workplace.
atrial_fibrillation	atrial fibrillation (af) is a common arrhythmia in patients with aortic stenosis. when these patients are treated medically or by surgical aortic valve replacement, af is associated with increased risk of adverse events including death. growing evidence suggests a significant impact of af on outcomes also in patients with aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (tavi). conversely, limited evidence is available regarding the optimal management of this condition. this review aims to summarize prevalence, pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of af in patients undergoing tavi.
anxiety	objectives social anxiety disorder (sad) is a common and heritable psychiatric disorder. however, genetic studies in sad are rare and only a few candidate genes have been implicated so far. in the present study, we investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with other psychiatric disorders also contribute toward the development of sad and followed up variants associated with sad on the phenotypic level. patients and methods we genotyped a total of 24 snps in a german sample of 321 sad patients and 804 controls. we carried out single-marker analyses as well as quantitative association analyses of sad severity and harm avoidance. results none of the variants investigated showed an association with sad in our case-control sample after bonferroni correction. two snps reached nominal significance (rs818702, p=0.032; rs140701, p=0.048). of these, only rs140701 showed an association in the same allelic direction as reported previously. this snp is located within the serotonin transporter gene slc6a4, which is the primary target of selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors used for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. the quantitative association analysis of all cases with available data on symptom severity showed four snps with a nominal significant association. among these snps, rs10994359 showed the strongest association (p=0.001) and was located near the ank3 gene. in addition, rs10994359 was nominally associated with harm avoidance scores (p=0.001). conclusion our results provide further evidence for an involvement of the serotonin transporter gene slc6a4 in the etiology of anxiety-related traits. furthermore, our study implicates that genetic variation at the genome-wide associated bipolar disorder locus ank3 might influence anxiety-related personality traits. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
