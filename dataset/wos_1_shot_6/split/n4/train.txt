smoking_cessation	electronic cigarettes (ecigs) use electricity to power a heating element that aerosolizes a liquid containing solvents, flavorants, and the dependence-producing drug nicotine for user inhalation. ecigs have evolved rapidly in the past 8 years, and the changes in product design and liquid constituents affect the resulting toxicant yield in the aerosol and delivery to the user. this rapid evolution has been accompanied by dramatic increases in ecig use prevalence in many countries among adults and, especially, adolescents in the united states. the increased prevalence of ecigs that deliver nicotine and other toxicants to users' lungs drives a rapidly growing research effort. this review highlights the most recent information regarding the design of ecigs and their liquid and aerosol constituents, the epidemiology of ecig use among adolescents and adults (including correlates of ecig use), and preclinical and clinical research regarding ecig effects. the current literature suggests a strong rationale for an empirical regulatory approach toward ecigs that balances any potential ecig-mediated decreases in health risks for smokers who use them as substitutes for tobacco cigarettes against any increased risks for nonsmokers who may be attracted to them.
lymphoma	a known hiv-1-positive intravenous drug user was found to be human t cell lymphoma/leukemia virus-ii (htlv-ii) dna positive by polymerase chain reaction but seronegative in a screening elisa. he was consistently dna positive but took 2 years to fully seroconvert. sequencing of the htlv-ii strain in his cultured t lymphocytes indicated that it is a prototypical type a strain with no major differences in the long terminal repeat dna sequence, nor major amino acid differences in the gag, env, tax, and rex proteins. however, a mutation in its pol gene created a stop codon at amino acid 543 of the pol protein, a region that encodes for the rnase function. this mutation may account for the subject 's slow seroconversion.
asthma	ion channels/pumps are essential regulators of organ homeostasis and disease. in the present review, we discuss the role of the mechanosensitive cation channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (trpv4), in cytokine secretion and pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis (cf), and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). trpv4 has been shown to play a role in lung diseases associated with lung parenchymal stretch or stiffness. trpv4 indirectly mediates hypotonicity-induced smooth muscle contraction and airway remodeling in asthma. further, the literature suggests that in cf trpv4 may improve ciliary beat frequency enhancing mucociliary clearance, while at the same time increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion/lung tissue injury. currently it is understood that the role of trpv4 in immune cell function and associated lung tissue injury/ards may depend on the injury stimulus. uncovering the downstream mechanisms of trpv4 action in pulmonary inflammatory diseases is likely important to understanding disease pathogenesis and may lead to novel therapeutics.
bipolar_disorder	background: bipolar patients show high intra-individual variability during cognitive processing. however, it is not known whether there are a specific fluctuations of variability contributing to the overall high cognitive inconsistency. the objective was to compare dynamic profiles of patients and healthy controls to identify hypothetical differences and their associations with overall variability and processing speed. methods: changes of reaction times isd during processing speed test performance over time was measured by dividing the isd for whole task into four consecutive parts. motor speed and cognitive effort were controlled. results: patients with bd exhibited significantly lower results regarding processing speed and higher intraindividual variability comparing with hc. the profile of intra-individual variability changes over time of performance was significantly different in bd versus hc groups: f(3, 207)=8.60, p < 0.0001, eta rho(2)=0.11. isd of bd patients in the initial phase of performance was three times higher than in the last. there was no significant differences between four intervals in hc group. inter-group difference in the initial part of the profiles was significant also after controlling for several cognitive and clinical variables. limitations: applied computer version of cognitive speed test was relatively new and, thus, replication studies are needed. effect seen in the present study is driven mainly by the bd type i. conclusions: patients with bd exhibits problems with setting a stimulus-response association in starting phase of cognitive processing. this deficit may negatively interfere with the other cognitive functions, decreasing level of psychosocial functioning, therefore should be explored in future studies.
crohn's_disease	inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic conditions of unknown etiology, showing a growing incidence and prevalence in several countries, including italy. although the etiology of crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis is unknown, due to the current knowledge regarding their pathogenesis, effective treatment strategies have been developed. several guidelines are available regarding the efficacy and safety of available drug treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases. nevertheless, national guidelines provide additional information adapted to local feasibility, costs and legal issues related to the use of the same drugs. these observations prompted the italian group for the study of inflammatory bowel disease (ig-ibd) to establish italian guidelines on the safety of currently available treatments for crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis. these guidelines discuss the use of aminosalicylates, systemic and low bioavailability corticosteroids, antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, rifaximin), thiopurines, methotrexate, cyclosporine a, tnf alpha antagonists, vedolizumab, and combination therapies. these guidelines are based on current knowledge derived from evidence-based medicine coupled with clinical experience of a national working group.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	farnesoid x receptor (fxr) activation by obeticholic acid (oca) has been demonstrated to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis development in liver, kidney and intestine in multiple disease models. fxr activation has also been demonstrated to suppress the inflammatory response and to promote lung repair after lung injury. this study investigated the protective effects of oca treatment (3 or 10 mg/kg/day) on inflammation, tissue remodeling and fibrosis in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis rat model. effects of oca treatment on morphological and molecular alterations of the lung, as well as remodeling of the alveoli and the right ventricle were also evaluated. lung function was assessed by measuring airway resistance to inflation. in the acute phase (7 days), bleomycin promoted an initial thickening and fibrosis of the lung interstitium, with upregulation of genes related to epithelial proliferation, tissue remodeling and hypoxia. at 28 days, an evident increase in the deposition of collagen in the lungs was observed. this excessive deposition was accompanied by an upregulation of transcripts related to the extracellular matrix (tgf(31, snai1 and snai2), indicating lung fibrosis. administration of oca protected against bleomycin-induced lung damage by suppressing molecular mechanisms related to epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (emt), inflammation and collagen deposition, with a dose-dependent reduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-113 and il-6, as well as tgf-131 and snail expression. pirfenidone, a recently approved treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), significantly counteracted bleomycin-induced pro-fibrotic genes expression, but did not exert significant effects on il-1 beta and il-6. oca treatment in bleomycin-challenged rats also improved pulmonary function, by effectively normalizing airway resistance to inflation and lung stiffness in vivo. results with oca were similar, or even superior, to those obtained with pirfenidone. in conclusion, our results suggest an important protective effect of oca against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by blunting critical mediators in the pathogenesis of ipf.

dementia	background. cognitive impairment is the gradual loss of one 's ability to learn, remember, pay attention, and make decisions. cognitively impaired elderly people are a challenging patient population for dental health care professionals and may be at higher risk of developing oral health diseases. the authors systematically reviewed interventions effective at improving dental health in patients with cognitive impairment and described research gaps remaining. types of studies reviewed. in a comprehensive search of multiple databases, the authors identified 2,255 studies published in the english language from 1995 through march 2016. the authors included studies if the investigators evaluated oral health measures after an intervention in patients 65 years or older with cognitive impairment or dementia. nine full-text articles met the criteria for inclusion. results. only 1 study was a randomized control trial, whereas all others lacked appropriate controls. investigators studied the effects of dental treatments, battery-powered devices for oral hygiene, and training of care staff members. most interventions improved some aspect of the oral health of patients with dementia, and results were more pronounced when patients required assistance while performing oral hygiene tasks or had poor oral health at baseline. conclusions and practical implications. a basic care plan for patients with dementia should, at the minimum, match prevention strategies recommended for healthy elderly patients. dental health care professionals should promote oral hygiene education for caregivers for elderly patients with cognitive impairment. there is a wide gap in knowledge regarding effective methods specifically to improve oral health in patients with dementia.
rheumatoid_arthritis	some evidences suggest that obesity impairs the effectiveness of tnf inhibitors. we examined the impact of body mass index (bmi) on the clinical effectiveness of abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients. this is a pooled analysis of 10 prospective cohorts of ra patients. all patients with available bmi were included in this study. the primary endpoint was drug retention of abatacept in the different bmi categories. multivariable cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) for drug discontinuation. a secondary endpoint was eular/lundex response rates at 6/12 months. of the 2015 ra patients initiating therapy with iv abatacept, 380 (18.9%) were classified as obese. obese patients had more functional disability, and were less often rf positive. the median abatacept retention time was 1.91 years for obese ra patients compared to 2.12 years for non-obese patients (p = 0.15). the risk of abatacept discontinuation was not significantly different for overweight (hr 1.03 (95% ci 0.89-1.19)), or for obese (hr 1.08 (95% ci 0.89-1.30)) compared to normal-weight patients. rheumatoid factor positivity reduced the risk of abatacept discontinuation (hr 0.83 (95% ci 0.72-0.95)), while previous biologic therapy was positively associated with drug interruption (hrs increasing from 1.68 to 2.16 with the line of treatments). obese and non-obese patients attained similar rates of eular/lundex clinical response at 6/12 months. drug retention and clinical response rates to abatacept do not seem to be decreased by obesity in ra patients.
osteoporosis	in this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the osteoporosis self-assessment tool for asians (osta) in screening for osteoporosis in the elderly male population in the chengdu area, china. the lunar prodigy advance bone densitometer was used to measure the bone mineral density of 11,039 healthy males over the age of 40 years. men with osta scores of >-1, -4 < osta <=-1, or <=-4 , or were assigned to the low-risk, moderate risk, or high-risk group, respectively. the t-scores measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the different sites were compared across the groups. the bone mineral density of the lumbar spines l1-l4, the left femur, and other sites decreased gradually with age. with increasing age, the screening sensitivity of osta for osteoporosis in the lumbar spine and femur gradually increased, whereas its specificity decreased. the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the osta index in different age groups and at different sites were 0.644-0.831. therefore, the osta index demonstrated some value in screening for osteoporosis in men over the age of 50 years. significant differences in its effectiveness were observed among different age groups.
medicare	objective : this 2009-2011 nation-wide study of adult koreans was aimed to provide characteristics, medical utilization states, and survival rates for newly diagnosed patients with primary nonmalignant and malignant spine tumors. methods : data for patients with primary spine tumors were selected from the korean health insurance review and assessment service database. the data included their age, sex, health insurance type, co-morbidities, medical cost, and hospital stay duration. hospital stay duration and medical costs per person occurring in one calendar year were used. in addition, survival rates of patients with primary malignant spine tumors were evaluated. results : the incidence rate of a primary spine tumor increased with age, and the year of diagnosis (p <= 0.0001). average annual medical costs ranged from 1627 usd (pelvis & sacrum & coccyx tumors) to 6601 usd (spinal cord tumor) for primary nonmalignant spine tumor and from 12137 usd (spinal meningomas) to 20825 usd (pelvis & sacrum & coccyx tumors) for a primary malignant spine tumor overall survival rates for those with a primary malignant spine tumor were 87.0%, 753%, and 70.6% at 3, 12, and 24 months, respectively. the cox regression model results showed that male sex, medicare insurance were significantly positive factors affecting survival after a diagnosis of primary malignant spine tumor. conclusion : our study provides a detailed view of the characteristics, medical utilization states, and survival rates of patients newly diagnosed with primary spine tumors in korea.
psoriatic_arthritis	objectives: we assessed the ability of patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases to successfully use the investigational autotouch (tm) reusable autoinjector as well as patient preference for autotouch (tm) versus the currently marketed single-use prefilled etanercept sureclick (r) autoinjector. methods: two multicenter studies were performed: a home use study and a patient preference study. in the home use study, 77 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) or psoriatic arthritis self-administered etanercept once weekly for 5 weeks. the primary end point was successful self-injection of etanercept via autotouch (tm). the patient preference study was an open-label, randomized, 8-week crossover trial (4 weeks for each device) in 216 patients with ra or psoriasis (pso). the primary end point was preference for autotouch (tm) versus sureclick (r). results: in the home use study, the proportion of successful self-injections with autotouch (tm) during weeks 1 through 5 was 97.8% (95% ci, 96.3. 99.3). in the patient preference study, patients had a preference rate for autotouch (tm) of 41.7% (95% ci, 34.9-48.4) overall, 43.5% (95% ci, 35.5. 51.6) for patients with ra, and 36.8% (95% ci, 24.3. 49.4) for patients with pso. needle apprehension was not different at initiation of the autoinjectors, nor was there a difference between the injectors after 4 weeks. overall, patients preferred autotouch t for ease of self-injecting, ease of pressing the start button, ease of following injection progress, and certainty of knowing when the injection was completed. sureclick (r) was preferred for fewer steps and experiencing less injection site discomfort or pain. conclusion: the introduction of the autotouch (tm) will give patients a choice between two different autoinjectors for self-administration of etanercept.
addiction	objective: childhood maltreatment is widely accepted as a risk factor for drug addiction from adolescence to adulthood. however, the influence of childhood maltreatment on drug treatment related variables, such as drug abstinence motivation and self-concept, as well as self-efficacy, remains unclear. this study aims at exploring whether self-concept mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation, as well as self-efficacy, among drug addicts. methods: this study involves 816 (550 males, 226 females, mean age = 34.59, range = 16-58 years) drug addicts from compulsory detoxification units. participants completed questionnaires, including the childhood trauma questionnaire 28- item short form (ctq- sf), tennessee self-concept scale (tscs), general self-efficacy scale (gses), and drug abstinence motivation questionnaire (damq). results: the structural equation model (sem) analysis, including total and specific forms of maltreatment scores, showed that childhood maltreatment was negatively associated with self-concept, self-efficacy, and abstinence motivation. self-concept was positively associated with self-efficacy and abstinence motivation. conversely, significant association between self-efficacy and abstinence motivation did not exist. an indirect analysis showed that self-concept mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and self-efficacy. critically, selfconcept arbitrated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation. the indirect effect of self-concept between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation still existed when the total scores of maltreatment were replaced by the scores of specific forms of maltreatment. conclusions: these results demonstrated that self-concept is a critical factor in understanding the relationship between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation, as well as self-efficacy, among drug addicts. improving the sense of self-worth may be an effective intervention therapy among drug addicts with childhood maltreatment history.

atopic_dermatitis	background: dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (dock8) deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency caused by autosomal recessive loss-of- function mutations in dock8. this disorder is characterized by recurrent cutaneous infections, increased serum ige levels, and severe atopic disease, including food-induced anaphylaxis. however, the contribution of defects in cd4(+) t cells to disease pathogenesis in these patients has not been thoroughly investigated. objective: we sought to investigate the phenotype and function of dock8-deficient cd4(+) t cells to determine (1) intrinsic and extrinsic cd4 1 t-cell defects and (2) how defects account for the clinical features of dock8 deficiency. methods: we performed in-depth analysis of the cd4(+) t-cell compartment of dock8-deficient patients. we enumerated subsets of cd4(+) t helper cells and assessed cytokine production and transcription factor expression. finally, we determined the levels of ige specific for staple foods and house dust mite allergens in dock8-deficient patients and healthy control subjects. results: dock8-deficient memory cd4 1 t cells were biased toward a t(h)2 type, and this was at the expense of t(h)1 and t(h)17 cells. in vitro polarization of dock8-deficient naive cd4(+) t cells revealed the th2 bias and th17 defect to be t-cell intrinsic. examination of allergen-specific ige revealed plasma ige from dock8-deficient patients is directed against staple food antigens but not house dust mites. conclusion: investigations into the dock8-deficient cd4(+) t cells provided an explanation for some of the clinical features of this disorder: the t(h)2 bias is likely to contribute to atopic disease, whereas defects in t(h)1 and t(h)17 cells compromise antiviral and antifungal immunity, respectively, explaining the infectious susceptibility of dock8-deficient patients.
digestive_health	the study investigates the effects of a post-weaning water restriction on performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass traits and meat quality of 84-day-old rabbits. a total of 1388 weaned rabbits (35 days) were randomly divided into two groups on the basis of bw and sex. the two groups were fed the same diets ad libitum both in the post-weaning (35 to 60 days) and fattening (61 to 84 days) periods. in the post-weaning period, one group (al) also received drinking water ad libitum, whereas the other (wr) had a water restriction from 35 to 41 days 2 h/day; from 42 to 48 days 2.5 h/day; from 49 to 55 days 3 h/day; and from 56 to 60 days 4 h/day. during the fattening period, both groups had water-free access. individual live weights and feed intake per cage were recorded weekly for 32 cages randomly chosen per group (64 rabbits) to calculate the bw gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio (fcr). the apparent digestibility values of nutrients were measured using acid-insoluble ash. carcass data were collected from 16 rabbits (8 males and 8 females) per group selected for similar final bw in both groups. mortality from 35 to 60 days was higher in the al group (10.1% v. 5.2%, for al and wr, respectively, p < 0.0001). bw gain was higher for the al group during both the post-weaning (+22.4%, p < 0.01) and the entire period (+7.5%, p < 0.05). water restriction reduced feed intake both in the post-weaning (-17.4%, p < 0.0001) and in the entire period (-9.9%, p < 0.05). during the fattening period, fcr was lower for the wr group (5.15 v. 5.75 g/g, for wr and al, respectively, p < 0.05). the apparent digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, ndf, adf and cellulose were greater in the restricted rabbits (+4.7%, +4.5%, +10.2%, +18.8% and +12.8%, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). perirenal and scapular fat percentages were higher in the al rabbits (+30.7% and +116.6%, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). water restriction increased saturated fatty acids (c16:0, +12.9%, p < 0.05), lauroleic acid (c12:1, +75.0%, p < 0.01), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (c20:5, +50.0%, p < 0.01 and c22:5, +16.6%, p < 0.05) and the n-3/n-6 ratio (+28.6%, p < 0.05). the applied water restriction between 35 and 60 days executed during the winter months improved the digestive health of rabbits, with no negative effects on carcass traits, or physical and chemical meat characteristics. however, from the animal welfare point of view, a water restriction can be criticized as a method to restrict feed intake.
healthy_sleep	aims and objectives to explore sleep quality in infertile women and examine the factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during intrauterine insemination treatment. background sleep disturbance is an important factor of human health and well-being. sleep disturbances tend to occur among infertile women during intrauterine insemination treatment. although many studies have focused on the high percentage of somatic symptoms and psychological distress in infertile women associated with their treatment, few studies have investigated factors linked to their sleep disturbances. design a cross-sectional study. methods the study was conducted during the period of september 2010-january 2011 in a teaching hospital in taiwan. infertile women (n=117) who received assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination treatment completed a questionnaire. demographic data, somatic symptoms, psychological distress and perceived sleep quality were collected. results more than one-third (35%) of the infertile women reported having sleep disturbances. their nausea symptoms and psychological distress were risk factors that contributed to sleep disturbance. conclusions the variables of nausea and psychological distress significantly explained 30% of the sleep disturbances in the infertile women. the evaluation of nausea symptoms and/or psychological distress among infertile women is an important area of future research; such research should aim to identify the best compromise between infertility treatment and sleep quality. relevance to clinical practice clinical obstetrics and gynaecology nurses should develop strategies to help infertile women reduce their nausea symptoms and psychological distress during intrauterine insemination treatment to promote healthy sleep.
anxiety	relationships with parents and friends are important contexts for developing romantic relationship skills. parents and friends may influence both the timing of involvement and the quality of romantic relationships. three models of the joint influence of parents and friends (direct effects model, mediation model, and moderator model) have been proposed. the present study uses data from a longitudinal study (n = 1012; 49.8% female; 81.1% caucasian) to examine how attachment and friendship quality at age 10 years predict romantic relationship involvement and quality at ages 12 and 15 years. the results supported the direct effects model, with attachment and friendship quality uniquely predicting different romantic relationship outcomes. the findings provide further support for the important influence of family and friends on early romantic relationships.
psoriasis	the relative genetic and immune protection against melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers in those with vitiligo is reassuring. the results of recent studies allow us to be cautiously optimistic when discussing the risk of skin cancer caused by therapeutic exposure to narrow-band ultraviolet b light. however, we should continue to recommend sun protection at all other times to avoid burning in vitiliginous skin and to decrease incidental ultraviolet exposure. it is also important to perform full skin checks regularly in light of the prolonged courses of phototherapy required to repigment vitiliginous skin and maintain repigmentation thereafter.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. neck pain is common in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and ankylosing spondylitis (as). we investigated the correlation of bone marrow edema (bme) on magnetic resonance imaging (mri) in ra and as and its association with clinical complaints of neck pain. methods. cervical spine short-tau inversion recovery-mri and t1w-mri of 34 patients with ra and 6 patients with as complaining about neck pain were obtained. clinical and laboratory data were available. bme was scored by 2 blinded readers using a modification of a published score, including various cervical sites. degenerative changes were also quantified. results. patients were predominantly women (82.5%), and mean +/- sd age was 57.5 +/- 11.8 years, c-reactive protein (crp) was 0.8 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, and pain score was 46.0 +/- 17.5. bme was detected in 24/40 patients (60%) involving the atlantoaxial region (21%), vertebral bodies (75%), facet joints (29%), and spinous processes (46%). degenerative changes were identified in 21/40 patients (52.5%), 13 (62%) of whom also had bme in vertebral bodies. no differences were found between patients with versus without cervical bme for clinical assessments: numeric rating scale pain (median +/- interquartile range) 5.5 +/- 3.0 vs 6.0 +/- 4.0 (p = 0.69), funktionsfragebogen hannover 68.2 +/- 41.0 vs 42.0 +/- 55.5 (p = 0.19), northwick pain score 44.4 +/- 21.8 vs 47.2 +/- 27.0 (p = 0.83), or crp 0.40 +/- 0.80 vs 0.60 +/- 0.66 (p = 0.94). for patients with degenerative changes, symptom duration was longer than for patients without (10 +/- 12.5 vs 5.0 +/- 18.0 yrs, p = 0.73). conclusion. in this small study of patients with ra and as complaining about neck pain, bme was found in many different cervical sites, including the facet joints and the spinous processes. however, the occurrence and severity of bme did not correlate with the severity of neck pain.
children's_health	introduction. the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (feno) is a biomarker of airway inflammation. repeat feno maneuvers at multiple fixed exhalation flow rates (extendednoanalysis) can be used to estimate parameters quantifying proximal and distal sources of no in mathematical models of lower respiratory tract no. a growing number of studies use extendednoanalysis, but there is no official standard flow rate sampling protocol. in this paper, we provide information for study planning by deriving theoretically optimal flow rate sampling designs. methods. first, we reviewed previously published designs. then, under a nonlinear regression framework for estimating no parameters in the steady-state two compartment model of no, we identified unbiased optimal four flow rate designs (within the range of 10-400 ml s(-1)) using theoretical derivations and simulation studies. optimality criteria included no parameter standard errors (ses). asimulation study was used to estimate sample sizes required to detect associations with no parameters estimated from studies with different designs. results. most designs (77%) were unbiased. noparameter ses were smaller for designs with: more target flows, more replicate maneuvers per target flow, and a larger range of target flows. high flows were most important for estimating alveolar no concentration, while low flows were most important for the proximal no parameters. the southern california children 's health study design (30, 50, 100 and 300 ml s(-1)) had. 1.8 fold larger ses and required 1.1-3.2 fold more subjects to detect the association of a determinant with each no parameter as compared to an optimal design of 10, 50, 100 and 400 ml s(-1). conclusions. there is a class of reasonable flow rate sampling designs with good theoretical performance. in practice, designs should be selected to balance the tradeoffs between optimality and feasibility of the flow range and total number of maneuvers.
stress_management	objective: this study assessed positive changes in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and their family caregivers following diagnosis. we compared self-reported positive changes within patient-caregiver dyads as well as self-reports and patient reports of positive changes in caregivers. design: individual, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 patients with advanced colorectal cancer and 23 caregivers. a theoretical thematic analysis of interview transcripts was framed by posttraumatic growth theory. results: patients and caregivers described five positive changes: closer relationships with others, greater appreciation of life, clarifying life priorities, increased faith, and more empathy for others. additionally, only caregivers reported better health habits following the cancer diagnosis, and a minority of patients and caregivers reported no positive changes. in about half of cases, patients reported at least one positive change that was identical to that of their caregiver. however, in most cases, patient and caregiver reports of the caregiver 's positive change were discrepant. conclusion: findings suggest that positive changes are a shared experience for many patient-caregiver dyads and obtaining both patient and caregiver reports of caregiver positive changes provides a more comprehensive understanding of their experience. interventions may capitalise on positive changes to promote meaningful living in the context of advanced cancer.
hiv_aids	background: due to the popularity of public service announcements (psas), as well as the broader health and social harms associated with illicit drug use, this study sought to investigate how drug prevention messages found in the government of canada 's drugsnot4me campaign were understood, experienced, and engaged with among a group of street-involved young people in vancouver, canada. methods: qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 individuals enrolled in the at-risk youth study, and a thematic analysis was conducted. results: findings indicate that the campaign 's messages neither resonated with ""at-risk youth"", nor provided information or resources for support. in some cases, the messaging exacerbated the social suffering experienced by these individuals. conclusions: this study underscores the importance of rigorous evaluation of psas and the need to consider diverting funds allocated to drug prevention campaigns to social services that can meaningfully address the structural drivers of drug-related harms among vulnerable youth populations.
migraine	objectiveto investigate differences in topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps of the scalp between patients with migraine and healthy controls considering the chronicity (episodic/chronic) and side (strictly unilateral/bilateral) of the symptoms. backgroundit seems that the trigeminal area is sensitized in migraine. no study has investigated topographical pressure sensitivity maps of the scalp in patients with migraine. methodspressure pain thresholds (ppts) were assessed from 21 points distributed over the scalp in 86 patients with episodic migraine, 76 with chronic migraine, and 42 healthy age and matched healthy controls in a blinded design. topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps based on interpolation of the ppts were constructed. clinical features of migraine, anxiety, and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale, hads) were collected. resultsthe multivariate ancova revealed significant differences in ppt between points (f=55.674; p.417). an anterior to posterior gradient was found, with the lowest ppts located in frontal regions and the highest ppts in occipital areas (all groups, p<.001). conclusionswe found that patients with migraine exhibited generalized pressure pain hypersensitivity in the head as compared to healthy controls and that hypersensitivity was similar between episodic/chronic and unilateral/bilateral migraine. topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps revealed an anterior to posterior gradient of pressure pain sensitivity in both migraine and control groups.
osteoarthritis	the emerging field of precision medicine emphasizes an individualized approach to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. using information from an individual 's genetics, environment and lifestyle, epigenetics, and other fields in precision medicine, practitioners can maximize resources by targeting pathology and human performance on the molecular level. however, practitioners may not be aware of topics within this field. therefore, the purpose of this review is to introduce basic concepts in precision medicine to highlight their potential application to sports medicine and performance enhancement. this review provides practical suggestions for implementation of some currently available precision medicine concepts in sport.
hereditary_angioedema	we report the case of a young boy with recurrent facial edema from his third year of life, diagnosed later with hereditary angio edema (hae), who died of severe fatal laryngeal attack at the age of eleven. the father had milder hae attacks until the age of 30, when he was diagnosed with systemic lupus erithematosus and the oldest brother has recurrent abdominal pain attacks, with long asymptomatic period. family history revealed another three members who died suffocated at different ages, without any diagnosis.the death of the young boy happened in a small hospital two hours after admission, while few ineffective procedures were performed. we consider that hae severity and fatality risk were underestimated by medical staff and the fatal outcome of hae attack in the youngest child could have been possibly prevented in a better equipped medical unit. this case highlights the need to raise the profile of hae within the medical community and to improve prophylaxis and treatment of this potential fatal disease.
kidney_health	background: diet can affect kidney health through its effects on inflammation. objective: we tested whether the adapted dietary inflammatory index (adii) is associated with kidney function and whether effects of diet on chronic low-grade inflammation explain this association. methods: this was an observational analysis in 1942 elderly community-dwelling participants aged 70-71 y from 2 independent cohorts: the uppsala longitudinal study of adult men (n = 1097 men) and the prospective investigation of vasculature in uppsala seniors (n = 845 men and women). the adii was calculated from 7-d food records, combining putatively proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of nutrients, vitamins, and trace elements. the adii was validated against serum c-reactive protein (crp) concentrations. the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) was assessed from serum cystatin c (cys) and creatinine (crea). associations between the adii and egfr were investigated, and crp was considered to be a mediator. results: in adjusted analysis, a 1-sd higher adii was associated with higher crp (beta: 6%, 95% cl: 1%, 10%; p= 0.01) and lower egfr [chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (ckd-epi)(cys): -2.1%, 95% cl: -3.2%, -1.1%; ckd-epi(cys+crea): -1.8%; 95% cl: -2.7%, -0.9%; both p < 0.001]. crp was also inversely associated with egfr. mediation analyses showed that of the total effect of the adii on kidney function, 15% and 17% (for ckd-epicys+crea and ckd-epicys equations, respectively) were explained/mediated by serum crp. findings were similar when each cohort was analyzed separately. conclusions: a proinflammatory diet was associated with systemic inflammation as well as with reduced kidney function in a combined analysis of 2 community-based cohorts of elderly individuals. our results also suggest systemic inflammation to be one potential pathway through which this dietary pattern is linked to kidney function.
autism	microglia can shift into different complex morphologies depending on the microenvironment of the central nervous system (cns). the distinct morphologies correlate with specific functions and can indicate the pathophysiological state of the cns. previous postmortem studies of autism spectrum disorder (asd) showed neuroinflammation in asd indicated by increased microglial density. these changes in the microglia density can be accompanied by changes in microglia phenotype but the individual contribution of different microglia phenotypes to the pathophysiology of asd remains unclear. here, we used an unbiased stereological approach to quantify six structurally and functionally distinct microglia phenotypes in postmortem human temporal cortex, which were immuno-stained with ibal. the total density of all microglia phenotypes did not differ between asd donors and typically developing individual donors. however, there was a significant decrease in ramified microglia in both gray matter and white matter of asd, and a significant increase in primed microglia in gray matter of asd compared to typically developing individuals. this increase in primed microglia showed a positive correlation with donor age in both gray matter and white of asd, but not in typically developing individuals. our results provide evidence of a shift in microglial phenotype that may indicate impaired synaptic plasticity and a chronic vulnerability to exaggerated immune responses.
