atrial_fibrillation	background-the activation pattern of localized reentry (lr) in atrial tachycardia remains incompletely understood. we used the ultra-high density rhythmia mapping system to study activation patterns in lr. methods and results-lr was suggested by small rotatory activations (carousels) containing the full spectrum of the colorcoded map. twenty-three left-sided atrial tachycardias were mapped in 15 patients (age: 64 +/- 11 years). 16 253 +/- 9192 points were displayed per map, collected over 26 +/- 14 minutes. a total of 50 carousels were identified (median 2; quartiles 1-3 per map), although this represented lr in only n=7 out of 50 (14%): here, rotation occurred around a small area of scar (< 0.03 mv; 12 +/- 6 mm diameter). in lr, electrograms along the carousel encompassed the full tachycardia cycle length, and surrounding activation moved away from the carousel in all directions. ablating fractionated electrograms (117 +/- 18 ms; 44 +/- 13% of tachycardia cycle length) within the carousel interrupted the tachycardia in every lr case. all remaining carousels were pseudo-reentrant (n=43/50 [86%]) occurring in areas of wavefront collision (n=21; median 0.5; quartiles 0-2 per map) or as artifact because of annotation of noise or interpolation in areas of incomplete mapping (n=22; median 1, quartiles 0-2 per map). pseudo-reentrant carousels were incorrectly ablated in 5 cases having been misinterpreted as lr. conclusions-the activation pattern of lr is of small stable rotational activations (carousels), and this drove 30% (7/23) of our postablation atrial tachycardias. however, this appearance is most often pseudo-reentrant and must be differentiated by interpretation of electrograms in the candidate circuit and activation in the wider surrounding region.
atrial_fibrillation	background: we evaluated the outcomes of totally endoscopic minimally invasive surgery for atrial septal defect (asd) using a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch in the transcatheter interventional era. methods and results: we retrospectively reviewed 37 consecutive patients who underwent totally endoscopic asd closure with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch between june 2011 and april 2015. all patients had been deferred from catheter-based intervention for clinical or anatomical reasons. we analyzed operative outcomes and postoperative echocardiographic data. the mean age was 45.7 16.5 years, and 25 patients (67.6%) were women. the mean ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow was 2.4 0.7. six patients (16.2%) underwent concomitant tricuspid valve repair, and 3 patients (8.1%) underwent concomitant atrial fibrillation surgery. there were no operative deaths, and the median length of hospital stay was 5 days. postoperative echocardiography revealed trivial residual shunt in 1 patient. during the follow-up period, there were no re-interventions for asd or readmission for heart failure. follow-up echocardiography revealed no recurrent shunt or calcification of the autologous pericardial patch. conclusions: totally endoscopic asd closure with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch demonstrated excellent outcomes. it is a useful option for patients with unfavorable anatomy or other reasons excluding transcatheter intervention.
atrial_fibrillation	in clinical practice, low-molecular-weight heparins are used relatively frequently in patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent embolic events. in this article, it is revised the available evidence in the following clinical situations: rapid onset of anticoagulation, bridging therapy (replacing long-term oral anticoagulant therapy around an invasive procedure) and transesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioversion.

atrial_fibrillation	introduction: atrial fibrillation (af) is a cardiac arrhythmia caused by various mechanisms, such as multiple reentering wavelets, high frequency activity, and rotor sources. evidence acquisition: this narrative review was based on papers found on pubmed and medline up to may 2016. the search terms were ""atrial fibrillation"" in combination with ""catheter ablation, pathophysiology, antiarrhythmic drugs"". evidence synthesis: antiarrhythmic drugs are the cornerstone of therapy in af, but their efficacy and safety might have to be improved. in case of failure of pharmacologic therapies, other treatments can be considered. a better understanding of the important role of the pulmonary veins has led to new approaches, such as ablation procedures, which were initially only surgical, while percutaneous options were later added. however, these strategies may present various technical complications also when performed by skilled operators. a promising field of investigation is the genetics of af, as highlighted by studies on the role of micro-rna. conclusions: relevant improvement on the knowledge of the electrophysiological basis of genesis and maintenance of af has been done in order to treat a very common arrhythmia, but further studies, as those in the genetics field, can open new challenging therapeutic horizons.
atrial_fibrillation	background: we hypothesized that survival in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (crt-d) patients is predicted by baseline heart rate score. methods: heart rate score is determined from the atrial paced and sensed histogram of a ddd icd or crt-d, and defined as percent of beats in the histogram in the tallest 10 beats/min range bin. it was calculated at initial remote monitoring for patients enrolled in latitude (r) without persistent atrial fibrillation, and with pulse generators implanted in 2006-2011. univariate, multivariate, and kaplan-meier analyses determined the impact of heart rate score on survival. results: of 57,893 icds and 67,929 crt-ds followed for 2.4 +/- 1.5 years, each 10% increase in heart rate score was associated with decreased survival (crt-d hazard ratio [hr] 1.07 95%, confidence interval 1.06-1.07, p < 0.0001; icd hr 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.06, p70%. conclusion: a simple device histogram measure, heart rate score, predicts survival in icd and crtd patients independent of the available variables, and even when sdann is unavailable.
smoking_cessation	objectives: people living with a psychotic illness have higher rates of cigarette smoking and face unique barriers to quitting compared to the general population. we examined whether self-reported reasons for smoking are useful predictors of successful quit attempts among people with psychosis. methods: as part of a randomized controlled trial addressing smoking and cardiovascular disease risk behaviors among people with psychosis, self-reported reasons for smoking were assessed at baseline (n = 235), 15 weeks (n = 151), and 12 months (n = 139). three factors from the reasons for smoking questionnaire (coping, physiological, and stimulation/activation) were entered into a model to predict short-and long-term abstinence. the relationship between these factors and mental health symptoms were also assessed. results: participants scoring higher on the stimulation/activation factor (control of weight, enjoyment, concentration, and ""peps me up"") at baseline were just less than half as likely to be abstinent at 15 weeks. female participants were five times more likely to abstinent at 15 weeks, and those with a higher global functioning at baseline were 5% more likely to be abstinent. there was a positive correlation between changes over time in the stimulation/activation factor from baseline to 12-month follow-up and the brief psychiatric rating scale total score at 12-month follow-up. this indicates that increasingly higher endorsement of the factor was associated with more psychological symptoms. there was also a negative correlation between the change over time in the stimulation/activation factor and global functioning at 12 months, indicating that increasingly higher endorsement of the factor led to lower global assessment of functioning. conclusions: the stimulation/activation factor may be particularly important to assess and address among smokers with psychosis. it is recommended that further research use the reasons for smoking questionnaire among smokers with psychosis as a clinical tool to identify specific quit barriers. further research into why females have higher smoking cessation rates in the short term and relapse prevention interventions seem worthy of further investigation.
smoking_cessation	nicotin replacement therapy (nrt) has been the preferred first option in smoking cessation treatment for many years. nrt reduces both the desire to smoke and the withdrawal symptoms. nicotine gum addiction may rarely develop during nrt. in this study, we present a case who became addicted to nicotine gum for 18 years, was admitted to the smoking cessation polyclinic, and treated with bupropion. the aim of this case study is to highlight that bupropion is also an effective option to treat nicotine gum addiction, a rarely seen occurrence.
smoking_cessation	purpose. to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text message-based smoking cessation intervention in china. design. study design was a randomized control trial with a 6-month follow-up assessment of smoking status. setting. zhejiang, heilongjiang, and shaanxi provinces in china provided the study setting. subjects. a total of 8000 adult smokers in china who used nokia life tools and participated in phase 2 (smoking education via text message) of the study were included. intervention. the high-frequency text contact (hftc) group received one to three messages daily containing smoking cessation advice, encouragement, and health education information. the low-frequency text contact (lftc) group received one weekly message with smoking health effects information. measures. our primary outcome was smoking status at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after intervention. secondary outcomes include participant perceptions of the hftc intervention, and factors associated with smoking cessation among hftc participants. analysis. descriptive and (2) analyses were conducted to assess smoking status and acceptability. factors associated with quitting were assessed using multiple logistic regression analyses. results. quit rates were high in both the hftc and lftc groups (hftc: 0 month, 27.9%; 1 month, 30.5%; 3 months, 26.7%; and 6 months, 27.7%; lftc: 0 month, 26.7%; 1 month, 30.4%; 3 months, 28.1%; and 6 months, 27.7%), with no significant difference between the two groups in an intent-to-treat analysis. attitudes toward the hftc intervention were largely positive. conclusion. our findings suggest that a text message-based smoking cessation intervention can be successfully delivered in china and is acceptable to chinese smokers, but further research is needed to assess the potential impact of this type of intervention.
smoking_cessation	objectives/hypothesisto demonstrate racial differences in preventable risk behaviors/practices that contribute to head and neck cancer (hnca). study designcross-sectional analysis of large national risk factor survey. methodsthe behavioral risk factor surveillance system for 2013 was analyzed. demographic data were extracted, including age, sex, and race. social habits considered risk factors for hnca were also extracted, including alcohol consumption, smoking, and human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination status. statistical comparisons were conducted according to race for each risk factor, and additional comparisons were conducted within the american indian population subgroup for risk factors according to sex. resultsa total of 238.6 million americans were surveyed. american indians reported higher rates of binge drinking (19.0%) than whites (17.3%), blacks (12.4%), and asian americans (13.1%; p < .001). this rate was significantly higher for american indian males (23.5%) versus females (13.7%; p < .001). mean total drinks per month was higher for whites and american indians (13.5 and 13.5; p < .001). american indians reported the highest rates of current smoking (28.1%), followed by blacks (20.1%), whites (18.3%), and asians (10.2%; p < .001). american indians also reported the highest rates of every day smoking (18.2%), versus whites (13.3%), blacks (13.1%), and asians (6.1%; p < .001). rates of hpv vaccination were lowest for american indians (11.7%), compared to whites (14.6%), blacks (13.6%), and asians (12%; p = 0.618). conclusionsthere are striking racial disparities in the prevalence of preventable risk factors for hnca. these data highlight the need for targeted education and prevention programs in particular racial groups. level of evidence4. laryngoscope, 127:1068-1072, 2017
smoking_cessation	this study examines the prevalence and tobacco use patterns among adult social assistance beneficiaries and their interest in quitting. the results are based on data collected in a cross-sectional survey conducted among adults in the piotrkowski district. a sample of 3636 social assistance beneficiaries produced a total of 1817 respondents who completed face-to-face questionnaires. overall, 37.1% of the respondents, including 52.8% men and 29.6% women, were current smokers. over one third of the smokers reported their willingness to quit. in the study population, several characteristics were significantly associated with the current daily smoking: male gender, low educational attainment, unemployment or temporary employment, lack of awareness of smoking-associated health risks, use of e-cigarettes, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ets). the intention to quit smoking among the daily smokers was positively correlated with their awareness of smoking-associated health risks, lack of previous quit attempts, and low exposure to ets. smoking prevalence among social assistance recipients tends to be higher than in the general population, but more than half of the smokers are willing to quit. there is an urgency to develop policies tailored to the needs of these disadvantaged population groups.
lymphoma	the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of myristicin (myr; 1-allyl-5-methoxy-3,4-methy-lenedioxybenzene), an active aromatic compound isolated from nutmeg, carrot, basil, cinnamon and parsley, in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in rat dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons. it was observed that myr significantly enhanced cell viability in hypoxia-induced drg neurons in a dose-dependent manner; the optimal concentration of myr was 50 mu m. furthermore, myr reduced the percentage of deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end-labeling-positive neuronal cells and influenced the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene b-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) associated x protein, the apoptosis protease cleaved caspase-3 and the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2, in the hypoxia-induced group. in addition, myr protected against hypoxic injury in drg neurons by inhibiting malondialdehyde and lactate dehydrogenase, however upregulating superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. myr reduced the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ers) markers, including ccaat/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein, glucose-related protein 78 and cleaved caspase-12 in the hypoxia-induced group. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the activity of myr against hypoxia-induced apoptosis in rat drg neurons via inhibition of the ers pathway.
lymphoma	conclusion: the multimodal diagnostic algorithm is a simple diagnostic tool in the pre-operative assessment of submandibular masses that enables one-stage surgical concepts.background: the pre-operative assessment of submandibular masses is of major clinical impact. this study assesses the diagnostic utility of a newly introduced diagnostic algorithm in the differentiation of submandibular masses based on epidemiological and b-mode ultrasonographic data.methods: one hundred and eighty-eight patients with submandibular triangle masses were included. epidemiological and ultrasonographic data of 128 consecutively included patients were assessed and structured in a multimodal algorithm. the diagnostic algorithm was prospectively validated in a further 60 patients.results: single epidemiological and ultrasonographic data do not reliably predict the lesional entity. the multimodal diagnostic algorithm achieved a diagnostic sensitivity/specificity of 100%/100% in sialolithiasis, 44%/100% in benign submandibular gland diseases (bsd), 94%/96% in nodal lymphoma/unspecific lymphadenitis, and 91%/84% in carcinomas. reduced sensitivity in bsd or specificity in carcinomas increased after intra-operative fresh frozen section in patients suspected for bsd.
lymphoma	background: epstein barr virus (ebv) plays a causal role in some diseases, including infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. detection of ebv infection has been shown to be a useful tool for diagnosing ebv-related diseases. in the present study, we compared the performance of molecular tests, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and ebv real-time pcr, to those of serological assays for the detection of ebv infection. methods: thirty-eight patients with infectious mononucleosis (im) were enrolled, of whom 31 were diagnosed with a mild type, and seven were diagnosed with im with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection. twenty healthy controls were involved in the study. the atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood were detected under a microscope and the percentage of positive cells was calculated. ebv dna load in peripheral blood was detected using real-time pcr. the fish assay was developed to detect the ebv genome from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). other diagnosis methods including the heterophil agglutination (ha) test and ebv-vca-igm test, to detect ebv were also compared. spss17.0 was used for statistical analysis. results: in all, 5-41% atypical lymphocytes were found among the pbmc in mild im patients, whereas 8-51% atypical lymphocytes were found in im patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection patients. there was no significant difference in the ratios of atypical lymphoma between patients of the different types. we observed that 71.2% of mild im patients and 85.7% of im patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection patients were positive for ebv-vca-igm. ebv-vca-igm was negative in all healthy control subjects. in addition, 67.1% of mild im patients tested heterophile antibody positive, whereas 71.4% of im patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection tested positive. ebv dna detected using real-time pcr was observed in 89.5% of these im patients. the ebv genome was detected by the fish assay in 97.4% of the im patients. the eb viral loads detected by fish and real-time pcr increased with the severity of im. the ebv genome was detected in almost all the pbmc of im with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chronic active ebv infection patients. conclusion: molecular tests, including fish and ebv real-time pcr, are more sensitive than serological assays for the detection of ebv infection. the fish assay detecting ebv copies in unfractionated whole blood is preferable and superior to plasma real-time pcr in its reflection of the absolute viral burden circulating in the patients.
lymphoma	autologous t cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (cars) specific for cd19 have demonstrated remarkable efficacy as therapeutics for b cell malignancies. in the present study, we generated flag-tagged cd19-specific car-t cells (cd19-flag) and compared them to their non-tagged counterparts for their effects on solid and hematological cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. for solid tumors, we used hela cervical carcinoma cells engineered to overexpress cd19 (hela-cd19), and for hematological cancer we used raji burkitt 's lymphoma cells, which endogenously express cd19. like non-tagged cd19 car-t cells, cd19-flag car-t cells expanded in culture >100-fold and exhibited potent cytolytic activity against both hela-cd19 and raji cells in vitro. cd19-flag car-t cells also secreted significantly more ifn-gamma and il-2 than the control t cells. in vivo, cd19-flag car-t cells significantly blocked the growth of hela-cd19 solid tumors, increased tumor cleaved caspase-3 levels, and expanded systemically. cd19-flag car-t cells also significantly reduced raji tumor burden and extended mouse survival. these results demonstrate the strong efficacy of flag-tagged cd19 car-t cells in solid and hematological cancer models.
lymphoma	bovine leukemia virus (blv) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, a malignant b cell lymphoma that has spread worldwide and causes serious problems for the cattle industry. the blv proviral load, which represents the blv genome integrated into host genome, is a useful index for estimating disease progression and transmission risk. here, we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with blv proviral load in japanese black cattle. the study examined 93 cattle with a high proviral load and 266 with a low proviral load. three snps showed a significant association with proviral load. one snp was detected in the cntn3 gene on chromosome 22, and two (which were not in linkage disequilibrium) were detected in the bovine major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 23. these results suggest that polymorphisms in the major histocompatibility complex region affect proviral load. this is the first report to detect snps associated with blv proviral load in japanese black cattle using whole genome association study, and understanding host factors may provide important clues for controlling the spread of blv in japanese black cattle.
asthma	airborne respirable dust (ard) (< 5 mu m) in the stable environment is strongly implicated in equine asthma. bedding, forage, ventilation rate, and stable management activities all contribute to ard. this study investigated the relationship between ard in the breathing zone (bz) and the stable zone (sz) in eight american barns (abs) and eight stable complexes with individual stables under four different management regimes. airborne respirable dust was measured in eight replicate stables per regime in abs (n = 32) and eight per regime in single stables (n = 32). regimes were as follows: (1) steamed hay and shavings; (2) dry hay and shavings; (3) haylage and straw; and (4) dry hay and straw. samples were taken in quite periods between 3 pm and 4 pm hours. airborne respirable dust levels were analyzed using split-plot analysis of variance and wilcoxon matched-pairs test (genstat 15) with p <.05 as significant. the lowest ard (< 360 rp/l air) was found for shavings and steamed hay in ab and single stables in both bz and sz. straw and dry hay in abs produced ard of 6,250 (sz), 5,079 rp/l air (bz) which was greater (p <.05) than the 2,901 (sz) and 942 (bz) rp/l air in single stables. straw and haylage produced more ard across both zones in single stables compared with abs. shavings and dry hay = more dust in the bz than in the sz, whereas straw and haylage = higher ard in the sz versus the bz across both stable designs. using dry hay and/or straw cannot be recommended as a suitable management regime for stabled horses.

asthma	background: pollen exposure has acute adverse effects on sensitized individuals. information on the prevalence of respiratory diseases in areas with different pollen concentrations is scanty. aim: we performed an ecologic analysis to assess whether the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in young adults varied across areas with different pollen concentrations in italy. methods: a questionnaire on respiratory diseases was delivered to random samples of 20-44 year-old subjects from six centers in 2005-2010. data on the daily air concentrations of 7 major allergologic pollens (poaceae, urticaceae, oleaceae, cupressaceae, coryloideae, betula and ambrosia) were collected for 2007-2008. center-specific pollen exposure indicators were calculated, including the average number of days per year with pollens above the low or high concentration thresholds defined by the italian association of aerobiology. associations between pollen exposure and disease prevalence, adjusted for potential confounders, were estimated using logistic regression models with center as a random-intercept. results: overall, 8834 subjects (56.8%) filled in the questionnaire. allergic rhinitis was significantly less frequent in the centers with longer periods with high concentrations of at least one (or per 10 days = 0.989, 95%ci: 0.979-0.999) or at least two pollens (or = 0.974, 95%ci: 0.951-0.998); associations with the number of days with at least one (or = 0.988, 95%cl: 0.972-1.004) or at least two (or = 0.985, 95%ci: 0.970-1.001) pollens above the low thresholds were borderline significant. asthma prevalence was not associated with pollen concentrations. conclusions: our study does not support that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma is greater in centers with higher pollen concentrations. it is not clear whether the observed ecologic associations hold at the individual level.

asthma	to achieve a better understanding of mechanisms underlying the anti-asthmatic action of inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids (gcs) and to provide more data regarding the risk of a negative effect of inhaled gcs on cd4(+) t cells, a study was conducted on the effect of ciclesonide and methylprednisolone on cd4+ effector (teff), regulatory (treg) and resting (trest) t cells within respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues in a mouse model of allergic asthma. the study indicated that one, and possibly a key mechanism, underlying the anti-asthmatic action of inhaled and systemic gcs is the prevention of the activation and clonal expansion of cd4+ teff cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes (mlns), which consequently prevents infiltration of the lungs with cd4+ teff cells. the beneficial effects of gcs in asthma treatment were not mediated through increased recruitment of treg cells into the mlns and lungs and/or local generation of treg cells. the results demonstrated that inhaled and systemic gcs induced comparable depletion of normal cd4+ teff, trest and treg cells in the mlns, head and neck lymph nodes and peripheral blood. furthermore, inhaled, but not systemic gc therapy, led to the loss of these cells in the lungs. thus, the study suggests that inhaled gc therapy may not be safer at all than systemic one with respect to the adverse effect on cd4+ t cells present within and outside the respiratory tract. moreover, administration of inhaled gcs can produce negative effects on lung-residing cd4+ t cells.

asthma	background: researchers investigating lung diseases, such as asthma, have questioned whether certain compounds previously reported in exhaled breath condensate (ebc) originate from saliva contamination. moreover, despite its increasing use in omics profiling studies, the constituents of ebc remain largely uncharacterized. the present study aims to define the usefulness of ebc in investigating lung disease by comparing ebc, saliva, and saliva-contaminated ebc using targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry and the potential of metabolite loss from adsorption to ebc sample collection tubes. methods: liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (lc-ms) was used to analyze samples from 133 individuals from three different cohorts. levels of amino acids and eicosanoids, two classes of molecules previously reported in ebc and saliva, were measured using targeted lc-ms. cohort 1 was used to examine contamination of ebc by saliva. samples from cohort 1 consisted of clean ebc, saliva-contaminated ebc, and clean saliva from 13 healthy volunteers; samples were analyzed using untargeted lc-ms. cohort 2 was used to compare eicosanoid levels from matched ebc and saliva collected from 107 asthmatic subjects. samples were analyzed using both targeted and untargeted lc-ms. cohort 3 samples consisted of clean-ebc collected from 13 subjects, including smokers and non-smokers, and were used to independently confirm findings; samples were analyzed using targeted lc-ms, untargeted lc-ms, and proteomics. in addition to human samples, an in-house developed nebulizing system was used to determine the potential for ebc samples to be contaminated by saliva. results: out of the 400 metabolites detected in both ebc and saliva, 77 were specific to ebc; however, ebc samples were concentrated 20-fold to achieve this level of sensitivity. amino acid concentrations ranged from 196 pg/ml - 4 mu g/ml (clean ebc), 1.98 ng/ml - 6 mu g/ml (saliva-contaminated ebc), and 13.84 ng/ml - 1256 mg/ml (saliva). eicosanoid concentration ranges were an order of magnitude lower; 10 pg/ml - 76.5 ng/ml (clean ebc), 10 pg/ml - 898 ng/ml (saliva-contaminated ebc), and 2.54 ng/ml - 272.9 mg/ml (saliva). although the sample size of the replication cohort (cohort 3) did not allow for statistical comparisons, two proteins and 19 eicosanoids were detected in smoker vs. non-smoker clean-ebc. conclusions: we conclude that metabolites are present and detectable in ebc using lc-ms; however, a large starting volume of sample is required.
asthma	backgroundclinical presentation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exacerbated respiratory disease (nerd) is found to be heterogeneous. this study classified phenotypic clusters to determine nerd subtypes. methodswe performed two-step cluster analysis using urticaria, chronic rhinosinusitis (crs), and atopy, in a nerd cohort comprising 302 patients. asthma exacerbation was defined as receiving at least one burst of intravenous steroid treatment and/or at least two bursts of oral steroid use ( 45 mg/3 days) per year. the possession rate of anti-asthmatic medications was estimated during the follow-up period. resultsthere were four subtypes: subtype 1 (nerd with crs/atopy and no urticaria), subtype 2 (nerd with crs and no urticaria/atopy), subtype 3 (nerd without crs/urticaria), and subtype 4 (nerd with urticaria). significant differences were found between the four subtypes in the female proportion, baseline fev1%, serum total ige level, and sputum/peripheral eosinophil count. a higher frequency of asthma exacerbations was noted in subtype 1 compared to subtype 3. the possession rates of medium- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta(2)-agonists showed significant differences among the four subtypes. metabolomic analysis showed that the four subtypes of nerd had a higher serum leukotriene e4 (lte4) level than those with aspirin-tolerant asthma. the patients with subtypes 1 and 3 had a higher urine lte4 level than those with subtype 2. conclusionwe found four distinct subtypes with different clinical/biochemical findings and asthma exacerbations in a nerd cohort. these findings suggest that stratified strategies by applying subtype classification may help achieve better outcomes in the management of nerd.
bipolar_disorder	introduction: analgesics are commonly prescribed medications used to alleviate pain of various aetiologies without affecting the patient 's consciousness. they interfere with the transmission of pain signals. a commonly used antiepileptic drug, sodium valproate has been used in various non-epileptic conditions like migraine prophylaxis and in the treatment of bipolar disorder because of the multiple mechanisms by which it acts. docosahexanoic acid (dha), an omega 3 fatty acid, is known to possess analgesic activity. we planned a study to assess the effect of sodium valproate alone and in combination with dha in rat models of pain. aim: to evaluate the analgesic activity of sodium valproate and dha supplementation using various experimental models in albino wistar rats. materials and methods: for analgesic activity, a total of 48 adult wistar albino rats were divided into eight groups of six rats each. group i was control (distil water 1 ml/kg), group ii received intraperitoneal injection of tramadol (10 mg/kg), group iii, iv, v were injected intraperitoneal sodium valproate 100, 200, 400 mg/kg with distil water respectively and group vi, vii, viii were given sodium valproate 100, 200, 400 mg/kg plus dha 300 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) respectively. analgesic activity was assessed using hot plate, tail flick and acetic acid writhing models. results: we found that sodium valproate at higher doses (400 mg/kg) used either alone along with dha (300 mg/kg) showed statistically significant analgesic activity in comparison to control in various experimental models for assessing pain. conclusion: combination of sodium valproate along with dha has shown promising analgesic activity.
bipolar_disorder	the present work aims at investigating how toxoplasma gondii (t. gondii) infection may be linked to n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) dysfunction in schizophrenia and related disorders and puts forward the hypothesis that immune responses against t. gondii may involve nmdars. indeed, the analysis of the protozoan proteome and nmdar subunits for peptide commonalities shows a massive peptide overlap and supports the possibility that anti-t. gondii immune responses raised during active protozoan infection may cross-react with host nmdars, determining disruption of neural circuits and cognitive deficits. in particular, the nmda 2d subunit, which is mainly expressed in parvalbumin-positive interneurons, appears to be a hotspot for potential t. gondii-induced cross-reactive immune attacks.
bipolar_disorder	transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation which uses a weak constant current to alter cortical excitability and activity temporarily. tdcs-induced increases in neuronal excitability and performance improvements have been observed following anodal stimulation of brain regions associated with visual and motor functions, but relatively little research has been conducted with respect to auditory processing. recently, pilot study results indicate that anodal tdcs can increase auditory deviance detection, whereas cathodal tdcs decreases auditory processing, as measured by a brain-based event-related potential (erp), mismatch negativity (mmn). as evidence has shown that tdcs lasting effects may be dependent on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor activity, the current study investigated the use of dextromethorphan (dmo), an nmda antagonist, to assess possible modulation of tdcs 's effects on both mmn and working memory performance. the study, conducted in 12 healthy volunteers, involved four laboratory test sessions within a randomised, placebo and sham-controlled crossover design that compared pre- and post-anodal tdcs over the auditory cortex (2 ma for 20 minutes to excite cortical activity temporarily and locally) and sham stimulation (i.e. device is turned off) during both dmo (50 ml) and placebo administration. anodal tdcs increased mmn amplitudes with placebo administration. significant increases were not seen with sham stimulation or with anodal stimulation during dmo administration. with sham stimulation (i.e. no stimulation), dmo decreased mmn amplitudes. findings from this study contribute to the understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms mediating tdcs sensory and memory improvements.
bipolar_disorder	the aim of this study was to compare the global functioning and cognitive performance in a community sample of young adults with mood disorders versus community controls. this was a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort study with a community sample, data was collected from february 2012 to june 2014; specifically, at a mean of five years after the first phase, all young adults were invited to participate in a re-evaluation. mini international neuropsychiatric interview- plus (mini-plus) was used for the diagnosis of mood disorders. the functional assessment short test (fast) and the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) were used to assess the global functioning, and cognitive performance, respectively. were included 1258 subjects. functional impairment was greater in subjects with bipolar disorder when compared to community controls, and there were no differences between major depressive disorder and community controls. there were no significant differences in cognitive performance between young adults with mood disorders when compared to community controls. functional impairment is a marker for bipolar disorder in young adults; however, gross cognitive impairment assessed by a screening test is not, possibly because cognition is impaired in more advanced stages of the disorder.
bipolar_disorder	background and aim emotional dysregulation (ed) is a frequent feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). it can be observed as a dysregulation profile or a deficient emotional self-regulation (desr) profile. oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (odd/cd) comorbidity is prevalent in adhd and known to be related with ed. the first-line treatment of adhd includes psychostimulants, but their effects on ed are not well studied. this study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of methylphenidate (mph) treatment on ed in adhd + odd/cd cases. methods a total of 118 adhd + odd/cd patients with a mean age of 9.0 1.9 years were treated with mph for 1 year. also, parents of cases were recruited for a parent-training program, which initiated after first month of mph treatment. symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 12th month by turgay diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition-based child and adolescent behavior disorders screening and rating scale-parent form, children depression inventory, child behavior checklist 4-18 years, and parental acceptance and rejection questionnaire-mother form. results emotional dysregulation (desr + dp) was present in 85.6% of cases. conduct disorder was significantly higher in patients with dp, whereas odd was significantly higher in the desr and non-ed groups (p < 0.0001). symptoms of adhd and ed were significantly improved with 1-year of mph treatment (p < 0.05). the improvement in ed was independent of improvement in adhd symptoms and parent training (p < 0.05). conclusions emotional dysregulation is highly prevalent in disruptive behavioral disorders as odd and cd, which are comorbid with adhd. the mph treatment is effective on ed independently from other clinical determinants.
crohn's_disease	background and aim: limited data are available regarding mortality from inflammatory bowel disease in non-caucasian populations. herein, we evaluated overall and cause-specific mortality in a hospital-based cohort of korean inflammatory bowel disease patients. methods: we determined mortality in 2414 crohn 's disease patients and 2798 ulcerative colitis patients diagnosed between 1977 and 2013. standardized mortality ratios were calculated in several demographic and phenotypic subgroups. results: during the mean 9-year follow up, 114 patients died: 35 with crohn 's disease and 79 with ulcerative colitis. the overall standardized mortality ratios were 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.94) in crohn 's disease and 0.73 (0.58-0.91) in ulcerative colitis. in crohn 's disease, female sex, age10years, ileocolonic disease at diagnosis, perianal fistula, intestinal resection, and ever-use of corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality. in ulcerative colitis, male sex, age >= 30years at diagnosis, disease duration <= 5years, proctitis at diagnosis, and no history of colectomy were associated with lower mortality, while primary sclerosing cholangitis was associated with higher mortality. in both crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis, high mortality rates due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal causes (standardized mortality ratios: 4.59 and 2.32, respectively) and gastrointestinal malignancies (standardized mortality ratios: 16.59 and 3.45, respectively) were observed. cardiovascular mortality was lower in ulcerative colitis (standardized mortality ratio: 0.47). conclusions: the overall mortality tended to be higher in crohn 's disease patients than in the general population; it was slightly lower in ulcerative colitis patients than in the general population.
crohn's_disease	bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (bpi) gene polymorphisms have been extensively investigated in terms of their associations with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), with contradictory results. the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate associations between bpi gene polymorphisms and the risk of ibd, crohn 's disease (cd), and ulcerative colitis (uc). eligible studies from pubmed, embase, and cochrane library databases were identified. ten studies (five cd and five uc) published in five papers were included in this meta-analysis. g645a polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of uc in allele model, dominant model, and homozygous model. our data suggested that bpi g645a polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of uc; the bpi g645a polymorphism was not associated with the risk of cd.
crohn's_disease	background: a large body of evidence supports a central role of tlr5 and its natural ligand, flagellin, in crohn 's disease (cd), with the precise mechanism(s) still unresolved. methods: we investigated the role of flagellin/tlr5 in samp1/yitfc (samp) mice, a spontaneous model of crohn 's disease-like ileitis. results: ileal tlr5 and serum antiflagellin igg antibodies were increased in samp before the onset of inflammation and during established disease; these trends were abrogated in the absence of colonizing commensal bacteria. irradiated samp receiving either wild-type (akr) or samp bone marrow (bm) developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal tlr5 compared with akr recipients of either samp or akr bone marrow, neither of which conferred ileitis, suggesting that elevated tlr5 in native samp is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic (e.g., epithelial) source. indeed, ileal epithelial tlr5 in preinflamed samp was increased compared with age-matched akr and germ-free samp. tlr5-specific ex vivo activation of samp ileal tissues decreased epithelial barrier resistance, indicative of increased permeability, and was accompanied by altered expression of the tight junction proteins, claudin-3, occludin, and zonula occludens-1. conclusions: our results provide evidence that aberrant, elevated tlr5 expression is present in the ileal epithelium of samp mice, is augmented in the presence of the gut microbiome, and that tlr5 activation in response to bacterial flagellin results in a deficiency to maintain appropriate epithelial barrier integrity. together, these findings represent a potential mechanistic pathway leading to the exacerbation and perpetuation of chronic gut inflammation in experimental ileitis and possibly, in patients with crohn 's disease.
crohn's_disease	background for many years, 'conventional' double contrast enteroclysis has been suggested as the technique of choice for the evaluation of the small intestine. computed tomography (ct) performed with oral and intravenous contrast material has a proven track record of depicting bowel wall and mesenteric abnormalities. ct enteroclysis was developed to overcome the individual deficiencies of ct and conventional enteroclysis and to combine the advantages of both barium enteroclysis and conventional abdominal ct examinations into one technique. the present study is a longitudinal study to evaluate the role of multi-detector row helical computed tomographic (ct) enteroclysis for the depiction of small bowel diseases in patients. aim of study-to prospectively evaluate the role of multi-detector row helical computed tomographic (mdct) enteroclysis for the depiction of small-bowel diseases. materials and methods study group-ct enteroclysis was done for 35 clinically suspected cases of small-bowel diseases referred to department of radiodiagnosis, yenepoya medical college, mangalore from october 2014 to september 2016. results of the 33 patients who underwent successful ct enteroclysis, positive findings were obtained in 16 patients (48.5%), and negative findings were obtained in 17 patients 51.56%). among the 16 patients, ct enteroclysis allowed the detection of small-bowel masses in 4 patients including 2 adenocarcinoma, 1 gastrointestinal stromal tumour and 1 lymphoma. ct enteroclysis demonstrated metastatic lymph nodes in 2 cases; small-bowel abnormalities in 12 patients including 4 patients with crohn 's disease and 2 patients with small-bowel tuberculosis. images demonstrated site and cause of small bowel obstruction in 2 cases and areas of stenosis in 12 cases with the mural and extramural inflammatory changes. conclusion ct enteroclysis is a fast, well-tolerated, and reliable imaging modality for the depiction of small-bowel diseases. this technique provides adequate small-bowel distension in a majority of patients. in addition, ct enteroclysis allows the detection of extraluminal disease and provides information relative to the entire abdomen that is not obtained with small-bowel follow-through or endoscopy.
crohn's_disease	the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of newly developed silver nanoparticle aqueous suspensions nanoag1 and nanoag2 in the mouse models mimicking ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease. nanoag1 and nanoag2 were synthesized in aqueous medium with the involvement of tannic acid. to elucidate their anti- inflammatory activity, semi-chronic mouse models of inflammation induced by dextrane sulfate sodium addition to drinking water and intracolonic (i.c.) administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid were used. nanoag1 and nanoag2 (500 mg/dm3, 100 mu l/animal, i.c., once daily) significantly ameliorated colitis in dextrane sulfate sodium- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced mouse models of colonic inflammation, as indicated by reduced macroscopic, ulcer and microscopic scores. the anti-inflammatory effect was dependent on the shape and diameter of silver nanoparticles, as indicated by weaker effect of nanoag1 than nanoag2. in addition, administration of nanoag2, but not nanoag1, modulated colonic microbiota, as indicated by reduced number of escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens, and increased number of lactobacillus sp. summarizing, nanoag1 and nanoag2 after administered i.c. effectively alleviate colitis in experimental models of ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease in mice. therefore, nanoag1 and nanoag2 administered i.c. have the potential to become valuable agents for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: avian antigen is a common cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (hp). inhalation challenge with pigeon serum and pigeon dropping extract (pde) elicits a hypersensitivity reaction in patients with bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (brhp), but the antigenic components in these materials have yet to be fully elucidated. method: pigeon serum, pigeon intestine homogenates, and pde were immunoblotted with serum samples from 8 patients with brhp, 2 patients with summer-type hp, 2 patients with humidifier lung, and 3 healthy volunteers. among the protein spots found in both pigeon serum and pde, those that reacted with sera from brhp patients were identified by mass spectrometry. immunoassays using recombinant protein were performed to confirm the antigenicity of the identified protein. cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) stimulated with recombinant protein was also assessed. results: immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide-1 (igll-1) was identified from all spots on 2-de immunoblots of both pigeon serum and pde. the brhp patients exhibited higher levels of serum igg antibody against the recombinant igll-1 (rigll-1) compared to the control subjects, as well as a stronger pbmcs proliferative response to rigll-1. cytokine production by pbmcs from brhp patients after rigll-1 exposure indicated that the protein could induce th1 prone immune responses: an increase in tnf-alpha and an absence of elevated il-10 production. conclusions: pigeon igll-1 was identified as the brhp antigen present in both pigeon serum and pde.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	background: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a devastating disease characterized by an unpredictable course. prognostic markers and disease activity markers are needed. the purpose of this single-center retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of lung fluorodeoxyglucose ([f-18]-fdg) uptake assessed by standardized uptake value (suv), metabolic lung volume (mlv) and total lesion glycolysis (tlg) in patients with ipf. methods: we included 27 ipf patients (ipf group) and 15 patients with a gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor without thoracic involvement (control group). we quantified lung suv mean and suv max, mlv and tlg and assessed clinical data, high-resolution ct (hrct) fibrosis and ground-glass score; lung function; gender, age, physiology (gap) stage at inclusion and during follow-up; and survival. results: lung suv mean and suv max were higher in ipf patients than controls (p < 0.00001). for patients with ipf, suv mean, suv max, mlv and tlg were correlated with severity of lung involvement as measured by a decline in forced vital capacity (fvc) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (dlco) and increased gap score. in a univariate and in a multivariate cox proportional-hazards model, risk of death was increased although not significantly with high suv mean. on univariate analysis, risk of death was significantly associated with high tlg and mlv, which disappeared after adjustment functional variables or gap index. increased mlv and tlg were independent predictors of death or disease progression during the 12 months after pet scan completion (for every 100-point increase in tlg, hazard ratio [hr]: 1.11 (95% ci 1.06; 1.36), p = 0.003; for every 100-point increase in mlv, hr: 1.20 (1.04; 1.19), p = 0.002). on multivariable analysis including tlg or mlv with age, fvc, and dlco or gap index, tlg and mlv remained associated with progression-free survival (hr: 1.1 [1.03; 1.22], p = 0.01; and 1.13 [1.0; 1.2], p = 0.005). conclusion: fdg lung uptake may be a marker of ipf severity and predict progression-free survival for patients with ipf.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a progressive lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation, fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated. the contribution of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/protein kinase b (akt) pathway in fibrotic processes remains to be investigated. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the pi3k/akt pathway in pulmonary fibrosis. a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal administration of bleomycin (blm), and a specific pi3k/akt inhibitor, ly294002, was used to assess the role of the pi3k/akt pathway in fibrogenesis. the inflammatory and fibrotic alterations in the lung tissues were evaluated using histological staining and the hydroxyproline assay. in addition, the concentration of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the expression of akt, phosphorylated (p-)akt, epithelial cadherin, a smooth muscle actin and vimentin in lung tissues. the data demonstrated that an increase in the expression levels of p-akt was involved in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis and contributed to fibrogenesis. administration of the akt inhibitor significantly attenuated inflammation and fibrosis, which was accompanied by a reversal of lung fibrosis-associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. taken together, these observations suggest that the pi3k/akt pathway serves a central role in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis, and is a promising therapeutic target.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	human amnion epithelial cells (haecs) have been shown to possess potent immunomodulatory properties across a number of disease models. recently, we reported that haecs influence macrophage polarization and activity, and that this step was dependent on regulatory t cells. in this study, we aimed to assess the effects of haec-derived proresolution lipoxin-a(4) (lxa4) on t-cell, macrophage, and neutrophil phenotype and function during the acute phase of bleomycin-induced lung injury. using c57bl6 mice, we administered 4 million haecs intraperitoneally 24 hours after bleomycin challenge. outcomes were measured at days 3, 5, and 7. haec administration resulted in significant changes to t-cell, macrophage, dendritic cell, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration and phenotypes. endogenous levels of lipoxygenases, lxa4, and the lipoxin receptor fpr2 were elevated in haec-treated animals. furthermore, we showed that the effects of haecs on macrophage phagocytic activity and t-cell suppression are lxa4 dependent, whereas the inhibition of neutrophil-derived myleoperoxidase by haecs is independent of lxa4. this study provides the first evidence that lipid-based mediators contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of haecs and further supports the growing body of evidence that lxa4 is proresolutionary in lung injury. this discovery of lxa4-dependent communication between haecs, macrophages, t cells, and neutrophils is important to the understanding of haec biodynamics and would be expected to inform future clinical applications.
idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis	setting : despite the clinical importance of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), its epidemiology has been rarely reported. the economic burden from ipf is therefore difficult to predict. objective: to analyse the health care burden and current situation with respect to medical resource utilisation in patients with ipf in korea. methods: we analysed nationwide data collected between 2009 and 2013 from the korean health insurance review and assessment (hira) database. patients with ipf were defined by the k-j84.18 code of the korean classification of disease, 6th revision. results: the total direct health care costs increased from us$19 805 167 in 2009 to us$31 410 083 in 2013; the principal factor responsible for the highest proportion of costs was hospitalisation. the proportion of the total ipf patient population who were hospitalised at least once a year was 27.2%, and the average length of hospital stay was 12.7 days. from post-hoc analysis, hospital admission, emergency room visit and intensive care unit admission rates showed significant seasonal variations; the admission rates were highest in the spring and lowest in autumn. conclusions: health care costs of ipf are increasing annually, with hospital admissions representing the major financial burden.
mental_health	there is compelling evidence that teachers and clergy are stressful occupations. this study aimed to compare the rate of job strain and burnout among lay and consecrated teachers and to study the effect of religious coping on the mental health of these two groups. a cross-sectional survey study was carried out in catholic kindergarten, preschool and primary schools of an italian congregation of nuns, in south italy. the italian versions of the maslach burnout inventory-educator survey (mbi-es) scale, of the general health questionnaire (ghq-12) and a study-specific questionnaire with sociodemographic variables and indicators of subjective (self-reported religiosity) and objective (prayer personal and church attendance) religiousness were used. data were analyzed according to the guidelines for data processing and an analysis of the scales used. the participation rate of this study was 88 %. there was a significant difference between two groups in religiousness and job strain/burnout scores (lay teachers were the most affected group). moreover, religiousness scores had a positive correlation with personal accomplishment, job satisfaction and perceived performance and a negative correlation with emotional exhaustion, turnover intention and morbidity psychiatric. therefore, according to religious coping 's research, prayer personal and church attendance can be recommended as two of the ways to prevent job strain and burnout in the teacher work.
mental_health	the current paper provides an overview of the history and development of mental health services with special emphasis on psychotherapy in china. recent epidemiological surveys have revealed high prevalence rates of mental disorders that translate into a huge demand for mental health care. the chinese government responds to such demand by increasing the number and types of mental health professionals in delivering mental health interventions, one of which is cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). due to unique chinese cultural values, cbt needs to be adapted to these values so as to enhance its acceptability by chinese people. furthermore, training and supervision of chinese therapists require some cultural adaptation in therapist 's training and supervision skills. this paper concludes by providing some specific recommendations on improving the quality and accessibility of cbt in china.
mental_health	background. chinese psychiatrists have gradually started to focus on those who are deemed to be at clinical high-risk (chr)' for psychosis; however, it is still unknown how often those individuals identified as chr from a different country background than previously studied would transition to psychosis. the objectives of this study are to examine baseline characteristics and the timing of symptom onset, help-seeking, or transition to psychosis over a 2-year period in china. method. the presence of chr was determined with the structured interview for prodromal syndromes (sips) at the participants' first visit to the mental health services. a total of 86 (of 117) chr participants completed the clinical follow-up of at least 2 years (73.5%). conversion was determined using the criteria of presence of psychotic symptoms (in sips). analyses examined baseline demographic and clinical predictors of psychosis and trajectory of symptoms over time. survival analysis (kaplan-meier) methods along with log-rank tests were performed to illustrate the relationship of baseline data to either conversion or non-conversion over time. cox regression was performed to identify baseline predictors of conversion by the 2-year follow-up. results. in total 25 (29.1%) of 86 completers transitioned to a psychotic disorder over the course of follow-up. among the chr sample, the mean time between attenuated symptom onset and professional help-seeking was about 4 months on average, and converters developed fully psychotic symptoms about 12 months after symptom onset. compared with those chr participants whose risk syndromes remitted over the course of the study, converters had significantly longer delays (p = 0.029) for their first visit to a professional in search of help. at baseline assessment, the conversion subgroup was younger, had poorer functioning, higher total sips positive symptom scores, longer duration of untreated prodromal symptoms, and were more often given psychosis-related diagnoses and subsequently prescribed antipsychotics in the clinic. conclusions. chinese chr identified primarily by a novel clinical screening approach had a 2-year transition rate comparable with those of specialised help-seeking samples world-wide. early clinical intervention with this functionally deteriorating clinical population who are suffering from attenuated psychotic symptoms, is a next step in applying the chr construct in china.
mental_health	intimate partner abuse (ipa), a major social problem, can lead to mental health conditions and is implicated in 30 % of female and 5 % of male homicide deaths. we hypothesized that due to distinct relationship structures and power dynamics which are immersed in varying sociocultural contexts, victims of male-male, female-female and female-male dyads experience different patterns of ipa. our objectives were: (1) to examine the demographic and clinical characteristics of victims of male victim-male abuser (m-m), female victim-male abuser (f-m), male victim-female abuser (m-f), and female victim-female abuser (f-f) dyads. (2) to compare patterns of ipa reported by the victims in these groups. out of 397 subjects in the general population that attempted this internet-based study, 214 english-speaking subjects were older than 18 years, had experienced ipa, and provided complete information for the analysis. victims of ipa were screened and specific methods of abuse were evaluated. m-ms were significantly more educated (70 %) than other groups. f-fs experienced more abuse before age 18 by a parent or relative. f-fs experienced the most physical abuse while m-ms the least (p = 0.004). physical abuse or threats of abuse in front of children was reported more in f-fs (p < 0.01) and least in m-ms. ipa patterns differ significantly with f-fs presenting the most physical profile and m-ms presenting the least.
mental_health	how does wartime violence affect public attitudes toward the government in the long run? in this paper, we examine whether violence against civilians during the korean war continues to influence people 's attitudes toward the south korean government more than half a century later. we find that wartime violence has clear long-term attitudinal effects. using a difference-in-differences analysis that compares the cohorts born before and after the war, the findings indicate that people who experienced violence in their childhood (0-5 years) are less supportive of the south korean government, especially the administration and the military, compared with those born in the same areas during the 5 years after the war. we argue that the gap between pre- and post-war cohorts is generated by the long-lasting trauma of wartime violence and the social stigma imposed on violence victims after the war.
dementia	objectives: intraindividual variability (iiv) in reaction time refers to the trial-to-trial fluctuations in responding across a given cognitive task. cross-sectional research suggests that iiv increases with normal and neuropathological ageing and it may serve as a marker of neurobiological integrity. this raises the possibility that iiv may also predict future cognitive decline and, indeed, neuropathology. therefore, we conducted a systematic review to address these issues. methods: a search of electronic databases embase, medline, psycinfo, and web of science was completed on may 17, 2016 that identified longitudinal investigations of iiv in middle-aged or older adults. results: a total of 688 studies were initially identified of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. nine included longitudinal iiv measures and 17 predicted subsequent outcome (cognitive decline or impairment, dementia, mortality) from baseline iiv. the results suggested iiv increased over time, particularly in participants aged over 75 years. greater baseline iiv was consistently associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including cognitive decline or impairment, and mortality. conclusions: increased iiv over time is associated with normal ageing. however, further increases in iiv over and above those found in normal ageing may be a risk factor for future cognitive impairment or mortality. measures of iiv may, therefore, have considerable potential as a supplement to existing clinical assessment to aid identification of individuals at risk of adverse outcomes such as dementia or death.
dementia	in recent years, chchd2 and chchd10 mutations were reported to be associated with a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson 's disease ( pd), although with conflicting results in different populations. the present study aimed to evaluate chchd2 and chchd10 coding variants in italian patients with pd. all the coding regions and flanking intronic splice sites of chchd2 and chchd10 were sequenced. none of our 119 pd cases carried chchd2 mutations, whereas 1 sporadic pd patient showed the pro34ser substitution in chchd10. our data suggest that chchd2 and chcdh10 mutations are not a relevant cause of pd in italian population.

dementia	the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex are core brain regions that anchor the salience network, one of several large-scale intrinsic functional connectivity networks that have been derived consistently using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). while several studies have shown that the insula and anterior cingulate cortex play important roles in interoceptive awareness, no study to date has examined the association between intrinsic salience network connectivity and interoceptive awareness. in this study, we sought to test this idea in 26 healthy young participants who underwent a resting-state fmri scan and a heartbeat counting task outside the scanner in the same session. greater salience network connectivity in the posterior insula (but not the anterior cingulate cortex) using independent component analysis correlated with higher accuracy in the heartbeat counting task. furthermore, using seed-based approach, greater interoceptive accuracy was associated with greater intrinsic connectivity of all insular functional subdivisions to salience network regions, including the anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum and midbrain. these associations remained after correcting for voxel-wise grey matter volumes. the findings underscore the critical role of insular salience network intrinsic connectivity in interoceptive awareness and pave the way for future investigations into how salience network dysconnectivity affects interoceptive awareness in brain disorders.
dementia	abnormal accumulation of tdp-43 into cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions with accompanying nuclear clearance, a common pathology initially identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal dementia (ftd), has also been found in alzheimer' disease (ad). tdp-43 serves as a splicing repressor of non-conserved cryptic exons and that such function is compromised in brains of als and ftd patients, suggesting that nuclear clearance of tdp-43 underlies its inability to repress cryptic exons. however, whether tdp-43 cytoplasmic aggregates are a prerequisite for the incorporation of cryptic exons is not known. here, we assessed hippocampal tissues from 34 human postmortem brains including cases with confirmed diagnosis of ad neuropathologic changes along with age-matched controls. we found that cryptic exon incorporation occurred in all ad cases exhibiting tdp-43 pathology. furthermore, incorporation of cryptic exons was observed in the hippocampus when tdp-43 inclusions was restricted only to the amygdala, the earliest stage of tdp-43 progression. importantly, cryptic exon incorporation could be detected in ad brains lacking tdp-43 inclusion but exhibiting nuclear clearance of tdp-43. these data supports the notion that the functional consequence of nuclear depletion of tdp-43 as determined by cryptic exon incorporation likely occurs as an early event of tdp-43 proteinopathy and may have greater contribution to the pathogenesis of ad than currently appreciated. early detection and effective repression of cryptic exons in ad patients may offer important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for this devastating illness of the elderly.
dementia	background: the organization of long-term care is one of the main challenges of public health and health policies in europe and worldwide, especially in terms of care concepts for people with dementia. in austria and the czech republic the majority of elderly institutionalized persons with dementia are cared for in nursing homes. it is however unclear, how many persons living in nursing homes in austria and in the czech republic are suffering from cognitive impairment and dementia. in addition, basic information on the nutritional status, the status of mobility and the medication prescription patterns are often missing. to facilitate new effective and evidenced based care concepts, basic epidemiological data are in urgent need. thus, demdata was initiated to provide important basic data on persons living in nursing homes in austria and the czech republic for future care planning. methods: demdata is a multicentre mixed methods cross-sectional study. stratified and randomly drawn nursing homes in austria and the czech republic are surveyed. the study protocol used in both study centres assesses four different domains: a) resident, b) care team, c) relative and d) environmental factors. resident 's data include among others health status, cognition, dementia, mobility, nutrition, behavioural symptoms, pain intensity and quality of life. a minimum of 500 residents per country are included into the study (n= 1000 residents). the care team is asked about the use of the person-centred care and their burden. the relatives are asked about the number of visits and proxy-rate the quality of life of their family member. all staff employed in the nursing homes, all residents and relatives can voluntary take part in the study. the environmental factors include among others the organisational category of the nursing home, number of residents, number of rooms, social activities and the care concept. the project started in march 2016 and will be concluded in february 2018. discussion: demdata will provide important epidemiological data on four different nursing home domains in austria and the czech republic, with a focus on the prevalence of dementia in this population. thereby supplying decision and policy makers with important foundation for future care planning.
rheumatoid_arthritis	health services research uses increasingly data from health insurance funds. it is well known that the funds differ with regard to sociodemographic characteristics and morbidity. it is uncertain if there are also differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. to compare the sociodemographic characteristics in various health insurance funds and the prevalence of joint disorders and chronic back pain. the 30(th) wave (2013) of the german socioeconomic panel served as a database. average age, sex distribution, nationality, education, and employment status were evaluated according to the health insurance funds. the prevalence of joint disorders and chronic back pain were also stratified according to the insurance funds and standardized according to age and sex. a total of 19,146 participants were included. most participants (4,934) were insured by aok, followed by bkk (2,632) and barmer gek (2,398). there were huge differences among the health insurance funds with regard to the sociodemographic characteristics. for example, the proportion of unemployed insurants was between 33.3 % (ikk) and 50.6 % (aok). the prevalence of joint disorders standardized according to age and sex (20.7 %; 95 % ci: 20.1-21.3) was between 17.4 % (95 % ci: 15.8-19.0; pkv) and 22.4 % (95 % ci: 21.1-23.6; aok). the prevalence of chronic back pain (18.0 %; 95 % ci: 17.4-18.5) was between 13.5 % (95 % ci: 12.2-14.9; pkv) and 20.6 % (95 % ci: 19.4-21.8; aok). there are differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among health insurance funds. the extrapolation of analyses of one health insurance fund to the german population is thus limited.
rheumatoid_arthritis	background/purpose we examined the association between hydroxychloroquine (hcq) and plasma lipid and glucose levels in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) cohort. methods this is a retrospective cohort analysis of 1261 ra patients comparing fasting lipid profiles and plasma glucose between patients who were and were not taking hcq. we divided patients into 3 groups based on hcq exposure during follow-up: those who had never taken hcq, those who took it intermittently, and those who took it continuously. we used multivariable models and propensity scoring to compensate for the effect of nonrandom treatment assignment. results we followed 1261 ra patients for a total of 4605 observations between 1996 and 2014. after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards), lipid-lowering medications, body mass index (bmi), and smoking, patients taking hcq at baseline had significantly lower total cholesterol (tc) (p 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (ldl) (p 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.013), and lipid profile ratios tc/high-density lipoprotein (hdl) (p 0.001) and ldl/hdl (p 0.001), as well as higher hdl (p 0.001). in longitudinal analyses, after adjusting for confounders, patients who continuously took hcq showed significantly lower tc, ldl, tc/hdl, and ldl/hdl and higher hdl (p 0.01). fasting plasma glucose levels were not significantly associated with hcq exposure. conclusions hydroxychloroquine use was associated with lower lipid levels but not with the plasma glucose in this ra cohort. these findings support the need for a randomized trial to establish the role of hcq in cardiovascular disease prevention in ra patients.
rheumatoid_arthritis	autoimmune polyendocrinopathy with candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy (apeced) is a rare disorder of immune dysregulation caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (aire) gene. individuals affected with apeced develop a clinical syndrome characterized by ectodermal abnormalities, autoantibody production, and organ-specific autoimmune manifestations. inflammatory arthritis is usually not described as a part of the syndrome, and only sporadic cases are reported. we describe the case of a preschool-age girl who presented with hypoparathyroidism, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and chronic polyarthritis at 4 years of age and was found to have two compound heterozygous disease-associated mutations in the aire gene. we also conducted a literature review of the main characteristics of inflammatory arthritis in apeced patients. our case and review demonstrate that (1) inflammatory arthritis, although rare, can be an early manifestation of apeced; (2) the diagnosis of apeced should be considered if mucocutaneous candidiasis, multiple organ-specific autoimmune manifestations, polyendocrinopathy, especially hypoparathyroidism or adrenal failure, or ectodermal dystrophy accompany joint symptoms; and (3) genotyping interpretation should take into account that mutations are found in the 14 exons of the gene, compound heterozygosity is common, and in some cases, only one or no mutated alleles are found.
rheumatoid_arthritis	systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is an autoimmune disease characterized by extensive immune response, including over-activation of t and b cell development of pathogenic autoantibodies, organ damage induced by the formation and deposition of immune complex and the abnormal elevation of type i interferon. semaphorin5a (sema5a) is involved essentially in immune cell regulation and is also implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. we aimed to evaluate the role of sema5a in patients with sle. serum levels of sema5a were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in 152 sle patients and 48 healthy controls. the message ribonucleic acid (mrna) expression levels of sema5a and adam metallopeptidase domain 17 (adam17) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from 43 patients with sle and 19 healthy controls were detected by the real-time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). serum sema5a levels were increased significantly in sle patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0001). elevated levels of sema5a were correlated positively with 24-h proteinuria excretion (r=0558, p < 00001), sle disease activity index (sledai) (r=0278, p=00006) and c-reactive protein (crp) (r=0266, p=0002), but negatively with planet (plt) (r=-0294, p=00003) and complement 3 (c3) (r=-0287, p=00004) in sle patients. patients with elevated sema5a levels showed higher incidence of rash, serositis and nephritis (p < 005 or p < 0001). patients with decreased plt, c3 or positive for proteinuria also showed elevated sema5a (p < 0001 or p < 005). the mrna adam17 was increased in sle patients and correlated positively with serum sema5a levels. our data demonstrated that elevated serum sema5a in sle patients correlated with disease activity and are involved in kidney and blood system damage; adam17 might be involved in the release of secreted sema5a.
rheumatoid_arthritis	introduction: autonomic neuropathy (an), found to be a strong predictor of sudden cardiac death, has been reported variably in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). manifesting as sweating disturbances, gastrointestinal irregularities, bladder or erectile dysfunction, an can significantly affect a patient 's quality of life and alter the course of the disease. aim: this study was undertaken to find out the prevalence and severity of an in ra patients attending the rheumatology clinic at a tertiary care hospital in new delhi, india and also to investigate its correlation with patient and disease factors such as age, gender, disease severity, duration and serological status. materials and methods: in this cross-sectional study, an was assessed subjectively by a survey of autonomic symptoms. cardiac autonomic involvement was assessed by five cardiovascular reflex tests as described by ewing: heart rate (hr), response to deep breathing, standing, and valsalva and blood pressure (bp) response to standing and sustained handgrip. results: a total of 31 ra patients and 31 age and sex matched healthy volunteers were recruited. upon analysis it was found that the prevalence of cardiac an was significantly higher in patients (80.65%) as compared to controls (51.61%) (p=0.016). positive correlation with disease severity was observed with the patient reported questionnaire but not with the objective cardiovascular reflex tests. no significant correlation between grade of an and patient 's age, gender, disease duration or serological status was established. conclusion: at the end of the study, it was concluded that the pathological mechanisms responsible for autonomic dysfunction are more active in ra as compared to others.
osteoporosis	platycodon grandiflorum root-derived saponins (changkil saponins, cks) are reported to have many pharmacological activities. in our latest research, cks was proven to have a significant osteogenic effect. however, the detail molecular mechanism of cks on osteoclastic differentiation has not been fully investigated. administration of cks considerably reduced ovx-induced bone loss, and ameliorated the reduction in plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus observed in ovx mice. cks also repressed the deterioration of bone trabecular microarchitecture. interestingly, platycodin d, the most abundant and major pharmacological constituent of triterpenoid cks, inhibited receptor activator of nf-kappa b ligand (rankl)-induced activation of nf-kappa b, and erk and p38 mapk, ultimately repressing osteoclast differentiation. ovx-induced bone turnover was attenuated by cks, possibly via repression of osteoclast differentiation by platycodin d, the active component of cks. platycodin d can be regarded as an antiosteoporotic candidate for treatment of osteoporosis diseases.

osteoporosis	low bone mass leads to fracture risk. osteoporosis affects over 10% of the population and one of every two women over the age of 50years. genetics predicts more than half of bone mass. diet and weight bearing exercise are two lifestyle choices that can influence the risk of fracture. nutrients are the structural constituents of bone. as bone is a living tissue and turns over, albeit more slowly than other tissues, there is an obligatory loss of minerals daily that must be replaced through diet. three servings of dairy products daily are recommended to replace those losses. alternative sources of nutrients can come from calcium fortified orange juice, plant-based beverages, or tofu to provide many nutrients needed for bone health. supplements can provide nutrients at risk for being inadequate such as calcium or vitamin d.
osteoporosis	this study compares spinal volumetric bone mineral density (vbmd) with spinal areal bone mineral density (abmd) among young adults from 3 eastern provincial capital cities in mainland china. a total of 416 young adults (age range: 20-40 yr) from 3 eastern provincial capital cities (beijing, shanghai, and guangzhou) in mainland china were recruited in this study. from each subject, the vbmd of the lumbar spine was measured by the mindways quantitative computed tomography system. moreover, the abmd of the lumbar spine, measured by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, was extracted from a previous multicenter large-scale study, and the 420 participants were matched by age, gender, height, weight, as well as geographic territory. the vbmd and the abmd values were further compared and analyzed. generally, the bone mineral density (bmd) results were significantly different among participants from the 3 cities (p < 0.05). specifically, both vbmd and abmd values of participants from beijing were significantly different from those from guangzhou (p0.05). interestingly, the overall mean vbmd value was 5.9% greater in women than those in men for all the 3 cities (p < 0.001). this study demonstrated an overall heterogeneity in spinal bmd among young adults from 3 eastern provincial capital cities in mainland china. specifically, the taller and heavier young adults from the northern part of china have smaller spinal vbmd but higher spinal abmd values than those who were shorter and lighter from the southern part of china.
osteoporosis	more than 81% of the studied women had a poor knowledge of different aspects of osteoporosis and its complications, suggesting that more educational programs targeting women in particular are needed to help improve the osteoporosis practice in the societies and reduce the burden of the disease. purpose the family structure has changed considerably in the past decade. but, women from iran and many countries in the region and even families with similar cultural background living in other parts of the world are still responsible for childcare as well as the lifestyle adapted by the family. the present study was conducted to assess the awareness of the female head of household of osteoporosis and its complications. methods as part of a population-based study in two iranian cities, arak and sannandaj, to study osteoporosis and its risk factors, a questionnaire on the knowledge of female head of households of osteoporosis and its complications was completed. the subsample filled out the knowledge survey along with the questionnaire on their demographic data, socioeconomic status (ses), reproductive factors, bone-related lifestyle habits, family and personal medical history, medication use, and compliance with osteoporosis medication (if used) as well as a ffq filled out for all the 2100 participants. they also underwent a bone mineral density (bmd) test, and their serum levels of vitamin d were calculated. these data were then used to assess the factors affecting their awareness level. results the knowledge of 81.3% (473) of the studied women was found to be poor on different aspects of osteoporosis and its complications. multivariate analysis revealed that each level increase in vit d intake tertile increases the chance of higher awareness level in k=total by 1.5 times. each level increase in physical activity tertile was associated with a 30.6% lower chance of having a good knowledge. conclusion considering the poor awareness level of the studied women and their poor practice of bone healthy behavior, one could conclude that more programs are needed or the content/delivery style of the existing ones should be optimized.
osteoporosis	sclerostin antibodies increase bone mass by stimulating bone formation. however, human and animal studies show that bone formation increases transiently and returns to pre-treatment level despite ongoing antibody treatment. to understand its mechanism of action, we studied the time course of bone formation, correlating the rate and extent of accrual of bone mass and strength after sclerostin antibody treatment. ovariectomized (ovx) rats were treated with a sclerostin-antibody (scle-ab) at 20 mg/kg sc once weekly and sacrificed at baseline and 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post-treatment. in scle-ab treated rats, serum pinp and ocn rapidly increased at week 1, peaked around week 3, and returned to ovx control levels by week 6. transcript analyses from the distal femur revealed an early increase in bone formation followed by a sustained decrease in bone resorption genes. lumbar vertebral (lv) osteoblast surface increased 88% by week 2, and bone formation rate (bfr/bs) increased 138% by week 4. both parameters were below ovx control by week 8. bone formation was primarily a result of modeling based formation. endocortical and periosteal bfr/bs peaked around week 4 at 313% and 585% of ovx control, respectively. bfr/bs then declined but remained higher than ovx control on both surfaces through week 8. histomorphometric analyses showed lv-bv/tv did not further increase after week 4, while bmd continued to increase at lv, mid femur (mf), and femoral neck (fn) through week 8. biomechanical tests showed a similar improvement in bone strength through 8 weeks in mf and fn, but bone strength plateaued between weeks 6 and 8 for lv. our data suggest that bone formation with scle-ab treatment is rapid and modeling formation dominated in ovx rats. although transient, the bone formation response persists longer in cortical than trabecular bone.

medicare	study design. cervical decompression (cd) and cervical fusion (cf) patients in 5% medicare part b claims data. objective. evaluate the complication rate and associated risk factors after cervical spine surgery using a national sample of elderly patients. summary of background data. the number of cervical spine procedures in the united states has risen along with associated hospital costs. postoperative complications lead to longer hospitalizations and greater costs. methods. demographic information and postoperative complications (90 days) were evaluated. multivariate cox regression was used to evaluate the risk factors for the complications, while adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, charlson comorbidity index, race, census region, sex, and year of surgery. results. between 2010 and 2012, 1519 cd and 1273 cf medicare patients were identified in the dataset. respiratory complications (cd: 12.1% and cf: 14.6%), urinary retention (cd: 8.2% and cf: 9.1%), acute delirium (cd: 5.3% and cf: 6.0%), and nausea/vomiting (cd: 2.8% and cf: 3.1%) were the most commonly diagnosed complications. all other complications had an incidence of less than 1.5%. older patients had higher risks of respiratory complications for both procedures, and cd patients with charlson scores of 1 to 2 and 5+ were also at higher risk of respiratory complications. males (p < 0.001) were at higher risk of urinary retention. patients with dementia (p < 0.001) had a higher risk of acute delirium after both cd and cf. for cd patients, those aged 85 years and over had higher risk of acute delirium, along with patients with transient ischemic attack/stroke. age was also a significant risk factor (p=0.019) for acute delirium for cf patients. females were at a significantly higher risk of nausea/vomiting after cd and cf. conclusion. these data help to provide baseline information regarding the complication rates in the elderly cd and cf patient population in the united states, and will serve to help minimize these complications.
medicare	objectives: to determine whether bundled payments are feasible in the orthopaedic fracture setting, and the potential economic implications of this reimbursement structure. design: prospective. setting: multicenter. patients/participants: between 2004 and 2014, a total of 23,643 operatively treated patients with fracture and 544,067 patients with total joint arthroplasty (tja) were identified using the new york state statewide planning and research cooperative system database. interventions: severity of illness (soi), hospital charges ($usd), length of stay (los; days), and discharge disposition (homebound vs. not) were collected. main outcome measurements: patients were subdivided into groups of minor and severe soi. differences in hospital charges, los, and discharge disposition were analyzed. differences in charges, los, and discharges were further analyzed based on minor and severe soi. results: the difference in hospital charge between patients with minor or severe soi undergoing elective tja ranged between 153% and 211%. in contrast, patients undergoing fracture surgery exhibited differences ranging from 314% to 489% between minor and severe soi levels. similar differences were observed regarding mean hospital los and homebound discharge disposition, with patients with fracture demonstrating greater sensitivity to increasing soi. conclusions: although bundled payments may be a viable option for patients undergoing elective tja, this payment model requires particular attention when applied to fracture care.
medicare	objective: to identify potential risk factors associated with rehospitalization among medicare recipients with heart failure (hf) receiving telehomecare. materials and methods: this study is a nonexperimental, cross-sectional secondary data analysis of the centers for medicare and medicaid (cms) mandated assessment called the outcome and assessment information set (oasis)-c, provided by a large home care company. a total of 526 patients who received telehomecare from january 1, 2011 to august 31, 2013 were included in the analyses, which used multiple logistic regression. results: the overall rate of rehospitalization was 36% while patients were receiving telehomecare. moderately frail health status (p = 0.01), the presence of severe pain (p = 0.01), the presence of dermatologic problems (p = 0.03), and independence in dressing one 's lower body (compared to slightly dependent [p = 0.01] or mostly dependent patient groups [p = 0.02]) were identified as risk factors for rehospitalization. conclusions: the risk factors identified from this study may be used to drive more effective telehomecare placements, and referrals for additional services among telehomecare patients with hf.
medicare	objective: most prior studies on aggressive end-of-life care in older patients with cancer have accounted for social determinants of health (e.g., race, income, and education), but rarely for multimoribidity (mm). in this study, we examine the association between end-of-life care and each of the social determinants of health and mm, hypothesizing that higher mm is associated with less aggressive care. methods: from the linked 1991-2008 health and retirement study, medicare data, and the national death index, we identified fee-for-service patients age >= 66 years who died from cancer (n = 835). mm was defined as the occurrence or co-occurrence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes. aggressive care was based on claims-derived measures of receipt of cancer-directed treatment in the last two weeks of life; admission to the hospital and/or emergency department (ed) within the last month; and in-hospital death. we also identified patients enrolled in hospice. in multivariable logistic regression models, we analyzed the associations of interest, adjusting for potential confounders. results: while 61.2% of the patients enrolled in hospice, 24.6% underwent cancer-directed treatment; 55.1% were admitted to the hospital and/or ed; and 21.7% died in the hospital. we observed a u-shaped distribution between income and in-hospital death. chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes were associated with some outcomes, but not with others. conclusions: to improve quality end-of-life care and curtail costs incurred by dying patients, relevant interventions need to account for social determinants of health and mm in a nuanced fashion.

medicare	background in the champion (cardiomems heart sensor allows monitoring of pressure to improve outcomes in new york heart association [nyha] functional class iii heart failure patients) trial, heart failure hospitalization (hfh) rates were lower in patients managed with guidance from an implantable pulmonary artery pressure sensor compared with usual care. objectives this study examined the effectiveness of ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring in reducing hfh outside of the clinical trial setting. methods we conducted a retrospective cohort study using u.s. medicare claims data from patients undergoing pulmonary artery pressure sensor implantation between june 1, 2014, and december 31, 2015. rates of hfh during pre-defined periods before and after implantation were compared using the andersen-gill extension to the cox proportional hazards model while accounting for the competing risk of death, ventricular assist device implantation, or cardiac transplantation. comprehensive heart failure (hf)-related costs were compared over the same periods. results among 1,114 patients receiving implants, there were 1,020 hfhs in the 6 months before, compared with 381 hfhs, 139 deaths, and 17 ventricular assist device implantations and/or transplants in the 6 months after implantation (hazard ratio [hr]: 0.55; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.49 to 0.61; p < 0.001). this lower rate of hfh was associated with a 6-month comprehensive hf cost reduction of $7,433 per patient (iqr: $7,000 to $ 7,884), and was robust in analyses restricted to 6-month survivors. similar reductions in hfh and costs were noted in the subset of 480 patients with complete data available for 12 months before and after implantation (hr: 0.66; 95% ci: 0.57 to 0.76; p < 0.001). conclusions as in clinical trials, use of ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring in clinical practice is associated with lower hfh and comprehensive hf costs. these benefits are sustained to 1 year and support the ""real-world"" effectiveness of this approach to hf management.

psoriatic_arthritis	purpose of the review we will address current treatment and unmet needs in psoriatic arthritis (psa), examine existing randomized controlled trials (rcts), and consider options for new trial designs and challenges in their implementation. recent findings while therapeutic options for psa have rapidly increased, there continues to be a need for clinical trials to test new therapies and establish optimal treatment strategies in order to improve the care for patients with psa. in addition, more data is needed on how to select the best therapy for a given patient in clinical practice. consideration of alternative outcome measures is also needed. summary despite the rapid expansion in the number of therapy options available, there is still much to be learned about how to treat the individual patient with psa.
psoriatic_arthritis	in most chronic inflammatory diseases, the cause remains unknown. chronic infection is, however, among the current hypotheses. recent technological advances have allowed in-depth studies of the gut microflora, or microbiota, which contains a vast array of organisms, most of which cannot be cultured. inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with distinctive changes in the gut microbiota, which persist between disease flares and may play a pathogenic role. links have been demonstrated between the gut microbiota and joint inflammation in murine models of arthritis but have received little attention in human patients. recent work has nevertheless demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or spondyloarthritis, with differences across diagnoses and studies. interestingly, some of these alterations resemble those now firmly established in inflammatory bowel disease; examples include decreased microbial diversity and lower frequencies of bacterial groups belonging to the firmicutes phylum known to have immunoregulatory properties. these new findings open up important new horizons both for understanding disease and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies.

psoriatic_arthritis	background: the prevalence and clinical characteristics of psoriatic arthritis (psa) in patients with psoriasis are not well described in asian populations, including koreans. objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of psa by using the classification of psoriatic arthritis (caspar) criteria on the basis of physical examination only, as well as its correlation with psoriasis severity and other medical conditions including nail psoriasis. methods: a single-center, cross-sectional observational cohort study was conducted, and the included patients were evaluated for psa according to the caspar criteria. the psoriasis area severity index (pasi) and the nail psoriasis severity index (napsi) were calculated. results: the prevalence of psa in patients with psoriasis in korea was 13.5%. when performing logistic regression, hyperlipidemia and localized pustular psoriasis were found to be significant predictors of psa. the pasi score was significantly higher in psa patients than in those with psoriasis alone (p=0.014). psoriatic nail involvement was found in 85.5% of the study population, and all psa patients had nail psoriasis. the mean napsi score was higher in patients with psa; however, the difference was not statistically significant. conclusion: there was a close relation between psoriasis severity and psa, although nail psoriasis severity was not related to psa status. dermatologists can diagnose psa from current physical findings by using the caspar criteria. to validate the caspar criteria for psa diagnosis, the definition of nail psoriasis clinical types and severity in the caspar criteria should be reviewed again.
psoriatic_arthritis	background: recent global data show an increasing prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in western countries. objective: the current study analyzed the trend of prevalence rates of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in taiwan and examined biologic prescription patterns by different specialties. methods: data were accessed from the national payer national health insurance research database in taiwan. this study protocol was approved by joint institutional review board established by medical research ethics foundation (no 13-s-001). results: between 2003 and 2013, the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis increased by 41% (from 15.54 to 21.90 per 10,000 population) and 191% (from 0.45 to 1.31 per 10,000 population), respectively, while the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis among patients with psoriatic disease increased from 6.3% to 12.7%. dermatologists are the main caregivers for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; however, data suggest a decreasing trend in the proportion of dermatologists for psoriasis patients from 24.7% between 2003 and 2008 to 10.74% between 2008 and 2013, with a corresponding decrease in dermatologists for psoriatic arthritis patients from 62.30% to 44.65% during the same periods, respectively. in 2013, of the 51,191 patients with psoriasis, only 596 (1.16%) received biologics (73.3% by dermatologists and 25.8% by rheumatologists), while 1120 of the 7470 (14.99%) psoriatic arthritis patients received biologics (72.8% by rheumatologists and 223% by dermatologists). the proportion of biologics use was 1.12% and 7.75% among all patients with only psoriasis and 8.01% and 26.70% among all patients with psoriatic arthritis seen by dermatologists and rheumatologists, respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is increasing in taiwan. the use of biologics in patients with psoriatic arthritis was comparable to that reported in previous studies in the united states and europe; however, the use of biologics remained low in patients with psoriasis in taiwan.

psoriatic_arthritis	apremilast is an orally-active small molecule which inhibits phosphodiesterase-4 (pde4). clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in psoriatic arthritis (psa) and psoriasis. established therapeutic options have variable effectiveness across the different domains of psoriatic disease. whilst biologic therapies have proven to be of significant benefit to many patients, not all patients respond, and others are not eligible or do not tolerate biologic therapy. we review the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and clinical trial data with regards to both efficacy and safety for apremilast and consider where this new treatment may be positioned in the treatment of psa.
addiction	public health research treats intimate partnerships as sites of risk management, including in the management of hiv and hepatitis c transmission. this risk-infused biomedical approach tends to undermine appreciation of the emotional and socially situated meanings of care in intimate partnerships. in this article we explore qualitative interview accounts of the care enacted in partnerships between people who inject drugs, drawing on a 2014 study of 34 couples and 12 individuals living in two locations of australia. a thematic analysis highlights 'best friend relationships', 'doing everything together', 'co-dependency', and 'doing normalcy' as core to narratives of care. as we will argue, the accounts position the care undertaken by couples as at once shaped by day-to-day practices of drug use and by social situation, with the partnership enacting care as a form of social protection, including protection from stigma and other environmental hostilities. the intimacy of doing everything together offers insulation against stigma, yet also reproduces its isolating effects. while the care produced in drug-using partnerships is presented as double-edged, we note how interview accounts are used to deflect the charge that these relationships represent harmful co-dependency. taken together, the interview accounts negotiate a 'counter-care' in relation to normalcy, presenting the intimate partnership between people who use drugs as a legitimate embodiment of care.

addiction	this study aimed to examine the associations of individual trajectories of three types of negative affect (na: anxiety, depression, and anger) and craving during a 44-day period of incentivized smoking abstinence period with cessation outcome at 3 months and at 1 year. adult smokers (n = 140) completed questionnaire assessments of na and craving during pre-quit baseline sessions and 15 postquit sessions over the 45 days of biochemically verified abstinence while on nicotine or placebo patch treatment. growth curve and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations of trajectory parameters of the individual na states and craving with the abstinence outcomes at 3 months and 1 year postquit. greater declines in anxiety, depression, and anger symptoms over the first 44 days of smoking cessation were predictive of higher odds of abstinence at both 3 months and 1 year. moreover, the greater declines in anxiety and anger remained as significant predictors of abstinence at both time points, independent of the predictive ability of the trajectory profiles of craving. the findings suggest that slower dissipation of na, especially anxiety and anger, represents a greater risk for relapse to smoking beyond that predicted by craving during early abstinence. thus, temporal profiles of the affective symptoms convey unique motivational significance in relapse. reduction in na during early abstinence may be a valid target for interventions to increase long-term cessation success rates particularly among individuals with refractory affective symptoms.
addiction	the high rate of relapse to drug use is one of the main problems in the treatment of addiction. stress plays the essential role in drug abuse and relapse; nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms underlying stress and relapse. accordingly, the effects of intra-accumbal administration of sulpiride, as a dopamine d2-like receptor antagonist, on an ineffective morphine dose1food deprivation(fd)-and morphine priming-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference (cpp). about 104 adult male albino wistar rats weighing 200-280 g were bilaterally implanted by cannula into the nucleus accumbens (nac). subcutaneous (sc) injection of morphine (5 mg kg21) was used daily during a 3-day conditioning phase. after a 24-hr "" off"" period following achievement of extinction criterion, rats were tested for fd-and priming-induced reinstatement of morphine cpp by an ineffective (0.5 mg kg21, sc) and priming (1 mg kg21, sc) dose of morphine, respectively. in the next experiments, animals received different doses of intra-accumbal sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mg/ 0.5 ml saline) bilaterally and were subsequently tested for morphine reinstatement. our findings indicated that the 24-hr fd facilitated reinstatement of morphine cpp. furthermore, the d2-like receptor antagonist attenuated the ineffective morphine dose1 fd-and priming-induced reinstatement of morphine cpp dose-dependently. also, contribution of d2-like receptors in mediation of the ineffective morphine dose1 fd-induced reinstatement of cpp was greater than morphine priming-induced reinstatement of cpp. the role of dopaminergic system in morphine reinstatement through a neural pathway in the nac provides the evidence that d2-like receptor antagonist can be useful therapeutic targets for reinstatement of morphine cpp.
addiction	this study was aimed to test the association between perceived stress and problematic social networking site (sns) usage, and to figure out whether psychological resilience moderated this relationship. the perceived stress scale, connor-davidson resilience scale, and facebook intrusion questionnaire were administered to 499 chinese college students. the results showed that (1) perceived stress was positively associated with problematic sns usage; (2) psychological resilience was negatively related with problematic sns usage; and (3) psychological resilience moderated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic sns usage. specifically, the relationship between perceived stress and problematic sns usage was statistically significant for students with a lower level of psychological resilience, while no significant association was found for those with a higher level of psychological resilience. the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing psychological resilience to decrease the likelihood of college students who experience higher level of stress from using sns problematically.

addiction	studying brain abnormalities in behavioral addiction including gd enables us to exclude possible confounding effects of exposure to neurotoxic substances, which should provide important insight that can lead to a better understanding of addiction per se. there have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for gd, although the results have been inconsistent. on the other hand, gd was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. we aimed to examine the heterogeneity of gd by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. thirty-six male gd patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. the gd patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. while both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion gd showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. our study suggests that the heterogeneity of gd is underpinned at the brain structural level. this result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for gd.

atopic_dermatitis	purpose: atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic eczematous dermatitis that has a high prevalence and diverse clinical features. although several hypotheses about its multifactorial pathogenesis have been suggested, the cause is not yet fully understood. a better understanding of the clinical features may helpful inelucidating the pathogenesis of ad. methods: this retrospective study analyzed the questionnaires, medical charts, and laboratory examination results of 5,000 patients diagnosed with ad at a.single tertiary hospital in korea. results: the demographics, allergic comorbidities, family history, severity, and treatment experiences of the patients were analyzed. most of the patients were adults, 76.3% of whom were classified as havingan extrinsic type of ad. the mean eczema area and severity index (easi) score was found to be 13.68, and adult patients were found to have higher severity than the other age groups. the anatomical involvements were different among the age groups, with more involvements of the head and neck in adults. the patients reported seasonal changes and stress as the factors that aggravated their symptoms the most. topical steroids and oral cyclosporine were the most used medications at our clinic, whereas 10.1% of the patients underwent allergen -specific immunotherapy. conclusions: this analysis of 5,000 patients would lead to a better understanding of various subtypes and diverse clinical features of ad in koreans. distinct characteristics were observed among different age groups; thus, treatment strategies may need to be differentiated accordingly.
atopic_dermatitis	atopic dermatitis (ad) is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that is usually seen in childhood, but can onset or persist into adulthood. the characteristic distribution and morphology based on age, chronic relapsing course, and pruritus comprise the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of ad. however, the numerous morphologies ranging from acute, weeping erythematous papules to chronic lichenified plaques, can be simulated by multiple other conditions, including inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and photo-dermatoses. recognition of the distinguishing features and clinical mimickers of atopic dermatitis is vital for an accurate and timely diagnosis, and initiation of proper treatment regimens.
atopic_dermatitis	the majority of research in the staphylococcus field has been dedicated to the understanding of staphylococcus aureus infections. in contrast, there is limited information on infections by coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) and how the host responds to them. s. epidermidis, a member of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, is an important commensal organism of the human skin and mucous membranes; and there is emerging evidence of its benefit for human health in fighting off harmful microorganisms. however, s. epidermidis can cause opportunistic infections, which include particularly biofilm-associated infections on indwelling medical devices. these often can disseminate into the bloodstream; and in fact, s. epidermidis is the most frequent cause of nosocomial sepsis. the increasing use of medical implants and the dramatic shift in the patient demographic population in recent years have contributed significantly to the rise of s. epidermidis infections. furthermore, treatment has been complicated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. today, s. epidermidis is a major nosocomial pathogen posing significant medical and economic burdens. in this review, we present the current understanding of mechanisms of host defense against the prototypical cons species s. epidermidis as a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, and during biofilm-associated infection and sepsis.
atopic_dermatitis	background: genetic differences in the target proteins, metabolizing enzymes and transporters that contribute to inter-individual differences in drug response are not integrated in contemporary drug development programs. ayurveda, that has propelled many drug discovery programs albeit for the search of new chemical entities incorporates inter-individual variability ""prakriti"" in development and administration of drug in an individualized manner. prakriti of an individual largely determines responsiveness to external environment including drugs as well as susceptibility to diseases. prakriti has also been shown to have molecular and genomic correlates. we highlight how integration of prakriti concepts can augment the efficiency of drug discovery and development programs through a unique initiative of ayurgenomics trisutra consortium. methods: five aspects that have been carried out are (1) analysis of variability in fda approved pharmacogenomics genes/snps in exomes of 72 healthy individuals including predominant prakriti types and matched controls from a north indian indo-european cohort (2) establishment of a consortium network and development of five genetically homogeneous cohorts from diverse ethnic and geo-climatic background (3) identification of parameters and development of uniform standard protocols for objective assessment of prakriti types (4) development of protocols for prakriti evaluation and its application in more than 7500 individuals in the five cohorts (5) development of data and sample repository and integrative omits pipelines for identification of genomic correlates. results: highlight of the study are (1) exome sequencing revealed significant differences between prakriti types in 28 snps of 11 fda approved genes of pharmacogenomics relevance viz. cyp2c19, cyp2b6, esr1, f2, pgr, hla-b, eila-dqa1, hla-drb1, ldlr, cftr, cps1. these variations are polymorphic in diverse indian and world populations included in 1000 genomes project. (2) based on the phenotypic attributes of prakriti we identified anthropometry for anatomical features, biophysical parameters for skin types, hrv for autonomic function tests, spirometry for vital capacity and gustometry for taste thresholds as objective parameters. (3) comparison of prakriti phenotypes across different ethnic, age and gender groups led to identification of invariant features as well as some that require weighted considerations across the cohorts. conclusion: considering the molecular and genomics differences underlying prakriti and relevance in disease pharmacogenomics studies, this novel integrative platform would help in identification of differently susceptible and drug responsive population. additionally, integrated analysis of phenomic and genomic variations would not only allow identification of clinical and genomic markers of prakriti for application in personalized medicine but also its integration in drug discovery and development programs.

atopic_dermatitis	over the past decade, a vast array of nanomaterials has been created through the development of nanotechnology. with the increasing application of these nanomaterials in various fields, such as foods, cosmetics, and medicines, there has been concern about their safety, that is, nanotoxicity. therefore, there is an urgent need to collect information about the biological effects of nanomaterials so that we can exploit their potential benefits and design safer nanomaterials, while avoiding nanotoxicity as a result of inhalation or skin exposure. in particular, the immunomodulating effect of nanomaterials is one of most interesting aspects of nanotoxicity. however, the immunomodulating effects of nanomaterials through skin exposure have not been adequately discussed compared with the effects of inhalation exposure, because skin penetration by nanomaterials is thought to be extremely low under normal conditions. on the other hand, the immunomodulatory effects of nanomaterials via skin may cause severe problems for people with impaired skin barrier function, because some nanomaterials could penetrate the deep layers of their allergic or damaged skin. in addition, some studies, including ours, have shown that nanomaterials could exhibit significant immunomodulating effects even if they do not penetrate the skin. in this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the allergic responses induced by nanomaterials upon skin exposure. first, we discuss nanomaterial penetration of the intact or impaired skin barrier. next, we describe the immunomodulating effects of nanomaterials, focusing on the sensitization potential of nanomaterials and the effects of co-exposure of nanomaterials with substances such as chemical sensitizers or allergens, on the onset of allergy, following skin exposure. finally, we discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the immunomodulating effects of nanomaterials by describing the involvement of the protein corona in the interaction of nanomaterials with biological components and by presenting recent data about the adjuvant effects of well-characterized particle adjuvant, aluminum salt, as an example of immunomodulatory particulate.
digestive_health	gastrointestinal health in regard to the gut microbiome is a rapidly emerging field and has many key components driving its emergence. fibre, prebiotics and probiotics are all dietary components that can play a critical role in maintaining a healthy gut microflora. fibre has long been appreciated for its influential role in cardiovascular disease, glycaemic control and weight management through various physiological mechanisms. prebiotics have been shown to play an influential role in irritable bowel symptoms/disease, colon cancer, cardiovascular disease and overall digestive health. together, various types of fibres and prebiotics have been targeted and synthesised to influence the gut microbiome, specifically lactobacillus and bifidobacterium populations. lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium spp. are common markers for gut health because they have been shown to down-regulate inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, alleviate irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, stimulate immune functions, aid in mineral absorption and produce little, if any, gas or known carcinogenic substances. probiotics have also been shown to display many of these pro-health components, and include many species of bacteria outside of the commonly utilised lactobacillus and bifidobacterium populations. how these dietary components are defined in the scientific and political arenas will play a critical role in the success of the gut health field moving forward. key changes in administrative definitions and requirements of these dietary components will influence consumption, awareness and understanding of these key influential components. the purpose of this review is to provide current accepted definitions for fibre, prebiotics and probiotics, as well as introduce key scientific studies describing the health benefits of these components, as well as current health claims.
digestive_health	the integrity of oral and digestive mucosa depend on many salivary components like the epidermal growth factor (egf). sometimes indicative, sometimes stimulated or modulated factor of oral and digestive health, egf appears as a clinical marker in neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. as cellular growth factor, it protects the digestive mucosa with stimulation of mucus production and with inhibition of gastric secretion. equally implicated in healing process, it enhances this one, and determines, in patients, more or less sensibility to inflammatory damages. its strategic place in various pathologies, as stomach ulcer and tumoral process, open research prospects with a real potential of repair and pronostic.

digestive_health	cereal-based foods are key components of the diet and they dominate most food-based dietary recommendations in order to achieve targets for intake of carbohydrate, protein and dietary fibre. processing (milling) of grains to produce refined grain products removes key nutrients and phytochemicals from the flour and although in some countries nutrients may be replaced with mandatory fortification, overall this refinement reduces their potential nutritional quality. there is increasing evidence from both observational and intervention studies that increased intake of less-refined, whole-grain (wg) foods has positive health benefits. the highest wg consumers are consistently shown to have lower risk of developing cvd, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. wg consumers may also have better digestive health and are likely to have lower bmi and gain less weight over time. the bulk of the evidence for the benefits of wg comes from observational studies, but evidence of benefit in intervention studies and potential mechanisms of action is increasing. overall this evidence supports the promotion of wg foods over refined grain foods in the diet, but this would require adoption of standard definitions of 'whole grain' and 'whole-grain foods' which will enable innovation by food manufacturers, provide clarity for the consumer and encourage the implementation of food-based dietary recommendations and public health strategies.
digestive_health	the effect of dietary inclusion of white lupin seed (wls) on the milk composition and yield of rabbit does as well as the performance of their litters was studied. two lactation diets having identical digestible protein (dp): de ratio and two weaning diets having identical dp: de ratio were formulated. the first lactation diet (sl) contained soybean meal (sbm; 13.0%) and sunflower meal (5.0%) as the main cp sources, whereas the second lactation diet (ll) was based on wls (25.0%). as a result, the ll diet had a greater ether extract (ee) content than did the sl diet. the first weaning diet (sw) included sbm (7.0%) as the main cp source, whereas the second weaning diet (lw) diet was based on wls (12.0%). no additional fat was added to any of the diets. a total of 32 (16 per treatment) hyplus ps 19 does (4,225 +/- 607 g bw, at the second parturition) were fed 1 of the 2 lactation diets. the litters were standardized to 9 kits (564 +/- 81 g bw) on the day of birth and were fed 1 of the 2 weaning diets from d 17 to 69 of age. at d 30 of age (weaning), 66 rabbits on each weaning diet (689 +/- 71 g bw; 3 per cage) were used to evaluate performance. feed intake and doe bw were not affected by the dietary treatments. milk yield tended to be higher between d 1 and 30 of lactation in does fed the ll diet (p = 0.094), a finding that is related to the higher dietary ee content and intake in the ll diet. when expressed per kilogram of metabolic weight, milk output (p < 0.05) and fat output (p < 0.05) were greater in these does. improved g:f (p < 0.05) between d 1 and 21 of lactation and greater adg (p = 0.072) and milk efficiency (p < 0.05) of litters was observed in does fed the ll diet. the milk of does fed the ll diet contained less linoleic acid (p < 0.05) and arachidonic acid (c 20:4n-6; p < 0.05) and more oleic acid (p < 0.05), alpha-linolenic acid (p < 0.05), and eicosapentaenic acid (p < 0.05), with a corresponding increase in the total pufa n-3: c 20:4n-6 ratio (p < 0.05). the performance of fattening rabbits was not affected by dietary treatment. the number of ill plus dead rabbits caused by digestive disease was lower (p < 0.05) in rabbits fed the lw diet. therefore, wls is a suitable dietary cp source for lactating does that can replace traditionally used cp sources without adverse effects on feed intake and milk yield or on the growth and viability of their litters. due to its fatty acid (fa) composition, the use of wls in the lactation diet has the potential to improve the milk fa composition of does.
digestive_health	in the present study, the results of a measurement campaign aiming to assess cancer risk among two special groups of population: policemen and laboratory technicians exposed to the toxic substances, benzene and formaldehyde are presented. the exposure is compared to general population risk. the results show that policemen working outdoor (traffic regulation, patrol on foot or in vehicles, etc.) are exposed at a significantly higher benzene concentration (3-5 times) than the general population, while the exposure to carbonyls is in general lower. the laboratory technicians appear to be highly exposed to formaldehyde while no significant variation of benzene exposure in comparison to the general population is recorded. the assessment revealed that laboratory technicians and policemen run a 20% and 1% higher cancer risk respectively compared to the general population. indoor working place air quality is more significant in assessing cancer risk in these two categories of professionals, due to the higher inhalation unit risk (iur) of formaldehyde compared to benzene. since the origin of the danger to laboratory technicians is clear (use of chemicals necessary for the experiments), in policemen the presence of carbonyls in indoor air concentrations due to smoking or used materials constitute a danger equal to the exposure to traffic originated air pollutants.
healthy_sleep	objectives: to describe sleep duration and sleep characteristics, and to examine the associations between sleep duration and characteristics and body weight status, diet quality, and physical activity levels among grade 5 children in nova scotia. methods: a provincially representative sample of 5,560 grade 5 children and their parents in nova scotia was surveyed. parents were asked to report their child 's bedtime and wake-up time, and to indicate how often their child snored or felt sleepy during the day. dietary intake and physical activity were self-reported by children using the harvard youth/adolescent food frequency questionnaire and the physical activity questionnaire for children respectively. body weight status was determined using measured heights and weights. linear and logistic random effects models with children nested within schools were used to test for associations. results: approximately half of the surveyed parents reported that their children were not getting adequate sleep at night. longer sleep duration was statistically significantly associated with decreased risk for overweight and obesity independent of other sleep characteristics (or = 0.82, 95% ci: 0.73, 0.91). longer sleep duration was also associated with better diet quality and higher levels of physical activity. conclusions: these findings indicate a need for health promotion strategies to encourage adequate sleep and to promote healthy sleep environments among children. given the links among sleep, body weight status and lifestyle behaviours, these messages should be included in public health interventions aimed at preventing obesity and promoting health among children.
healthy_sleep	objectives: current recommendations for healthy sleep in school-aged children are predominantly focused on optimal sleep duration (9-11 h). however, given the importance of routine for circadian health, the stability of sleep/wake schedules may also be important, especially for daytime behavioral functioning. we examined the relationship between short sleep duration, sleep schedule instability and behavioral difficulties in a community sample of australian children. methods: children, aged 5-10 years (n = 1622), without chronic health or psychological conditions, were recruited from primary schools in adelaide, south australia. a parent-report questionnaire was used to assess sleep/wake behavior. behavioral functioning was assessed using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire. results: most children met sleep duration recommendations with approximately 5% reporting12 h. weekly variability of bed and rise times >1 h were reported in up to 50% of children. multinomial regression analysis revealed sleep duration60 min, and bed and rise time variability >60 min significantly increased the risk of scoring in the 95th percentile for behavioral subscales. conclusions: inconsistent sleep schedules were common and, similar to short sleep duration, were associated with behavioral difficulties. considering the lack of study in this area, further research is needed for the development of new recommendations, education and sleep health messages.

healthy_sleep	under normal sleep-wake conditions, noradrenaline (na) secretions in supine subjects exhibit a weak circadian variation with a peak that occurs around noon; the sleep span is characterized by reduced na secretion. some investigators have reported that the circadian na rhythm is completely obliterated during sleep deprivation. in our laboratory, plasma na was assayed every hour for 24 h in nine healthy men 20-23 years of age. all men were deprived of sleep and were required to eat and walk around every hour to prevent sleep. however, subjects remained supine for 20 min before blood samples were collected to eliminate the effect of activity. persistence of a slight decrease in the night concentration in several subjects, despite sleep deprivation, suggests that na secretion may be influenced by a biological clock whose activity becomes visible when the influence of posture is removed.
healthy_sleep	study objectives: work-family conflict is a threat to healthy sleep behaviors among employees. this study aimed to examine how work-to-family conflict (demands from work that interfere with one 's family/personal life; wtfc) and family-to-work conflict (demands from family/personal life that interfere with work; ftwc) are associated with several dimensions of sleep among information technology workers. methods: employees at a u.s. it firm (n = 799) provided self-reports of sleep sufficiency (feeling rested upon waking), sleep quality, and sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (waking up in the middle of the night or early morning) in the last month. they also provided a week of actigraphy for nighttime sleep duration, napping, sleep timing, and a novel sleep inconsistency measure. analyses adjusted for work conditions (job demands, decision authority, schedule control, and family-supportive supervisor behavior), and household and sociodemographic characteristics. results: employees who experienced higher wtfc reported less sleep sufficiency, poorer sleep quality, and more insomnia symptoms. higher wtfc also predicted shorter nighttime sleep duration, greater likelihood of napping, and longer nap duration. furthermore, higher wtfc was linked to greater inconsistency of nighttime sleep duration and sleep clock times, whereas higher ftwc was associated with more rigidity of sleep timing mostly driven by wake time. conclusions: results highlight the unique associations of wtfc/ftwc with employee sleep independent of other work conditions and household and sociodemographic characteristics. our novel methodological approach demonstrates differential associations of wtfc and ftwc with inconsistency of sleep timing. given the strong associations between wtfc and poor sleep, future research should focus on reducing wtfc.
healthy_sleep	objective: to test whether subjects spontaneously signal sleepiness before falling asleep under monotonous conditions. methods: twenty-eight healthy students were deprived of sleep for one night and then underwent a ""maintenance-of-wakefulness test"" (mwt) consisting of four 40-min trials. they were told to give a signal as soon as they felt sleepy and to try to stay awake as long as possible. in a first series of tests, the subjects were given no reward (nr); in a second series, monetary rewards (wr) were given both for an accurate perception of sleepiness and for staying awake longer. results: seventeen of the 28 subjects (60.7%) did not signal sleepiness before a sleep fragment occurred in at least one of the four mwt trials. women were more reliably aware of sleepiness than men in the nr trials (p = .02), while the men 's performance improved in the wr trials (p < .02), becoming equivalent to the women 's performance. conclusions: our results cast doubt on the general assumption that one cannot fall asleep without feeling sleepy first. if similar results can be obtained in monotonous driving or working situations, this will imply that accidents caused by sleepiness or by falling asleep cannot necessarily be attributed to an individual 's negligence.

anxiety	studies on the diurnal sleep-wake rhythm of patients with lung cancer have mostly examined patients cross-sectionally, whereas the effects of lung cancer treatment over time have rarely been considered. through long-term longitudinal tracking of patients with lung cancer, this study examined changes in their sleep-wake rhythm, sleep quality, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and quality of life (qol) at various treatment stages. in addition, factors affecting their qol were explored. hierarchical linear modeling was adopted to analyze a convenience sample of 82 patients with lung cancer. the changes in their sleep-wake rhythm, sleep, mood (anxiety, depressive symptoms and fatigue) and qol were observed at five time points: prior to treatment and at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48 after the start of the treatment. the effects of sex, age, cancer stage, treatment type, comorbidities and time were controlled to determine the predictors of patients' qol. the results showed that patients' sleep-wake rhythms were poor before treatments. compared with baseline, the sleep-wake rhythms of the patients significantly improved at week 48, and anxiety significantly improved at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48. by contrast, their fatigue became exacerbated at weeks 8 and 48. moreover, qol improved significantly from week 6 until the end of the treatment period. qol was negatively affected by poor sleep quality (beta = -0.69, p = 0.00) and depressive symptoms (beta = -2.59, p < 0.001) and positively affected by regular sleep-wake rhythms (beta = 0.23, p = 0.001). therefore, clinical health-care professionals should focus more attention to the fatigue levels of patients with lung cancer before, during and after treatment. health-care professionals may also need to provide such patients with health education regarding sleep hygiene and with emotional support to assist them in maintaining regular sleep-wake rhythms in order to improve their qol.
anxiety	objective: psychiatric symptoms of varying degrees that accompany hyperemesis gravidarum (hg) may continue throughout the pregnancy or after, and these psychological problems may cause morbidity. in this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the hg and psychiatric symptoms in the first trimester and postpartum depression. methods: two hundred and seven pregnant who were diagnosed as hg and 177 healthy pregnant women included in this prospective study. all cases were assessed with scl-90-r in first trimester and with ed in postpartum period. factors related to postpartum psychiatric symptoms were investigated with bivariate logistic regression analysis. results: scl-90-r and ed scores were statistically significant at hg group (p<0.05). in cases who diagnosed as postpartum depression, the rates of hg and scl-90-r results were higher (p<0.05). in the bivariate analysis, the high rates of hg and high scl-90-r scores were determined to be related to postpartum depression (p<0.05). conclusions: the results show that mental health is negatively affected by hg at pregnancy, and in this case, psychiatric symptoms may continue even after discontinuation hg.
anxiety	backgroundtemporal discounting refers to the tendency for rewards to lose value as the expected delay to receipt increases. individuals with anorexia nervosa (an) have been found to show reduced temporal discounting rates, indicating a greater preference for delayed rewards compared to healthy peers. obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) and social anxiety disorder (sad) commonly co-occur with an, and anxiety has been related to development and prognosis of an. we examined whether reduced temporal discounting is present across these potentially related disorders, and explored the relationship between temporal discounting and anxiety transdiagnostically. methodsone hundred ninety six individuals (75 healthy controls (hc); 50 ocd; 27 an; 44 sad) completed two temporal discounting tasks in which they chose between smaller-sooner and larger-later monetary rewards. two measures of discountingdiscount rate and discount factorwere compared between diagnostic groups, and associations with anxious traits were examined. resultsindividuals with an showed decreased temporal discounting compared to hc. ocd and sad groups did not differ significantly from hc. across the sample, anxiety was associated with decreased discounting; more anxious individuals showed a greater preference for delayed reward. conclusionswe replicated the findings that individuals with an show an increased preference for delayed reward relative to hc and that individuals with ocd do not differ from hc. we also showed that individuals with sad do not differ from hc in discounting. across this large sample, two measures of anxious temperament were associated with temporal discounting. these data raise new questions about the relationship between this dimensional trait and psychopathology.
anxiety	erectile dysfunction (ed) and premature ejaculation (pe) are two forms of male sexual disorder with both psychological and physical features. while their cognitive, attentional, and affective components have been investigated separately, there is a lack of knowledge about the role played by cognitive attentional syndrome in their onset and maintenance. the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible contribution of perseverative thinking styles and thought control strategies to the development and maintenance of ed and pe. the authors hypothesized that such modes of processing might constitute a cognitive attentional syndrome specific to these disorders and sustained by particular metacognitive beliefs. a semistructured interview was administered to 11 participants with ed and 10 with pe in order to assess their metacognitive beliefs and cognitive attentional processes. the results suggest that individuals with ed and pe adopt a range of cognitive attentional strategies aimed at improving their sexual performance, and endorse both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs about these thinking responses. overall, their cognitive and attentional patterns worsened negative internal states, reduced sexual excitement, detached them from their bodily sensations, and hindered sexual functioning. these preliminary findings suggest that perseverative thinking, thought control strategies, and metacognitive beliefs may play a key role in the onset and maintenance of male sexual dysfunction.
anxiety	this study attempted to examine the validity of the italian version of the career factors inventory (cfi), a psychometric tool widely used in the assessment of cognitive and personal-emotional dimensions of career indecision, among a sample of 2,060 italian students attending high school and university. recurring to both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the original four-factor structure was confirmed and returned, in line with the literature, satisfactory reliability indices; moreover, cfi subscales showed intercorrelations consistent with previous studies, albeit lower in some cases. subsequently, convergent validity between the four cfi subscales and other scales via zero-order correlation was tested, confirming previous evidence except for need for career information. in conclusion, consistent with previous studies, the italian version of the cfi showed to be a valid and reliable instrument for the evaluation of dimensions of career indecision.
psoriasis	psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated skin disease. antagonists of tnf-alpha and, recently, il-17 have proven to be highly effective in the treatment for psoriasis; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis are poorly understood. recently, we presented evidence that i kappa b zeta is a key regulator in the development of psoriasis through its role in mediating il-17a-driven effects. like il-17a, il-17f is produced by a variety of immune cells, and the expression of il-17f is increased in psoriatic skin. the purpose of this study was to characterize the role of il-17f in the regulation of i kappa b zeta expression and to investigate whether il-17f regulates psoriasis-associated genes in human keratinocytes through i kappa b zeta. here, we demonstrate that il-17f stimulation induces i kappa b zeta expression at both the mrna and the protein levels in normal human keratinocytes. moreover, silencing i kappa b zeta by sirna revealed that i kappa b zeta is a key regulator of specific il-17f-inducible psoriasis-associated genes and proteins, including defb4/hbd2, s100a7, ccl20, il-8 and chi3l1. in addition, il-17f-induced i kappa b zeta expression is mediated by a mechanism involving the p38 mapk and nf-kappa b signalling pathways, as shown by the clear reduction in il-17f-mediated expression of i kappa b zeta during chemical inhibition of these two signalling pathways. in summary, we present i kappa b zeta as a novel key regulator of il-17f-driven effects in psoriasis. thus, antagonists to i kappa b zeta could potentially provide a more targeted approach for treating psoriasis as well as for treating the other inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases for which il-17-targeting drugs have recently been approved.
psoriasis	background: psoriasis is associated with numerous comorbidities, often reported in terms of relative risk. both doctors and the general population tend to overestimate the effects of exposures when presented in relative terms, leading to anxiety and potentially poor treatment decisions. absolute risks might provide a better basis for risk assessment. objective: to characterize and compare relative and absolute risks of comorbidities in patients with psoriasis. methods: a systematic review using medline identified comorbidities associated with psoriasis, their relative risks, and information for calculating absolute risks. results: the comorbidities associated with psoriasis with the highest relative risk were nonmelanoma skin cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, with relative risks of 7.5, 6.12, and 3.61, respectively; the attributable risk for these 3 conditions were 0.64, 0.05, and 0.17 per 1000 person-years, respectively. to attribute 1 event of these conditions to psoriasis would require seeing 1551; 20,135; and 5823 patients, respectively. limitations: database studies might not fully account for confounders, resulting in overestimates of the risk impact of comorbidities. conclusions: presenting attributable risk in the form of the number needed to harm provides a clearer picture of the magnitude of risk and a basis for wiser medical decision making and patient education.
psoriasis	psoriasis is resistant to treatment and it shows frequent relapse; systemic treatment is often associated with toxicities, and long-term safety data are lacking for most of the newer drugs like biologics. moreover, some body areas such as hands, feet, intertriginous areas, scalp, and nails are even more resistant. frequently, systemic treatments are necessary considering the higher psychological impact on the patient. there is a lack of agreement on the best therapeutic modalities in the management of psoriasis involving difficult-to-treat locations. at present, there are no indian guidelines for these conditions. available literature has been reviewed extensively on the treatment of psoriasis involving difficult-to-treat locations; level of evidence has been evaluated as per the oxford centre for evidence-based medicine 2011 guideline, and therapeutic suggestions have been developed. best care has been employed to consider socioeconomic, cultural, genetic, and ethnic factors to prepare a therapeutic suggestion that is appropriate and logical to be used among indian population and people of similar ethnic and socioeconomic background.
psoriasis	overweight is a proposed risk factor for psoriasis. how-ever, evidence from prospective studies is limited. the aim of this study was to investigate the association be-tween overweight, weight gain and risk of psoriasis, and potential synergism with smoking, within a population-based cohort including 8,752 individuals followed from 1994 up to 2008. there was a 32% increased odds of psoriasis from a body mass index (bmi) of 27 kg/m(2), in multi-variable logistic regression analysis, further increasing to 43% at bmi 28 kg/m(2), and to 71% at bmi >= 30 kg/m(2) in non-smokers. there was a dose-response association between weight gain from age 25 years, with up to 90% higher odds of psoriasis from middle age, independent of weight category. there was no indication of a synergism between overweight and smoking, and no interaction with sex. overweight and weight gain represent modifiable risk factors that may be targets for primary prevention of psoriasis.
psoriasis	objective: psoriasis has been considered as systemic disorder. lipocalin-2 might be a link between psoriasis and its comorbidities. aim of the study was to investigate the associations between serum lipocalin-2 levels and the disease activity, markers of inflammation or metabolic disturbances and changes after topical treatment in psoriatic patients. methods: thirty-seven individuals with active plaque-type psoriasis and 15 healthy controls were recruited. blood samples were collected before and after 14 days of therapy. serum lipocalin-2 concentrations were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the results were correlated with psoriasis area and severity index (pasi), body mass index (bmi), inflammatory and biochemical markers, lipid profile and with effectiveness of topical treatment. results: lipocalin-2 serum levels were significantly increased in psoriatic patients in comparison to the controls (p=0.023). no significant correlations with indicators of inflammation, nor bmi or pasi were noted. a statistical association between lipocalin-2 and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was shown. after topical treatment serum lipocalin-2 level did not significantly change (p=0.9), still remaining higher than in the controls, despite clinical improvement. conclusions: lipocalin-2 might be a marker of psoriasis and convey cardiovascular or metabolic risk in psoriatic patients, but may not be a reliable indicator of inflammation, severity of psoriasis nor efficacy of antipsoriatic treatment.
ankylosing_spondylitis	involvement of tendons and tendon sheaths is frequently found in the most common inflammatory systemic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. in rheumatoid arthritis tendon manifestations occur as tenosynovitis, with swelling and pain of the tendons mainly on the hands and feet. in spondyloarthritis the involvement of tendons presents as enthesitis with pain and swelling directly at the attachment points of tendons to the bony structures and more commonly in the lower extremities. pathological alterations of tendons can be normally visualized by sonography and only sometimes with magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or scintigraphy. furthermore, it is important for diagnostics and effective therapy to detect all joints involved by means of clinical, sonographic and radiological examination as well as laboratory parameters of inflammation, antibody serology (e.g. anti-ccp antibodies) and hla-b27. the histopathological alterations of tendinopathy in rheumatic diseases differ from degenerative/posttraumatic tendinopathy in their expression of the changes; however, a clear differentiation of the different rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases is histopathologically not possible. therapeutically, systemic medication is the most important part of treatment in rheumatic diseases. local therapeutic measures can be employed in the treatment of tenosynovitis and enthesitis. in the case of failure or lack of efficacy of the medication and conservative therapy, tenosynovectomy is performed for persistent tenosynovitis and reconstructive surgical procedures are necessary for tendon ruptures.
ankylosing_spondylitis	functional limitation is often complained by patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as). with a rising number of patients suffering from as, there are a limited number of reports focusing on functional limitation of as in chinese patients. this study was conducted to investigate the level of functional limitation and explore its associations with demographic, disease-related factors. a total of 303 as outpatients were recruited in this cross-sectional study from a tertiary general hospital in southwest china. functional limitation was measured by the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (basfi). other data were collected by the following questionnaires: the bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai), the bath ankylosing spondylitis patient global score (bas-g), and the pittsburgh sleep quality index questionnaire (psqi). finally, 295 outpatients with as completed this survey. the median basfi was 0.80. worse function limitation was found in outpatients with extra-spinal manifestation, older age, lower household income, more back pain, higher disease activity and morning stiffness, poorer sleep, and worse patient 's well-being (all p < 0.05). multivariate regression analysis indicated that patient 's well-being (p < 0.001), disease activity (p < 0.001), and disease duration (p < 0.05) were the positive predictors of functional limitation. as outpatients in southwest china had a mild level of functional limitation. the factors associated with functional limitation included disease duration, disease activity, and patients' well-being, which should be taken into consideration when assessing functional limitation of as outpatients. besides, more comprehensive and targeted interventions should be conducted for as patients as early as possible, which will be effective to improve functional outcome.
ankylosing_spondylitis	the aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of power doppler ultrasound (pdus) abnormalities at entheseal sites in patients with early psoriatic arthritis (psa) na < ve to traditional and biologic dmards and to compare the pdus findings with clinical examination. psa patients with early disease and na < ve to traditional and biologic dmards were consecutively enrolled in this study. patients underwent pdus examination of the following bilateral entheseal sites: common extensor tendon at its insertion at the lateral humeral epicondyle; quadriceps tendon at its insertion at the superior pole of the patella; patellar tendon at its insertion at the tibial tuberosity; medial collateral ligament at its proximal insertion and achilles tendon at its insertion at the calcaneus. the leeds enthesitis index (lei) was used to assess clinical entheseal involvement. twenty-one early psa patients completed the clinical and pdus examinations. clinical entheseal involvement was found in 9 (42.9 %) and pdus abnormalities in 20 (95.5 %) of the 21 early psa patients. achilles tendon insertion was the site with the major entheseal abnormalities. active (power doppler positive) entheseal lesions were found in 4.7, 9.5, 14.3 and 14.3 % of patients at the lateral humeral epicondyle; quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon insertions, and achilles tendon insertions, respectively. concordance between clinical (lei) and pdus was poor. the present study confirms that pdus allows detecting structural and inflammatory abnormalities of enthesis in early psa patients. our study shows that, in early disease, active abnormalities seem to have a low prevalence.
ankylosing_spondylitis	a new three-dimensional (3-d) zn-based metal-organic framework with the formula of [zn-2(l)(bpy)](ci) (1, h3l = 2,6-dihydroxypyridine-4-carboxylate, bpy = 4,4'-bipyridine), has been synthesized under hydrothermal condition. x-ray diffraction analyse reveals that compound 1 exhibits the unique 3-d two-fold interpenetrated coordination framework with 3,4-connected fsx-3,4-c2 network topology, in which the l ligand adopts the mu(3)-bridging fashion. in addition, the experimental results of anti-inflammatory activity showed that compared with organic ligands h3l and bpy, the title compound 1 exerted rather potent activity.
ankylosing_spondylitis	objective. to determine the reproducibility of evaluation of sacroiliac joint (sij) radiographs among readers with varying levels of experience, and to identify potential drivers of disagreement in classification among 5 predefined radiographic lesion types. methods. the study sample consisted of 104 consecutive patients aged 18-40 with low back pain >= 3 months of duration who met the assessment of spondyloarthritis international society (asas) definition for a positive sij magnetic resonance image, or were hla-b27-positive and had >= 1 spondyloarthritis (spa)-related clinical/laboratory feature according to the asas classification criteria for axial spa. seven blinded readers (2 musculoskeletal radiologists, 5 rheumatologists) classified pelvic radiographs according to the modified new york criteria (mny) and recorded presence/absence of 5 lesion types in both sij: erosion, sclerosis, ankylosis, joint space widening, and joint space narrowing. reproducibility of mny classification among 21 reader pairs was assessed and potential drivers of disagreement were identified among 5 lesion types. a generalized linear mixed logistic regression model served to analyze to what extent discordance in lesion type was associated with discrepant mny classification. results. mean kappa values (percent concordance) were 0.39 (84.1%) for mny classification over 21 reader pairs, 0.46 (79.8%) between 2 musculoskeletal radiologists, and 0.55 (86.5%) and 0.36 (77.9%) between the most experienced rheumatologist and the 2 radiologists. erosion showed the lowest agreement (25%) among patients with discordant classification and gave the highest or of 13.5 for disagreement. conclusion. reproducibility of radiographic sij classification in an spa inception cohort was only fair to at best moderate among 7 readers with varying levels of experience, questioning the applicability of mny in early spa.
children's_health	regulated school days entail less free-living physical activity (pa) and outdoor stay, which may jeopardize the opportunities for cohesive moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (mvpa) and, by extension, children 's health. the role of outdoor stay during school time for pupils' free-living pa vs. physical education (pe) and indoor stay was studied during one academic year in 196 pupils aged 7-14 years at four schools in mid-southern sweden during five consecutive days each in september, march, and may. actigraph gt3x+ activity monitors were used. predictors for pa during school stay were expressed as mean daily accelerometer counts and were measured per season, day, grade, gender, weather, and time outdoors. overall, free-living pa outdoors generated the highest mean accelerometer counts for moderate and vigorous pa. outdoor pa and pe, representing 23.7% of the total school time contributed to 50.4% of total mean accelerometer counts, and were the greatest contributors to moderate and vigorous pa. age and weather impacted pa, with less pa in inclement weather and among older pupils. more time outdoors, at all seasons, would favorably increase school children 's chances of reaching recommended levels of pa.
children's_health	objectives/hypothesis: to determine whether parent-perceived hearing problems are associated with grade repetition among children in the united states. study design: retrospective cohort analysis of a contemporary national database. methods: the national survey of children 's health 2011 to 2012 was analyzed. hearing loss, as perceived and reported by parents, was categorized as: no hearing problem, history of a hearing problem, or current hearing problem. children never repeating a grade versus repeating one or more grades (kindergarten-high school) were identified. univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyzed the association of hearing problems with grade repetition. patients with mental retardation, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were excluded from the analysis. after adjusting for race, sex, and poverty level, odds ratios for grade repetition were computed. results: among 66.1 million (average age, 8.3 years, 49.0% male) children, 97.3% never had a hearing problem, 1.7% had a history of a hearing problem, and 1.0% had a current hearing problem. overall, 7.1% repeated a grade. grade repetition was reported in 6.9% of children without a hearing problem versus 9.4% with a history of a hearing problem and 19.3% with a current hearing problem (p < 0.001). after adjustment for race, poverty level, and sex, a history of a hearing problem demonstrated an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval 0.82-4.13) for grade repetition, whereas a current hearing problem demonstrated an odds ratio of 3.0 (1.90-4.80). conclusion: parents' perception of children 's hearing problems is strongly associated with grade repetition. this trend is noticed in elementary school more than in high school.
children's_health	objectives: to examine parent report of flourishing in children with hearing impairments compared to children without hearing impairments, and to explore whether school engagement and bullying related to child flourishing. methods: participants were 655 children with hearing impairments and 44, 618 children without hearing impairments who were 10-17 years of age. caregivers completed telephone interviews about their child 's functioning for the national survey of children 's health. results: children without hearing loss had higher parent-reported flourishing compared to children with hearing loss when controlling for child demographics (i.e., race, age, sex). school engagement was positively related to flourishing of children with hearing loss. bullying behaviors were not related to flourishing of children with hearing loss. conclusion: improving school engagement may increase flourishing of children with hearing loss, which is critical given that children with hearing loss experience lower flourishing than children without hearing loss. examining the relationships among other risk and resilience factors and flourishing for children with hearing loss will provide information for interventions to enhance the adaptation of these children.

children's_health	document beliefs about the contribution of physical activity to preschool-aged children 's health held by latino mothers in farmworker families, and delineate their perceived barriers or constraints that impose limits on preschool-aged children 's physical activity. qualitative data obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews (n = 33) with mothers of preschool-aged children living in latino farmworker families in north carolina. mothers universally agree that regular vigorous physical activity is good for preschool-aged children 's health, including obesity prevention. however, excessive physical activity can produce illnesses, as well as other physical and emotional problems, and should be limited. mothers wanted their children to engage in more sedentary forms of activity because they believed it would benefit learning. physical and chemical hazards in rural environments, distance to parks and play spaces, and lack of familiarity and concerns about neighbors constrained children 's physical activity. although physical activity is believed to be beneficial, strong cultural beliefs and real contextual barriers undermine preschool-aged latino farmworker children 's level of physical activity.
children's_health	di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (dehp) is one of the most widely used phthalates. metabolites of dehp are detectable in majority of the population. findings on adverse health outcomes, particularly birth weight in association with prenatal exposure to dehp remain equivocal. besides, there is insufficient evidence to address influence on metabolic function from epidemiological studies. thus, our objective was to investigate cord blood adipokine levels and birth size in association with prenatal dehp exposure in prospective birth cohort study. mono-2-methylhexyl phthalate (mehp), primary metabolite of dehp was determined as exposure by using maternal blood sample of 3rd trimester. leptin and adiponectin levels in cord blood were measured as markers of metabolic function. birth weight and length were obtained from birth record. association between maternal mehp levels and cord blood adiponectin and leptin levels, birth weight and ponderal index (pi) were examined for 167 mother-child pairs who had both mehp and cord blood adipokine measurements. the median mehp level was 8.81 ng/ml and the detection rate was 100%. there was no sex difference in mehp levels. both leptin and adiponectin levels were higher in girls than in boys. mehp level was positively associated with adiponectin level among boys and was negatively associated with leptin level among girls. mehp level were negatively associated with pi only in girls and this could be due to decreased leptin level. this study suggested that prenatal dehp exposure may be associated with cord blood adipokine and birth size. the influence potentially be sex-specific and could be more significant in girls.

stress_management	purpose: the purpose of this study was to gather baseline data on the health-promoting lifestyle practices of rns working in six major health care and educational institutions in a southeast pennsylvania community. methods: a descriptive correlational study design was used. the 52-item health-promoting lifestyle profile ii instrument was used to explore participants' self-reported health-promoting behaviors and measure the dimensions of health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth, and stress management. results: findings revealed that physical activity and stress management scores were low for the entire group of rns. there were statistically significant differences between nurses 50 years of age and older and those 30 to 39 years of age for the subscales of health responsibility, nutrition, and stress management, suggesting that older nurses are more concerned about their health. there were also statistically significant differences between nurses 50 years of age and older and those 29 years of age and younger for the subscale of health responsibility. sixty-seven percent of participants reported having too many competing priorities and had significantly lower subscale scores for spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management, as well as significantly lower total scores. conclusion: this study 's findings provided baseline data that will be useful in planning health-promoting lifestyle interventions for participants specific to their institutions, and may help guide future research and educational initiatives related to numerous issues common to the rn workforce. the failure of many nurses to take adequate care of themselves needs to be better understood and addressed, by both individual nurses and their employers.
stress_management	the development of supervisors' behaviours has been proposed as an innovative approach for the reduction of employees' work stress. the uk health and safety executive (hse) developed the ""stress management competency indicator tool"" (smcit), designed to be used within a learning and development intervention. however, its psychometric properties have never been evaluated, and the length of the questionnaire (66 items) limits its practical applicability. we developed a brief 36-item version of the questionnaire, assessed its psychometric properties and studied the relationship with the employees' psychosocial work environment. 353 employees filled in the brief smcit and the ""stress management indicator tool"". the latter is a self-report questionnaire developed by the uk hse, measuring workers' perceptions of seven dimensions of the psychosocial work environment that if not properly managed can lead to harm. data were analysed with structural equation modelling and multiple regressions. the results confirmed the factorial structure of the brief smcit questionnaire and mainly supported the convergent validity and internal consistency of the scales. furthermore, with few exceptions, the relations hypothesized between supervisors' competencies and the psychosocial work environment were confirmed, supporting the criterion validity of the revised questionnaire and the uk hse framework. we conclude that the brief 36-item version of the smcit represents an important step toward the development of interventions directed at supervisors and we discuss the practical implications for work stress prevention.
stress_management	introduction: occupational stress is a major factor in hindering the performance of nurses and midwives and developing physical and mental complications in them. given that these two groups are in direct contact with patients more than other medical staff and stress management training can be effective in the reduction of occupational stress among the nurses and midwives. aim: this study was set out to compare the effect of a precede-proceed based stress management training program on the occupational stress of the nurses and midwives. materials and methods: this quasi-experimental study was conducted on the aforementioned nurses and midwives. data collection instruments included the nursing stress scale (nss). the training program was held in two 4-hour-long sessions for three months from 1st january to 31st march 2013. results: the results showed a significant increase in the precede scores of both groups by the end of the program, as compared to the baseline. a significant decrease was also observed in the stress scores of both groups. there was no difference between groups in these regards. conclusion: the precede-based stress management training is effective in the reduction of occupational stress among the nurses and midwives.
stress_management	research on the efficacy of yoga for improving mental, emotional, physical, and behavioral health characteristics in school settings is a recent but growing field of inquiry. this systematic review of research on school-based yoga interventions published in peer-reviewed journals offers a bibliometric analysis that identified 47 publications. the studies from these publications have been conducted primarily in the united states (n = 30) and india (n = 15) since 2005, with the majority of studies (n = 41) conducted from 2010 onward. about half of the publications were of studies at elementary schools; most (85%) were conducted within the school curriculum, and most (62%) also implemented a formal school-based yoga program. there was a high degree of variability in yoga intervention characteristics, including overall duration, and the number and duration of sessions. most of these published research trials are preliminary in nature, with numerous study design limitations, including limited sample sizes (median = 74; range = 20-660) and relatively weak research designs (57% randomized controlled trials, 19% uncontrolled trials), as would be expected in an infant research field. nevertheless, these publications suggest that yoga in the school setting is a viable and potentially efficacious strategy for improving child and adolescent health and therefore worthy of continued research.
stress_management	employees with low levels of work-related self-efficacy may stand to benefit more from a worksite stress management training (smt) intervention. however, this low work-related self-efficacy/enhanced smt benefits effect may be conditional on employees also having high levels of intrinsic work motivation. in the present study, we examined this proposition by testing three-way, or higher order, interaction effects. one hundred and fifty-three u.k. government employees were randomly assigned to a smt intervention group (n = 68), or to a waiting list control group (n = 85). the smt group received three half-day training sessions spread over two and a half months. findings indicated that there were significant overall reductions in psychological strain, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in the smt group, in comparison to the control group. furthermore, there were significant higher order group (smt vs. control) x time 1 work-related self-efficacy x time 1 intrinsic work motivation interactions, such that reductions in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization at certain time points were experienced only by those who had low baseline levels of work-related self-efficacy and high baseline levels of intrinsic work motivation. implications for work-related self-efficacy theory and research and smt research and practice are discussed.
hiv_aids	changes in retrovirus acquisition/transmission behaviors have been reported in brazil, with a concerning increase in hiv-1-infected individuals aged 15-39 years. in sao paulo, hiv-1/htlv-1 and hiv-1/htlv-2 coinfections have been associated with intravenous drug use and failure to detect htlv-1/2 (human t cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2) with immunosuppression and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). negative results for htlv serologic [western blotting (wb)] and molecular [real-time pcr pol (qpcr)] confirmatory assays have been reported, whereas the best sensitivity has been found for inno-lia (lia). in this study, we expand our previous data by analyzing a group of young patients (n = 1,383; median age 35.6 years) who recently acquired hiv by sexual contact, the majority of whom were haart naive, and comparing the performances of four htlv confirmatory assays: lia, wb, qpcr, and pcr-rflp (tax). we confirmed htlv infection in 58 (4.2%) blood samples: 29 htlv-1, 24 htlv-2, 1 htlv-1+htlv-2, and 4 htlv. lia, wb, qpcr, and pcr-rflp sensitivities were 94.8%, 82.8%, 79.2%, and 74.5%, respectively. associations of htlv infection with female gender (or = 2.28, 1.31-4.00) and age >40 years (p < .0001) were detected. the results confirm the low sensitivities of molecular assays and the best performance of lia in detecting htlv-1/2 in such patients. we hypothesize that the negative pcr results are due to the presence of defective provirus and/or low proviral load circulating in such patients, with inconclusive wb coinciding with the seroconversion period. corroborating the associations obtained, repeated exposure is required for htlv sexual transmission/acquisition, which is more efficient from male to female.
hiv_aids	purpose of reviewmore point-of-care (poc) diagnostic tests are becoming available for hiv diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited settings. these novel technologies have the potential to foster decentralized hiv care and treatment for the benefit of clinical laboratories, hiv clinics, and hiv-infected patients. there continue to be many business, technological, and operational challenges that limit product development and regulatory approval, which limits products available for the required operational and cost-effectiveness studies and delays policy adoption and implementation.recent findingsalthough the rapid hiv diagnostic test has been widely successful, the pathways for poc cd4(+) cell count and hiv viral load assay analyzers have been more challenging. we describe significant hurdles for product development, approval, and implementation, which include the business case, technical development, clinical impact, and integrating laboratory and clinical networks.summarythe objective of this review is to highlight the obstacles for developing and implementing appropriate strategies for poc hiv testing assays to improve the clinical services for hiv-infected patients in resource-limited settings.
hiv_aids	hiv-positive kenyan men who have sex with men (msm) are a highly stigmatized group facing barriers to care engagement and antiretroviral therapy (art) adherence. because care providers' views are important in improving outcomes, we sought the perspective of those serving msm patients on how to optimize art adherence in a setting where same-sex behavior is criminalized. we conducted 4 focus group discussions with a total of 29 healthcare workers (hcws) experienced in providing hiv care to msm. the semistructured, open-ended topic guide used was based on an access-information-motivation-proximal cues model of adherence, with added focus on trust in providers, stigma, and discrimination. detailed facilitator notes and transcripts were translated into english and reviewed for common themes. the hcw identified adherence challenges of msm patients that are similar to those of the general population, including hiv-related stigma and lack of disclosure. in addition, hcws noted challenges specific to msm, such as lack of access to msm-friendly health services, economic and social challenges due to stigma, difficult relationships with care providers, and discrimination at the clinic and in the community. hcws recommended clinic staff sensitivity training, use of trained msm peer navigators, and stigma reduction in the community as interventions that might improve adherence and health outcomes for msm. despite noting msm-specific barriers, hcws recommended strategies for improving hiv care for msm in rights-constrained settings that merit future research attention. most likely, multilevel interventions incorporating both individual and structural factors will be necessary.
hiv_aids	purpose: the purpose of this study is to estimate the population size of men who have sex with men (msm) in kazakhstan and their hiv testing history. methods: we conducted structured interviews with msm in four geographically disparate cities-n=400 (n = 100/city)-to implement four population estimation methods and ascertain hiv testing history. results: approximately 3.2% of men-corresponding to similar to 154,000 individuals-in kazakhstan aged 18-59 are msm. the 49.9% of the sample who reported taking an hiv test far exceeds the <1% reported as msm in surveillance data. conclusion: hiv testing surveillance in kazakhstan has underestimated the number of msm. this underscores the need to redress social and structural barriers to hiv testing and disclosure of sexual behavior experienced by msm in kazakhstan. recommendations include promoting cultural sensitivity among testing staff through quality assurance and regular training, and increasing protection and public awareness through antidiscrimination policy development.
hiv_aids	caring for hiv/aids patients and/or drug users requires health care workers (hcws) to have good knowledge of the issues. cultural differences in hcws, combined with professional ethics and personal beliefs, could also result in conflicting attitudes, leading to difficulties related to looking after people affected by hiv/aids or drug users. a cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the attitude towards hiv/aids patients and/or drug users in a sample of workers operating in a large university hospital in southern italy. a total of 736 workers were surveyed from may to november 2016. during the periodic occupational health surveillance, a questionnaire was administered about attitudes of discrimination, acceptance and fear towards these patients. respondents showed average levels of acceptance to hiv/aids and drug user patients. as years of experience and professional training increased, scores for discrimination, acceptance of hiv/aids, acceptance of drug users and fear decreased. factors positively influencing levels of attitudes were being female and younger. supplementary education is needed to strengthen the awareness of hcws.
migraine	background and purpose spreading depolarizations (sds) may contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah). we tested whether sd-inhibitor valproate reduces brain injury in an sah rat model with and without experimental sd induction. methods rats were randomized in a 2x2 design and pretreated with valproate (200 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 weeks. sah was induced by endovascular puncture of the right internal carotid bifurcation. one day post-sah, brain tissue damage was measured with t-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, followed by cortical application of 1 mol/l kcl (to induce sds) or nacl (no sds). magnetic resonance imaging was repeated on day 3 followed by histology to confirm neuronal death. neurological function was measured with an inclined slope test. results in the groups with kcl application, lesion growth between days 1 and 3 was 5773 mm3 in the valproate-treated versus 237 +/- 232 mm3 in the vehicle-treated group. in the groups without sd induction, lesion growth in the valproate- and vehicle-treated groups was 8 +/- 20 mm3 versus 27 +/- 52 mm3. on fitting a 2-way analysis of variance model, we found a significant interaction effect between treatment and kcl/nacl application of 161 mm3 (p=0.04). number and duration of sds, mortality, and neurological function were not statistically significantly different between groups. lesion growth on magnetic resonance imaging correlated to histological infarct volume (spearman 's rho =0.83; p=0.0004), with areas of lesion growth exhibiting reduced neuronal death compared with primary lesions. conclusions in our rat sah model, valproate treatment significantly reduced brain lesion growth after kcl application. future studies are needed to confirm that this protective effect is based on sd inhibition.
migraine	background: patients with medication-overuse headache suffer not only from chronic headache, but often from psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. the mechanisms underlying these comorbidities are unclear, but the amygdala is likely to be involved in their pathogenesis. to investigate the mechanisms underlying the comorbidities we used elevated plus maze and open field tests to assess anxiety-like behavior in rats chronically treated with analgesics. we measured the electrical properties of neurons in the amygdala, and examined the cortical spreading depression (csd)-evoked expression of fos in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (tnc) and amygdala of rats chronically treated with analgesics. csd, an analog of aura, evokes fos expression in the tnc of rodents suggesting trigeminal nociception, considered to be a model of migraine. results: increased anxiety-like behavior was seen both in elevated plus maze and open field tests in a model of medication overuse produced in male rats by chronic treatment with aspirin or acetaminophen. the time spent in the open arms of the maze by aspirin-or acetaminophen-treated rats (53 +/- 36.1 and 37 +/- 29.5 s, respectively) was significantly shorter than that spent by saline-treated vehicle control rats (138 +/- 22.6 s, p < 0.001). chronic treatment with the analgesics increased the excitability of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala as indicated by their more negative threshold for action potential generation (-54.6 +/- 5.01 mv for aspirin-treated, -55.2 +/- 0.97 mv for acetaminophen-treated, and -31.50 +/- 5.34 mv for saline-treated rats, p < 0.001). chronic treatment with analgesics increased the csd-evoked expression of fos in the tnc and amygdala [18 +/- 10.2 fos-immunoreactive (ir) neurons per slide in the amygdala of rats treated with aspirin, 11 +/- 5.4 ir neurons per slide in rats treated with acetaminophen, and 4 +/- 3.7 ir neurons per slide in saline-treated control rats, p < 0.001]. conclusions: chronic treatment with analgesics can increase the excitability of neurons in the amygdala, which could underlie the anxiety seen in patients with medication-overuse headache.
migraine	intervention strategies in familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) patients and other high-risk colorectal cancer (crc) populations have highlighted a critical need for endoscopy combined with safe and effective preventive agents. we performed transcriptome profiling of colorectal adenomas from fap patients and the polyposis in rat colon (pirc) preclinical model, and prioritized molecular targets for prevention studies in vivo. at clinically relevant doses in the pirc model, the drug clotam (tolfenamic acid, ta) was highly effective at suppressing tumorigenesis both in the colon and in the small intestine, when administered alone or in combination with sulindac. cell proliferation in the colonic crypts was reduced significantly by ta, coincident with increased cleaved caspase-3 and decreased survivin, beta-catenin, cyclin d1 and matrix metalloproteinase 7. from the list of differentially expressed genes prioritized by transcriptome profiling, mmp7, s100a9, nppb and aldh1a3 were defined as key oncogene candidates downregulated in colon tumors after ta treatment. monthly colonoscopies revealed the rapid onset of tumor suppression by ta in the pirc model, and the temporal changes in mmp7, s100a9, nppb and aldh1a3, highlighting their value as potential early biomarkers for prevention in the clinical setting. we conclude that ta, an ""old drug"" repurposed from migraine, offers an exciting new therapeutic avenue in fap and other high-risk crc patient populations.
migraine	background: while studies have demonstrated the economic burden of migraines in terms of quality of life, health care resource use (hru), and costs, there exists a notable paucity of data comparing such outcomes among migraineurs with nausea and vomiting (n/v) and those without. the current study aimed to address this gap. methods: this was a retrospective study using data from the 2013 us national health and wellness survey, a cross-sectional, internet-based survey. respondents self-reported their migraine with or without n/v along with demographics and outcomes including depression (patient health questionnaire total score; phq-9), sleep problems (11-item total score of sleep problems), hru (number of physician visits, emergency room [er] visits, and hospitalizations) and work productivity and activity impairment-general health scale (wpai-gh), and associated mean annual costs. generalized linear models, adjusting for covariates, assessed the burden of n/v on all outcomes. results: among all migraineurs (n=7,855), 73.4% were female, mean age was 41.82 years old, and 57.6% reported experiencing n/v. adjusting for covariates, migraineurs with n/v vs without n/v had higher mean phq-9 scores (7.91 vs 7.02, p<0.001) and mean sleep problems (3.29 vs 2.64, p<0.001). mean er visits were more frequent among migraineurs with n/v than those without n/v (0.48 vs 0.38, p=0.001). this difference translated into a 26.3% increase in estimated mean er costs (n/v=us$ 1,499 vs without n/v=us$ 1,187, p=0.002). mean percentage activity impairment was higher in migraineurs with n/v than in those without n/v (37.73% vs 35.12%, p=0.002) and migraineurs with n/v had higher work productivity loss costs (n/v=us$ 10,344 vs without n/v=us$ 9,218, p=0.016). conclusion: migraine patients with n/v reported worse depression, sleep problems, and activity impairment, and higher er visits than those without n/v. migraine with n/v was also associated with an increase in mean annual er visit costs and work productivity loss costs. study findings suggest unmet needs with current treatment options for migraine patients with n/v.
migraine	background: calcitonin gene-related peptide provokes migraine attacks in 65% of patients with migraine without aura. whether aggregation of migraine in first-degree relatives (family load) or a high number of risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms contributes to migraine susceptibility to calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion in migraine patients is unknown. we hypothesized that genetic enrichment plays a role in triggering of migraine and, therefore, migraine without aura patients with high family load would report more migraine attacks after calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion than patients with low family load. methods: we allocated 40 previously genotyped migraine without aura patients to receive intravenous infusion of 1.5 mu g/min calcitonin gene-related peptide and recorded migraine attacks including headache characteristics and associated symptoms. information of familial aggregation was obtained by telephone interview of first-degree relatives using a validated semi-structured questionnaire. results: calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion induced a migraine-like attack in 75% (12 out of 16) of patients with high family load compared to 52% (12 out of 23) with low family load (p = 0.150). in addition, we found that the migraine response after calcitonin gene-related peptide was not associated with specific or a high number of risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms of migraine without aura. conclusion: we found no statistical association between familial aggregation of migraine and hypersensitivity to calcitonin gene-related peptide infusion in migraine without aura patients. we also demonstrated that the currently known single nucleotide polymorphisms conferring risk of migraine without aura have no additive effect on calcitonin gene-related peptide induced migraine-like attacks.
osteoarthritis	background: in 2002, moseley et al published a randomized controlled trial (rct) that showed no difference between knee arthroscopy and placebo for patients with osteoarthritis (oa). we wanted to assess the impact of the trial on clinical practice in the united states. purpose/hypothesis: to evaluate changes in knee arthroscopy practice before and after publication of the article by moseley et al and to assess the effect of this landmark rct on the behavior of practicing orthopaedic surgeons. we hypothesized that after publication of the moseley trial, the overall frequency of knee arthroscopy would decrease, that the mean age of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy would decrease, and that the proportion of arthroscopies for a diagnosis of oa would decrease. study design: descriptive epidemiology study. methods: the state ambulatory surgery database was used to analyze cases from 1998 to 2006, which were classified as meniscus tear, oa, or oa with meniscus tear. changes in age, surgery rates, and case classification were evaluated before and after moseley 's trial using student t tests and analysis of variance. results: after publication of the trial, the number of knee arthroscopies per year increased from 155,057 in 1998 to 172,317 in 2006 (p <= .001). mean patient age increased from 47.6 to 49.2 years (p < .001). meniscus tears increased from 69.1% to 70.8%, representing approximately 15,500 additional cases per year. oa decreased from 10.6% to 7.2%, representing approximately 4000 fewer cases per year. oa with meniscus tear increased from 20.3% to 22.0%, representing approximately 6400 additional cases per year. conclusion: while overall age and rates of knee arthroscopy increased contrary to our hypothesis, we identified a decrease in rates of knee arthroscopy for oa after publication of the moseley trial, demonstrating that well-publicized rcts can influence patterns of clinical practice.
osteoarthritis	background: several new rehabilitation modalities have been proposed after anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction. among these, trigger point dry needling (trp-dn) might be useful in the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome associated with acl reconstruction to reduce pain intensity, increase knee flexion range and modify the mechanical properties of the quadriceps muscle during late-stage rehabilitation. to date, this is the first randomized clinical trial to support the use of trp-dn in the early rehabilitation process after acl reconstruction. the aim of this study was to determine the pain intensity, range of motion (rom), stability, and functionality improvements by adding quadriceps vastus medialis trp-dn to the rehabilitation protocol (rh) provided to subacute acl reconstructed patients. methods: this randomized, single-blinded, clinical trial (nct02699411) included 44 subacute patients with surgical reconstruction of complete acl rupture. the patients were randomized into 2 intervention groups: rh (n=22) or rh+ trp-dn (n=22). pain intensity, rom, stability, and functionality were measured at baseline (a(0)) and immediately (a(1)), 24 hours (a(2)), 1 week (a(3)), and 5 weeks (a(4)) after the first treatment. results: comparing statistically significant differences (p.05). conclusion: quadriceps vastus medialis trp-dn in conjunction with a rehabilitation protocol in subacute patients with surgical reconstruction of complete acl rupture increases rom (short-term) and functionality (short-to mid-term). although there was an increase in pain intensity with the addition of trp-dn, this was not detected beyond immediately after the first treatment. furthermore, stability does not seem to be modified after trp-dn.
osteoarthritis	background: previous studies have reported varying return-to-sport protocols after knee cartilage restoration procedures. purpose: to (1) evaluate the time for return to sport in athletes with an isolated chondral injury who underwent an accelerated return-to-sport protocol after osteochondral autograft plug transfer (oat) and (2) evaluate clinical outcomes to assess for any consequences from the accelerated return to sport. study design: case series; level of evidence, 4. methods: an institutional cohort of 152 oat procedures was reviewed, of which 20 competitive athletes met inclusion and exclusion criteria. all patients underwent a physician-directed accelerated rehabilitation program after their procedure. return to sport was determined for all athletes. clinical outcomes were assessed using international knee documentation committee (ikdc) and tegner scores as well as assessment of level of participation on return to sport. results: return-to-sport data were available for all 20 athletes; 13 of 20 athletes (65%) were available for clinical evaluation at a mean 4.4-year follow-up. the mean time for return to sport for all 20 athletes was 82.9 25 days (range, 38-134 days). all athletes were able to return to sport at their previous level and reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their surgical outcome and ability to return to sport. the mean postoperative ikdc score was 84.5 +/- 9.5. the mean tegner score prior to injury was 8.9 +/- 1.7; it was 7.7 +/- 1.9 at final follow-up. conclusion: competitive athletes with traumatic chondral defects treated with oat managed using this protocol had reduced time to preinjury activity levels compared with what is currently reported, with excellent clinical outcomes and no serious long-term sequelae.

osteoarthritis	osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease caused by excessive death of chondrocytes and loss of the extracellular matrix (ecm) in articular cartilage. we previously reported that reactive oxygen species (ros) generated by the nadph oxidase (nox) isoform nox-2 are involved in chondrocyte death induced by interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta). in this study, we investigate the role of nox-2 in the production and degradation of ecm by chondrocytes. although il-1 beta lowered the mrna expression of type ii collagen (col2a1) and aggrecan (acan) in mouse chondrocyte-like atdc5 cells, rna silencing of nox2 did not change the mrna expression of these major components of the ecm of cartilage. hence, nox-2 is not involved in the il-1 beta-induced suppression of ecm production. on the other hand, the nox inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (aebsf), the ros scavenger n-acetylcysteine and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for nox2 prevented the loss of proteoglycan induced by il-1 beta in highly differentiated atdc5 cells. furthermore, aebsf did not affect the expression of hyaluronidase-1 and -2, whereas it suppressed hyaluronidase activity in culture medium. il-1 beta-induced intra- and extracellular acidification was also suppressed by aebsf, as was the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for nox2. since hyaluronidase activity is known to be higher under acidic conditions, nox-2 probably contributes to ecm loss by the activation of hyaluronidase through acidification.
hereditary_angioedema	factor xii is a mysterious plasma protein without a clear physiologic function. it was identified as a clotting factor, but has no clear role in hemostasis. however, fxii also contributes to the production of bradykinin, a short-lived inflammatory peptide. a growing body of mechanistic research from animal models indicates that fxii contributes to thrombotic disease by triggering excessive coagulation. fxii is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that this molecule does have a physiologic function. this leads to intriguing questions: what does fxii really do? is it even a real clotting factor at all? before the groundbreaking discovery of a role for fxii in thrombotic disease, many studies investigated the biochemical properties of fxii and its activators. in this review, we highlight several biochemical studies that reveal much about the natural behavior of fxii. on the basis of these findings, it is possible to draft a conceptual model to explain how fxii reacts to surface materials. we then discuss how this model applies to the activities of fxii in its natural environment. there are two tentative physiologic functions of fxii that can operate exclusively: (i) maintenance of thrombus stability; (ii) local regulation of vascular permeability. either, or both, of these natural functions may explain the evolutionary development and maintenance of fxii.

hereditary_angioedema	plasma kallikrein (pk), a serine protease in the trypsin clan (sa), plays critical roles in many physiological and pathological pathways. regulating the abnormal activity of pk has been successfully used in the clinical therapy of hereditary angioedema. in this study, the serine protease domain of murine plasma kallikrein (mpk) was expressed in the pichia pastoris system. the recombinant protein was a glycosylated active enzyme after purification by the cation exchange and size-exclusion chromatography, and was crystallized at the precipitant condition of 25% peg 3350, 0.1 m tris-hcl ph 8.5 and 0.1 m nacl. the crystal structure of mpk was determined at 2.6 angstrom. this is the first published crystal structure of mpk, showing some distinctive features at s2' and s3' pockets when compared to its human analogue (human plasma kallikrein, hpk). in addition, mpk show unique structural features in the non-conservative 67-72 and 76-81 loops when compared to other serine proteases. these results provide insights for the design of potent and selective pk inhibitors.
hereditary_angioedema	the association of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (hht) and type i hereditary angioedema is a very rare condition in medicine. the case reported by muller et al., describes the coexistence of the two diseases and emphasizes the need for listing hht patients for liver transplantation in case indications occurs, such as the presence of hcc, abnormally increased cardiac output, and gastrointestinal bleeding as reported for this case. the case described by mueller et al. is anecdotal for the usefulness of liver transplantation in hht patients and shows that liver transplantation may be the best supportive care and, sometimes, the unique and final therapeutic option for these patients.
hereditary_angioedema	angioedema is a rare condition which manifests as sudden localised, non-pitting swelling of certain body parts including skin and mucous membranes. it is vital that anaesthesiologists understand this condition, as it may present suddenly in the perioperative period with airway compromise. to identify literature for this review, the authors searched the pubmed, medline, embase, scopus and web of science databases for english language articles covering a 10-year period, 2006 through 2016. angioedema can be either mast-cell mediated or bradykinin-induced. older therapies for histaminergic symptoms are well known to anaesthesiologists (e.g., adrenaline, anti-histamines and steroids), whereas older therapies for bradykinin-induced symptoms include plasma and attenuated androgens. new classes of drugs for bradykinin-induced symptoms are now available, including anti-bradykinin, plasma kallikrein inhibitor and c1 esterase inhibitors. these can be used prophylactically or as rescue medications. anaesthesiologists are in a unique position to coordinate perioperative care for this complex group of patients.
kidney_health	chronic kidney diseases are a social and economic problem, and diet has long been recognized as a fundamental modulator of kidney health in human and experimental models. age-dependent alterations in mitochondrial function play a crucial role in the development of diseases of aging, and mitochondrial disorders have been observed in experimental models of kidney failure. recently, the beneficial dietary effect of a specific mixture of essential amino acids (eaa) has been studied in elderly subjects, but no data were collected from the kidney. the aim of this study was to assess whether daily supplementation of the diet with eaa at the beginning of senescence could preserve renal health. we used middle-aged (18-month-old) male wistar rats fed a standard diet and water ad libitum (m-aged group) or a diet with added eaa (1.5 g/kg per day) dissolved in drinking water for 3 months (m-aged+eaa group). young (2-month-old) rats fed a standard diet for 3 months were used as controls. mitochondrial morphology and markers for collagen, cyt-c-oxidase, hsp60, grp75, enos, inos, bax, bcl2 and vegf were analyzed in glomeruli and tubules. eaa supplementation limited fibrosis and increased the capillary tuft area in the glomeruli of m-aged rats. vegf and enos were enhanced in glomeruli and the peritubular space with the eaa-supplemented diet. mitochondrial cyt-c oxidase, bcl2, and chaperones increased in the distal tubules of the eaa group to levels similar to those observed in the young group. mitochondrial area and density after eaa intake did not differ from young groups. the results suggest that prolonged eaa intake could represent a strategy for maintaining the healthy status of the kidney in m-aged animals.
kidney_health	although it affects <1% of the us population, stage 4 chronic kidney disease (ckd) has increased in prevalence in the united states, grown 67% between the early 1990s and the first part of this decade. it is important to consider new strategies to slow or halt this increase. a frameshift in patient care delivery is underway in kidney health care in the united states with a medicare education benefit for patients with stage 4 ckd. this medicare benefit is a unique program that has the potential to inform patients and families about ckd and prepare them for transitions in health states and kidney health care. for the greatest value of this benefit to be realized, it is critical for the health care community to accurately gauge patient understanding of ckd and provide curricula that are comprehensible and actionable for patients. this type of benefit is patient centered, yet it will succeed only with a willingness to review its effectiveness and revise it if needed. am j kidney dis. 57(3):381-386.

kidney_health	aboriginal canadian patients with end-stage kidney disease receive disproportionately fewer transplants than non-aboriginal patients. the reasons for this are poorly understood and likely to be complex. this qualitative study employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with canadian kidney health professionals (n = 23) from programs across canada to explore their perspective on this disparity. individual-level factors were the most commonly reported barriers to aboriginal patients accessing transplants-most notable of which was patients' remote living location. understanding the role of 'place' as a barrier to accessing care and the lived experiences of aboriginal patients emerged as key research priorities.

kidney_health	study 1: a study was conducted to determine the effects of geriatric foods utilizing 40 healthy geriatric cats (>= 12 years, initially 4.6 kg). cats were fed a control food during a 30-day pre-feeding period, blocked by age, gender, and body fat percentage, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 foods (a = experimental geriatric food, b = lams active maturity, c = royal canin mature 28, and d = purina one senior protection formula) for the 90-day testing period. chemistry screens and microalbuminuria were evaluated at day 30 and day 90 along with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) scan at day 90. cats fed all foods maintained weight and body fat content throughout the study. at day 90, cats fed food d had reduced (p < 0.01) bone mineral content. cats fed food a and c had reduced (p < 0.03) lean. cats fed food a tended to have a lower percentage of cats with renal damage (p < 0.08) compared with cats fed food b. for vital organ measures, cats fed food a had lower (p0.15). however, cats fed food h weighed less and had less fat (p < 0.03) compared with cats fed food e. cats fed food f also had less fat (p0.35). by combining the data from both studies and plotting increasing lysine:calorie ratio versus lean loss for each corresponding ratio, a strong linear relationship could be detected with the line representing 75% (r-2 = 0.75) of the variation in lean loss. a moderate linear relationship was detected as bone mineral content decreased with increasing crude protein concentration (r-2 = 0.24). these studies suggest that feeding a food with reduced protein/phosphorus and higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as antioxidants improved markers of kidney function compared with other commercial formulas. additionally, increasing the lysine:calorie ratio prevented the loss of lean body mass in the geriatric cat and provided a similar response to high protein foods.
kidney_health	backgroundknowledge about kidney disease among the general population is poor but has not been assessed in the population selected for referral to nephrology care. aimthis study aimed to determine patients' understanding of chronic kidney disease (ckd) when first presenting to a nephrology clinic. methodsnewly referred patients to a nephrology clinic were surveyed with open-ended questions about their understanding of ckd causes, symptoms and management. resultstwo hundred and ten patients were surveyed. median age was 66.5 years (interquartile range 52-77), 50.5% female and mean body mass index 29.7 6.8kg/m(2). prevalence of risk factors for ckd included 31% diabetic, 62% hypertension, 19% family history of ckd and 2% aboriginal or torres strait islander. ckd stage prevalence was 0 (8%), 1 (24%), 2 (11%), 3 (38.5%), 4 (18%) and 5 (0.5%). eighty-two per cent were referred by their primary care physician and 29% had seen a nephrologist previously. kidney health australia was mentioned by 2.4%. sixteen per cent were unsure why they had been referred. ckd causes identified by patients were unsure (40%), alcohol (29%), hypertension (16%) and diabetes (14%). symptoms identified included asymptomatic (16%), kidney pain (17%) and other (42%). management suggested by patients was uncertain (51%), dialysis (32%) and anti-hypertensive medication (16%). eighty-two per cent reported unsatisfactory education from their primary care physician. conclusionsnew patients referred to a renal outpatient department had poor knowledge about kidney disease. education of patients should begin in primary care prior to referral. for most patients, education programmes need to be targeted at a simplistic level.
autism	background: down syndrome (ds) is the most common chromosomal aberration, but the characteristics of the brainstem component in this condition during childhood (from newborn to preteen stages) have not been clarified. objective: to evaluate the morphological features of the brainstem in ds on magnetic resonance imaging (mri). materials and methods: mris for 32 children with ds (16 boys and girls each; age range, 0-11 years) without major brain insults, and 32 age-matched controls (16 boys and girls each) were retrospectively analyzed. height, width, and area of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata were measured on sagittal t1-weighted images; these were compared in children with ds and age-matched controls. the ratios of the brainstem to the size of the posterior fossa (bs/pf index) were calculated; these were also compared in the children with ds and the control group. results: the width and area of the midbrain; height, width, area of the pons; and area of the medulla oblongata were significantly smaller in children with ds than in control children (p < 0.05); the area of the pons, particularly for the ventral part, showed the largest differences in the mean relative differences. the bs/pf indices of the height, width, and area of the pons were significantly smaller in children with ds than in the control group (p < 0.01). however, the bs/pf indices for the midbrain and the medulla oblongata did not differ between these two groups. conclusions: children with ds may have small brainstems, particularly in the pons; this may be a characteristic morphological feature of the brainstem on mri in childhood including neonates.

autism	backgroundthis study explored psychological adjustment and sibling relationships of siblings of children with life-limiting conditions (llcs), expanding on previous research by defining llcs using a systematic classification of these conditions. methodsthirty-nine siblings participated, aged 3-16years. parents completed measures of siblings' emotional and behavioural difficulties, quality of life, sibling relationships and impact on families and siblings. sibling and family adjustment and relationships were compared with population norms, where available, and to a matched comparison group of siblings of children with autistic spectrum disorder (asd), as a comparable high risk' group. resultsllc siblings presented significantly higher levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties, and lower quality of life than population norms. their difficulties were at levels comparable to siblings of children with asd. a wider impact on the family was confirmed. family socio-economic position, time since diagnosis, employment and accessing hospice care were factors associated with better psychological adjustment. conclusionsusing a systematic classification of llcs, the study supported earlier findings of increased levels of psychological difficulties in siblings of children with a llc. the evidence is (i) highlighting the need to provide support to these siblings and their families, and (ii) that intervention approaches could be drawn from the asd field.
autism	although the challenges that autistic students face adapting to college are often pronounced, they are similar to the challenges that students with other disabilities face (e.g., difficulties with social interaction, self-advocacy, and executive functioning). however, extant evaluations of services for autistic college students are very limited despite an emerging literature examining supports for college students with a range of other disabilities. given that many autistic students do not self-identify as autistic in college, and consequently might avoid autism-specific services, autistic students might benefit from services that are designed to support a broad range of neurodiverse students, or services that are structured according to the principles of universal design. in order to develop such services, we assessed the self-reported needs of autistic college students and their peers with other disabilities. guided by needs assessments and feedback from students, we developed and evaluated two semesters of mentor-led group programming for autistic college students and students with other disabilities. the first semester of the program focused on social skills; after receiving feedback from participants, the curriculum for the second semester focused on self-advocacy. participation in social-skills groups was associated with decreased anxiety and autism symptoms. participation in self-advocacy groups was associated with increased perceived social support from friends, academic self-efficacy, and more accurate definitions of self-advocacy. this research suggests that supports for neurodiverse college students should be developed with their input and should include opportunities to engage with diverse peers.
autism	autism spectrum disorder (asd), a condition defined along a continuum of sociocommunicative difficulties, is associated with unique patterns of memory functioning including difficulties with autobiographical memory (am). am refers to memory for information related to the self and personally experienced events and has a strong social function. the current paper reviews empirical studies assessing am among individuals with asd across the lifespan. results support that both children and adults with asd manifest am difficulties characterized by (a) reduced specificity, (b) less elaborated and detailed am narratives, (c) lower am coherence, and (d) increased reliance on scaffolding for retrieval. individuals with asd also demonstrate intact am for certain memory indices and show evidence of using compensatory strategies to facilitate retrieval. results are interpreted in relation to models of typically developing am and broad memory theory, as well as models of information processing specific to asd. to advance knowledge of how am develops within the context of asd, a developmental psychopathology perspective is applied to the consideration of candidate processes underlying developing am among individuals with asd. future research should consider support for mechanisms that promote am performance at multiple ecological levels. limitations, clinical implications for intervention, and future directions are discussed.

autism	introduction: data from an eeg is not commonly used by psychiatrists to plan treatment and medication. however, eeg abnormalities such as isolated epileptiform discharges are found to be more prevalent in psychiatric patients, particularly those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (asd). most medications prescribed for asd lower seizure threshold and increase side effects. therefore, it may be prudent to order an eeg for asd cases, especially those categorized as refractory. methods: the data set was obtained from a multidisciplinary practice that treats a wide variety of neuroatypical children and adolescent refractory patients. this study investigated 140 nonepileptic subjects diagnosed with asd, aged 4 to 25 years. visual inspection of the eeg was performed to search for paroxysmal, focal, or lateralizing patterns. results: of the 140 subjects, the eeg data identified 36% with isolated epileptiform discharges. the x(2) analysis found no significant difference between genders among the three age groups. findings indicated a high prevalence of isolated epileptiform discharges among individuals with asd. conclusions: our results find that compared with the healthy population, a large number of patients with asd have isolated epileptiform discharges despite never having a seizure. our findings support the use of eeg in children, adolescents, and young adults with asd, regardless of gender or age. this is particularly true for those who exhibit aggressive behaviors or those who have failed previous medication attempts with stimulants, antidepressants, and/or antipsychotics.
