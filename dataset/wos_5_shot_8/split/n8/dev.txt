fluid_mechanics	varicocele has been associated with reduced male reproductive potential. with the advances in biomolecular techniques, it has been possible to better understand the mechanisms involved in testicular damage provoked by varicocele. current evidence suggests the central role of reactive oxygen species (ros) and the resultant oxidative stress (os) in the pathogenesis of varicocele-associated male subfertility although the mechanisms have not yet been fully described and it is likely to be multifactorial. excessive ros is associated with sperm dna fragmentation, which may mediate the clinical manifestation of poor sperm function and fertilization outcome related to varicocele. testing of ros/os and dna fragmentation has the potential to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information compared to conventional semen analysis and may guide therapeutic management strategies in individual patient.
fluid_mechanics	in water treatment, flocculation creates aggregated particles or flocs large enough to be removed by downstream processes of sedimentation and filtration. fluidized beds of flocs (floc blankets) are sometimes included in upflow sedimentation processes because they can significantly improve sedimentation tank particle removal when plate or tube settlers are used. overall performance of a sedimentation tank containing a floc blanket is influenced by the characteristics of incoming flocs fromthe flocculator. floc blankets provide an additional opportunity for aggregation of colloidal particles that enables a reduction in the size of the flocculators, while improving particle removal efficiency. in this study, laminar flow flocculators varying in velocity gradient (g) and residence time (theta) were tested in a laboratory scale water treatment systemwith a floc blanket. results indicate that increasing g (range of 74-251 s(-1)), while decreasing residence time from 269 to 80 s, and maintaining a constant g theta (similar to 20,000) improved particle removal. these results indicate that velocity gradients greater than existing design recommendations may be used to reduce flocculator residence times (and associated construction costs) when upflow sedimentation with a floc blanket and overlying lamellar plate or tube settlers are employed subsequent to flocculation. further reduction of the residence time to 24 s with a g of 251 s(-1) resulted in a settled water turbidity of 14 nephelometric turbidity unit (ntu). when varying theta at a constant g of 72 s(-1), an apparentminimum in settled effluent turbidity at 0.15 ntu was observed at the middle residence time tested (theta = 211 s), suggesting that long hydraulic flocculator residence times may be suboptimal.
fluid_mechanics	the feasibility of using a thermomagnetically pumped ferrofluid to enhance the performance of a natural convection cooling loop is investigated. first, a simplified analytical estimate for the thermomagnetic pumping action is derived, and then design rules for optimal solenoid and ferrofluid are presented. the design rules are used to set up a medium-scale (1 m, 10-1000 w) case study, which is modeled using a previously published and validated model (aursand et al. [1]). the results show that the thermomagnetic driving force is significant compared to the natural convection driving force, and may in some cases greatly surpass it. the results also indicate that cooling performance can be increased by factors up to 4 and 2 in the single-phase and two-phase regimes, respectively, even when taking into the account the added heat from the solenoid. the performance increases can alternatively be used to obtain a reduction in heat-sink size by up to 75%.

fluid_mechanics	the present contribution is a significant extension of the work by kelbin et al. (j. fluid mech., vol. 721, 2013, pp. 340-366) as a new time-dependent helical coordinate system has been introduced. for this, lie symmetry methods have been employed such that the spatial dependence of the originally three independent variables is reduced by one and the remaining variables are: the cylindrical radius r and the time- dependent helical variable xi = (z/alpha(t)) + b phi, b = const. and time t. the variables z and pi are the usual cylindrical coordinates and alpha(t) is an arbitrary function of time t. assuming alpha = const., we retain the classical helically symmetric case. using this, and imposing helical invariance onto the equation of motion, leads to a helically symmetric system of euler and navier-stokes equations with a time-dependent pitch alpha(t), which may be varied arbitrarily and which is explicitly contained in all of the latter equations. this has been conducted both for primitive variables as well as for the vorticity formulation. hence a significantly extended set of helically invariant flows may be considered, which may be altered by an external time-dependent strain along the axis of the helix. finally, we sought new conservation laws which can be found from the helically invariant euler and navier-stokes equations derived herein. most of these new conservation laws are considerable extensions of existing conservation laws for helical flows at a constant pitch. interestingly enough, certain classical conservation laws do not admit extensions in the new time-dependent coordinate system.
fluid_mechanics	in this paper, we present an overview of the entropy production in fluid dynamics in a systematic way. first of all, we clarify a rigorous derivation of the incompressible limit for the navier-stokes-fourier system of equations based on the asymptotic analysis, which is a very well known mathematical technique used to derive macroscopic limits of kinetic equations (chapman-enskog expansion and hilbert expansion are popular methodologies). this allows to overcome the theoretical limits of assuming that the material derivative of the density simply vanishes. moreover, we show that the fundamental gibbs relation in classical thermodynamics can be applied to non-equilibrium flows for generalizing the entropy and for expressing the second law of thermodynamics in case of both incompressible and compressible flows. this is consistent with the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and it is an essential condition for the design and optimization of fluid flow devices. summarizing a theoretical framework valid at different regimes (both incompressible and compressible) sheds light on entropy production in fluid mechanics, with broad implications in applied mechanics.
hydraulics	the stars project at the paul scherrer institut (psi) has adopted the trace thermal-hydraulic code. for analyses involving interactions between system and core, a coupling of trace with the simulate-3k (s3k) light water reactor (lwr) core simulator has been developed. in this configuration, the codes and associated simulation models play a central role to achieve a comprehensive safety analysis capability. therefore, efforts have now been undertaken to consolidate the validation strategy by implementing a more rigorous and structured assessment approach for trace applications. the principle is to systematically track the evolution of a given set of predicted physical quantities of interest (qois) over a multidimensional parametric space. if properly set up, such environment should provide code developers and code users with persistent (less affected by user effect) and quantified information (sensitivity of qois) on the applicability of a simulation scheme (codes, methodology, and input models) for steady-state and transient analysis of full lwr systems. through this, for each given transient/accident, critical paths of the validation process can be identified that could then translate into defining reference schemes to be applied for downstream predictive simulations. to illustrate this approach, this validation strategy is applied to an inadvertent blowdown event that occurred in a swiss bwr/6. the transient was initiated by the spurious actuation of the automatic depressurization system. here, the validation approach progresses through a number of dimensions: (a) different versions of the trace code; (b) the methodology dimension-in this case imposed power and updated trace core models are investigated; and (c) the nodalization dimension, where changes to the input model are assessed. for each step in each validation dimension, a common set of qois is investigated. for the steady-state results, these include fuel temperature distributions. for the transient part of the present study, the evaluated qois include the system pressure evolution and water carryover into the steam line. it has been seen that the improvements to the model predictions resulted in a small impact on the system pressure gradient, thus confirming a persistency of the downstream mechanical stress estimate, whereas the water carryover could vary by up to 150% as a function of the adopted simulation methodology.
hydraulics	the thermal-hydraulic response of large dry pressurized water reactor containments under loss-of-coolant-accident conditions-particularly with respect to containment pressure and sump pool temperature-is crucial for risk-informed decision making about generic safety issue 191. texas a& m university has developed models with several computer codes including melcor and gothic to model such scenarios. melcor is a best-estimate thermal-hydraulic and severe accident code created and actively maintained by sandia national laboratories for the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission. gothic is a thermal-hydraulic software package meant for design, licensing, and safety calculations for, among other systems, nuclear power plant containments. it was developed and is maintained by numerical applications inc. for the electronic power research institute. the overarching goal of the analyses presented here is twofold: (1) produce best-estimate time profiles of sump pool temperature under double-ended guillotine-break conditions with melcor and gothic and (2) investigate differences between the melcor and gothic code results via a sensitivity study. the sump pool temperature was selected as a key parameter to compare because it has direct implications for sump pool chemistry, residual heat removal during recirculation, and pressure drop across sump screens. aspects of the melcor and gothic modeling strategies are discussed, and best estimates of the containment thermal-hydraulic response are presented. there are significant disagreements between code predictions. hypotheses to explain the differences are tested through a comparative code sensitivity study. in this context, ""sensitivity"" refers to how containment thermal hydraulics respond to differences in code inputs or code phenomenological models. sensitivity calculations are performed to exclude, individually, the model effects on comparative thermal-hydraulic responses of containment fan coolers, containment sprays, thermal surface condensation/films, and break source definition. calculations are also performed with multiple models excluded. using containment sump pool temperature as an indicator, the most impactful physics in terms of code agreement are those of thermal surfaces (condensation, film phenomena) whereas fan cooler models have a minimal effect. containment spray exclusion results in disagreement in parts of the event sequence, while break source definition and/or break effluent flashing models lead to disagreement.
hydraulics	the importance of conceptualizing the dynamics of storage-driven saturation area connectivity in runoff generation has been central to the development of topmodel and similar low parameterized rainfall-runoff models. in this contribution, we show how we developed a 40-year hydrometric data base to simulate storage-discharge relationships in the girnock catchment in the scottish highlands using a simple conceptual model. the catchment is a unique fisheries reference site where atlantic salmon populations have been monitored since 1966. the modelling allowed us to track storage dynamics in hillslopes, the riparian zone and groundwater, and explicitly link non-linear changes of streamflows to landscape storage and connectivity dynamics. this provides a fundamental basis for understanding how the landscape and riverscape are hydrologically connected and how this regulates in-stream hydraulic conditions that directly influence salmonids. we use the model to simulate storage and discharge dynamics over the 40-year period of fisheries records. the modelled storage-driven connectivity provides an ecohydological context for understanding the dynamics in stream flow generation which determine habitat hydraulics for different life stages of salmon population. this new, long-term modelling now sets this variability in the riverscape in a more fundamental context of the inter-relationships between storage in the landscape and stream flow generation. this provides a simple, robust framework for future ecohydrological modelling at this site, which is an alternative to more increasingly popular but highly parameterized and uncertain commercial ecohydrological models. it also provides a wider, novel context that is a prerequisite for any model-based scenario assessment of likely impacts resulting from climate or land use change. copyright (c) 2016 the authors hydrological processes published by john wiley & sons ltd. copyright (c) 2016 the authors hydrological processes published by john wiley & sons ltd.
hydraulics	submerged aquatic vegetation affects flow, sediment and ecological processes within rivers. quantifying these effects is key to effective river management. despite a wealth of research into vegetated flows, the detailed flow characteristics around real plants in natural channels are still poorly understood. here we present a new methodology for representing vegetation patches within computational fluid dynamics (cfd) models of vegetated channels. vegetation is represented using a mass flux scaling algorithm (mfsa) and drag term within the reynolds-averaged navier-stokes equations, which account for the mass and momentum effects of the vegetation, respectively. the model is applied using three different grid resolutions (0.2, 0.1 and 0.05m) using time-averaged solution methods and compared to field data. the results show that the model reproduces the complex spatial flow heterogeneity within the channel and that increasing the resolution leads to enhanced model accuracy. future applications of the model to the prediction of channel roughness, sedimentation and key eco-hydraulic variables are presented, likely to be valuable for informing effective river management.

hydraulics	biofilms are ubiquitous in the pipes of drinking water distribution systems (dwdss), and recent experimental studies revealed that the chlorination of the microbial carbon associated with the biofilm contributes to the total disinfection by-products (dbps) formation with distinct mechanisms from those formed from precursors derived from natural organic matter (nom). a multiple species reactive transport model was developed to explain the role of biofilms in dbps formation by accounting for the simultaneous transport and interactions of disinfectants, organic compounds, and biomass. using parameter values from experimental studies in the literature, the model equations were solved to predict chlorine decay and microbial regrowth dynamics in an actual dwds, and trihalomethanes (thms) formation in a pilot-scale distribution system simulator. the model 's capability of reproducing the measured concentrations of free chlorine, suspended biomass, and thms under different hydrodynamic and temperature conditions was demonstrated. the contribution of bacteria-derived precursors to the total thms production was found to have a significant dependence on the system 's hydraulics, seasonal variables, and the quality of the treated drinking water. under system conditions that promoted fast bacterial re-growth, the transformation of non-microbial into microbial carbon dbp precursors by the biofilms showed a noticeable effect on the kinetics of thms formation, especially when a high initial chlorine dose was applied. these conditions included elevated water temperature and high concentrations of nutrients in the influent water. the fraction of thms formed from microbial sources was found to reach a peak of 12% of the total produced thms under the investigated scenarios. the results demonstrated the importance of integrating bacterial regrowth dynamics in predictive dbps formation models.

computer-aided_design	in thiswork, a molecular dynamics simulationmethodwas introduced to compute the preassembled system of molecular imprinted polymers for sulfamethoxazole monomer. the results revealed that the ratio of sulfamethoxazole as template molecule to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane as functional monomer to tetraethylorthosilicate as cross-linker of 10: 10: 40 led to themost stable template-functionalmonomer cluster. based on the result of computational simulation, cdte@sio2 core-shell imprinted polymers, a cadmium telluride quantum dots layer on the surface of aminofunctionalized sio2, were synthesized as the fluorescent sensor. then, a series of measures were used to characterize the structure and morphology to get optimal sensors. the concentration range was 5.0-30.0 mu mol/l between molecular imprinted polymers at cdte at sio2, and sulfamethoxazole of the fluorescence intensity. to further verify the reliability and accuracy of the fluorescent sensor, the application was successfully by analyzing sulfamethoxazole in pure milk and lake water. the results showed the recoveries were above 96.89% with a relative standard deviation of 1.25-5.45%, and the fluorescence sensor with selective recognition provides an alternative solution for the determination of sulfamethoxazole.
computer-aided_design	reverse engineering demands a fast and accurate measuring method to obtain the surface model of an object when its computer-aided design (cad) model is not available. blending the advantages of both contact probes and non-contact scanners has been the trend of reverse engineering development for the past 15 years. current research on hybrid reverse engineering system focuses on sensor selection, scanning path planning, and coordinate system registration and unification, but lacks of interaction between the data groups from the touch probe and laser sensor. the objective of this research is directed toward improving data accuracy at a reduced amount of data points without complex instrument integration and is accomplished through combining the advantages of contact probes and non-contact scanners and meanwhile offsetting their disadvantages. in this research, data from the laser sensor is strategically selected based on the local surface variation, and a coordinate measuring machine (cmm) touch probe is used to enhance data accuracy. a cell merging algorithm is implemented to reduce the amount of data based on a newly proposed concept of break points, by which a hermit bicubic relation is maintained among neighboring sampling points while a hybrid reverse engineering process is going on. at the end of the paper, examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the methodology.

computer-aided_design	ingaas (and its variant) appears to be a promising channel material for high-performance, low-power scaled cmos applications due to its excellent carrier transport properties. however, mos transistors made of this suffer from poor electrostatic integrity. in this work, we consider an underlap ultra thin body (utb) inas-on-insulator n-channel mos transistor, and study the effect of varying the gate-source/drain (g-s/d) underlap length on the analog performance of the device with the help of technology computer-aided design (tcad) simulation, calibrated with schrodinger-poisson solver and experimental results. the underlap technique improves the gate electrostatic integrity which in turn improves the analog performance. we develop a non-quasi-static (nqs) small signal equivalent circuit model of the device which is used for study of the rf performance. with increase of the underlap length, the unity gain cut-off frequency degrades and the maximum oscillation frequency improves beyond a certain value of the underlap length. we further study the gain-frequency response of a common source amplifier using the nqs model, through spice simulation and observe that the voltage gain and the gain bandwidth improves.

manufacturing_engineering	the development of computer aided resources in automation of generation of manufacturing routings and operations is being mainly accomplished through the search of similarities between existent ones, resulting standard process routings that are grouped by analysis of similarities between parts or routings. this article proposes the development of manufacturing routings and operations detailment using a methodology which steps will define the initial, intermediate and final operations, starting from the rough piece and going up to the final specifications, that must have binunivocal relationship with the part design specifications. each step will use the so called rules of precedence to link and chain the routing operations. the rules of precedence order and prioritize the knowledge of various manufacturing processes, taking in account the theories of machining, forging, assembly,and heat treatments; also, utilizes the theories of accumulation of tolerances and process capabilities, between others. it is also reinforced the availability of manufacturing databases related to process tolerances, deviations of machine tool- cutting tool- fixturing devices - workpiece,and process capabilities. the statement and application of rules of precedence, linking and joining manufacturing concepts in a logical and structured way, and their application in the methodology steps will make viable the utilization of structured knowledge instead of tacit one currently available in the manufacturing engineering departments, in the generation of manufacturing routing and operations. consequently, the development of computer aided in process planning will be facilitated, due to the structured knowledge applied with this methodology.
manufacturing_engineering	although the system reliability theory has a high capability in quality quantification, while system reliability optimization (sro) has been well developed in manufacturing engineering, seldom can their applications be found in the construction industry. this study aims to develop a system reliability theory based multiple-objective optimization model to conduct sro, and then identify the cost-quality trade-off solution for construction projects. first the whole construction project is treated as a system composed of different work packages. second, the reliability function is employed to quantify the quality performance and the nonlinear cost-reliability function is set up. moreover, according to the physical arrangements among each work package, the system reliability structural function is determined. third, the total construction cost minimization and system reliability maximization are defined as multiple-objectives. the particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to search for the pareto-optimal solutions, from which the final cost-quality trade-off solution can be selected. a real construction case is used to evaluate the workability of the proposed model and the results have fully proven its validity and practicality.

manufacturing_engineering	in manufacturing engineering, especially in machining process, the definition of a reference plane is the first essential step within the overall process. after the reference plane is applied at the component all other features are processed with reference to this basic plane. during any process the component has to be clamped in order to resist the processing forces. there are several clamping systems available, such as pneumatic, magnetic systems or magneto-rheological (mr) systems. depending on its stiffness the component is deformed due to the clamping forces, stresses are introduced. this effect can be neglected for components with a high stiffness and nearly rigid body behaviour. however, the deformation of low stiff components under clamping forces, e.g. sheet metals, is relatively large and is in the same range as the addressed accuracy of machining process. due to the introduced elastic clamping stresses the component will reconfigure after clamping, this phenomenon is known as springback. the focus of this work is the design of a clamping system for flexible bodies in order to reduce the springback and to enable high precision processing. this clamping system consists in a set of supports, which adjust to the surface of the body without introducing stresses and causing no springback after the machining process. the number and the arrangement of the supports are optimized as a function of the intensity and position of the milling force and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the body as well. the functional unit of the clamping system is a cylindrical bodysliding nearly frictionless within a pipe. numerical simulation is used for configuration and optimization. the developed clamping systems can also be used to process freeform shaped bodies.
machine_design	to enable important scientific discoveries, eso has defined a new ground-based telescope: the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the baseline design features a telescope with a 39-m-class primary mirror (m1), making it the largest and most powerful telescope in the world. the m1 consists of 798 hexagonal segments, each about 1.4 m wide, but only 50 mm thick. in the last stages of the manufacturing process of these m1 segments, a nanometre-accurate metrology method is required for the m1 to be within specifications. the segments have to be measured on their whiffle-tree support structures with a nanometre-level uncertainty, with a total budget on form accuracy of 50 nm rms for any segment assembly. in this paper a measurement machine design is presented based on a non-contact single-point scanning technique, capable of measuring with nanometre accuracy, being universal, fast and with low operational costs, providing suitable metrology for m1 segments. a tactile precision probe is implemented to be able to use the machine in earlier stages of the segment manufacturing process. in particular, this paper describes the design of the air-bearing motion system and the separate metrology system based on a moving sintered silicon carbide tube, a fixed zerodur metrology frame and an interferometric system for a direct and short metrology loop. preliminary calculations show nanometre-level measurement uncertainty after calibration.

machine_design	the design method of initial topology of interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (ipmsm) for hybrid electric vehicle (hev) propulsion is described in this paper. design constraints are selected on the basis of limitations imposed by machine 's manufacturer and application (e.g. maximum copper slot fill factor, air gap length, permanent magnet material, limited space available in drive trains, etc.). design variables are rotor radius, stator slot width and number of turns per phase winding. parametric analysis is performed for various machine topologies. the cost function, which connects the distribution of operating points of hev and the efficiency maps of various topologies of an electrical machine, is defined. obtained parametric results are compared to find the result leading to the extreme value of the cost function. the initial design of ipmsm that corresponds to this result is considered as the best initial design.
machine_design	this paper proposes and implements a new single-phase magnetless flux switching machine (fsm) for rooftop wind power generation. the key is to integrate an outer-rotor fsm and an inner-rotor fsm with shared stator yoke and stator drum windings. in such a way, this proposed machine can not only realize flux switching function to regulate magnetic flux effectively, but also incorporate the field and armature windings within one stator to reduce the copper losses and improve the overall machine efficiency. meanwhile, the structure is compact and rotors can be directly driven by blades to capture the wind power. the machine design guidelines from both magnetic and electric aspects are illustrated, the machine characteristics are analyzed by using time-stepping finite-element method, and the system performances are evaluated based on mathematical modeling. both simulation and prototyping test are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed machine and system.
machine_design	combining biological components, such as cells and tissues, with soft robotics can enable the fabrication of biological machines with the ability to sense, process signals, and produce force. an intuitive demonstration of a biological machine is one that can produce motion in response to controllable external signaling. whereas cardiac cell-driven biological actuators have been demonstrated, the requirements of these machines to respond to stimuli and exhibit controlled movement merit the use of skeletal muscle, the primary generator of actuation in animals, as a contractile power source. here, we report the development of 3d printed hydrogel ""bio-bots"" with an asymmetric physical design and powered by the actuation of an engineered mammalian skeletal muscle strip to result in net locomotion of the bio-bot. geometric design and material properties of the hydrogel bio-bots were optimized using stereolithographic 3d printing, and the effect of collagen i and fibrin extracellular matrix proteins and insulin-like growth factor 1 on the force production of engineered skeletal muscle was characterized. electrical stimulation triggered contraction of cells in the muscle strip and net locomotion of the bio-bot with a maximum velocity of similar to 156 m s(-1), which is over 1.5 body lengths per min. modeling and simulation were used to understand both the effect of different design parameters on the bio-bot and the mechanism of motion. this demonstration advances the goal of realizing forward-engineered integrated cellular machines and systems, which can have a myriad array of applications in drug screening, programmable tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biomimetic machine design.
machine_design	fretting fatigue is a phenomenon which occurs when two parts are contacted to each other and one of those parts or both are subjected to cyclic load. fretting decreases fatigue life of materials drastically by half or even more. therefore, investigation of fretting fatigue life of materials is an important subject. fretting fatigue tests are usually performed using universal hydraulic testing devices. in this work, a rotating bending apparatus for fretting fatigue test is introduced in which the cyclic load is provided by an adjustable eccentric load. the apparatus called rbff machine which is the abbreviation of rotating bending fretting fatigue. the eccentric load is measured by load cell. the coefficient of friction and fretting load are measured by foil strain gauges using a wheatstone bridge configuration. the performance of the machine is verified with doing a comparison between fatigue lives of a number of al7075-t6 alloy samples on a shimadzu rotating bending fatigue testing machine and rbff. the results shows very close assent between the operations of the two testing rigs. the main privileges of rbff are its simplicity with respect to universal devices, cheapness and, coefficient of friction (between pads and specimen) evaluation during the test. the rbff also has the capability of being used for any other soft and hard metals. it can be advanced further for high and low temperature.
thermodynamics	phytochelatins or pcn,(gamma glu-cys),-gly,and their glutathione (gsh) precursor are thiol-rich peptides that play an important role in heavy metal detoxification in plants and microorganisms. complex formation between cd2+ and pb2+ and gsh or pcn (n = 2, 4 and 6) are investigated by microcalorimetry, absorption spectrophotometry and t-jump kinetics. complex formation with pb2+ or cd2+ is exothermic, and induces ligand metal charge transfer bands in uv absorption spectral range, which implies the formation of a coordination bond between the metal and the thiol groups of the phytochelatins. absorption spectra and microcalorimetry experiments allow the determination of the affinity constants and the stoichiometry of the complexes. we show that the three pcn interact with pb2+ to form the 1:1 and 2:1 m:l complexes, with similar affinity constants (log k-11(pb) similar to 4.6 log k-21(pb)similar to 11.4). these affinities are independent of the number of thiols and are, moreover, lower than those determined for complex formation with cd2+. on the other hand, with cd2+, pc2-cd, pc2-cd-2, (pc2)(3)-cd-2, pc4-cd, pc4-cd-2, pc6-cd, (pc6)(2)-cd-3 and pc6-cd-3 complexes are detected. furthermore, for pc4-cd, the 1:1 complex is the most stable: affinity constant (log k-11(cd)similar to 7.5). kinetic studies indicate that complex formation between cd2+ and gsh occurs in the ms range; direct rate constant k(obs) = (6.8 +/- 0.3) 106 m-1 s(-1) and reverse rate constant k(-obs), = 340 +/- 210 s(-1). thus, when encapsulated in a silica matrix, pcn can be good candidates for heavy metal detection.

thermodynamics	the general class of bianchi cosmological models with dark energy in the form of modified chaplygin gas with variable lambda and g and bulk viscosity have been considered. we discuss three types of average scale factor by using a special law for deceleration parameter which is linear in time with negative slope. the exact solutions to the corresponding field equations are obtained. we obtain the solution of bulk viscosity (xi), cosmological constant (lambda), gravitational parameter (g) and deceleration parameter (q) for different equations of state. the model describes an accelerating universe for large value of time t, wherein the effective negative pressure induced by chaplygin gas and bulk viscous pressure are driving the acceleration.
thermodynamics	the specimen size has a significant influence on the flow behavior of zr55cu30al10ni5 bulk metallic glass throughout thermoplastic compression processes in the supercooled liquid region. due to enhanced structural relaxation, the recovery enthalpy increases with specimen size decreasing. based on combined differential scanning calorimetry experiments and finite element modeling simulations, the different free volume annihilations caused by the specific surface area discrepancy are considered as the main cause of size-dependent free volume variation during the pre-heating process. thermodynamics and structural relaxation theory are introduced to provide a reasonable explanation of the size-dependent flow behavior at elevated temperatures. a novel prediction model involving size-induced free volume variations has been established by considering the influences of compression deformation variables. the quantitative theoretical prediction agrees well with experimental data, which indicates that the developed prediction model can accurately describe the size-dependent free volume annihilation and generation during the thermoplastic forming process. furthermore, the reasonable theoretical analysis and size-dependent free volume prediction model provide a profound understanding of the size-dependent flow behavior and its relation to internal structural evolution behaviors of metallic glasses.

thermodynamics	in an effort to screen out the alginolytic and cellulolytic bacteria from the putrefying invasive seaweed sargassum species accumulated off barbados' coast, a potent bacterial strain was isolated. this bacterium, which simultaneously produced alginate lyase and cellulase, was identified as exiguobacterium sp. alg-s5 via the phylogenetic approach targeting the 16s rrna gene. the co-produced alginate lyase and cellulase exhibited maximal enzymatic activity at ph 7.5 and at 40 degrees c and 45 degrees c, respectively. the k-m and v-max values recorded as 0.91 mg/ml and 21.8 u/mg-protein, respectively, for alginate lyase, and 10.9 mg/ml and 74.6 u/mg-protein, respectively, for cellulase. first order kinetic analysis of the thermal denaturation of the co-produced alginate lyase and cellulase in the temperature range from 40 degrees c to 55 degrees c revealed that both the enzymes were thermodynamically efficient by displaying higher activation energy and enthalpy of denaturation. these enzymatic properties indicate the potential industrial importance of this bacterium in algal biomass conversion. this appears to be the first report on assessing the efficacy of a bacterium for the co-production of alginate lyase and cellulase.

thermodynamics	the halogen bond (xb) is a topical noncovalent interaction of rapidly increasing importance. the xb employs a 'soft' donor atom in comparison to the 'hard' proton of the hydrogen bond (hb). this difference has led to the hypothesis that xbs can form more favorable interactions with 'soft' bases than hbs. while computational studies have supported this suggestion, solution and solid-state data are lacking. here, xb soft-soft complementarity is investigated with a bidentate receptor that shows similar associations with neutral carbonyls and heavy chalcogen analogs. the solution speciation and xb soft-soft complementarity is supported by four crystal structures containing neutral and anionic soft lewis bases.

strength_of_materials	a dislocation is a topological defect where the atoms are out of position in a crystalline structure. it plays an important role in the theory of plasticity for the stability and the strength of materials and in melting processes. in this paper, we report an experimental and numerical study of the interaction between such a dislocation and a compressional solitary wave in 2-d strongly coupled plasma crystals. complex plasmas consist of micrometer-sized spheres immersed into an ordinary ion-electron plasma. they can exist in solid, liquid, and gaseous states and are model systems to study dynamic phenomena.
strength_of_materials	objective: different biomaterials have been used as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. the purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of bovine bone collagen to the porosity, water retention, degradation rate and biomechanical characteristics of composite scaffolds. methods: bovine bone collagen solution was mixed with cellulose nanofibers solution, and then the mixture was added a certain quality of hydroxyapatite. we divided the mixture into two groups according to the different bovine bone collagen solution mass fraction: no. 1 (0 % bovine bone collagen), no. 2 (50 % bovine bone collagen). the surface structure and the pore size was observed under the scanning electron microscopic. then we calculated the porosity, degradation rate, water content and biomechanical properties. results: two groups of scaffold materials showed a multi-pore structure. the average pore size were 133.4 +/- 13.5 mu m and 221.7 +/- 16.8 mu m. the porosity was (91.65 +/- 1.75) % and (85.42 +/- 1.48) %. statistical analysis showed that two groups of material porosity difference were statistically significant (p<0.05). the degradation rates of two groups of scaffold materials at six weeks were (60.25 +/- 1.81) % and (23.16 +/- 1.027) %. statistical analysis showed that the degradation rate of the material differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). water content of two groups of scaffold materials was (97.44 perpendicular to 0.98 % and (91.36 perpendicular to 0.77) %. statistical analysis showed that the water content of the material differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). biomechanical properties of the second group increased significantly. conclusion: it could be seen from the experimental data that bovine bone collagen could increase the pore size, improved stability to degradation and the biomechanical strength of materials. therefore, the biocomposite studied has several characteristics considered as ideal for its use as a scaffold for osteoconduction and osteoinduction.
strength_of_materials	masonry walls subjected to in-plane loading exhibit a complex behavior because of the influence of several parameters such as axial load, aspect ratio, and the strength of materials. in high-rise buildings or seismic areas, large tensile stresses may arise in these walls, and vertical and horizontal reinforcement is often used to provide proper resistance, which increases the complexity of the structural behavior. this work presents (1) an overview of the experimental behavior of unreinforced and reinforced masonry walls; (2) an overview of distinct design methods aimed at calculating the in-plane lateral resistance; and (3) a proposal of a new design model for reinforced masonry walls subjected to in-plane loading. the proposed model considers the coupling interaction of the flexural and shear resisting mechanisms and updates the role of the vertical and horizontal reinforcement to the lateral resistance. a database composed of experimental results of the in-plane lateral resistance of 101 masonry walls available in the literature was used to evaluate the performance of existing models and to validate the newly proposed model, which exhibits much better performance. doi: 10.1061/(asce)st.1943-541x.0000636.

strength_of_materials	on the basis of ab initio simulations, the value of strength of interatomic bonds in one-, two- and three-dimensional carbon crystals is obtained. it is shown that decreasing in dimensionality of crystal gives rise to nearly linear increase in strength of atomic bonds. it is ascertained that growth of strength of the crystal with a decrease in its dimensionality is due to both a reduction in coordination number of atom and increase in the angle between the directions of atomic bonds. based on these data, it is substantiated that the one-dimensional (1d) crystals have maximum strength, and strength of carbyne is the absolute upper limit of strength of materials.
strength_of_materials	in recent years, there have been a lot of new developments concerning the use of advanced materials for lightweight structures. examples are long- and short-fibre-reinforced composites, sandwiches, foams, and, last but not least, nanostructures. the analysis of structures made of these materials can be performed on the basis of the mechanics of composites. however, stimulated by new applications, new manufacturing technologies, new material compositions, etc. a review of the mechanics of composites is necessary. in this article, some of the actual trends are discussed, for example developments in the application of long-and short-fibre-reinforced composites, laminates affected by multifield loadings, effective property-based analysis of foams, and the description of nanostructures within the concepts of continuum mechanics. the starting point of the review are the engineering mechanics basics on the level of the bsc program, that means the classical strength of materials. extensions of materials strength foundations (for example, inclusion of anisotropy) are often sufficient as first improved estimates. if it is necessary, elements of continuum mechanics, of material testing or numerical solution techniques can be implied. the every year increasing number of publications in the field of advanced materials for lightweight structures does not allow to give a complete overview over the state of the art. recognizing this fact, the author will give a report only of directions related to his own research group and/or in the surrounding of his team.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper presents a theoretical model and addresses several issues related to life cycle cost analysis to illustrate how time-inconsistent preferences affect consumer choice. the particular case study selects involved consumer choice between a vehicle with high initial acquisition cost but low ownership cost (e.g., an electric vehicle, ev) and one with a low initial acquisition cost but high ownership cost (e.g., a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, icev). to test our theoretical analysis, we conduct an empirical study on how time discounting rates affect consumer choice between icevs and evs with different initial cost ratios. from the survey results, we find that individuals with higher present bias showed irrational purchase behavior even when controlling for wealth level. specifically, people making some ""stronger bias to present' decisions chose higher total cost icevs with lower initial cost but higher ownership cost over lower total cost evs with higher initial cost and lower ownership cost. however, people 's long-term discount is not correlated with irrational vehicle purchase behavior. furthermore, we study the present bias and long-term discount rate in one scenario and found present bias to be correlated with irrational behavior.

internal_combustion_engine	this study aimed to compare the performance of an internal combustion engine fed with blends of biodiesel produced from soybean and diesel, and blends of biodiesel produced from beef tallow and diesel. performance was evaluated in terms of power generated at low loading conditions (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 kw) and emission of organic and inorganic pollutants. in order to analyse inorganic gases (co, so2 and nox), an automatic analyser was used and the organic emissions (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - btex) were carried out using a gas chromatograph. the results indicate that the introduction of the two biodiesels in the fuel caused a reduction in co, so2 and btex emissions. in addition, the reduction was proportional to the increase in loading regime. beef tallow biodiesels presented better results regarding emission than soybean biodiesels. the use of pure biodiesels also presented a net reduction in pollutant gas emissions without hindering the engine generator performance.
internal_combustion_engine	to reduce the fuel consumption of internal combustion engines, more attention has been paid to the tribological performance of the piston ring pack during the cold start and idle operations. in this research, a numerical model considering the cylinder liner deformation and the piston ring conformability is developed to predict the blow-by, lubrication, friction and wear of the piston ring pack under different operating conditions. the gas flow rate, inter-ring gas pressures, minimum oil film thickness, frictional force and wear load during cold start are calculated and compared with those during warm idle operating conditions. the results show that cylinder liner deformation and piston ring conformability together obviously affect blow-by and other tribological performance. meanwhile, it is found that friction loss is larger during cold start than during warm idle operating conditions. however, the wear process is more severe during warm idle operation than during cold start. from this research, the blow-by and tribological performance of the piston ring pack during cold start and warm idle operations are understood more deeply.
internal_combustion_engine	in this two-part paper, a topological analysis of powertrains for refuse-collecting vehicles (rcvs) based on simulation of different architectures (internal combustion engine, hybrid electric, and hybrid hydraulic) on real routes is proposed. in this second part, three different hybrid electric powertrain architectures are proposed and modeled. these architectures are based on the use of fuel cells, ultracapacitors, and batteries. a calculation engine, which is specifically designed to estimate energy consumption, respecting the original performance as the original internal combustion engine (ice), is presented and used for simulations and component sizing. finally, the overall performance of the different architectures (hybrid hydraulic, taken from the first paper part, and hybrid electric, estimated in this second part) and control strategies are summarized in a fuel and energy consumption table. based on this table, an analysis of the different architecture performance results is carried out. from this analysis, a technological evolution of these vehicles in the medium- and long terms is proposed.
internal_combustion_engine	the well-to-wheel (wtw) methodology is widely used for policy support in road transport. it can be seen as a simplified life cycle assessment (lca) that focuses on the energy consumption and co2 emissions only for the fuel being consumed, ignoring other stages of a vehicle 's life cycle. wtw results are therefore different from lca results. in order to close this gap, the authors propose a hybrid wtw+lca methodology useful to assess the greenhouse gas (ghg) profiles of road vehicles. the proposed method (hybrid wtw+lca) keeps the main hypotheses of the wtw methodology, but integrates them with lca data restricted to the global warming potential (gwp) occurring during the manufacturing of the battery pack. wtw data are used for the ghg intensity of the eu electric mix, after a consistency check with the main life cycle impact (lci) sources available in literature. a numerical example is provided, comparing ghg emissions due to the use of a battery electric vehicle (bev) with emissions from an internal combustion engine vehicle. this comparison is done both according to the wtw approach (namely the jec wtw version 4) and the proposed hybrid wtw+lca method. the ghg savings due to the use of bevs calculated with the wtw-4 range between 44 and 56 %, while according to the hybrid method the savings are lower (31-46 %). this difference is due to the gwp which arises as a result of the manufacturing of the battery pack for the electric vehicles. the wtw methodology used in policy support to quantify energy content and ghg emissions of fuels and powertrains can produce results closer to the lca methodology by adopting a hybrid wtw+lca approach. while evaluating ghg savings due to the use of bevs, it is important that this method considers the gwp due to the manufacturing of the battery pack.
