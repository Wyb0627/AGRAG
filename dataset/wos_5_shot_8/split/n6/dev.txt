prenatal_development	fetal exposure to environmental insults increases the susceptibility to late-onset neuropsychiatric disorders. alcohol is listed as one of such prenatal environmental risk factors and known to exert devastating teratogenetic effects on the developing brain, leading to complex neurological and psychiatric symptoms observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (fasd). here, we performed a coordinated transcriptome analysis of human and mouse fetal cerebral cortices exposed to ethanol in vitro and in vivo, respectively. up-and down-regulated genes conserved in the human and mouse models and the biological annotation of their expression profiles included many genes/terms related to neural development, such as cell proliferation, neuronal migration and differentiation, providing a reliable connection between the two species. our data indicate that use of the combined rodent and human model systems provides an effective strategy to reveal and analyze gene expression changes inflicted by various physical and chemical environmental exposures during prenatal development. it also can potentially provide insight into the pathogenesis of environmentally caused brain disorders in humans.
prenatal_development	prenatal development is known to be extremely sensitive to maternal and environmental challenges. in this study, we hypothesize that body growth and lactation during gestation in cattle reduce nutrient availability for the pregnant uterus, with consequences for placental development. fetal membranes of 16 growing heifers and 27 fully grown cows of the belgian blue (bb) breed were compared to determine the effect of body growth on placental development. furthermore, the fetal membranes of 49 lactating holstein friesian (hf) cows and 27 hf heifers were compared to study the impact of dam lactation compared to dam body growth. after parturition, calf birth weight and body measurements of dam and calf were recorded, as well as weight of total fetal membranes, cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes. all cotyledons were individually measured to calculate both the surface of each individual cotyledon and the total cotyledonary surface per placenta. total cotyledonary surface was unaffected by breed or the breedxparity interaction. besides a 0.3 kg lower cotyledonary weight (p=0.007), heifer placentas had a smaller total cotyledonary surface compared with placentas of cows (0.48 +/- 0.017 v. 0.54 +/- 0.014 m(2), respectively, p<0.001). within the bb breed, fetal membranes of heifers had a 1.5 kg lower total weight and 1.0 kg lower intercotyledonary membrane weight (p<0.005) compared with cows. a cotyledon number of only 91 +/- 5.4 was found in multiparous bb dams, while growing bb heifers had a higher cotyledon number (126 +/- 6.7, p<0.001), but a greater proportion of smaller cotyledons (<40 cm(2)). within the hf breed, no parity effect on intercotyledonary membrane weight, cotyledon number and individual cotyledonary surface was found. placental efficiency (calf weight/total cotyledonary surface) was similar in hf and bb heifers but significantly higher in multiparous bb compared with multiparous hf dams (106.0 +/- 20.45 v. 74.3 +/- 12.27 kg/m(2), respectively, p<0.001). furthermore, a seasonal effect on placental development was found, with winter and spring placentas having smaller cotyledons than summer and fall placentas (p<0.001). main findings of the present study are that lactation and maternal growth during gestation entail a comparable nutrient diverting constraint, which might alter placental development. however, results suggest that the placenta is able to manage this situation through two potential compensation mechanisms. in early pregnancy the placenta might cope by establishing a higher number of cotyledons, while in late gestation a compensatory expansion of the cotyledonary surface is suggested to meet the nutrient demand of the fetus.
prenatal_development	the humerus of fossorial moles has a highly derived anatomy, reflecting the ecological specialization of these animals for digging. it is short and broad, with enlarged muscle attachment sites and pronounced articulations compared to non-fossorial sister taxa and other mammals. both condyles are rotated in opposite directions, resulting in a torsion which is unique among eutherian mammals. the development of this exceptional bone was studied in embryonic stages of the fossorial iberian mole (talpa occidentalis) from mesenchymal condensation to incipient ossification based on histological serial sections using 3d reconstruction methods. for comparison, embryonic stages of the semi-fossorial japanese shrew mole (urotrichus talpoides) as well as a sister taxon of moles, the terrestrial north american least shrew (cryptotis parva), were studied. results show that the humerus of talpa already shows its derived anatomy with broadened muscle attachment sites and distinct articulations at early cartilaginous stages, when ossification has just started in the mid-diaphyseal region. the torsion takes place simultaneously with the medial rotation of the forelimbs. the supracondylar foramen is closed in all studied talpa embryos, but patent in cryptotis and urotrichus. this is an example of developmental penetrance, suggesting that variation of adult elements can be found at early stages as well.
prenatal_development	in 1996, psychologists ray blanchard and anthony bogaert found evidence that gay men have a greater number of older brothers than do heterosexual men. this ""fraternal birth order"" (fbo) effect has been replicated numerous times, including in non-western samples. more recently, strong evidence has been found that the fbo effect is of prenatal origin. although there is no direct support for the exact prenatal mechanism, the most plausible explanation may be immunological in origin, i.e., a mother develops an immune reaction against a substance important in male fetal development during pregnancy, and that this immune effect becomes increasingly likely with each male gestation. this immune effect is hypothesized to cause an alteration in (some) later born males' prenatal brain development. the target of the immune response may be molecules (i.e., y-linked proteins) on the surface of male fetal brain cells, including in sites of the anterior hypothalamus, which has been linked to sexual orientation in other research. antibodies might bind to these molecules and thus alter their role in typical sexual differentiation, leading some later born males to be attracted to men as opposed to women. here we review evidence in favor of this hypothesis, including recent research showing that mothers of boys develop an immune response to one y-linked protein (i.e., h-y antigen; smcy) important in male fetal development, and that this immune effect becomes increasingly likely with each additional boy to which a mother gives birth. we also discuss other y-linked proteins that may be relevant if this hypothesis is correct. finally, we discuss issues in testing the maternal immune hypothesis of fbo.

prenatal_development	during prenatal development, the nervous system may be more susceptible to environmental toxicants, such as secondhand smoke. the authors assessed the effects of prenatal and postnatal secondhand smoke exposure on the neurodevelopment of 6-month infants. the subjects were 414 mother and infant pairs with no medical problems, taken from the mothers' and children 's environmental health study. prenatal and postnatal exposures to secondhand smoke were determined using maternal self-reports. examiners, unaware of exposure history, assessed the infants at 6 months of age using the bayley scales of infant development. bayley scores were compared for secondhand smoke exposed and unexposed groups after adjusting for potential confounders. multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate the risk of developmental delay posed by shs exposure. the multivariate model included residential area, maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, education, income, infant sex, parity, birth weight, and type of feeding. after adjusting for covariates, secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy was found to be related to a decrease in mental developmental index score, but not to a decrease in psychomotor developmental index score. in addition, secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy was found to increase the risk of developmental delay (mental developmental index score 5 85) at 6 months. this study suggests that the infants of non-smoking women exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk of neurodevelopmental delay.

attention	location-aware recommender systems that use location-based ratings to produce recommendations have recently experienced a rapid development and draw significant attention from the research community. however, current work mainly focused on high-quality recommendations while underestimating privacy issues, which can lead to problems of privacy. such problems are more prominent when service providers, who have limited computational and storage resources, leverage on cloud platforms to fit in with the tremendous number of service requirements and users. in this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely applet, for protecting user privacy information, including locations and recommendation results, within a cloud environment. through this framework, all historical ratings are stored and calculated in ciphertext, allowing us to securely compute the similarities of venues through paillier encryption, and predict the recommendation results based on paillier, commutative, and comparable encryption. we also theoretically prove that user information is private and will not be leaked during a recommendation. finally, empirical results over a real-world dataset demonstrate that our framework can efficiently recommend pois with a high degree of accuracy in a privacy-preserving manner.
attention	the space-filling visualization model was first invented by ben shneiderman [28] for maximizing the utilization of display space in relational data (or graph) visualization, especially for tree visualization. it uses the concept of enclosure which dismisses the ""edges"" in the graphic representation that are all too frequently used in traditional node-link based graph visualizations. therefore, the major issue in graph visualization which is the edge crossing can be naturally solved through the adoption of a space filling approach. however in the past, the space-filling concept has not attracted much attention from researchers in the field of multidimensional visualization. although the problem of 'edge crossing' has also occurred among polylines which are used as the basic visual elements in the parallel coordinates visualization, it is problematic if those 'edge crossings' among polylines are not evenly distributed on the display plate as visual clutter will occur. this problem could significantly reduce the human readability in terms of reviewing a particular region of the visualization. in this study, we propose a new space-filling multidimensional data visualization (sfmdvis) that for the first-time introduces a space-filling approach into multidimensional data visualization. the main contributions are: (1) achieving the maximization of space utilization in multidimensional visualization (i.e. 100% of the display area is fully used), (2) eliminating visual clutter in sfmdvis through the use of the non-classic geometric primitive and (3) improving the quality of visualization for the visual perception of linear correlations among different variables as well as recognizing data patterns. to evaluate the quality of sfmdvis, we have conducted a usability study to measure the performance of sfmdvis in comparison with parallel coordinates and a scatterplot matrix for finding linear correlations and data patterns. the evaluation results have suggested that the accuracy of sfmdvis is better than both in terms of perceiving linear correlations and also that the sfmdvis is more efficient (less time is required) than both when recognizing data patterns. 2015 elsevier inc.

attention	extracellular vesicles (evs), including exosomes, play a key role in inter and intracellular communication, promoting the proliferation and invasion of recipient cells to support tumor growth and metastasis. metastasis comprises multiple steps that first include the detachment of tumor cells through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt), allowing the physical dissemination to distant organs. thereafter, cancer-derived exosomes are still critical components for preparing the tumor microenvironment by (i) enabling tumor cells to escape from the immunological surveillance and (ii) arranging the pre-metastatic site for the engraftment of detached cancer cells. in this review, we discuss the multifaceted role of evs in the multiple steps of metastasis. future research directions draw attention to evs as biological targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. however, due to their significant role in cell communication, they may become a valuable drug delivery system.
attention	here, we aimed our attention at the synthesis of carbon dots (c-dots) with the ability to interact with dna to suggest an approach for the detection of dna damage. primarily, c-dots modified with amine moieties were synthesized using the one-step microwave pyrolysis of citric acid in the presence of diethylenetriamine. the c-dots showed strong photoluminescence with a quantum yield of 4%. in addition, the c-dots (2.8 +/- 0.8 nm) possessed a good colloidal stability and exhibited a positive surface charge (zeta=36 mv) at a neutral ph. an interaction study of the c-dots and the dna fragment of lambda bacteriophage was performed, and the dna binding resulted in changes to the photoluminescent and absorption properties of the c-dots. a binding of the c-dots to dna was also observed as a change to dna electrophoretic mobility and a decreased ability to intercalate ethidium bromide (etbr). moreover, the forster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (fret) between the c-dots and etbr was studied, in which the c-dots serve as an excitation energy donor and the etbr serves as an acceptor. when dna was damaged using ultraviolet (uv) radiation (lambda=254 nm) and hydroxyl radicals, the intensity of the emitted photoluminescence at 612 nm significantly decreased. the concept was proved on analysis of the genomic dna from pc-3 cells and dna isolated from melanoma tissues.
attention	integrative medicine (im) has received increasing attention since the 1990s, but few studies have explored the key factors of the im model in health care. this study aimed to describe the im model in leading centers operating in the usa and germany. a 28-item structured survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted in six centers providing integrative medicine in the usa and germany, and were analyzed using a convergent mixed-method approach. the elements in common across all six centers were the following: (1) involvement of general physicians (gp) in delivering complementary and alternative medicine (cam) services; (2) requirement for gp or medical referral or recommendation to cam services; (3) involvement of an integrative physician (ip) as a ""gatekeeper""; (4) focus on research, education, and clinical practice; and (5) ongoing academic activities. the key elements differentiating the two countries were the following: (1) level of requirements for gp referral to cam services; (2) differences in im service delivery, including treatment modalities used; (3) accessibility of cam services to patients; (4) interaction between team members and patients; (5) perception of cam/im; and (6) perception of patient-centered care. themes underpinning these elements are the following: cultural aspects in conceptualizing im health care; communication within im programs; and resource availability for delivering im services, which impacts patient engagement and team collaboration in the im framework. delivering im health care requires a model of care that encourages interaction between all stakeholders. developing a comprehensive conceptual framework to support im practice is required to facilitate efficient and safe patient care.
eating_disorders	background: whether gastrointestinal motor and sensory function is primary cause or secondary effect of abnormal body weight is uncertain. moreover, studies relating continuous postprandial sensations of satiation to measurable pathology are scarce. this work assessed postprandial gastrointestinal function and concurrent sensations of satiation across a wide range of body weight and after weight change. methods: patients with anorexia nervosa (an) and obesity (ob) were investigated in reference to normal weight controls (hc). an were additionally investigated longitudinally. gastric emptying, antral contractions and oro-cecal transit after ingestion of a solid meal were investigated by mri and c-13-lactose-ureide breath test. the dependency of self-reported sensations of satiation on the varying degree of stomach filling during gastric emptying was compared between groups. results: 24 an (bmi 14.4 (11.9-16.0) kg/m(2)), 16 ob (34.9 (29.6-41.5) kg/m(2)) and 20 hc (21.9 (18.9-24.9) kg/m(2)) were studied. gastric half-emptying time (t(50)) was slower in an than hc (p = 0.016) and ob (p = 0.007), and a negative association between t(50) and bmi was observed between bmi 12 and 25 kg/m(2) (p = 0.007). antral contractions and oro-cecal transit were not different. for any given gastric content volume, self-reported postprandial fullness was greater in an than in hc or ob (p < 0.001). after weight rehabilitation, t(50) in an tended to become shorter (p = 0.09) and postprandial fullness was less marked (p < 0.01). conclusions: a relationship between body weight and gastric emptying as well as self-reported feelings of satiation is present. an have slower gastric emptying and heightened visceral perception compared to hc and ob. longitudinal follow-up after weight rehabilitation in an suggests these abnormalities are not a primary feature, but secondary to other factors that determine abnormal body weight.
eating_disorders	this study provides an evaluation of group schema therapy (st) for inpatient treatment of patients with personality pathology who did not respond to previous psychotherapeutic interventions. forty-two patients were assessed pre- and posttreatment, and 35 patients were evaluated at follow-up 6 months later. the results showed a dropout rate of 35%. those who dropped out did not differ from those who completed treatment with regard to demographic and clinical variables; the only exception was that those who dropped out showed a lower prevalence of mood disorders. furthermore, intention-to-treat analyses showed a significant improvement in maladaptive schemas, schema modes, maladaptive coping styles, mental well-being, and psychological distress after treatment, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. on the other hand, there was no significant change in experienced parenting style as self-reported by patients. changes in schemas and schema modes measured from pre- to posttreatment were predictive of general psychological distress at follow-up. overall, these preliminary findings suggest that positive treatment results can be obtained with group st-based inpatient treatment for patients who did not respond to previous psychotherapeutic interventions. moreover, these findings are comparable with treatment results for patients without such a nonresponsive treatment history.
eating_disorders	background.- iron plays an essential role in balancing the various metabolism in the body. it is also involved in the synthesis of several neurotransmitters. nutritional iron deficiency is one of the most widespread worldwide; it poses a great health challenge due to the consequences it entails. objectives.- the aim of this research study is to explore the percentage of psychiatric patients who have a deficiency in iron. in addition, the study investigates the efficacy of iron administered by oral treatment on psychiatric symptomatology among iron deficient patients. the research study utilized the martial biological results, which involved the observation of the level of iron deficiency among the outpatients of a local psychiatrist and assessor from the period of january 2012 until december 2013. methods.- out of 412 patients, 295 were women and 117 men. the age of the participants ranged from 16 to 89 years, with an average age of 45 years. the only exclusion criterion was a patient 's refusal or inability to take the prescribed iron assessment test. we considered a transferrin saturation coefficient (tsc) <30% and/or a serum ferritin level100 ng/ml. a single method was utilized in the various laboratories to analyse the blood samples to determine whether there was a deficiency in iron. only those patients with blood ferritin levels < 100 ng/ml and/or a tsc of <30% (335 patients) were subsequently given exclusively an oral iron treatment prescribed on its own or as a supplement or simultaneously with psychotropic treatment. the daily administered dose of elemental iron varied between 50 and 200 mg a day. results.- about half of the women- 145 (35.19% of the subjects)- and 15 men (3.64% of the subjects) certainly had a deficiency in iron (blood ferritin level100 ng/ml and some had tsc <= 30%, while the remaining patients' tsc was unknown because it was not measured. the results indicated that there is an iron deficiency in 198 out of 240 patients suffering mostly from mood and behavioural disorders, in 101 out of 126 patients suffering mostly from anxiety disorders, in 18 out of 27 patients suffering mostly from sleep disorders, in 14 out of 15 patients suffering mostly from delusions of persecution, and in the 4 patients suffering mostly from burn out. there was evidence of regression/remission of psychiatric symptoms in 193 responsive patients whereas the remaining 142 patients were considered non-responsive. in the responsive patient category, 37 participants were treated with just iron, 52 received iron supplemented to the initial psychotropic treatment which was not fully effective, and 104 patients were treated with iron and prescribed psychotropic drugs simultaneously. the iron treatment seems to bring about a reduction- particularly through its mono-aminergic neurotransmitter synthesis-promoting action- in hyperemotivity, anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, sadness, anhedonia, apathy, asthenia, sleep disorders, dysautonomia symptoms, eating disorders, restless-leg syndrome, cognitive performance and the likelihood of resorting to psychiatric admission. a daily elemental iron dose intake between 50 and 200 mg/day by deficient patients appears to likely enhance the effects of the psychotropic drugs and even to act as an actual antidepressant. many patients who received a prescription for iron and antidepressants showed few side effects related to antidepressants and a small number required psychiatric hospitalization. patients considered unresponsive to iron therapy were those who left the study, were not assessed because the study 's timeframe ended, still had an iron deficiency because they did not continuously take the medication, or suffered from somatic diseases which explains their resistance to treat the low iron level (nutritional imbalance, digestive or urinary or gynecological or iatrogenic diseases, sleep apnea). conclusion.- our clinical observation of two years in a local psychiatrist 's clinic revealed that over 80% of patients had iron deficiency. although the low iron level cannot explain all physical and psychiatric symptoms in patients, it is useful to note that more than half of the iron deficient patients responded favorably after an oral treatment of iron. this result leads to further investigation of the level of iron in psychiatric patients and to reconsider the iron range placed by the laboratories. in addition, it is crucial not to eliminate the possibility of iron deficiency in psychiatric patients. further research studies are needed to set more specific and detailed criteria to determine the range of iron deficiency in order to support the findings of this study and optimize the care given to patients suffering from various disorders and psychiatric syndromes.

eating_disorders	comprehensive models, targeting the development of eating disorders (eds) in males, often employ a sociocultural perspective and empathize the importance of body dissatisfaction (bd). to further illuminate psychological factors contributing to the development of ed pathology, we propose a mediator model of disturbed eating and compensatory behavior (decb) for men. this model suggests that emotion dysregulation and the susceptibility to body-related cognitive distortions (thought-shape fusion, tsf) mediate the relationship between bd and decb. based on data from a cross-sectional online-survey we tested our model in a non-clinical community sample of young men (n=123,18-37 years). we found a significant positive association between bd and decb, accounting for participant 's body mass index (bmi), age and depressive symptoms. while tsf partially mediated the relationship between bd and decb, we did not detect a corresponding effect for emotion dysregulation. based on our findings, we concluded that tsf, which describes specific distorted cognitions with respect to one 's own body triggered by fattening/forbidden food, contributes to the pathological eating- and body-related behavior in men who are dissatisfied with their body. we suggest that tsf should be included in etiological models as a relevant aspect of cognitive information processing with emotional and behavioral consequences.

eating_disorders	background: cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for unhealthy dieting behaviors (udbs) in youth. the role of alternative tobacco products and udb engagement has yet to be examined empirically despite concerning trends in use. this study aimed to examine udb prevalence in a u.s. geographic region- specific adolescent sample and associations with a variety of tobacco use behaviors and perceptions. methods: weighted data from the 2013 virginia youth survey were analyzed (n = 6903). udbs assessed included past 30-day fasting, diet pill use, and vomiting/laxative use. tobacco-related items were ever and past 30-day cigarette smoking, past 30-day smokeless tobacco and cigar use, and the perception that smokers have more friends. udb prevalence was recoded by the number of behaviors endorsed (0, 1, and 2+). bivariate and multinomial regression models were used to examine associations between covariates and number of udbs endorsed by gender. results: overall, nearly 16% engaged in at least one udb. fasting was most prevalent (14.2%) followed by vomiting/laxative (7.0%) and diet pill use (6.1%). across gender, ever cigarette smoking, past 30-day cigar use, and the perception that smokers have more friends were positively associated with udb engagement in relative isolation as well as in combination. conclusions: findings highlight the importance of tobacco-related factors for weight control behaviors and are the first to identify an association between udb incidence and an alternative tobacco product, cigars. this work should inform prevention efforts for tobacco use and udbs and underscores the need to address the use of any tobacco for weight control.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: in patients with borderline personality disorder (bpd), about 22-50% experience auditory verbal hallucinations (avh). however, the impact of these hallucinations on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, crisis-service interventions, and hospital admissions is unknown. methods: in a cross-sectional design, data were collected with the psychotic symptom rating scales (psyrats) and the mini international neuropsychiatric interview plus, as well as from the medical records of a convenience sample of outpatients fulfilling the dsm-iv criteria for bpd. results: of the 89 included patients, 27 experienced avh. in the latter group, the presence of avh was associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal plans and attempts in the month prior to study participation, more hospitalisations, and a shorter interval until hospitalisation. all subscales of the psyrats correlated positively with suicide plans, while the phenomenological and emotional subscales also correlated positively with suicide attempts. moreover, higher scores on the emotional subscale were associated with more hospital admissions. conclusions: avh experienced by patients with bpd might constitute a risk factor for suicide plans and attempts, and hospitalisation. this finding emphasises that this population requires adequate clinical attention, as well as effective treatment for avh.

borderline_personality_disorder	dissociative experiences, involving altered states of consciousness, have long been understood as a consequence or response to traumatic experiences, where a reduced level of consciousness may aid in survival during and after a traumatic event. indeed, the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd-ds) was added recently to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th edition (dsm-5). dissociative symptoms are present across a host of neuropsychiatric conditions, including ptsd, psychotic spectrum illnesses, anxiety and mood disorders. transdiagnostically, the presence of dissociative symptoms is associated with a greater illness burden and reduced treatment outcomes. critically, dissociative symptoms are related to impaired performance on measures of attention, executive functioning, memory, and social cognition and may contribute to the widespread cognitive dysfunction observed across psychiatric illnesses. despite this knowledge, the relation between dissociative symptoms and reduced cognitive function remains poorly understood. here, we review the evidence linking dissociative symptoms to cognitive dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders. in addition, we explore two potential neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie the relation between dissociative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in trauma-related neuropsychiatric conditions. specifically, we hypothesize that: 1) functional sensory deafferentation at the level of the thalamus, as observed in the defence cascade model of dissociation, may underlie reduced attention and arousal leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction and; 2) altered functional connectivity between key brain networks implicated in cognitive functioning may represent a critical neurobiological mechanism linking dissociative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in patients with ptsd-ds and transdiagnostically.

borderline_personality_disorder	background: temperament and character traits of adolescents with nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (nssi) might differentiate those-with and without comorbid borderline personality disorder (bpd). methods: participants were 57 female adolescents with nssi disorder without bpd (nssi-bpd), 14 adolescents with nssi disorder and bpd (nssi + bpd), 32 clinical controls (cc), and 64 nonclinical controls (nc). temperament and character traits were assessed with the junior temperament and character inventory, and impulsivity with the barratt impulsiveness scale and a go/nogo task. results: adolescents with nssi disorder scored significantly higher on novelty seeking and harm avoidance and lower on persistence, self-directedness, and cooperativeness than cc. the nssi + bpd group scored even higher than the nssi-bpd group on novelty seeking and harm avoidance and lower on persistence and cooperativeness (d >= 0.72). adolescents with nssi reported higher levels of impulsivity than the cc and nc group. however, this difference was not found in a go/nogo task. conclusions: the results provide further evidence for a distinct diagnostic entity of nssi disorder.
borderline_personality_disorder	basic emotion theory suggests that the effectiveness of different emotion regulation strategies vary with the intensity of the emotionally-salient stimulus. although findings from studies using healthy samples are concordant with what is proposed by theory, it is unclear whether these relationships hold true among individuals with borderline personality disorder (bpd). twenty-five individuals with bpd and 30 hcs were exposed to negative images of varying levels of emotional arousal and were instructed to either react as they normally would, distract, or use mindful awareness. self-reported negativity ratings, heart rate, and skin conductance level (scl) were monitored throughout. scl data indicated that increases in image arousal resulted in larger reductions in scl when distracting but not when implementing mindful awareness. self-report data suggested that, in hcs, the effectiveness of mindful awareness decreased to a greater extent than distraction when image arousal increased. these findings are consistent with basic emotion research and suggest that some forms of emotion regulation (distraction) are more suited to high emotion arousal contexts than others (mindful awareness) and that, compared with hcs, individuals with bpd may be more resilient to the deteriorating effectiveness of mindful awareness with respect to increasing emotional arousal.

borderline_personality_disorder	mental health professionals are increasingly aware of the need for competence in the treatment of clients with pornography-related concerns. however, while researchers have recently sought to explore efficacious treatments for pornography-related concerns, few explorations of potential clinical judgment issues have occurred. due to the sensitive, and at times uncomfortable, nature of client disclosures of sexual concerns within therapy, therapists are required to manage their own discomfort while retaining fidelity to treatment. the present paper explores clinician examples of judgment errors that may result from feelings of discomfort, and specifically from client use of pornography. issues of potential bias, bias management techniques, and therapeutic implications are discussed.
prosocial_behavior	humans exhibit extensive large-scale cooperation, of a form unprecedented in the natural world. here i suggest that this cooperation arises in our species alone because of our uniquely potent capacities for social learning, imitation and teaching, combined with the co-evolutionary feedbacks that these capabilities have generated on the human mind. culture took human populations down evolutionary pathways not available to non-cultural species, either by creating conditions that promoted established cooperative mechanisms, such as indirect reciprocity and mutualism, or by generating novel cooperative mechanisms not seen in other taxa, such as cultural group selection. in the process, gene-culture co-evolution seemingly generated an evolved psychology, comprising an enhanced ability and motivation to learn, teach, communicate through language, imitate and emulate, as well as predispositions to docility, social tolerance, and the sharing of goals, intentions and attention. this evolved psychology is entirely different from that observed in any other animal, or that could have evolved through conventional selection on genes alone.
prosocial_behavior	grandparenting has been proposed as an ultimate evolutionary mechanism that has contributed to the increase in human life expectancy (see the grandmother hypothesis). the neural and hormonal system originally rooted in parenting and thus grandparenting - that is activated in the process of caregiving has been suggested as a potential proximate mechanism that promotes engagement in prosocial behavior towards kin and non-kin alike. evidence and theory suggest that activating this caregiving system positively impacts health and may reduce the mortality of the helper. although some studies have found grandparental care to have beneficial effects on grandparents' health outcomes, most studies have focused on the detrimental health consequences of providing custodial care for grandchildren. little is known about how non-custodial grandparental and other forms of care giving relate to mortality hazards for the care provider. using an evolutionary framework, we examined whether caregiving within and beyond the family is related to mortality in older adults. survival analyses based on data from the berlin aging study revealed that mortality hazards for grandparents who provided non-custodial childcare were 37% lower than for grandparents who did not provide childcare and for non-grandparents. these associations held after controlling for physical health, age, socioeconomic status and various characteristics of the children and grandchildren. furthermore, the effect of caregiving extended to non-grandparents and to childless older adults who helped beyond their families. potential ultimate and proximate mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed.

prosocial_behavior	the aim of this paper is to analyze what proportion of variance of prosociality and aggressiveness predicts positive emotions (joy and gratitude, serenity and personal satisfaction), empathy (perspective taking and empathic concern), and social self-efficacy. since there is abundant research showing that there are significant differences in prosocial behavior and aggression by sex it is that these separate analyzes were performed on children. the sample consisted of 221 children of both sexes (42.2 % males), 10 to 13 years (m = 11.45, dt = .80), middle class, who attended primary schools in the city of buenos aires, argentina. the results indicate that both empathy and positive emotions are involved in predicting prosocial behavior in both boys and girls. however, it seems clear that in the case of boy 's empathy has greater predictive power that positive emotions, unlike girls where both variables seem to share similar power. on the other hand, social self-efficacy predicts prosocial behavior only in girls. finally, the results indicated that both empathy and positive emotions inhibit aggressive behavior in girls only.
prosocial_behavior	sharing materials is a complex social behavior that may lead to longterm development of friendships and concomitant increases in related prosocial behaviors. given the complexities of sharing behaviors, children with social delays or deficits may not recognize when, how, and with whom to share. because children with social delays or deficits, especially those with disabilities, may not engage in typical sharing behaviors, and because these behaviors are important, identifying interventions for sharing and related social behaviors are crucial. the purpose of this review was to identify sharing interventions, evaluate methodological rigor, and assess intervention effectiveness. twenty single-case designs published in 11 articles were included. some studies reported variable results and had considerable methodological limitations. results of high-quality studies are promising and provide a foundation for future research on sharing behaviors.
prosocial_behavior	previous communication studies have focused on how media content influences human aggression. few studies, however, have been conducted regarding the influence of situational variables on human aggression. regarding online gaming, the present study examines how game users' aggression is influenced by two idiosyncratic situational variables: ""degree of control"" (playing vs. watching) and ""degree of interaction"" (alone vs. together). the feeling of presence is also examined as a mediator to explicate the mechanism through which these situational variables influence the game users' levels of aggression. the results demonstrate that degree of control significantly affects users' aggression. aggression is increased when players actively participate in the game versus simply watching; situational factors that are associated with the way people engage in interactive media cause short-term shifts in players' aggression. implications and future research directions are discussed.
false_memories	in this case report, a legal case revolving around the reliability of statements given by a 6-year-old girl is described. she claimed to have witnessed her mother being murdered by her father. two psychological experts provided diametrically opposed opinions about the reliability of her statements. one expert, a clinician, opined that the girl 's statements were based on autosuggestion whereas the other expert, a memory researcher, stated that autosuggestion was unlikely to have played a role. this case and the analysis of the experts' opinions illustrate what may happen when experts in court are unaware of the recent literature on (false) memory. that is, recent studies show that autosuggestion is less likely to occur in young children than in older children and adults. the current case stresses the importance and implications of relying on memory experts in cases concerning the reliability of eyewitness statements.
false_memories	we examined the mechanisms involved in the development of the easily learned, easily remembered (eler) heuristic in three groups of young children (4-5 years, 6-7 years, and 8-9 years). a trial-to-acquisition procedure was used to evaluate how much these children 's judgment of learning depended on the eler heuristic. moreover, a new experimental paradigm, composed of six phases a pretest, four training phases, and a posttest was employed to implicitly influence the validity of the eler association that underlies this metacognitive rule. results revealed that the eler heuristic develops early (4-5 years), but its use is reduced after implicit training. furthermore, executive monitoring was found to account for the smaller changes observed in older children (8-9 years) after training. from a developmental perspective, these findings present a coherent picture of children 's learning of metacognitive heuristics, wherein early automatic and implicit learning is later followed by effortful control.

false_memories	we investigated how well structural features such as note density or the relative number of changes in the melodic contour could predict success in implicit and explicit memory for unfamiliar melodies. we also analyzed which features are more likely to elicit increasingly confident judgments of ""old"" in a recognition memory task. an automated analysis program computed structural aspects of melodies, both independent of any context, and also with reference to the other melodies in the testset and the parent corpus of pop music. a few features predicted success in both memory tasks, which points to a shared memory component. however, motivic complexity compared to a large corpus of pop music had different effects on explicit and implicit memory. we also found that just a few features are associated with different rates of ""old"" judgments, whether the items were old or new. rarer motives relative to the testset predicted hits and rarer motives relative to the corpus predicted false alarms. this data-driven analysis provides further support for both shared and separable mechanisms in implicit and explicit memory retrieval, as well as the role of distinctiveness in true and false judgments of familiarity.
false_memories	prior studies with schizophrenia patients described a reduced ability to discriminate between correct and false memories in terms of confidence compared to control groups. this metamemory bias has been associated with the emergence and maintenance of delusions. the relation to neuropsychological performance and other clinical dimensions is incompletely understood. in a cross-sectional study, metamemory functioning was explored in 32 schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy controls. metamemory was assessed using a verbal recognition task combined with retrospective confidence level ratings. associations of metamemory performance with six neuropsychological domains (executive functioning/problem solving, speed of processing, working memory, verbal and visual learning, and attention/vigilance) and psychopathological measures were analyzed. results revealed a significantly smaller discrepancy between confidence ratings for correct and incorrect recognitions in the patient group. furthermore, patients showed significantly lower recognition accuracy in the metamemory task and marked deficits in all neuropsychological domains. across all participants, metamemory performance significantly correlated with executive functioning and working memory. no associations with delusions were found. this data confirms prior findings of metamemory biases in schizophrenia. selective neuropsychological abilities seem to be modulating factors of metamemory functioning. longitudinal studies in at risk mental state and first-episode patients are needed to reveal causal interrelations.

false_memories	the purposes of this study were to: (1) assess child abuse professionals' and nonprofessionals' knowledge of scientific research findings that are relevant to forensic child sexual abuse (csa) evaluations and (2) describe associations between child abuse professionals' levels of research knowledge and their education and experience. an 18-item multiple-choice test was administered to 188 child abuse professionals and 457 nonprofessionals (undergraduate college students) in brazil and the united states. the nonprofessionals' average percent correct, m=44%, was not significantly different than what would be expected for random guessing (45%). the professionals' average percent correct, m=55%, was higher than that of nonprofessionals and random guessing (both ps<.001). the average percent correct score for the us-sample psychologists, m= 76%, was higher than the average score of the other professionals, m= 51%, p<.001. professionals' educational level, as measured by the highest academic degree obtained, was positively associated with percent correct scores, spearman 's rho=.46, p<.001. controlling for educational attainment, professional experience, as measured by the total number of csa evaluations performed, was weakly associated with percent correct scores, partial r=.15, p=.04. percent correct scores were low for both nonprofessionals and professionals. most of the participants in this study were uninformed or misinformed about scientific research findings that are important for conducting optimal forensic csa evaluations and for making accurate judgments about the validity of sexual abuse allegations.

problem-solving	governance silos are settings in which different organizations work in isolation and avoid sharing information and strategies. siloes are a fundamental challenge for environmental planning and problem solving, which generally requires collaboration. siloes can be overcome by creating governance networks. studying the structure and function of these networks is important for understanding how to create institutional arrangements that can respond to the biophysical dynamics of a specific natural resource system (i.e., social-ecological, or institutional fit). using the case of salmon restoration in a sub basin of puget sound, usa, we assess network integration, considering three different reasons for network collaborations (i.e., mandated, funded, and shared interest relationships) and analyze how these different collaboration types relate to productivity based on practitioner 's assessments. we also illustrate how specific and targeted network interventions might enhance the network, to do so, we use a mixed methods approach that combines quantitative social network analysis (sna) and qualitative interview analysis. overall, the sub-basin 's governance network is fairly well integrated, but several concerning gaps exist. funded, mandated, and shared interest relationships lead to different network patterns. mandated relationships are associated with lower productivity than shared interest relationships, highlighting the benefit of genuine collaboration in collaborative watershed governance. lastly, quantitative and qualitative data comparisons strengthen recent calls to incorporate geographic space and the role of individual actors versus organizational culture into natural resource governance research using sna.

problem-solving	persons with intellectual disability are a group at risk of being exposed to overly demanding problem-solving situations, which may produce learned helplessness. the research was based on the informational model of learned helplessness.the consequences of exposure to an unsolvable task and the ability to recognize the symptoms of cognitive exhaustion were tested in 120 students with mild intellectual disability. after the exposure to the unsolvable task, persons in the experimental group obtained lower results than the control group in the escape/avoidance learning task, but a similar result was found in the divergent thinking fluency task. also, participants in the experimental group had difficulties recognizing the symptoms of the cognitive exhaustion state. after a week 's time, the difference in escape/avoidance learning performance was still observed. the results indicate that exposure to unsolvable tasks may negatively influence the cognitive performance in persons with intellectual disability, although those persons may not identify the cognitive state related to lowered performance.
problem-solving	according to evidence from recent decades, multicomponent programs of psychological intervention in people with chronic pain have reached the highest levels of efficacy. however, there are still many questions left to answer since efficacy has mainly been shown among upper-middle class patients in english-speaking countries and in controlled studies, with expert professionals guiding the intervention and with a limited number of domains of painful experience evaluated. for this study, a program of multicomponent psychological intervention was implemented: (a) based on techniques with empirical evidence, but developed in spain; (b) at a public primary care center; (c) among patients with limited financial resources and lower education; (d) by a novice psychologist; and (e) evaluating all domains of painful experience using the instruments recommended by the initiative on methods, measurement, and pain assessment in clinical trials (immpact). the aim of this study was to evaluate this program. we selected a consecutive sample of 40 patients treated for chronic non-cancer pain at a primary care center in utrera (seville, spain), adults who were not in any employment dispute, not suffering from psychopathology, and not receiving psychological treatment. the patients participated in 10 psychological intervention sessions, one per week, in groups of 13-14 people, which addressed psychoeducation for pain; breathing and relaxation; attention management; cognitive restructuring; problem-solving; emotional management; social skills; life values and goal setting; time organization and behavioral activation; physical exercise promotion; postural and sleep hygiene; and relapse prevention. in addition to the initial assessment, measures were taken after the intervention and at a 6-month follow-up. we assessed the program throughout the process: before, during and after the implementation. results were analyzed statistically (significance and effect size) and from a clinical perspective (clinical significance according to immpact standards). according to this analysis, the intervention was successful, although improvement tended to decline at follow-up, and the detailed design gave the program assessment a high degree of standardization and specification. finally, suggestions for improvement are presented for upcoming applications of the program.
problem-solving	utilizing qualitative data gleaned from focus groups with adolescent girls participating in a cybersecurity summer program (n=38, mean age=16.3), this study examines the following research questions: (a) how do adolescent girls perceive the cybersecurity field? (b) what are the promising practices that engage girls in cybersecurity education? guided by ecological and social role theories, findings reveal that single-sex collaborative settings with encouraging and supportive teachers and female mentors are practices that contribute to girls' increased interest in the field of cybersecurity. findings also suggest that an emphasis on creative and collaborative problem-solving processes and the real-world application inherent to cybersecurity are likely to increase girls' engagement in the field. results have implications for educators, researchers, and policy makers aiming to close gender gaps in the field of computer science and build interest in cybersecurity, an area of critical national need.
problem-solving	despite much attention including national initiatives, concerns remain about the approaches to managing behavior symptoms and psychiatric conditions across all settings, including in long-term care settings such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities. one key reason why problems persist is because most efforts to ""reform"" and ""correct"" the situation have failed to explore or address root causes and instead have promoted inadequate piecemeal ""solutions."" further improvement requires jumping off the bandwagon and rethinking the entire issue, including recognizing and applying key concepts of clinical reasoning and the care delivery process to every situation. the huge negative impact of cognitive biases and rote approaches on related clinical problem solving and decision making and patient outcomes also must be addressed.

prejudice	the global increase in cultural and religious diversity has led to calls for toleration of group differences to achieve intergroup harmony. although much social-psychological research has examined the nature of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, and its impact on targets of these biases, little research has examined the nature and impact of toleration for intergroup relations. toleration does not require that people give up their objections to out-group norms and practices but rather mutual accommodation. integrating research from various social sciences, we explore the nature of intergroup tolerance including its three components objection, acceptance, and rejection while drawing out its implications for future social psychological research. we then explore some psychological consequences to social groups that are the object of toleration. by doing so, we consider the complex ways in which intergroup tolerance impacts both majority and minority groups and the dynamic interplay of both in pluralistic societies.
prejudice	background: past scholarly efforts to describe and measure the stigma surrounding suicide have largely viewed suicide stigma from the perspective of the general public. aims: in the spirit of community-based participatory research (cbpr), the current study brought together a diverse stakeholder team to qualitatively investigate the suicide stigma as experienced by those most intimately affected by suicide. method: seven focus groups (n = 62) were conducted with suicide attempt survivors, family members of those who died by suicide, and suicide loss therapists. results: themes were derived for stereotypes (n = 30), prejudice (n = 3), and discrimination (n = 4). people who attempted suicide were seen as attention-seeking, selfish, incompetent, emotionally weak, and immoral. participants described personal experiences of prejudice and discrimination, including those with health professionals. conclusion: participants experienced public stigma, self-stigma, and label avoidance. analyses reveal that the stigma of suicide shares similarities with stereotypes of mental illness, but also includes some important differences. attempt survivors may be subject to double stigma, which impedes recovery and access to care.
prejudice	this study undertakes an empirical exploration of attitudes towards tax evasion and welfare fraud in new zealand. prior research indicates that society has different attitudes towards these two crimes. however, it is not known why this is the case, particularly as both crimes are conceptually similar. the study has two aims. the first is to measure the extent to which society views tax evasion and welfare fraud differently in new zealand. the second, and primary, objective of this research is to offer an explanation for why different views exist. the dual-process model, using social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism is used for analytical purposes. responses from 1500 survey participants show that new zealanders do have different attitudes towards welfare fraud and tax evasion. in contrast to previous research findings, this study shows that harsher attitudes are held towards tax evasion than welfare fraud. education and income level provide the greatest level of significance in explaining attitudes towards welfare fraud; and age and income source provide the greatest level of significance in explaining attitudes towards tax evasion.
prejudice	the present study examined legal perceptions of lesbian intimate partner violence (ipv) in an experimental context. undergraduate women and men from the southeastern united states (n = 217) read a trial summary in which the defendant was charged with physically assaulting her same-sex partner. the trial varied as to whether the victim and defendant were depicted via images as either feminine or masculine. participants rendered verdicts and made judgments about the victim and defendant (e.g., credibility). results indicated that the victim 's and defendant 's masculine or feminine appearance affected these judgments. female participants viewed a masculine victim as more credible than a feminine victim when the defendant was masculine. when the victim was masculine, they viewed a masculine defendant as more responsible for the victim 's injuries than a feminine defendant. male participants had higher sympathy for a masculine versus feminine victim overall, but had more anger toward a masculine defendant versus a feminine defendant accused of assaulting a feminine victim. finally, fewer participants mentioned the defendant 's history of violence as a reason for a guilty of felony verdict for a feminine victim with a feminine defendant versus all other combinations of victim and defendant masculine/feminine appearance. results are discussed in terms of gender stereotypes influencing legal decision-making in ipv cases among lesbian couples.
prejudice	we introduce a heuristic called pseudocontingencies (pcs) as an alternative account of various stereotyping phenomena. pcs give rise to the expectation that attributes are correlated based solely on asymmetries in attribute base rates. attributes that are encountered frequently and attributes that are encountered rarely are perceived to be correlated with each other. such differences in information densities are typical of many stereotyped targets, including the self vs. others, the in-group vs. out-groups and majority vs. minority groups. evidence is reviewed for pcs underlying illusory correlations, confirmation biases, gender stereotypes, simpson 's paradox, and in procedures used for implicit stereotype measurement. pcs are shown to predict specific patterns of self-enhancement and self-depreciation, the effects of intergroup contact on in-group biases and the readiness to infer stereotypes from aggregated ""big-data"". although pcs can lead to seriously flawed stereotypic expectations, they afford an efficient and possibly adaptive inference strategy.
antisocial_personality_disorder	psychopathy research is plagued by an enigma: psychopaths reliably act immorally, but they also accurately report whether an action is morally wrong. the current study revealed that cooperative suppressor effects and conflicting subsets of personality traits within the construct of psychopathy might help explain this conundrum. among a sample of adult male offenders (n = 100) who ranked deserved punishment of crimes, psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r) total scores were not linearly correlated with deserved punishment task performance. however, these null results masked significant opposing associations between task performance and factors of psychopathy: the pcl-r interpersonal/affective (i.e., manipulative and callous) factor was positively associated with task performance, while the pcl-r social deviance (i.e., impulsive and antisocial) factor was simultaneously negatively associated with task performance. these relationships were qualified by a significant interaction where the interpersonal/affective traits were positively associated with task performance when social deviance traits were high, but social deviance traits were negatively associated with task performance when interpersonal/affective traits were low. this interaction helped reveal a significant nonlinear relationship between pcl-r total scores and task performance such that individuals with very low or very high pcl-r total scores performed better than those with middle-range pcl-r total scores. these results may explain the enigma of why individuals with very high psychopathic traits, but not other groups of antisocial individuals, usually have normal moral judgment in laboratory settings, but still behave immorally, especially in contexts where social deviance traits have strong influence.
antisocial_personality_disorder	in the present study, operationally defined aggressive behavior of 6 males with antisocial personality disorder (aspd) was measured following acute intranasal oxytocin dosing (12, 24, and 48 international units) and placebo, using a well-validated laboratory task of human aggression (point subtraction aggression paradigm, or psap). the psap provides participants with concurrently available monetary-earning and operationally defined aggressive response options, maintained by fixed ratio schedules of consequences. shifts in response rates and interresponse time (irt) distributions were observed on the aggressive response option following oxytocin doses, relative to placebo. few changes were observed in monetary-reinforced responding. however, across participants the direction and magnitude of changes in aggressive responding were not systematically related to dose. no trends were observed between psychometric or physiological data and oxytocin dosing or aggressive behavior. while this report is to our knowledge the first to examine the acute effects of oxytocin in this population at high risk for violence and other forms of antisocial behavior, several limitations in the experimental design and the results cast the study as a preliminary report. strategies for more extensive future projects are discussed.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this study tested the predictive value of attentional bias, emotion recognition, automatic associations, and response inhibition, in the assessment of in-clinic violent incidents. sixty-nine male forensic patients participated and completed an emotional stroop to measure attentional bias for threat and aggression, a single target - implicit association task to assess automatic associations, a graded emotional recognition task to measure emotion recognition, and an affective go/nogo to measure response inhibition. violent incidents were derived from patient files and scored on severity level. the predictive value of level of psychopathy was tested with the psychopathy checklist - revised (pcl-r). generalized linear mixed model analyses showed that increased attention towards threat and aggression, difficulty recognizing sad faces and factor 2 of the pcl-r predicted the sum of violent incidents. specifically, verbal aggression was predicted by increased attention towards threat and aggression, difficulty to recognize sad and happy faces, and pcl-r factor 2; physical aggression by decreased response inhibition, higher pcl-r factor 2 and lower pcl-r factor 1 scores; and aggression against property by difficulty recognizing angry faces. findings indicate that cognitive tasks could be valuable in predicting aggression, thereby extending current knowledge on dynamic factors predicting aggressive behavior in forensic patients.

antisocial_personality_disorder	offenders with antisocial personality disorder (aspd) may be characterized by a lack in emotional functioning that manifests in irritability and a lack of remorse. the proposed link between aspd and negative emotionality led to the question of emotional processing anomalies in aspd. furthermore, the effect of childhood maltreatment/abuse on emotional processing was tested in the present study. violent and sexual offenders with aspd (n=35), without aspd (n=34), and healthy non-criminal controls (n=24) were compared in an emotional stroop task (est) using neutral, negative, and violence-related words. secondary analyses focused on the effect of psychopathic traits and childhood maltreatment. offenders with aspd showed a stronger attentional bias to violence-related and negative words as compared to controls. comparable results were obtained when grouping offenders to high, medium, and low psychopathic subgroups. offenders with childhood maltreatment specifically showed stronger violence-related attentional bias than non-maltreated offenders. the data suggest that enhanced attention to violence-related stimuli in adult criminal offenders is associated with adverse developmental experiences and delinquency but to a lesser extent with antisocial or psychopathic traits.

antisocial_personality_disorder	domestic homicide is the most extreme form of domestic violence and one of the most common types of homicide. the objective was to examine differences between spontaneous domestic homicide and nondomestic homicide offenders regarding demographics, psychiatric history, crime characteristics, and neuropsychological status, utilizing neuropsychological test data from forensic examinations of 153 murderers. using standard crime classification criteria, 33% committed spontaneous domestic homicides (sdh) and 61% committed nondomestic homicides (ndh). sdh offenders were more likely to manifest psychotic disorders, but less likely to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder or to have prior felony convictions. sdh offenders manifested significantly worse neuropsychological impairments than ndh offenders. the mean number of victims was lower for the sdh than the ndh group and only 14% of sdh offenders used a firearm, whereas 59% of ndh offenders used a firearm. these findings corroborate the notion that spontaneous domestic homicide may represent a discernible criminological phenotype.
nonverbal_communication	objective: the aim of this study was to examine eye gaze patterns between patients and physicians while electronic health records were used to support patient care. background: eye gaze provides an indication of physician attention to patient, patient/physician interaction, and physician behaviors such as searching for information and documenting information. methods: a field study was conducted where 100 patient visits were observed and video recorded in a primary care clinic. videos were then coded for gaze behaviors where patients' and physicians' gaze at each other and artifacts such as electronic health records were coded using a pre-established objective coding scheme. gaze data were then analyzed using lag sequential methods. results: results showed that there are several eye gaze patterns significantly dependent to each other. all doctor-initiated gaze patterns were followed by patient gaze patterns. some patient-initiated gaze patterns were also followed by doctor gaze patterns significantly unlike the findings in previous studies. health information technology appears to contribute to some of the new significant patterns that have emerged. differences were also found in gaze patterns related to technology that differ from patterns identified in studies with paper charts. several sequences related to patient-doctor-technology were also significant. electronic health records affect the patient-physician eye contact dynamic differently than paper charts. conclusion: this study identified several patterns of patient-physician interaction with electronic health record systems. consistent with previous studies, physician initiated gaze is an important driver of the interactions between patient and physician and patient and technology. published by elsevier ireland ltd.
nonverbal_communication	using the developmental play assessment, this preliminary study described the categories and levels of play with objects produced by 10 young boys with diagnoses of full mutation fragile x syndrome, the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability. additionally, the study examined concurrent associations between child characteristics and three different summary level variables representing object play skills. presentation combinations (i.e., recreating structured configurations of objects) was the highest play level emerging or mastered for all participants. the number of toys touched during the play sample, an index of object interest, was positively related to standardized measures of receptive and expressive language while the number of different actions produced, an index of play diversity, was negatively related to autism symptom severity. both variables were significantly related to the number of nonverbal communication acts children produced while interacting with their mothers in play. clinical implications and future directions are discussed. learning outcomes: readers will be able to: (1) define a framework for categorizing developmental levels of play; (2) discuss the constructs represented by three different summary level metrics of play with objects; (3) describe the relationship between object-play skills and child characteristics for young males with fxs.

nonverbal_communication	classroom observation is an important part of language teacher education (kelly & grenfell 2004) but its effects could be enhanced through observation and guided analysis of video-recorded lessons. as a matter of fact, focus on teacher talk and on its specific conversational patterns (sinclair 1982, sinclair & brazil 1982) could be of great benefit on teacher education. moreover, digital data (audio, video and text) presenting natural speech in context would be a relevant tool for teacher trainers, in order to help their trainees to develop teaching awareness and interaction ability, especially if such data are easily and freely accessible and properly treated through new methods of computer-based multimodal analysis. in this study we have analysed, through a multimodal approach, teacher talk questioning in several l2 and ls italian classrooms. questioning is one of the most common techniques used by teachers (richards, 1996) and serves as the principal way in which teachers control the classroom interaction. in some classrooms over half of class time is taken up by question-and-answer exchanges (richards, 1996). we have focused on two main types of questions: display questions and referential questions. through the usage of some video-recorded lessons, transcribed and subtitled, we have investigated the presence and relevance of non-linguistic patterns, that match with regularity with these linguistic phenomena. particularly, we have examined specific non-verbal and para-verbal activities made by the speakers, tightly linked to the various types of questions, and we have noted that there are recurring behaviours used together with the over mentioned linguistic structures, to express specific communicative and didactic scopes and functions, that is to say to build and spread knowledge in a l2/ls italian classroom.
nonverbal_communication	purpose prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (psa) is a controversial issue. the present study aimed to explore physician behaviors during an unannounced standardized patient encounter that was part of a randomized controlled trial to educate physicians using a prostate cancer screening, interactive, web-based module. methods participants included 118 internal medicine and family medicine physicians from 5 health systems in california, in 2007-2008. control physicians received usual education about prostate cancer screening (brochures from the center for disease control and prevention). intervention physicians participated in the prostate cancer screening module. within 3 months, all physicians saw unannounced standardized patients who prompted prostate cancer screening discussions in clinic. the encounter was audio-recorded, and the recordings were transcribed. authors analyzed physician behaviors around screening: (1) engagement after prompting, (2) degree of shared decision making, and (3) final recommendations for prostate cancer screening. results after prompting, 90% of physicians discussed prostate cancer screening. in comparison with control physicians, intervention physicians showed somewhat more shared decision making behaviors (intervention 14 items vs control 11 items, p < .05), were more likely to mention no screening as an option (intervention 63% vs control 26%, p < .05), to encourage patients to consider different screening options (intervention 62% vs control 39%, p < .05) and seeking input from others (intervention 25% vs control 7%, p < .05). conclusions a brief web-based interactive educational intervention can improve shared decision making, neutrality in recommendation, and reduce psa test ordering. engaging patients in discussion of the uses and limitations of tests with uncertain value can decrease utilization of the tests.
nonverbal_communication	uncertainty monitoring is a core property of metacognition, allowing individuals to adapt their decision-making strategies depending on the state of their knowledge. although it has been argued that other animals share these metacognitive abilities, only humans seem to possess the ability to explicitly communicate their own uncertainty to others. it remains unknown whether this capacity is present early in development, or whether it emerges later with the ability to verbally report one 's own mental states. here, using a nonverbal memory-monitoring paradigm, we show that 20-month-olds can monitor and report their own uncertainty. infants had to remember the location of a hidden toy before pointing to indicate where they wanted to recover it. in an experimental group, infants were given the possibility to ask for help through nonverbal communication when they had forgotten the toy location. compared with a control group in which infants had no other option but to decide by themselves, infants given the opportunity to ask for help used this option strategically to improve their performance. asking for help was used selectively to avoid making errors and to decline difficult choices. these results demonstrate that infants are able to successfully monitor their own uncertainty and share this information with others to fulfill their goals.
leadership	purpose: to identify, evaluate and synthesise studies examining the barriers and enablers for survivors of critical illness to participate in physical activity in the icu and post-icu settings from the perspective of patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. methods: systematic review of articles using five electronic databases: medline, cinahl, embase, cochrane library, scopus. quantitative and qualitative studies that were published in english in a peer-reviewed journal and assessed barriers or enablers for survivors of critical illness to perform physical activity were included. prospero id: crd42016035454. results: eighty-nine papers were included. five major themes and 28 sub-themes were identified, encompassing: (1) patient physical and psychological capability to perform physical activity, including delirium, sedation, illness severity, comorbidities, weakness, anxiety, confidence and motivation; (2) safety influences, including physiological stability and concern for lines, e.g. risk of dislodgement; (3) culture and team influences, including leadership, interprofessional communication, administrative buy-in, clinician expertise and knowledge; (4) motivation and beliefs regarding the benefits/risks; and (5) environmental influences, including funding, access to rehabilitation programs, staffing and equipment. conclusions: the main barriers identified were patient physical and psychological capability to perform physical activity, safety concerns, lack of leadership and icu culture of mobility, lack of interprofessional communication, expertise and knowledge, and lack of staffing/equipment and funding to provide rehabilitation programs. barriers and enablers are multidimensional and span diverse factors. the majority of these barriers are modifiable and can be targeted in future clinical practice.
leadership	the importance of leadership for improving educational outcomes in schools has been widely promoted. however, the nature of leadership practices, in context, has received less attention in the educational leadership literature. in this article, we present a case study of the specific leadership practices that developed in one school site serving the learning needs of students in a complex, diverse, low socio-economic community in south-east queensland, australia. rather than focusing on the person/role of 'the leader', or various leadership qualities/traits, we examine the nature and particularity of the leadership practices as praxis, across a variety of roles and dispositions, as developed within the school. to help make sense of the praxis and particularity of educational leadership practices, we draw upon recent neo-aristotelian practice theory to reveal the specific actions ( 'doings'), dialogue ( 'sayings') and relationships ( 'relatings'), which constituted leadership-in-practice, as praxis. these 'doing', 'sayings' and 'relatings' for praxis were evident in: formal leadership practices responsive to the context and history of the particular school site; formal and informal leadership practices involved in establishing a 'leadership group' within the school to address students' needs, and; and informal leadership practices focused on cultivating teacher learning for student learning. such an approach does not simply reinforce sedimented notions of what constitutes 'educational leadership', but sheds new light upon the nature of 'leading practices for praxis'.
leadership	without power and political authority, planning theorists' advice for planners to be politically astute is of little help. the politically astute planners could do little in the face of political pressure. in this context, the logical advice for planners would be to join politics and acquire the political authority that they need to materialize their plans. this article, through case studies from the united states, brazil, and nepal, shows that the planners who joined politics were able to accomplish some of the most difficult planning tasks in their towns and suggests that planners should take up elected position as and when possible.
leadership	understood in economic terms, interest elevates baser human impulses and degrades higher human potential as it motivates individuals to value material gains over moral ones. because of this influence, it is difficult to consider interest as a regime value. but just because it is beleaguered does not mean it ought to be abandoned, especially because interest is placed front and center in the constitutional order. providing a perspective of the merits of interest, alexis de tocqueville offers a conceptualization that allows this regime value to be relevant even for contemporary administrators operating in spaces of diffused public responsibility.
leadership	family firms play a significant role in the global economy. although family firm literature has devoted much time and effort to investigating topics concerning corporate governance, leadership, ownership and succession, accounting issues have received relatively scant attention. in this paper, we assemble and critically review extant literature on the choice of management controls. this is an essential topic for firms as management control systems (mcs) are used to make sure subordinates behave in function of the goals of the firm. family firms, however, have distinct features, such as differences in governance structures and goals, which can have a significant impact on whether and how mcs are used. we conclude this review paper by providing avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of both the determinants and the outcomes of the choice of mcs.
child_abuse	the role of the veterinary forensic pathologist in the investigation of animal abuse or neglect can go beyond documenting the condition of animals presented as evidence. although animal cruelty is a moral concern and a crime in itself, law enforcement response to such crimes is often enhanced by the recognition that crimes against animals can be both indicators of other ongoing crimes against people and predictors of the potential for interpersonal violence. an understanding of common motives underlying animal cruelty can aid the pathologist in asking appropriate questions. the authors review the forms of pathology evidence commonly seen in various presentations of animal cruelty. understanding these forms of evidence can help the pathologist describe findings that can be significant for assessing the potential risks the alleged perpetrator may pose to other animals and humans.
child_abuse	objectives: to develop and provide validity evidence for a performance checklist to evaluate the child abuse screening behaviors of prehospital providers. methods: checklist development: we developed the first iteration of the checklist after review of the relevant literature and on the basis of the authors' clinical experience. next, a panel of six content experts participated in three rounds of delphi review to reach consensus on the final checklist items. checklist validation: twenty-eight emergency medical services (ems) providers (16 emt-basics, 12 emt-paramedics) participated in a standardized simulated case of physical child abuse to an infant followed by one-on-one semi-structured qualitative interviews. three reviewers scored the videotaped performance using the final checklist. light 's kappa and cronbach 's alpha were calculated to assess inter-rater reliability (irr) and internal consistency, respectively. the correlation of successful child abuse screening with checklist task completion and with participant characteristics were compared using pearson 's chi squared test to gather evidence for construct validity. results: the delphi review process resulted in a final checklist that included 24 items classified with trichotomous scoring (done, not done, or not applicable). the overall irr of the three raters was 0.70 using light 's kappa, indicating substantial agreement. internal consistency of the checklist was low, with an overall cronbach 's alpha of 0.61. of 28 participants, only 14 (50%) successfully screened for child abuse in simulation. participants who successfully screened for child abuse did not differ significantly from those who failed to screen in terms of training level, past experience with child abuse reporting, or self-reported confidence in detecting child abuse (all p >0.30). of all 24 tasks, only the task of exposing the infant significantly correlated with successful detection of child abuse (p < 0.05). conclusions: we developed a child abuse checklist that demonstrated strong content validity and substantial inter-rater reliability, but successful item completion did not correlate with other markers of provider experience. the validated instrument has important potential for training, continuing education, and research for prehospital providers at all levels of training.
child_abuse	clause 13 of the united nations convention on the rights of the child states that children have the right 'to seek, receive or impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in art or in any other media of the child 's voice'. however, there is one area in which this directive is constrained in various countries by domestic regulations curtailing children 's access to information. that area is human sexuality. the arguments for and against children 's access to sex education are well rehearsed. in this article, the author pursues a different angle, looking instead at the increasing restrictions placed upon young people 's ability to imagine and communicate with each other about sexual issues, particularly in online settings. the advent of the internet and a range of social networking sites have not only enabled young people to access previously quarantined information about sexuality, but also to actively engage in forms of 'intimate citizenship' online. in this article, the author focuses on young people 's online fan communities which use characters from popular culture such as harry potter or a range of japanese manga and animation to imagine and explore sexual issues. 'child abuse publications legislation' in australia and elsewhere now criminalizes the representation of even imaginary characters who are or may only 'appear to be' under the age of 18 in sexual scenarios. hence these children and young people are in danger of being charged with the offence of manufacturing and disseminating child pornography. despite research into these fandoms that indicates that they are of positive benefit to young people in developing 'sexual literacies', there is increasingly diminishing space for young people under the age of 18 to imagine or communicate about sexuality, even in the context of purely fictional scenarios.
child_abuse	this study examined the relationship between different areas of family need and the utilization of home-based, post-investigation services (hbps) following a child protective services (cps) investigation. the sample consisted of 2598 families with children who remained at home after an initial cps investigation between july 2006 and april 2011. family need was measured in three areas (concrete, clinical, and educational) using the family assessment form (faf), and families received one or more of the following hbps: case management, concrete, educational, and clinical services. pearson chi-square analyses were utilized to identify significant areas of needs to be included in a final multivariate logistic regression for each hbps while controlling for demographic characteristics. numerous areas of family need were associated with receipt of services intended to address those needs. specifically, concrete need related to financial conditions was met with concrete services, educational need related to child development (an indicator of parenting need) was met with educational services, and clinical need related to interactions between caregivers (a potential indicator of domestic violence) was met with clinical services. in contrast, caregivers with concrete need related to living conditions were less likely to receive both educational and clinical services. findings from the study highlight that matching concrete needs to related services is relatively straightforward but that the match between educational and clinical needs to respective services is more complex. we discuss the complexities of matching different areas of need and hbps following a cps investigation and the importance of ""bridging services"" to engage families at risk of maltreatment in additional prevention services. published by elsevier ltd.
child_abuse	background: an extremely high percentage of children worldwide are exposed to stress from the first months of life. the aim of this review is to bring together the experimental results related to chronic early-life stress in both human and experimental models. methods: we aimed to achieve our objective via a thorough review of the literature. results: early-life stress is a challenge for the developing organism and leads to negative effects in the medium and long term. the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domains are compromised due to alterations produced in the nervous system, with some of the most important being related to the main neurotransmission systems. conclusions: by using experimental models, it is possible to address the study of the structural and functional changes resulting from early-life stress and, thus, plan intervention and prevention alternatives.
gender_roles	background ""gender"" reflects social norms for women and men, whereas ""sex"" defines biological characteristics. gender-related characteristics explain some differences in access to care for premature acute coronary syndrome (acs); whether they are associated with cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. objectives this study estimated associations between gender and sex with recurrent acs and major adverse cardiac events (mace) (e.g., acs, cardiac mortality, revascularization) over 12 months in patients with acs. methods we studied 273 women and 636 men age 18 to 55 years from genesis-praxy (gender and sex determinants of cardiovascular disease: from bench to beyond-premature acute coronary syndrome), a prospective observational cohort study, who were hospitalized for acs between january 2009 and april 2013. gender-related characteristics (e.g., social roles) were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, and a composite measure of gender was derived. outcomes included recurrent acs and mace over 12 months. results feminine roles and personality traits were associated with higher rates of recurrent acs and mace compared with masculine characteristics. this difference persisted for recurrent acs, after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio from score 0 to 100: 4.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 19.27), and was a nonstatistically significant trend for mace (hazard ratio: 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.90 to 2.66). a possible explanation is increased anxiety, the only condition that was more prevalent in patients with feminine characteristics and that rendered the association between gender and recurrent acs nonstatistically significant (hazard ratio: 3.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 15.61). female sex was not associated with outcomes post-acs. conclusions younger adults with acs with feminine gender are at an increased risk of recurrent acs over 12 months, independent of female sex.

gender_roles	honor values articulate gender roles, the importance of reputation in maintaining one 's place in society, and maintaining respect for the groups one belongs to. in that sense honor provides a template for organizing social interactions and hence may be functional even among people and societies that do not report valuing and endorsing honor. we test the prediction that honor influences judgment and attention when activated in two experiments (n = 538). using a culture-as-situated cognition perspective, we predicted that activating one aspect of honor would activate other aspects, even among individuals who do not much endorse honor values. we tested these predictions among european americans, a group that is not typically associated with honor values. in each study, participants were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, which differed in one way: the experimental group read statements about honor values as a first step and the control group did not. participants then judged stick-figure pairs (judging which is male; study 1, n = 130) or made lexical decisions (judging whether a letter-string formed a correctly spelled word; study 2, n = 408). in study 1, experimental group participants were more likely to choose the visually agentic figure as male. in study 2, experimental group participants were more accurate at noticing that the letter string formed a word if the word was an honor-relevant word (e.g., noble), but they did not differ from the control group if the word was irrelevant to honor (e.g., happy). participants in both studies were just above the neutral point in their endorsement of honor values. individual differences in honor values endorsement did not moderate the effects of activating an honor mindset. though honor is often described as if it is located in space, we did not find clear effects of where our letter strings were located on the computer screen. our findings suggest a new way to consider how honor functions, even in societies in which honor is not a highly endorsed value.
gender_roles	traditionally, sport has been a heteronormative domain space in which women and men with different sexual orientations have been rejected as transgressing and questioning the 'heteronormative patriarchy'. in recent years, spanish society seems to have changed and a more tolerant and respectful climate of diversity has been created. however, there are no current studies analysing this situation in sport in spain. in this work, an attitude scale towards sexual diversity in sport is presented. the initial version of the 32 item questionnaire was completed by 414 athletes of both genders, whose ages ranged from 13 to 44 years old (m = 21.72, sd = 4.48). the validity of the content of the initial battery of items was analysed by four experts. afterwards, two successive exploratory factor analyses were carried out to assess internal validity determining a scale of 18 items and adequate internal consistency reliability (alpha =.904). the results also show that there are four factors that bring these attitudes together: cognitive attitudes towards diversity, attitudes towards gender stereotypes, attitudes towards transgression and affective attitudes towards diversity. item analysis and analysis of the internal consistency of the four factors were also carried out. therefore, the study results support the conclusion that the scale, in general, shows good adaptation due to its validity and reliability.
gender_roles	the current study addresses the gender roles and the stereotypes produced in the context of cypriot society, through their representations on postage stamps produced by the republic of cyprus from 1960 to 2013. the theoretical framework employed derives from relevant theories on social roles' divisions based on gender, as well as the way these roles and stereotypes are expressed through images. the corpus has been analyzed by means of content analysis and semiotic analysis was employed in order to explore how the theoretical framework complies with selected stamps from the content analysis in respect of non-verbal signs. according to the findings, the role of women on stamp representations seems to be secondary and tied with emotional qualities, while men seem to hold a more prominent position in the society. this fact is reflected both on the quantity of stamps representing each gender in the respective thematic categories, as well as, on the selected stamps studied with semiotic analysis. nonetheless, there have been strong indications that the social roles of genders and therefore stereotypes have started changing as the society progresses through the years. this process however, does not seem apparent on the imagery used for the stamps of the republic of cyprus.
gender_roles	purpose - influence tactics are prevalent in the workplace and are linked to crucial outcomes such as career success and helping behaviours. the authors argue that sex role identity affects women 's choice of influence tactics in the workplace, but they only receive positive performance ratings when their behaviours are congruent with gender role expectation. furthermore, the authors hypothesize that these relationships may be moderated by occupational continuance commitment. results suggest that femininity is negatively related to the use of influence tactics overall, and this relationship is moderated by occupational continuance commitment. design/methodology/approach - in all, 657 women working in the construction industry were surveyed for their continuance occupational commitment and sex role identity and 465 supervisors whose responses are linked with the subordinates are surveyed for the women 's influence tactics and performance ratings. findings - results suggested that femininity was negatively related to the use of influence tactics overall, and this relationship was moderated by occupational continuance commitment. results also showed that women 's use of influence tactics was only positively received in terms of performance ratings when the influence tactic was congruent with gender role expectations. research limitations/implications - the results of this current study suggest that not all women are equally likely to use influence tactics and not all tactics result in positive perceptions of performance. feminine women in general refrain from using influence tactics unless they are driven to stay in a given occupation, but they only receive positive results when their behaviours are congruent with society 's gender role expectations. originality/value - past research has mostly focused on broad differences between males and females, and this study has shown that there are more nuanced differences that can more accurately describe the effects of gender disposition (i.e. sex role identity) on influence tactics. it also emphasizes the importance of occupational commitment as a boundary condition, which influences women to step out of their gender roles even though they may be penalized with lower performance ratings.
depression	intimate partner violence (ipv) has potentially severe and long-lasting mental health consequences for survivors, including elevated symptoms and diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (gad). the current study examined the relationship between three self-report measures of psychological distress and ratings obtained from the corresponding clinician-administered measures in women seeking assessment for mental health problems following ipv (n = 185). ptsd symptoms were assessed using the self-report impact of event scale-revised (ies-r) and the interview-based clinician-administered ptsd scale (caps). depression symptoms were assessed using the self-report beck depression inventory-ii (bdi-ii) and the depressive disorders sections from the clinician-administered anxiety disorders interview schedule-iv (adis-iv). anxiety symptoms were assessed using the self-report beck anxiety inventory (bai) and the clinician-administered gad section from the adis-iv. results indicated that psychological distress was prevalent in the sample, with 27% receiving a ptsd diagnosis, 40% diagnosed with a depressive disorder, and 55% meeting criteria for gad. although each self-report measure was significantly and positively correlated with its corresponding clinician-administered measure, rates of diagnostic concordance were mixed. the bdi-ii showed a high degree of agreement with the adis-iv depression section, but the ies-r and the caps were discordant at classifying ptsd. the bai had acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity in relation to the adis-iv gad section. these findings suggest that multiple assessment modalities should be considered when rating symptoms and estimating the prevalence of diagnoses among survivors of ipv.
depression	the current paper provides an overview of the cultural and religious background of pakistan; the current situation of mental health in pakistan with special emphasis on cultural adaptation of cognitive behaviour therapy (cbt) in pakistan. in the context of sufism-islamic mindfulness, it is interesting to note that it has been easy to explain the concepts of cbt to the therapists and clients in pakistan, but the process to culturally adapt cbt in pakistani culture, had to be based on patience while generating evidence for it. our group has taken the responsibility to do that and so far, have been successful in the endeavours pertaining to research and service development, described in this paper.
depression	introduction: posttraumatic stress symptoms (pts) are associated with increased risk of obstetric complications among pregnant survivors of trauma, abuse and interpersonal violence, but little is known about how pts affects women 's actual experiences of obstetric care. this study investigated the rate at which abuse history was detected by obstetricians, whether abuse survivors experienced more invasive exams than is typically indicated for routine obstetric care, and whether psychological distress was associated with abuse survivors' sense of self-efficacy when communicating their obstetric care needs.methods: forty-one pregnant abuse survivors completed questionnaires about abuse history, current psychological distress and self-efficacy for communicating obstetric care needs and preferences. electronic medical records (emrs) were reviewed to examine frequency of invasive prenatal obstetric procedures (e.g. removal of clothing for external genital examination, pelvic exams and procedures) and to examine the detection rate of abuse histories during the initial obstetric visit.results: the majority of participants (83%) reported at least one past incident of violent physical or sexual assault. obstetricians detected abuse histories in less than one quarter of cases. nearly half of participants (46%) received invasive exams for non-routine reasons. pts and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.discussion: women most at risk for experiencing distress during their obstetric visits and/or undergoing potentially distressing procedures may also be the least likely to communicate their distress to obstetricians. results are discussed with implications for improving screening for abuse screening and distress symptoms as well as need for trauma-sensitive obstetric practices.
depression	growing evidence suggests that positive mental health or wellbeing protects against psychopathology. how and why those who flourish derive these resilient outcomes is, however, unknown. this exploratory study investigated if self-compassion, as it continuously provides a friendly, accepting and situational context for negative experiences, functions as a resilience mechanism and adaptive emotion regulation strategy that protects against psychopathology for those with high levels of positive mental health. participants from the general population (n = 349) provided measures at one time-point on positive mental health (mhc-sf), self-compassion (scs-sf), psychopathology (hads) and negative affect (mdes). self-compassion significantly mediated the negative relationship between positive mental health and psychopathology. furthermore, higher levels of self-compassion attenuated the relationship between state negative affect and psychopathology. findings suggest that especially individuals with high levels of positive mental health possess self-compassion skills that promote resilience against psychopathology. these might function as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy and protect against the activation of schema related to psychopathology following state negative affective experiences. enhancing self-compassion is a promising positive intervention for clinical practice. it will not only impact psychopathology through reducing factors like rumination and self-criticism, but also improve positive mental health by enhancing factors such as kindness and positive emotions. this may reduce the future risk of psychopathology.
depression	background. men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following local therapies often use natural supplements in an attempt to delay metastases and/or avoid the need for more aggressive treatments with undesirable side-effects. while there is a growing body of research into phytotherapeutic agents in this cohort, with some promising results, as yet no definitive recommendations can be made. this pilot study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a fully-powered study to examine the effects of this phytotherapeutic intervention (containing turmeric, resveratrol, green tea and broccoli sprouts) on psa doubling time in men with biochemical recurrence with a moderate psa rise rate. methods. a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial was conducted with 22 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate rise rate (psa doubling time of 4-15 months and no evidence of metastases from conventional imaging methods). patients were randomized to either the active treatment arm or placebo for 12 weeks. the primary endpoints were feasibility of study recruitment and procedures, and measurement of proposed secondary endpoints (prostate symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression as measured on the eortc qlq-c30 and pr-25, the ipss and hads). data were collected to estimate psa-log slopes and psa-doubling times, using a mixed model, for both the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. results. adherence to study protocol was excellent, and the phytotherapeutic intervention was well-tolerated, with similar numbers of mild-to-moderate adverse events in the active and placebo arms. both the intervention and data collection methods were acceptable to participants. no statistical difference between groups on clinical outcomes was expected in this pilot study. there was between-subject variation in the psa post treatment, but on average the active treatment group experienced a non-significant increase in the log-slope of psa (pre-treatment doubling time = 10.2 months, post-treatment doubling time = 5.5 months), and the placebo group experienced no change in the log-slope of psa (pre-treatment doubling time = 10.8 months, post-treatment doubling time = 10.9 months). conclusion. the findings suggest that a fully powered study of this combination is feasible in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate psa rise rate.

social_cognition	over the last several decades, there has been a wealth of illuminating work on processes implicated in social cognition. much less has been done in articulating how we learn the contours of particular concepts deployed in social cognition, like the concept mentalistic agent. recent developments in learning theory afford new tools for approaching these questions. in this article, i describe some rudimentary ways in which learning theoretic considerations can illuminate philosophically important aspects of the mentalistic agent concept. i maintain that mentalistic agent is an essentialized concept (cf. gelman, in the essential child, 2003; keil, in concepts, kinds, and cognitive development, 1992) and that learning-theoretic considerations help explain why the concept is not tied to particular traits.
social_cognition	social disinhibition difficulties are common following traumatic brain injury (tbi). however, clinically sensitive tools to objectively assess the difficulties are lacking. this study aimed to pilot a new clinical measure of social disinhibition, the social disinhibition task (sdt). whether social disinhibition is dependent on the type of social information judgements required and whether disinhibited responses can be adjusted with additional guidance were also examined. participants were 31 adults (25 male) with moderate-to-severe tbi and 22 adult (17 male) healthy control participants. participants viewed scenes of complex social situations and were asked to describe a character in them (part a), describe a character while inhibiting inappropriate or negative responses (part b), and describe a character while not only inhibiting negative responses, but also providing positive responses (part c). one-half of the items contained a faux pas requiring participants to make inferences about a character 'smental state. tbi and control participants responded similarly to part a, although control participants responded less positively than tbi participants in the faux pas items. tbi participants were significantly impaired on part b indicating they experienced difficulties in inhibiting automatic responding. tbi participants were however able to adjust their responding in part c so that they respond similarly to the control participants. between group differences were not detected in reaction time. overall, the sdt appears to be suitable to detect social inhibition difficulties in clinical settings and provides a new direction for remediation of the difficulties in individuals with tbi.
social_cognition	we outline an evolutionary-embodied-epistemological (eee) account of intellectual arrogance (ia), proposing that people psychologically experience their important beliefs as valued possessions - mental materialism - that they must fight to keep - ideological territoriality - thereby disposing them toward ia. nonetheless, ia should still vary, being higher among people taking a hostile and domineering epistemic stance (rejecting reality, resisting evidence) than among those taking an open and deferential one (embracing reality, respecting evidence). such variations can be predicted from people 's standing on the communion-agency circumplex at multiple levels of analysis (i.e. from their social inclusion and status; dispositional warmth and competence; and behavioral amiability and assertiveness). using pre-validated indices of mental materialism and ideological territoriality, and an argument evaluation task permitting the quantification of rational objectivity and egotistical bias, we obtained consistent correlational evidence that, as hypothesized, ia is the highest when agency is high and communion low, validating the eee account.
social_cognition	the debate about direct perception encompasses different topics, one of which concerns the richness of the contents of perceptual experiences. can we directly perceive only low-level properties, like edges, colors etc. (the sparse-content view), or can we perceive high-level properties and entities as well (the liberal-content view)? the aim of the paper is to defend the claim that the content of our perceptual experience can include emotions and also person impressions. using these examples, an argument is developed to defend a liberal-content view for core examples of social cognition. this view is developed and contrasted with accounts which claim that in the case of registering another person 's emotion while seeing them, we have to describe the relevant content not as the content of a perceptual experience, but of a perceptual belief. the paper defends the view that perceptual experiences can have a rich content yet remain separable from beliefs formed on the basis of the experience. how liberal and enriched the content of a perceptual experience is will depend upon the expertise a person has developed in the field. this is supported by the argument that perceptual experiences can be systematically enriched by perceiving affordances of objects, by pattern recognition or by top-down processes, as analyzed by processes of cognitive penetration or predictive coding.
social_cognition	group ownership is ubiquitous-property is owned by countries, corporations, families, and clubs. however, people cannot understand group ownership by simply relying on their conceptions of ownership by individuals, as group ownership is subject to complexities that do not arise when property is individually owned. we report 6 experiments investigating whether children ages 3 to 6 (n = 540) understand group ownership. in experiments 1 and 2 children were asked who different objects belong to, and they appropriately judged that certain objects are more likely to belong to a group than to individual people. experiments 3 and 4 investigated whether children understand the limits of group ownership. children saw vignettes where agents modified or depleted property. children ages 3 and older understood that individual members of a group should not deplete group-owned property, and children ages 5 and 6 understood that individual members should not modify group-owned property. finally, experiments 5 and 6 investigated whether children understand the benefits of group ownership. children ages 5 and 6 judged that it is more acceptable for a group member to take group property than for a nonmember to do this, and children ages 4 to 6 judged that group members can take more group resources than can nonmembers. together, these results are informative about how children conceive of group ownership rights, and about children 's conceptions of groups.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: in our previous studies, we found that the ile394thr snp in the melanopsin gene (opn4) was functionally associated with the pupillary light reflex. this indicates the possibility that opn4*ile394thr is associated with other non-image forming responses. the aim of this study was therefore to determine whether opn4*ile394thr is associated with sleep/wake timing. methods: a total of 348 healthy japanese university students participated in this study. scalp hair was used to genotype the ile394thr snp of opn4. sleep habits, including bedtime, wake time and sleep duration, were assessed separately for weekdays and weekends. a total of 328 samples, including 223 samples with tt genotype, 91 with tc genotype and 14 with cc genotype, were used for statistical analysis. no significant difference in age or male/female distribution was found among the three genotype groups. results: there was no significant difference in circadian preference among the genotype groups. during weekdays, bedtime, wake time and midpoint of sleep for cc subjects were significantly later than those for tt and tc subjects. however, there was no difference between tt and tc subjects in any of their sleep habits. during weekends, bedtime of cc subjects was significantly later than those of tt and tc subjects, and the midpoint of sleep of cc subjects was significantly later than that of tc subjects. conclusions: our findings demonstrated that opn4*ile394thr is associated with sleep/wake timing. we also found that the sleep/wake timing of subjects with the cc genotype was later than that of subjects with the tt or tc genotype.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objective: to explore the effects of five-element music therapy on elderly patients with seasonal affective disorder in a chinese nursing home. methods: the patients (n=50) were recruited from a shijingshan district nursing home in beijing, china. they were randomly assigned to two groups, a treatment group and a control group, with 25 participants in each group. the patients received music therapy for 1-2 h each week over an 8-week period. the music therapy involved four phases: introduction, activities, listening to the chinese five-element music, and a concluding phase. the participants in the control group did not listen to the five-element music. this study consisted of two parts: (a) a qualitative study that used focus groups to understand the feelings of the patients with seasonal affective disorder; (b) a quantitative study that involved administration of the self-rating depression scale (sds) and hamilton depression scale (hamd) before and after treatment. results: (a) qualitative analysis results: strength derived from the five-element group music therapy and emotional adjustment. the five-element group music therapy can reduce patients' psychological distress and let them feel inner peace and enhance their life satisfaction. (b) no significant difference in sds and hamd scores was found between the two groups (p>0.05) prior to treatment. after treatment, the mean sds score of the control group was 49.9 +/- 18.8, while the treatment group 's score was 40.2 +/- 18.1. the hamd score of the control group was 11.2 +/- 3.1, and the treatment group 's score was 8.8 +/- 4.9. following 8 weeks of music therapy, the sds and hamd scores of the treatment group were significantly lower than those for the control group (p<0.05). conclusion: five-element music therapy alleviated the symptoms of, seasonal affective disorder in the elderly patients.

seasonal_affective_disorder	this review of the sad hypothesis of kamstra et al. (2003), hereafter kkl (2003), isolates four new problems. first, the kkl (2003) statistical model does not test the kkl (2003) sad hypothesis. second, kkl (2003) do not properly interpret their results. third, kkl (2003) incorrectly specify the sign of the sad effect in the winter. the revised sad hypothesis is that hours of night have a negative influence on stock returns in the fall and in the winter. fourth, the statistical tests do not support either the kkl (2003) hypothesis or the revised sad hypothesis.

seasonal_affective_disorder	low serum vitamin d and increased parathormone levels were found to be associated with depression and stress in a wintering expedition of 20 healthy male subjects over a period of 1 year in antarctica. the continuous daylight during summer and the dark polar winter affect endogenous vitamin d production. long-term effects on bone health need to be studied further. purpose vitamin d plays a significant role in calcium and bone mineral metabolism and also affects cardiovascular, psychological, and cognitive functions. the ultraviolet b radiation component of sunlight, which shows marked seasonal variation in antarctica, influences the synthesis of vitamin d. depression and mood disorders are associated with this extreme photoperiod. in this study, we attempted to gauge the alteration of vitamin d homeostasis in antarctica and its effect on bone mineral metabolism and mood over a period of 1 year. materials and methods twenty male subjects who wintered over at india 's antarctic base maitri (70 degrees 45'57 '' s, 11 degrees 44' 09 '' e) from november 2010 to december 2011 were studied. fasting serum samples were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d, intact parathyroid hormone (pth), total alkaline phosphatase (alp), calcium, and phosphate. beck depression inventory (bdi), positive and negative affect scale (panas x), and perceived stress scale were used to measure depression, affect, and stress. results mild vitamin d deficiency was present in two (10 %) subjects on arrival, which increased to seven (35 %) subjects during the polar winter at 6 months. the mean score on the bdi-ii screen for depression was significantly higher during midwinter (4.8 +/- 3.9) when compared with the baseline value (2.9 +/- 2.1). only 2/20 (10 %) of subjects met the criteria for minor depression. higher pth levels at 6 months correlated with a higher panas x score (p=0.021). the mean values of calcium, inorganic phosphorus, and alp were comparable during the course of the expedition. conclusion low light exposure during the dark polar winter, lower vitamin d, and increased intact pth levels were found to be associated with depression during 1 year of antarctic residence. the low dietary intake and decreased solar radiation exposure during the polar winter reduce serum vitamin d levels in otherwise healthy individuals, which suggests that supplementation may be necessary.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objective/introduction. there is a close functional and neuroanatomical relationship between olfactory ability and emotional processing. the present study seeks to explore the association between olfactory ability and social cognition, especially facial emotion perception, in euthymic bipolar patients. methods. thirty-nine euthymic outpatients meeting dsm-iv-tr criteria for bipolar disorder and 40 healthy volunteers matched on socio-demographic criteria were recruited. both groups were assessed at one time point with the university of pennsylvania smell identification test (upsit), the emotion recognition test, and the faux pas recognition test, as well as measures of general cognition and functioning. results. the bipolar patients showed a significant impairment in olfactory identification (upsit) and social cognition measures compared to healthy controls. analyses revealed significant relationships between olfactory identification and facial emotion recognition, theory of mind, general cognition, and a trend-level relationship with functioning. controlling for age and cigarettes smoked, relationships remained significant between olfactory function and facial emotion recognition. conclusion. there is a deficit of olfactory identification in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder that is correlated with a deficit in both verbal and non-verbal measures of social cognition.
person_perception	in order to ensure successful mating opportunities, it is critical that human perceivers accurately infer others' sexual interests. but how do perceivers achieve these inferences? for over 50 years, scientists have documented that the pupils dilate in response to sexual arousal. despite the potential importance of this cue for mate selection, however, extant data have focused almost exclusively on the perspective of the individual experiencing arousal. here, we demonstrate that outside observers exploit pupil dilation as a visible cue to others' sexual interests. we used reverse-correlation methods to derive facial images based on perceivers' mental representations of both state-based (sexually aroused, sexually unaroused) and trait-based (sexually promiscuous, sexually non promiscuous) markers of sexual interest. next, we explored the phenotypic features that differentiated these faces, specifically the dilation of the pupils contained within each reverse-correlation image. consistent with the notion that pupil dilation is a reliable cue to sexual arousal, sexually interested faces contained objectively larger and darker pupils than did sexually disinterested faces. moreover, these differences were perceptually obvious to naive observers. collectively, our results suggest that perceivers attend to an external cue - pupil dilation - when forming decisions about others' state-based and trait-based sexual interests.

person_perception	asch 's seminal research on ""forming impressions of personality'' (1946) has widely been cited as providing evidence for a primacy-of-warmth effect, suggesting that warmth-related judgments have a stronger influence on impressions of personality than competence-related judgments (e. g., fiske, cuddy, & glick, 2007; wojciszke, 2005). because this effect does not fit with asch 's gestalt-view on impression formation and does not readily follow from the data presented in his original paper, the goal of the present study was to critically examine and replicate the studies of asch 's paper that are most relevant to the primacy-of-warmth effect. we found no evidence for a primacyof- warmth effect. instead, the role of warmth was highly context-dependent, and competence was at least as important in shaping impressions as warmth.
person_perception	spousal revenge killers murder their child apparently out of a desire to cause harm to their ex-partner, the child 's other parent. standard explanations of these killings fail to provide an adequate solution to what i call the problem of spousal revenge filicide. this is the problem of how a killer comes to take their rage at their former partner out on their own child and how that child can be dehumanized to the point of murder. although the dehumanization of the victim is acknowledged to occur, why it occurs is not well understood. here, i offer an hypothesis that the killer fails to represent their child as a moral subject with a mind of their own. this is due to a deficit in the killer 's capacity for person perception which is, by hypothesis, pathological. as such, the killer experiences the child as an object, rather than a person, which is of significant emotional value to the other parent. the specificity of this disorder explains why the ex-partner themselves is not targeted, and it explains how the killer is able to understand that killing the child will harm the other parent.

person_perception	prior research finds that sexually permissive individuals are judged more negatively than nonpermissive peers, placing them at risk of social isolation. based on the positive assortment principle (i.e., preferences for similarity in attributes in close relationships), we examined whether participants' own permissiveness mitigated negative judgments of permissive others in the same-sex friendship context. college students (n=751) evaluated a hypothetical same-sex target with either 2 (nonpermissive) or 20 (permissive) past sex partners on 10 friendship-relevant outcomes. participant permissiveness attenuated some negative evaluations. however, preferences were rarely reversed, and no moderation was found in five outcomes, suggesting the role of permissiveness-based positive assortment is limited, and evolutionary concerns may take precedence. partial support for the sexual double standard was also found.
person_perception	on the basis of an integration of dual-process models of information processing and the lens model framework of person perception, we conducted two studies to investigate whether self-perceivers could detect their implicit disposition from video feedback of behavioural cues and whether these cues were used for explicit dispositional inferences under conditions that maximized the presumed self-perception process. using an approach that differed from previous research, we used the following: (i) a more detailed and stepwise self-perception procedure; (ii) a specific explicit measure compared with a global explicit measure; and (iii) disgust sensitivity as a domain with clear, unambiguous cues and an assumed low self-presentation bias. the results from two studies (n=117 and n=130) on disgust sensitivity provide the first evidence for the assumed process with regard to bodily reaction cues but not with regard to facial expression cues. these novel findings suggest that people can get to know their unconscious selves better if supporting conditions are met and the right behavioural cues are attended to. additional boundary conditions of this self-perception process were investigated using display rules and need for closure in study 2. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.
media_violence	background: the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to threat is critical to survival, and the neural substrates subserving attention to threat may be probed using depictions of media violence. whether neural responses to potential threat differ in down syndrome is not known. methods: we performed functional mri scans of 15 adolescent and adult down syndrome and 14 typically developing individuals, group matched by age and gender, during 50 min of passive cartoon viewing. brain activation to auditory and visual features, violence, and presence of the protagonist and antagonist were compared across cartoon segments. fmri signal from the brain 's dorsal attention network was compared to thematic and violent events within the cartoons between down syndrome and control samples. results: we found that in typical development, the brain 's dorsal attention network was most active during violent scenes in the cartoons and that this was significantly and specifically reduced in down syndrome. when the antagonist was on screen, there was significantly less activation in the left medial temporal lobe of individuals with down syndrome. as scenes represented greater relative threat, the disparity between attentional brain activation in down syndrome and control individuals increased. there was a reduction in the temporal autocorrelation of the dorsal attention network, consistent with a shortened attention span in down syndrome. individuals with down syndrome exhibited significantly reduced activation in primary sensory cortices, and such perceptual impairments may constrain their ability to respond to more complex social cues such as violence. conclusions: these findings may indicate a relative deficit in emotive perception of violence in down syndrome, possibly mediated by impaired sensory perception and hypoactivation of medial temporal structures in response to threats, with relative preservation of activity in pro-social brain regions. these findings indicate that specific genetic differences associated with down syndrome can modulate the brain 's response to violence and other complex emotive ideas.
media_violence	research on audience interest in violent media content is extended to include individuals' appreciation of certain types of violent portrayals as a meaningful and valuable reflection of reality. a sample of 482 german and u.s. adults aged 18-82 watched movie trailers that varied in pretest ratings of gore and meaningfulness, but were equivalent in suspense. as hypothesized, perceived levels of gore and meaningfulness interacted to predict individuals' reported likelihood of watching the full movie, such that a negative influence of gore on viewing likelihood was compensated at high levels of meaningfulness. these findings suggest that, in addition to other motivations such as suspense, some types of violent and even gory content might be sought as an opportunity for meaning-making.
media_violence	how do researchers talk to the media about the media? how is research about the media portrayed by those responsible for reporting objective findings? this article summarizes the efforts of the american psychological association 's public policy office on violence in the media in the late 1990s. by looking at the range of dynamics at play (school shootings blamed on popular music, rapidly evolving technology, a presidential campaign), this article explores the complexity of accurately representing psychological research in a medium where the findings could impact profits.
media_violence	the columbine high school shooting in 1999 prompted school officials and policy-makers to create and implement programs and policies that would prevent violence in school and ensure school safety. ten years have passed since the columbine shooting; however, debates concerning risk factors for the shootings continue to ensue. the focus of this article is to examine the columbine school shootings within the context of bronfenbrenner 's (1994) ecological systems analysis. we examine the most commonly identified risk factors, which operate within five systems levels: chrono-, macro-, exo-, mesa-, and microsystems, and draw implications for school-based practice and policy.

media_violence	since the twentieth century, studies have demonstrated the impact of media channels on their beneficiaries, especially children and adolescents. from the transmission of moving images, the concept of information rapidly expanded both vertically, through technological development and improved information quality in terms of details, and horizontally, by broadening the target audience. gradually, in the contemporary society the written press, television and radio have entered almost all the houses in various ways. the impact of mass media has evolved with technology, currently a large number of social events having the press as their trigger element. in this paper the authors start with a case study to illustrate the negative impact that violence conveyed through media channels can have on children and adolescents by generating or increasing their aggressiveness.
schizophrenia	background: although the quality of life (qol) experienced by patients with schizophrenia has been recognized, few studies have assessed the relationship between the caregivers' qol and patients' qol. methods: the study included 253 stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia and their caregivers from 3 mental health services in bolivia (n = 83), chile (n = 85) and peru (n = 85). caregivers' and patients' qol were respectively assessed using two specific qol questionnaires (s-cgqol and s-qol 18). we collected socio-demographic information and clinical data. multiple linear regressions were performed to determine which variables were associated with patient 's qol. we tested the following hypothesis using structural equation modeling (sem): caregivers' qol may have an indirect effect on patients' qol mediated by their influence of the severity of psychotic symptoms. results: in the multivariate analysis, the caregivers' qol was not significantly associated with the patients' qol, except for one qol dimension about relationship with family (beta = 0.23). among patients' characteristics, being a woman and aymara, having lower educational level, unemployment and severity of symptoms was significantly associated to a lower qol. the sem revealed a moderate significant association between caregivers' qol and psychotic symptoms severity (path coefficient = -0.32) and a significant association between psychotic symptoms severity and patients qol (path coefficient = -0.40). the indirect effect of caregivers' qol on patients' qol was significant (mediated effect coefficient = 0.13). conclusion: improvement of caregiver 's qol may have a direct impact on the psychotic symptoms of patients and indirectly on patient 's qol, confirming the need for ongoing family interventions in these regions.
schizophrenia	disruptive behavior disorders (dbds), inclusive of oppositional defiant disorder (odd) and conduct disorder (cd), are associated with outcomes likely to increase risk of mortality. using danish national registers, a total of 1.92 million individuals including 9495 individuals with ebds diagnosed by specialist services were followed from their first birthday to 2013. those with and without dbds were compared using mortality rate ratios (mrrs) estimated using poisson regression and adjusted for calendar period, age, sex, family history of psychiatric disorders, maternal age at time of birth, paternal age at time of birth, parental education status, and parental employment status. over the course of follow up, which totalled 24.9 million person-years, 5580 cohort members died including 78 individuals with dbds. the mortality rate per 10,000 person-years was 9.66 for individuals with dbds compared to 2.22 for those with no diagnosis. this corresponded to a fully adjusted mrr of 2.57 (95% confidence interval 2.04-3.20). comorbid substance use disorder and attention-deticit/hyperactivity disorder resulted in the highest mrr across all categories. these findings demonstrate the excess mortality associated with dbds.
schizophrenia	relatively little is known about patterns of school-based supportive services for youth with autism spectrum disorder. this study describes these supportive services and their correlates, both cross-sectionally and retrospectively, in a large sample (n=283) of 6- to 18-year-old youth. to assess whether special education designation and classroom placement patterns were peculiar to autism spectrum disorder, we also conducted analyses comparing youth with autism spectrum disorder to those with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=1088). in higher grades, the relative quantity of three common supportive services received by youth with autism spectrum disorder decreased, while total supportive service quantity remained stable over time. youth with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to receive a special education designation and were placed in less inclusive classroom settings than youth with other psychiatric diagnoses. these findings suggest that as youth with autism spectrum disorder reach higher grades, changes in service provision occur in terms of both time and quantity.
schizophrenia	since their discovery in the mammalian brain, it has been apparent that serotonin (5-ht) and dopamine (da) interactions play a key role in normal and abnormal behavior. therefore, disclosure of this interaction could reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction or neurological conditions such as parkinson 's disease and tourette 's syndrome. unfortunately, this interaction remains difficult to study for many reasons, including the rich and widespread innervations of 5-ht and da in the brain, the plethora of 5-ht receptors and the release of co-transmitters by 5-ht and da neurons. the purpose of this review is to present electrophysiological and biochemical data showing that endogenous 5-ht and pharmacological 5-ht ligands modify the mesencephalic da systems' activity. 5-ht receptors may control da neuron activity in a state-dependent and region-dependent manner. 5-ht controls the activity of da neurons in a phasic and excitatory manner, except for the control exerted by 5-ht2c receptors which appears to also be tonically and/or constitutively inhibitory. the functional interaction between the two monoamines will also be discussed in view of the mechanism of action of antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-parkinsonians and drugs of abuse.

schizophrenia	resveratrol, a caloric restriction mimetic, is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including generalized anxiety and schizophrenia. this study investigated the anxiolytic and antipsychotic potentials of resveratrol in murine models of anxiety and schizophrenia. mice were pretreated with resveratrol (200 and 400 mg/kg) in 1% carboxymethyl cellulose for 14 days and subjected to behavioural tests on the 15th day. anxiolytic activity of resveratrol was determined using the hole board and staircase tests while its anti-psychotic property was evaluated via apormorphine induced stereotypy and swim-induced grooming tests. although resveratrol did not significantly reduce the mean number of head dips at doses used in the hole board test, it significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the mean episodes of rearing without significantly altering the total number of upward steps climbed in the staircase test. resveratrol significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the mean climbing scores in the first ten minutes of the apormorphine induced stereotypic climbing and significantly decreased (p < 0.01) episodes and total duration of swim induced grooming in mice. administration of resveratrol at doses used in this study produced anxiolysis and anti-psychotic effects in mice.
