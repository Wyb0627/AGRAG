alzheimer's_disease	long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are transcripts with low protein-coding potential but occupy a large part of transcriptional output. their roles include regulating gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional level in cellular homeostasis. however, lncrna studies are still in their infancy and the functions of the vast majority of lncrna transcripts remain unknown. it is generally known that the function of the human nervous system largely relies on the precise regulation of gene expression. various studies have shown that lncrnas have a significant impact on normal neural development and on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. in this review, we focused on recent studies associated with lncrnas in neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer 's disease (ad), parkinson 's disease (pd), huntington 's disease (hd), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), multiple system atrophy (msa), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ftld), and glaucoma. glaucoma, caused by unexplained ganglion cell lesion and apoptosis, is now labeled as a chronic neurodegenerative disorder [1], and therefore, we discussed the association of lncrnas with glaucoma as well. we illustrate the role of some specific lncrnas, which may provide new insights into our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative diseases mentioned above.
alzheimer's_disease	the formation of soluble oligomers of amyloid beta 42 and 40 (a beta 42, a beta 40) is the initial event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease (ad). based on previous systematic proline replacement and solid-state nmr, we proposed a toxic dimer structure of a beta 42, a highly aggregative alloform, with a turn at positions 22 and 23, and a hydrophobic core in the c-terminal region. however, in addition to a beta 42, a beta 40 dimers can also contribute to ad progression because of the more abundance of a beta 40 monomer in biological fluids. here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three dimer models of the toxic-conformation constrained e22p-a beta 40 using l,l-2,6-diaminopimeric acid (dap) or l,l-2,8diaminoazelaic acid (daz) linker at position 30, which is incorporated into the intermolecular parallel beta-sheet region, and dap at position 38 in the c-terminal hydrophobic core. e22p-a3odap-a beta 40 dimer (1) and e22p-a3odaz-a beta 40 dimer (2) existed mainly in oligomeric states even after 2 weeks incubation without forming fibrils, unlike the corresponding monomer. their neurotoxicity toward sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells was very weak. in contrast, e22p-g38dap-a beta 40 dimer (3) formed beta-sheet rich oligomeric aggregates, and exhibited more potent neurotoxicity than the corresponding monomer. ion mobility mass spectrometry suggested that high molecular-weight oligomers (12-24-mer) of 3 form, but not for 1 and 2 after 4 h incubation. these findings indicate that formation of the hydrophobic core at the c-terminus, rather than intermolecular parallel beta-sheet, triggers the formation of toxic a beta oligomers. compound 3 may be a suitable model for studying the etiology of alzheimer 's disease.
alzheimer's_disease	available cholinergic drugs for treating alzheimer 's disease (ad) provide modest symptomatic benefit. we hypothesized that co-administration of a peripheral anticholinergic to reduce dose-limiting adverse effects (aes) would enable the safe/tolerable use of higher cholinesterase inhibitor doses and thus improve their antidementia efficacy. a modified single-blind, ascending-dose, phase iia study of donepezil plus solifenacin (cpc-201) lasting 26 weeks was conducted in 41 patients with probable ad of moderate severity. entry criteria included the use of donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/day during the preceding 3 months. the primary outcome measure was the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) of donepezil achieved (to protocol limit of 40 mg/day) when administered with the anticholinergic solifenacin 15 mg/day. secondary measures included assessments of cognitive and global function, as well as of aes. the mean +/- sd donepezil mtd increased to 38 +/- 0.74 mg/day (median 40 mg/day; p < 0.001); 88% of the study population safely attained this dose at the end of titration. markedly reduced donepezil ae frequency, especially gastrointestinal, allowed this dose increase. there were no drug-related serious aes or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. at 26 weeks, alzheimer 's disease assessment scale cognitive component scores in the efficacy evaluable population improved by 0.35 +/- 0.85 points over baseline (p < 0.05), an estimated 2.5 +/- 0.84 points above 10 mg/day donepezil and 5.4 +/- 0.84 points above historic placebo (both p < 0.05). clinical global impression of improvement scores improved by 0.94 +/- 0.20 to 3.1 +/- 0.20 points (p < 0.001). the findings suggest that limiting donepezil aes by co-administration of solifenacin allows the safe administration of substantially higher cholinesterase inhibitors doses that may augment cognitive and global benefits in patients with ad.
alzheimer's_disease	in the present study, we have tested whether mri t-1 relaxation time is a sensitive marker to detect early stages of amyloidosis and gliosis in the young 5xfad transgenic mouse, a well-established animal model for alzheimer 's disease. 5xfad and wild-type mice were imaged in a 4.7 t varian horizontal bore mri system to generate t-1 quantitative maps using the spin-echo multi-slice sequence. following immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, iba-1, and amyloid-beta, t-1 and area fraction of staining were quantified in the posterior parietal and primary somatosensory cortex and corpus callosum. in comparison with age-matched wild-type mice, we observed first signs of amyloidosis in 2.5-month-old 5xfad mice, and development of gliosis in 5-month-old 5xfad mice. in contrast, mri t-1 relaxation times of young, i.e., 2.5- and 5-month-old, 5xfad mice were not significantly different to those of age-matched wild-type controls. furthermore, although disease progression was detectable by increased amyloid-beta load in the brain of 5-month-old 5xfad mice compared with 2.5-month-old 5xfad mice, mri t-1 relaxation time did not change. in summary, our data suggest that mri t-1 relaxation time is neither a sensitive measure of disease onset nor progression at early stages in the 5xfad mouse transgenic mouse model.
alzheimer's_disease	brain imaging plays an important role in the study of alzheimer 's disease (ad), where atrophy has been found to occur in the hippocampal formation during the very early disease stages and to progress in parallel with the disease 's evolution. the aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible correlation between ""small world"" characteristics of the brain connectivity architecture-as extracted from eeg recordings-and hippocampal volume in ad patients. a dataset of 144 subjects, including 110 ad (mmse 21.3) and 34 healthy nold (mmse 29.8) individuals, was evaluated. weighted and undirected networks were built by the eloreta solutions of the cortical sources' activities moving from eeg recordings. the evaluation of the hippocampal volume was carried out on a subgroup of 60 ad patients who received a high-resolution t1-weighted sequence and underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the freesurfer image analysis software. results showed that, quantitatively, more correlation was observed in the right hemisphere, but the same trend was seen in both hemispheres. alpha band connectivity was negatively correlated, while slow (delta) and fast-frequency (beta, gamma) bands positively correlated with hippocampal volume. namely, the larger the hippocampal volume, the lower the alpha and the higher the delta, beta, and gamma small world characteristics of connectivity. accordingly, the small world connectivity pattern could represent a functional counterpart of structural hippocampal atrophying and related-network disconnection.
parkinson's_disease	the death of dopaminergic neurons is a major pathological hallmark of parkinson 's disease (pd). elevated iron within the substantia nigra of the pd brain is thought to catalyze this neuronal death through hydroxyl radical-derived oxidative damage. removing this excess iron presents a potential therapeutic strategy for pd. seventeen derivatives of the non-toxic iron chelator desferrioxamine b (dfob) were prepared by the conjugation of adamantyl- (1-4,8-12), deconstructed adamantyl units (5-7), norborna(e)ne- (13-16) or bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-based (17) ancillary fragments to the terminal amine group. the range of experimental logp values of 1-17 (logp = 0.15-2.82) was greater than water soluble dfob (logp -2.29), with the increased hydrophobicity designed to improve cell membrane carriage to facilitate intracellular iron sequestration. the first activity screen showed compounds with methyl-substituted adamantyl (1-3), noradamantyl (5), or 1-pentylbicyclo[2.2.21octane (17) ancillary groups significantly rescued iron-mediated oxidative stress in confluent pd-relevant sk-n-be2-m17 neuroblastoma cells (m17 cells) exposed to 1,1'-dimethy1-4,4'-bipyridinium (paraquat, pq) or h2o2. the second dose-dependence screen ranked 1-3 and 17 as the top candidates (ec50 similar to 10 mu m) in the rescue of pq-treated m17 cells. the ancillary fragments of 1-3 and 17 clustered in a region defined by a close-to-zero dipole moment, logp values of 2-2.8 and a surface area:volume ratio of 0.60-0.61. results of iron leaching studies indicate that the compounds may be operating via mechanisms beyond solely removing intracellular iron. the dfob conjugates with methyl-substituted adamantyl ancillary groups (1-3) were the top and most consistent performers in this class of compound designed for pd.

parkinson's_disease	in parkinson 's disease, the enhanced beta rhythm is closely associated with akinesia/bradykinesia and rigidity. an increase in beta oscillations (12-35 hz) within the basal ganglia (bg) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e. the lower beta (12-20 hz) and upper beta (21-35 hz). a computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations. simulation results show several findings. the upper beta frequency in the bg originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the bg depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (gpe) and the subthalamic nucleus (stn). there is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the gpe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations. it is shown that increased self-inhibition within the gpe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the gpe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the bg. this work provides an analysis for understanding the mechanism underlying pathological synchronization in neurological diseases.

parkinson's_disease	the advantages of nasal high-flow oxygen therapy (nhf) include not only allowing talking, but also eating and drinking, during the therapy. however, the effect of nhf on the swallowing reflex remains unclear. in the present study, we aimed to assess the effects of nhf on the swallowing reflex. nine healthy adult japanese male volunteers with no history of dysphagia or diseases that may cause dysphagia, such as stroke or parkinson 's disease, were evaluated. participants received one of four levels of nhf intervention (0 (control), 15, 30 and 45 l/min of oxygen) with the nhf system through the nasal cannula. swallowing was induced by the administration of a bolus injection of 5 ml of distilled water over 3 s through a polyethylene catheter at each level of oxygen flow. the primary end-point was the latency period of the swallowing reflex after bolus injection, which was defined as the time from the start of the bolus injection to the onset of the electromyogram (emg) burst of the first swallow. mean latency times of the swallowing reflex with 15 (9.8 +/- 2.9 s), 30 (9.0 +/- 2.7 s) and 45 (8.5 +/- 3.0 s) l/min of nhf were significantly shorter than those under control conditions (11.9 +/- 3.7 s; p < 0.05). our study demonstrates that nhf may enhance swallowing function with increasing levels of nhf by reducing the latency of the reflex. nhf may allow continuation of oral intake without aspiration during oxygen therapy.
parkinson's_disease	background. specialized parkinson 's disease (pd) care offers advantages to patients. however, specialized health care providers may be unaware of patients' personal context and comorbidity, leading to conflicting treatment regimens. patients may benefit from a more holistic approach. objective. to clarify the role community-dwelling pd patients see for general practitioners (gps) in pd care and to clarify the role gps see for themselves. methods. qualitative interview study with 16 community-dwelling pd patients and 12 gps in the netherlands, using a constant comparative approach to analysis. results. patients expressed a preference for self-management and autonomy in decisionmaking. gps chose a limited, reactive position in early-stage pd care to stimulate patient autonomy. moreover, gps felt insufficiently competent to extend their role. patients also felt gps lack expert knowledge and skills; they focus on their neurologist for pd care. in addition, gps observed patients might not realize what accessory role the gp could have, a role gps described as essential in being aware of patient 's well-being. patients did not describe additional roles for the gp in more advanced disease, whereas gps mentioned a shift towards a more proactive and extended role. conclusion. patients and gps see a limited role for the gp in early-stage pd care because of patient autonomy and gp 's lack of specific knowledge and skills. however, gps should feel more confident of the added value of their generalist approach to care for patients with a complex chronic disorder as pd. if generalist and specialized care reinforce each other, pd patients benefit.
parkinson's_disease	in 1967, l-dopa was introduced as part of the pharmacological therapy of parkinson 's disease (pd) and, in spite of extensive research, no additional effective drugs have been discovered to treat pd. this brings forward the question: why haver no new drugs been developed? we consider that one of the problems preventing the discovery of new drugs is that we still have no information on the pathophysiology of the neurodegeneration of the neuromelanin-containing nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. currently, it is, widely accepted that the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, i.e., in the substantia nigra pars compacta, involves mitochondria! dysfunction, the formation of neurotoxic oligomers of alphasynuclein, the dysfunction of protein degradation systems, neuroinflammation, and oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. however, the initial trigger of these mechanisms in the nigrostriatal system is still unknown. it has been reported that aminochrome induces the majority of these mechanisms involved in the neurodegeneration process. aminochrome is formed within the cytoplasm of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons during the oxidation of dopamine to to neuromelanin is a normal and harmless process, because healthy individuals have intact neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons. interestingly, aminochrome-induced neurotoxicity is prevented by two enzymes: dt-diaphorase and glutathione transferase m2-2, which explains why melanin-containing dopaminergic neurons are intact in healthy human brains.
sprains_and_strains	objectives: (1) to characterize the demographics and external causes of pediatric sports injury-related visits (sirvs) to emergency departments (eds). (2) to analyze the effect of race/ethnicity and insurance on sirvs to eds. methods: a stratified random-sample cross-sectional survey of eds in the national hospital ambulatory medical care survey was conducted from 1997-2001; for patients younger than 19 years, we used all visits [n = 33,654; injury-related visits (irvs) = 13,496, sirvs = 29901. we examined both the external cause codes and the actual verbatim text of all irvs. national estimates of pediatric irvs were obtained using the assigned patient visit weights in the national hospital ambulatory medical care survey databases and sudaan 9.1 software (sas institute, inc., cary, nc). results: sports injuries resulted in 2.5 million visits annually, or 23% of ed irvs. male sex, older age (6-18 years), and white race/ethnicity are associated with higher rates of sirvs. cycling, basketball, playground injuries, and football resulted in the largest numbers of ed sirvs. leading diagnoses for sirvs included fractures and dislocations, sprains and strains, open wounds, and contusions. hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with lower rates of sirvs across all insurance types. after controlling for demographic factors and insurance, hispanic children were less likely to have an sirv than white children (odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-0.9). conclusions: sports and recreation are the leading causes of pediatric ed irvs. hispanic children, regardless of insurance status, had lower rates of sirvs than white children, which helps explain the lower rate of nonfatal irvs to eds among hispanic youth.
sprains_and_strains	traumatic ankle injury is a frequent clinical presentation. ankle taping is commonly used in the prophylaxis of sprains and as an adjunct during rehabilitation of ankle injury. the mechanisms behind taping remain unclear however, one possible mechanism is improved proprioception and peroneal reflex responses. this study investigated the peroneal reflex response to rapid inversion (using a trapdoor) with different taping protocols. the dominant leg of 31 healthy subjects was tested in three conditions: no taping; simple prophylactic taping; and circumferential leg taping. a repeated measures anova revealed no statistically significant effect across conditions or trials. the results suggest that neurophysiological responses to sudden inversion are not altered by mechanical or sensory input from taping in normal subjects.
sprains_and_strains	problem: national occupational injury prevention goals often prioritize the reduction of serious injuries. this study analyzed whether this prioritization is credible in respect to lost-time injuries and short and long term work absence, and the implications this has for injury severity-based versus injury absence-based prevention approaches. method: the data consisted of national and work-site specific injury and absence data from construction workers in denmark, including workers from the copenhagen metro construction sites, during the period 2000-2001. results and impact on industry and government: absence length was significantly dependent on the type of injury. sprains and strains were most prevalent and accounted for approximately one third of injuries and absence. fractures accounted for one sixth of injuries and the greatest proportion of long-term absence. the results give credibility to the need for targeting sprains and strains in injury and absence prevention initiatives.

sprains_and_strains	objective: this study was undertaken to determine the occurrence rates, outcomes, risk factors, and timing of obstetric delivery for trauma sustained during pregnancy. study design: this is a retrospective cohort study of women for trauma in california (1991-1999). international classification of disease, ninth revision, clinical modification codes, and external causation codes for injury were identified. maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes were analyzed for women delivering at the trauma hospitalization (group 1), and women sustaining trauma prenatally (group 2), compared with nontrauma controls. injury severity scores and injury types were used to stratify risk in relation to outcome. statistical comparisons are expressed as odds ratios (ors) with 95% cis. results: a total of 10,316 deliveries fulfilling study criteria were identified in 4,833,286 total deliveries. fractures, dislocations, sprains, and strains were the most common type of injury. group 1 was associated with the worst outcomes: maternal death or 69 (95% ci 42-115), fetal death or 4.7 (95% ci 3.4-6.4), uterine rupture or 43 (95% ci 19-97), and placental abruption or 9.2 (95% ci 7.8-11). group 2 also resulted in increased risks at delivery: placental abruption or 1.6 (95% ci 1.3-1.9), preterm labor or 2.7 (95% ci 2.5-2.9), maternal death or 4.4 (95% ci 1.4-14). as injury severity scores increased, outcomes worsened, yet were statistically nonpredictive. the type of injury most commonly leading to maternal death was internal injury. the risk of fetal, neonatal, and infant death was strongly influenced by gestational age at the time of delivery. conclusion: women delivering at the trauma hospitalization (group 1) had the worst outcomes, regardless of the severity of the injury. group 2 women (prenatal injury) had an increased risk of adverse outcomes at delivery, and therefore should be monitored closely during the subsequent course of the pregnancy. this study highlights the need to optimize education in trauma prevention during pregnancy.

sprains_and_strains	background: the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (tb) in xinjiang is higher than in other regions of china, and beijing/w lineage mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) is the dominant strain of mtb in xinjiang. however, information on multidrug-resistant (mdr) and extensively drug-resistant (xdr) tb, particularly the correlation between mdr and the beijing/w lineage and the correlation between drug resistance and the beijing/w sublineage strains, is limited. material/methods: we conducted a prospective study to describe the prevalence of mdr/xdr tb, beijing/w lineage and sublineage strains in xinjiang in china from 2009 to 2013. all mtb underwent drug susceptibility testing to the first-and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. the beijing/w lineages and sublineages were detected by large-sequence polymorphisms with polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 410 clinical isolates were identified. the overall percentage of mdr and xdr cases in xinjiang was 13.2% (54/410) and 13.0% (7/54), respectively. overall, 9.8% (14/143) of the beijing lineage mtb were mdr patients, and 15.6% (40/257) of the non-beijing lineage mtb were mdr patients. in the 143 beijing mtb lineages, 11.2% isolates were in sublineage 105, 15.4% isolates were in sublineage 207, 69.2% isolates were in sublineage 181, and 4.2% isolates were in sublineage 150. none of the isolates were detected in sublineage 142. significant differences between the beijing/w and non-beijing/w strains were observed regarding inh and emb resistance, respectively. conclusions: the prevalence of the mdr tb in xinjiang remains high and imposes challenges for tb control. four beijing/w sublineage isolates were observed in xinjiang. there was no correlation between mdr and the beijing/w lineage and no correlation between drug resistance and the beijing/w sublineage strains. surveillance of the clinical isolates of mtb is recommended to strengthen the identification of mdr/xdr tb and sublineages of the beijing/w strains.
cancer	background: signal transduction inhibitors (stis) have considerably improved treatment of advanced/metastasized renal cell carcinoma (mrcc). most safety data for these drugs are derived from clinical trials. the purpose of this study was to evaluate which adverse drug reactions are documented during first-line treatments in routine clinical practice. patients and methods: the ongoing prospective german mrcc clinical registry is recruiting patients in 110 oncology and urology outpatient centers. data from the first 250 patients who had completed first-line treatment were analyzed regarding adverse drug reactions (adrs) documented in patients' medical records. results: patients were older than in clinical trials and had comorbidities. patients were treated with the stis sunitinib (61%), temsirolimus (14%), sorafenib (10%), or bevacizumab combined with interferon (6%). about 520 adrs were documented, of which 29% resulted in treatment modifications. the most frequently affected organ system was the gastrointestinal system. the most frequently documented adrs were mucositis/stomatitis (14%), fatigue (14%), diarrhea (12%), and nausea (12%). conclusions: in routine practice, mrcc first-line treatments using stis frequently lead to adrs partly necessitating treatment modifications. the pattern of reported adrs is similar to that reported in clinical trials, but frequencies of events differ, especially for symptoms of multifactorial origin that are not immediately associated with the treatment. these results indicate that perception and documentation of adverse reactions is different between clinical trials and routine practice, and that reviews of patients' medical records might not be the best method to assess safety in routine practice.
cancer	purpose the aim of this study was to assess the value of dual-time point imaging in pet/ct for detection of biochemically recurrent or persistent prostate cancer, using the prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) ligand [ga-68]psma i&t. methods 240 patients who underwent a [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct in the context of biochemical relapse of prostate cancer were included in this retrospective analysis. imaging consisted of a standard whole-body pet/ct (1 h p.i.), followed by delayed (3 h p.i.) imaging of the abdomen. psa-stratified proportions of positive pet/ct results, standardized uptake values and target-to-background ratios were analyzed, and compared between standard and delayed imaging. results the overall detection rates of [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct were 94.2, 71.8, 58.6, 55.9 and 38.9% for psa levels of >= 2, 1 to < 2, 0.5 to0.2 to < 0.5, and 0.01 to 0.2 ng/ml, respectively. although the target-to-background ratio improved significantly over time (p < 0.0001), the majority (96.6%) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease could already be detected in standard imaging. delayed imaging at 3 h p.i. exclusively identified pathologic findings in 5.4% (10/184) of abnormal [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct scans, and exclusively detected 3.4% (38/1134) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease. [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct shows high detection rates in patients with prostate-specific antigen persistence or biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. delayed imaging can detect lesions with improved contrast compared to standard imaging. however, the impact on detection rates was limited in this study.
cancer	optical imaging methods have significant potential as effective intraoperative tools to visualize tissues, cells, and biochemical events aimed at objective assessment of the tumor margin and guiding the surgeon to adequately resect the tumor while sparing critical tissues. the wide variety of approaches to guide resection, the range of parameters that they detect, and the interdisciplinary nature involving biology, chemistry, engineering, and medicine suggested that there was a need for an organization that could review, discuss, refine, and help prioritize methods to optimize patient care and pharmaceutical and instrument development. to address these issues, the world molecular imaging society created the optical surgical navigation (osn) interest group to bring together scientists, engineers, and surgeons to develop the field to benefit patients. here, we provide an overview of approaches currently under clinical investigation for optical surgical navigation and offer our perspective on upcoming strategies.
cancer	while elevated blood cholesterol has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (crc) in observational studies, causality is uncertain. here we apply a mendelian randomisation (mr) analysis to examine the potential causal relationship between lipid traits and crc risk. we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with blood levels of total cholesterol (tc), triglyceride (tg), low-density lipoprotein (ldl), and high-density lipoprotein (hdl) as instrumental variables (iv). we calculated mr estimates for each risk factor with crc using snp-crc associations from 9,254 cases and 18,386 controls. genetically predicted higher tc was associated with an elevated risk of crc (odds ratios (or) per unit sd increase=1.46, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.20-1.79, p = 1.68 x 10(-4)). the pooled ors for ldl, hdl, and tg were 1.05 (95% ci: 0.92-1.18, p = 0.49), 0.94 (95% ci: 0.84-1.05, p = 0.27), and 0.98 (95% ci: 0.85-1.12, p = 0.75) respectively. a genetic risk score for 3-hydoxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase (hmgcr) to mimic the effects of statin therapy was associated with a reduced crc risk (or=0.69, 95% ci: 0.49-0.99, p = 0.046). this study supports a causal relationship between higher levels of tc with crc risk, and a further rationale for implementing public health strategies to reduce the prevalence of hyperlipidaemia. what 's new? while observational studies have suggested an association between blood cholesterol levels and colorectal cancer (crc), they do not establish causality and may be influenced by confounding factors. here the authors used mendelian randomization, the relationship between genetic risk scores for lipid traits and crc, to provide new evidence for a causal link between both. their results point to hyperlipidaemia as an important target for crc prevention in the population.
cancer	objective: to determine the effect of biological mesh closure on perineal wound healing after extralevator abdominoperineal resection (eapr). background: perineal wound complications frequently occur after eapr with preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer. cohort studies have suggested that biological mesh closure of the pelvic floor improves perineal wound healing. methods: patients were randomly assigned to primary closure (standard arm) or biological mesh closure (intervention arm). a non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal mesh was sutured to the pelvic floor remnants in the intervention arm, followed by a layered closure of the ischioanal and subcutaneous fat and skin similar to the control intervention. the outcome of the randomization was concealed from the patient and perineal wound assessor. the primary endpoint was the rate of uncomplicated perineal wound healing defined as a southampton wound score of less than 2 at 30 days postoperatively. patients were followed for 1 year. results: in total, 104 patients were randomly assigned to primary closure (n = 54; 1 dropouts) and biological mesh closure (n = 50; 2 dropouts). uncomplicated perineal wound healing rate at 30 days was 66% (33/50; 3 not evaluable) after primary closure, which did not significantly differ from 63% (30/48) after biological mesh closure [relative risk 1.056; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.7854-1.4197; p = 0.7177). freedom from perineal hernia at 1 year was 73% (95% ci 60.93-85.07) versus 87% (95% ci 77.49-96.51), respectively (p = 0.0316). conclusions: perineal wound healing after eapr with preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was not improved when using a biological mesh. a significantly lower 1-year perineal hernia rate after biological mesh closure is a promising secondary finding that needs longer follow-up to determine its clinical relevance.
sports_injuries	background: the middle genicular artery (mga) is responsible for the blood supply to the cruciate ligaments and synovial tissue. traumatic sports injuries and surgical procedures (open and arthroscopic) can cause vascular damage. little attention has been devoted to establish safe parameters for the mga. purpose: to investigate the anatomy of the mga and its relation to the posterior structures of the knees, mainly the posterior capsule and femoral condyles, and to establish safe parameters to avoid harming the mga. study design: descriptive laboratory study. methods: dissection of the mga was performed in 16 fresh, unpaired adult human cadaveric knees with no macroscopic degenerative or traumatic changes and no previous surgeries. the specimens were meticulously evaluated with emphasis on preservation of the mga. the distances from the mga to the medial and lateral femoral condyles were measured. the mann-whitney test was used for statistical analysis. results: in all specimens, the mga emerged from the anterior aspect of the popliteal artery, distal to the superior genicular arteries, and had a short distal trajectory toward the posterior capsule where it entered proximal to the oblique popliteal ligament. the artery lay in the midportion between the condyles. the distance between the posterior aspect of the tibia and the point of entry of the mga into the posterior joint capsule was 23.8 +/- 7.3 mm (range, 14.72-35.68 mm). there was no correlation between an individual 's height and the distance of the entrance point of the mga into the posterior joint capsule to the posterior superior corner of the tibia. conclusion: the middle genicular artery lies in the midportion between the medial and lateral femoral condyles. clinical relevance: this knowledge is important for the preservation of the blood supply during posterior knee surgical procedures and to settle a secure distance between the posterior aspect of the tibia and the mga input. this could decrease and prevent iatrogenic vascular injury risk to the mga.
sports_injuries	introduction: patellar dislocation is an emergency. vertical patellar dislocation is rare, often seen in adolescents and mostly due to sports injuries or high-velocity trauma. few cases have been reported in the literature. closed or open reduction under general anesthesia is often needed. we report a case of vertical locked patellar dislocation in a 26-year-old male, which was reduced by a simple closed method under spinal anaesthesia. a literature review regarding the various methods of treatment is also discussed. case presentation: a 26-year-old male experienced a trivial accident while descending stairs, sustaining patellar dislocation. the closed method of reduction was attempted, using a simple technique. reduction was confirmed and postoperative rehabilitation was started. follow-up was uneventful. conclusions: vertical patellar dislocations are encountered rarely in the emergency department. adolescents are not the only victims, and high-velocity trauma is not the essential cause. unnecessary manipulation should be avoided. the closed reduction method is simple, but the surgeon should be prepared for open reduction.
sports_injuries	objective there is currently no consensus on the safety of sports participation for patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst (ac). the authors' goal was to define the risk of sports participation for children with this imaging finding. methods a survey was prospectively administered to 185 patients with acs during a 46-month period at a single institution. cyst size and location, treatment, sports participation, and any injuries were recorded. eighty patients completed at least 1 subsequent survey following their initial entry into the registry, and these patients were included in a prospective registry with a mean prospective follow-up interval of 15.9 +/- 8.8 months. results a total 112 patients with acs participated in 261 sports for a cumulative duration of 4410 months or 1470 seasons. of these, 94 patients participated in 190 contact sports for a cumulative duration of 2818 months or 939 seasons. there were no serious or catastrophic neurological injuries. two patients presented with symptomatic subdural hygromas following minor sports injuries. in the prospective cohort, there were no neurological injuries conclusions permanent or catastrophic neurological injuries are very unusual in ac patients who participate in athletic activities. in most cases, sports participation by these patients is safe.
sports_injuries	eye injuries sustained during sport comprise up to 20 per cent of all injuries to the eye serious enough for medical attention to be sought. the prevalence of eye injuries in sport is not easily assessed due to lack of authoritative participation rates, so most studies report total numbers in a time period. the evidence on the proportion of all ocular injuries that are from sport is reviewed. the relative frequencies in different sports are compared in a qualitative manner and the sports with greater numbers of ocular injuries are detailed. in common with occupational injuries to the eye, most sports eye injuries are considered preventable. the hierarchy of action for occupational risk is detailed and adapted to use in a sports scenario. all the available international, regional and national standards on sports eye protection are detailed and their provisions compared. the major function of the standards is to provide adequate protection against the hazard of the sport concerned. these are detailed and compared as a function of energy transfer. eye protection must not introduce additional or secondary hazards (for instance, fracturing into sharp fragments on impact) and not introduce features that would deter the wearing of eye protection (for instance, restricting field of view to impede playing the sport). the provisions of the standards intended to limit secondary hazards are detailed and compared. the need for future work in standards writing and the activities of the international standardization organization in sports eye protection are detailed.
sports_injuries	objective: the repair of cartilaginous lesions within synovial joints is still an unresolved and weighty clinical problem. although research activity in this area has been indefatigably sustained, no significant progress has been made during the past decade. the aim of this educational review is to heighten the awareness amongst students and scientists of the basic issues that must be tackled and resolved before we can hope to escape from the whirlpool of stagnation into which we have fallen: cartilage repair redivivus! design: articular-cartilage lesions may be induced traumatically (e. g., by sports injuries and occupational accidents) or pathologically during the course of a degenerative disease (e. g., osteoarthritis). this review addresses the biological basis of cartilage repair and surveys current trends in treatment strategies, focussing on those that are most widely adopted by orthopaedic surgeons [viz., abrasive chondroplasty, microfracturing/microdrilling, osteochondral grafting and autologous-chondrocyte implantation (aci)]. also described are current research activities in the field of cartilage-tissue engineering, which, as a therapeutic principle, holds more promise for success than any other experimental approach. results and conclusions: tissue engineering aims to reconstitute a tissue both structurally and functionally. this process can be conducted entirely in vitro, initially in vitro and then in vivo (in situ), or entirely in vivo. three key constituents usually form the building blocks of such an approach: a matrix scaffold, cells, and signalling molecules. of the proposed approaches, none have yet advanced beyond the phase of experimental development to the level of clinical induction. the hurdles that need to be surmounted for ultimate success are discussed.

senior_health	the wilmington senior center developed a 3-year multidisciplinary health and wellness initiative entitled the time of your life to promote healthy aging for participants attending countywide senior centers. the purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of the evaluation methodology and outcomes of this senior health and wellness project that consisted of 11 programs in total. long-term programming can present several challenges in both implementation and evaluation, but assessing outcomes is critical to documenting program value and accountability. participant-completed surveys and post-series focus groups were utilized as the evaluation tools. our findings indicate that the program 's objectives of increasing knowledge and motivating adoption or maintenance of a healthy lifestyle were met to varying degrees, while a third objective of assessing the usefulness of resources to inform health-related decisions was unable to be evaluated due to the cross-sectional nature of the data collection. post-series focus groups indicated that topics of most interest to seniors were money management, medications and staying mentally and physically fit. the evaluations showed that long-term programming, while challenging, can be a successful and sustainable format for senior health education.
senior_health	objective: to assess the effect of introducing consensus guidelines on avoidable blood transfusions in mwanza region, tanzania. methods: avoidable blood transfusions were determined among 842 blood transfusion recipients in eight hospitals in 1991. in a workshop with senior health workers from the region, consensus guidelines for the prescription of blood transfusions were developed and introduced in the hospitals and after 7 months intervention data were collected on 1042 blood transfusion recipients. the 1991 and 1992 data were compared to estimate the change in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions. results: in blood transfusion recipients aged <5 years there was a significant reduction in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions from 257 (52%) out of 498 to 197 (33%) out of 595 (p<0.001), especially at the peripheral hospitals. for children the proportion decreased from 25 to 17% (p<0.05) and for operated patients the percentage remained at 24%. in pregnant women there was a significant increase in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions from 10 to 27% and in adults from 37 (25%) out of 146 to 121 (50%) out of 242. the improvement in peripheral hospitals was offset by a similar deterioration in the referral hospital, thus no overall reduction was achieved in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions. conclusion: the development and introduction of consensus guidelines was not sufficient to change prescribing practice. the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions decreased only in hospitals where compliance was maintained through regular clinic meetings and strict supervision by senior medical staff.
senior_health	this paper presents a new senior health monitoring system using the kinect device to monitor elderly people and detect when they are likely to fall by measuring their gait, and analyzing change in posture when they change from sitting to standing or vice versa. support vector machine is used to analyze the gait and posture data obtained from the kinect device. several experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed system and experimental results as well as research experience on using the kinect device will be presented.
senior_health	background and objectives: dental caries is an important healthcare challenge in adults over 65 years of age. integration of oral health screening into non-dental primary care practice may improve access to preventive dental care for vulnerable populations such as the elderly. such integration would require easy, fast, and accurate early caries detection tools. primary goal of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of optical coherence tomography (oct) imaging for detecting very early caries in the elderly living in community-based settings. the international caries detection and assessment system (icdas) served as gold standard. secondary goal of this study was to provide baseline prevalence data of very early caries lesions in independent living adults aged 65+ years. materials and methods: seventy-two subjects were recruited from three sites in southern california: a retirement community, a senior health fair, and a convalescent hospital. clinical examination was performed using the icdas visual criteria and this was followed by oct imaging. the two-dimensional oct images (b-scan) were analyzed with simple software. locations with a log of back-scattered light intensity (bsli) below 2.9 were scored as sound, and areas equaling or exceeding 2.9 bsli were considered carious. diagnostic performance of oct imaging was compared with icdas score. results: oct-based diagnosis demonstrated very good sensitivity (95.1%) and good specificity (85.8%). 54.7% of dentate subjects had at least one tooth with very early coronal caries. conclusions: early coronal decay is prevalent in the unrestored pits and fissures of coronal surfaces of teeth in independent living adults aged 65+ years. though oct imaging coupled with a simple diagnostic algorithm can accurately detect areas of very early caries in community-based settings, existing devices are expensive and not well-suited for use by non-dental health care providers. simple, inexpensive, fast, and accurate tools for early caries detection by field health care providers working in non-traditional settings are urgently needed to support inter-professional dental health management.

senior_health	purpose: to assess changes in various functional and satisfaction measures between older persons enrolled in minnesota senior health options (msho), a managed care program for older persons eligible for both medicare and medicaid. design and methods: we used two sets of matched controls for msho enrollees and their families and matched controls living in the community and in nursing homes: persons in the same county who were eligible to enroll but did not enroll in msho and persons in other metropolitan areas where msho is not available. for the community sample; we used questionnaires to measure functional status (activities of daily living), pain, unmet care needs, satisfaction, and caregiver burden. approximately 2 years after the first survey, we re-surveyed respondents who lived in the community at the time of the first survey. for the nursing home residents, we used annual assessments to calculate case mix to compare changes in functional levels over time. results: there were few significant differences in change over time between the msho sample and the two control groups. out-of-area controls showed greater increases in pain but in-area controls showed less interference from pain. compared with out-of-area controls, msho clients showed greater increase in homemaker use, meals on wheels, and outpatient rehabilitation. compared with in-area controls, they showed more use of meals on wheels and less help from family with household tasks. there were few differences in satisfaction, but the msho families showed significantly lower,burden than controls on five items. implications: the analyses show only modest evidence of benefit from msho compared with the two control groups. the model represented by msho does not appear to generate substantial differences in-outcomes across function, satisfaction, and caregiver burden.
multiple_sclerosis	guillain-barre syndrome (gbs) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy resulting in severe impairments of many body structures and functions with consequent limitations of activities and participation. the aim of our study was to evaluate rehabilitation outcome in these patients. forty-five (20 women, 25 men) with gbs patients who had completed primary comprehensive rehabilitation were included in the study. medical research council scale for muscle strength was used for assessment of lower-limb function. patients' activities were assessed using the functional independence measure and two walking tests (6 min and 10 m). the patients were also described using an adapted international classification of functioning, disability and health checklist. assessment was performed at admission and at discharge. clinically important and statistically significant improvements were found in all outcome measures. strong and significant correlations were found between the outcome measures. international classification of functioning, disability and health coding also clearly reflected the progress. improvement in patients' activities increased statistically significantly with time for up to 3 months of rehabilitation. the outcome was not related to the time interval from establishing the diagnosis to the start of rehabilitation. hence, multidisciplinary care for gbs patients is effective, because clinically important and statistically significant improvements regarding body functions and activities are achieved during relatively short inpatient rehabilitation. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
multiple_sclerosis	purposemagnetic susceptibility is a physical property of matter that varies depending on chemical composition and abundance of different molecular species. interest is growing in mapping of magnetic susceptibility in the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging techniques, but the influences affecting the mapped values are not fully understood. methodswe performed quantitative susceptibility mapping on 7 tesla (t) multiple echo time gradient recalled echo data and evaluated the trend in 10 regions of the human brain. temporal plots of susceptibility were performed in the caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, insula, red nucleus, substantia nigra, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and fornix. we implemented an existing three compartment signal model and used optimization to fit the experimental result to assess the influences that could be responsible for our findings. resultsthe temporal trend in susceptibility is different for different brain regions, and subsegmentation of specific regions suggests that differences are likely to be attributable to variations in tissue structure and composition. using a signal model, we verified that a nonlinear temporal behavior in experimentally computed susceptibility within imaging voxels may be the result of the heterogeneous composition of tissue properties. conclusionsdecomposition of voxel constituents into meaningful parameters may lead to informative measures that reflect changes in tissue microstructure. magn reson med 77:1946-1958, 2017.

multiple_sclerosis	background: immunotherapy initiated early after first presentation of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is associated with improved long-term outcomes. one can therefore speculate that early initiation of highly effective immunotherapies, with an average efficacy that is superior to the typical first-line therapies, could further improve relapse and disability outcomes. however, the most common treatment strategy is to commence firstline therapies, followed by treatment escalation in patients who continue to experience on-treatment disease activity. while this monitoring approach is logical, the current lack of effective regenerative or remyelinating therapies behoves us to consider high-efficacy treatment strategies from disease onset (including induction therapy) in order to prevent irreversible disability. objective: in this systematic review, we evaluate the effect of high-efficacy immunotherapies at different stages of ms. methods: a systematic review of literature reporting outcomes of treatment with fingolimod, natalizumab or alemtuzumab at different stages of ms was carried out. results and conclusions: twelve publications reporting relevant information were included in the systematic review. the literature suggests that treatment with high-efficacy immunotherapies is more potent in suppressing relapse activity when initiated early vs. with a delay after the ms diagnosis. the evidence reported for disability and mri outcomes is inconclusive.

multiple_sclerosis	aimsunderstanding the causes of axonal pathology remains a key goal in the pursuit of new therapies to target disease progression in multiple sclerosis (ms). anterograde axonal transport of many proteins vital for axonal viability is mediated by the motor protein kif5a, which has been linked to several neurological diseases. this study aimed to investigate the expression of kif5a protein and its associated cargoes: amyloid precursor protein (app) and neurofilament (nf) in post mortem ms and control white matter (wm) and to determine if kif5a expression is influenced by the presence of ms risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) identified in the region of the kif5a gene. methodsusing immunoblotting assays we analysed the expression of kif5a, app and nf phospho-isoforms in 23 ms cases and 12 controls. resultswe found a significant reduction in kif5a and associated cargoes in ms wm and an inverse correlation between kif5a and app/nf protein levels. furthermore, homozygous carriers of ms risk gene snps show significantly lower levels of kif5a protein compared to ms patients with no copies of the risk snps. conclusionswe conclude that reduced expression of axonal motor kif5a may have important implications in determining axonal transport deficits and ongoing neurodegeneration in ms.
multiple_sclerosis	objectives: disease-modifying treatments (dmts) constitute the largest direct medical cost for multiple sclerosis (ms). this study aims at investigating predictors of the 10-year economic burden for dmt administration and management. materials and methods: this study included 537 newly diagnosed, drug naive relapsing-remitting ms (rrms) patients, followed up for 10.1 +/- 3.3 years. costs for dmt administration and management were calculated, and referred to each year of observation (annual costs). possible predictors of disease evolution were categorized into early predictors (age, gender, disease duration, baseline expanded disability status scale (edss), 1-point edss progression within 2 years, and annualized relapse rate -arr-within 2 years), and long-term predictors (reaching of edss 4.0, conversion to secondary progressive -sp-, arr, number of dmts, follow-up duration). association between predictors and study outcome was explored using mixed-effects log-linear regression models. results: a 1-point higher edss at diagnosis was associated with 13.21% increase in the annual costs (95% ci=4.16-23.04%). each additional year of age at diagnosis was associated with a 0.74% decrease in the annual costs (95% ci=-1.43 to-0.04%). female gender was associated with a 12.43% decrease in the annual costs (95% ci=-22.61 to-0.93%). converting to sp was associated with a 14.26% decrease in the annual costs (95% ci=-14.26 to-2.94%). each additional year of follow-up was associated with a 3.05% decrease in the annual costs (95% ci=-4.51 to-1.57%). conclusions: an estimate of the 10-year costs associated with dmt administration and management can be calculated by analyzing different factors, and might be of particular interest for planning resources needed for treating people with ms.
hepatitis_c	traditional vaccination approaches (e.g. live attenuated or killed microorganisms) are among the most effective means to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. these approaches, nevertheless, have failed to yield successful vaccines against many important pathogens. to overcome this problem, methods have been developed to identify microbial components, against which protective immune responses can be elicited. subunit antigens identified by these approaches enable the production of defined vaccines, with improved safety profiles. however, they are generally poorly immunogenic, necessitating their administration with potent immunostimulatory adjuvants. since few safe and effective adjuvants are currently used in vaccines approved for human use, with those available displaying poor potency, or an inability to stimulate the types of immune responses required for vaccines against specific diseases (e.g. cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) to treat cancers), the development of new vaccines will be aided by the availability of characterized platforms of new adjuvants, improving our capacity to rationally select adjuvants for different applications. one such approach, involves the addition of microbial components (pathogen-associated molecular patterns; pamps), that can stimulate strong immune responses, into subunit vaccine formulations. the conjugation of pamps to subunit antigens provides a means to greatly increase vaccine potency, by targeting immunostimulation and antigen to the same antigen presenting cell. thus, methods that enable the efficient, and inexpensive production of antigen-adjuvant fusions represent an exciting mean to improve immunity towards subunit antigens. herein we review four protein-based adjuvants (flagellin, bacterial lipoproteins, the extra domain a of fibronectin (eda), and heat shock proteins (hsps)), which can be genetically fused to antigens to enable recombinant production of antigen-adjuvant fusion proteins, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, structural or sequence requirements for activity, sequence modifications to enhance their activity or simplify production, adverse effects, and examples of vaccines in preclinical or human clinical trials.

hepatitis_c	hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is currently the most important cause of chronic viral hepatitis in the world and one of the most frequent indications for liver transplantation. hcv uses different strategies to evade the innate and adaptive immune response, and this evasion plays a key role in determining viral persistence. several hcv viral proteins have been described as immune modulators. in this review, we will focus on the effect of hcv nucleocapsid core protein in the function of immune cells and its correlation with the findings observed in hcv chronically infected patients. effects on immune cell function related to both extracellular and intracellular hcv core localization will be considered. this review provides an updated perspective on the mechanisms involved in hcv evasion related to one single hcv protein, which could become a key tool in the development of new antiviral strategies able to control and/or eradicate hcv infection.
hepatitis_c	introduction: clinicians and practitioners caring for patients with chronic liver disease are often unsure whether drug therapy is a hazard that increases their patient 's risk for drug-induced liver injury (dili).areas covered: we searched for reports of drug induced liver injury, both idiosyncratic and intrinsic, in patients with chronic liver disease including non-alcoholic and alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis. reports we analyzed include statin treatment in patients with fatty liver, acetaminophen use in alcoholic fatty liver, antituberculous drugs in patients with tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, antiviral medications in hepatitis and antiretroviral medications in hiv/aids. the most challenging cases we found are drug therapy in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.expert opinion: we identified many case reports and case series discussing a potential increased risk of dili in patients with pre-existing liver disease. however, most of these reports were retrospective and ambiguous. with few exceptions, we conclude that drugs seem to be well tolerated by the majority of patients with pre-existing, non-cirrhotic chronic liver diseases. special care is needed for some therapies, however, including antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis b and c and in decompensated liver cirrhosis with impaired drug metabolism. prospective studies are warranted to valid our conclusions.
hepatitis_c	background: chronic antigen exposure and/or ageing increases the frequency of t-box expressed in t cells (t-bet)-expressing b-lymphocytes in mice. the frequency and significance of b-cell t-bet expression during chronic hepatitis c (hcv) infection in human subjects has never been described. methods: healthy controls, cirrhotic and noncirrhotic hcv-infected patients, and non-hcv patients with cirrhosis were recruited. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were phenotyped for expression of t-bet and related markers by flow cytometry. in a subset of patients who underwent antiviral therapy and were cured of hcv infection (sustained virological response), the dynamics of t-bet expression in b cells was monitored. after cure, convalescent b cells were tested for t-bet expression after re-exposure to infected plasma or recombinant hcv proteins. results: forty-nine patients including 11 healthy donors, 30 hepatitis c-infected individuals (nine with liver cancer, 13 with cirrhosis, eight without cirrhosis) and eight patients with cirrhosis due to non-hcv-related cause were recruited. we found that b cells in patients with chronic hcv exhibited increased frequency of t-bet+ b cells relative to noninfected individuals (median 11.5% v. 2.2%, p<.0001) but that there were no significant differences between noncirrhotic, cirrhotic and cancer-bearing infected individuals. t-bet(+) b cells expressed higher levels of cd95, cxcr3, cd11c, cd267 and fcrl5 compared to t-bet(-) b cells and predominantly exhibit a tissue-like memory cd27(-)cd21(-) phenotype independent of hcv infection. t-bet(+) b cells in hcv-infected patients were more frequently class-switched igd(-)igg(+) (40.4% vs. 26.4%, p=.012). resolution of hcv infection with direct-acting antiviral (daa) therapy leads to a marked reduction in the frequency of t-bet(+) b cells (median 14.1% pretreatment v. 6.7% end of treatment v. 6.1% svr12, p.01). re-exposure of convalescent (cured) b cells to viremic plasma and recombinant hcv e2 protein led to re-expression of t-bet. conclusion: chronic antigenemia in chronic hcv infection induces and maintains an antigen-specific t-bet(+) b cell. these b cells share markers with tissue-like memory b cells. antigen-driven t-bet expression may be a critical suppressor of b-cell activation in chronic hcv infection.
hepatitis_c	background: determination of the hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotype and discrimination between hcv subtypes 1a and 1b is still mandatory prior to anti-hcv treatment initiation. the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the recently introduced cobas\(r) hcv gt assay (roche) and to compare it to two comparator assays. methods: the cobas (r) hcv gt assay is based on primerspecific real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). for comparison, the trugene (r) hcv 5'nc genotyping kit (siemens) and the versant (r) hcv genotype 2.0 assay (siemens) were employed. accuracy of the new assay was determined using proficiency panels. for clinical evaluation, 183 residual clinical samples obtained from patients with chronic hepatitis c infection were included. results: when accuracy was tested, panel members containing hcv subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a were identified as expected; however, the new assay failed to identify low titer panel members containing hcv subtype 5a correctly. of 183 clinical samples, 160 gave concordant results. for seven samples, an indeterminate result was reported with the cobas (r) hcv gt assay and the remaining 16 samples were found discordant with one of the comparator assays. when time-to-results of the assays were compared, the new assay showed shorter total time and similar handson time per sample. conclusions: the cobas (r) hcv gt assay showed a good performance and proved to be suitable for use in the routine diagnostic laboratory. due to the high level of automation, fast and reliable results are obtained with short hands-on time.
weight_loss	weight loss surgery that mechanically restricts consumers' bodies to limit their food intake is booming in a context of globesity (world health organization). based on a foucauldian analysis, this study contends that self-transformative experiences arise from normalizing practices that the advocates of a repressive medical bio power overlook. this article problematizes the idea of resistance and normativity by emphasizing the existence of various forms of agency, not all of which are predicated on the term of resistance. the author proposes 'embodied transformation' as escaping docile embodiment versus embodied resistance (the negative view of subjectification as subjecting) to tell of normalizing practices that become a locus of discovery of creative potentialities within restrictive contexts. the study detects two types of agency. consumers' discourses are driven by a temporal or narrative structure vs. a spatial or connective form of becoming.

weight_loss	the present study aimed to determine the effect of a green tea supplement on anthropometric indices and inflammatory factors in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). in this randomized clinical trial, 45 women with pcos were randomly allocated into two groups receiving green tea tablets or placebo. the period of intervention was 45days. the serum levels of interleukin 6, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor were measured before and after intervention period using the related kits. anthropometric indices also were measured. the mean of body mass index, weight, waist circumference, and body fat percentage in the green tea group were reduced significantly. however, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. also, there was no significant effect on the levels of inflammatory factors. the present results suggest that daily consumption of green tea tablets did not cause any effect on inflammation biomarkers in pcos women. however, it may be effective as a complementary treatment for weight control in these women. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
weight_loss	laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (lagb) is the third most popular bariatric procedure worldwide. various authors present ambivalent long-term follow up results. we revised records of the patients who underwent lagb between 2003 and 2006 along with history of additional check-ins. patients with outdated details were tracked with the national health insurance database and social media (facebook). an online survey was sent. the patients who did not have their band removed were included in this study. we calculated the percent total weight loss (%twl) and percent excess weight loss (%ewl), along with changes in body mass index (delta bmi). satisfactory weight loss was set at >50% ewl (for bmi = 25 kg/m(2)). since eight patients gained weight, we decided to include negative values of %twl, %ewl, and delta bmi. one hundred seven patients underwent lagb from 2003 to 2006. the mean follow-up time was 11.2 (+/- 1.2) years. eleven percent of patients were lost to follow up (n = 12). there was one perioperative death. fifty-four of the patients (n = 57) had their band removed. thirty-seven patients still have the band (39%) and were included in the study. the mean %ewl was 27% (-56-112%) and %twl was 11% (-19-53%). twelve patients achieved %ewl >50% (32%). thiry-two patients still suffer from obesity, with bmi over 30 kg/m(2). eight patients (22%) gained additional weight. patients with %ewl >50% suffered less from gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms than those with ewl < 50% (p < 0.05). out of 107 cases, only 11.2% of patients with gastric band (n = 12) achieved satisfactory %ewl. twenty-two percent of patients regained their weight or even exceeded it. overall results suggest that lagb is not an effective bariatric procedure in long term observation.
weight_loss	calculation of energy and protein doses for critically ill patients is still a matter of controversy. for more than 40 years of nutrition support, the total amount of nutrients to be delivered to these patients has been calculated based on expert recommendations, and this calculation is based on the administration of nonprotein calories in one attempt to ameliorate catabolic response and avoid the weight loss. new evidence suggests protein delivery is the most important intervention to improve clinical and metabolic outcomes. this article describes the metabolic rationale and the new evidence supporting a change in the approach of metabolic support of the critically ill, proposing a physiological-based intervention supported by the recognition of ancillary characteristics of the metabolic response to trauma and injury. a moderate dose of calories around 15 kcal/kg/d with a delivery of protein of 1.5 g/kg/d appears to be the new recommendation for many hypercatabolic patients in the first week following injury.
weight_loss	postharvest uv exposure has been useful to i) delay senescence and ii) induce the accumulation of bioactive compounds in some vegetable species. however, no studies have been conducted to determine the treatment conditions (radiation dose and intensity) required to maximize these two diverse responses. in this work, we evaluated the effect of uv-b irradiation intensity (control: 0, low: 3.2, medium: 4.0 and high: 5.0 w/m(2)) and dose (0, 2, 4, 8, 12 kj/m(2)) on quality retention and antioxidant capacity of fresh broccoli florets during storage (4 degrees c for 17 days). exposure to low uv-b radiation and dose (2, 4 kj/m(2)) reduced broccoli weight loss, delayed yellowing and improved chlorophyll and chlorophyllide retention. after long term storage, no marked improvement on the antioxidant capacity was found regardless of the irradiation condition. evaluations at short time after uv-b exposure (0, 2, 6, 18 h) indicated that the treatments elicited antioxidant accumulation. greatest antioxidant capacity was found in broccoli subjected to high intensity uv-b. increased levels of aliphatic glucosinolates were found 18 h after the uv-b irradiation, whereas phenolic antioxidants peaked 6 h after the treatment. results showed that low uv-b doses and intensities delayed chlorophyll degradation and may be useful to complement refrigeration in fresh broccoli. instead, high intensity uv-b exposure may be better suited as a pre-treatment to increase the antioxidant capacity prior to further processing such us freezing.

low_testosterone	men with congestive heart failure (chf) have relatively low testosterone levels. several studies demonstrated that testosterone treatment increases cardiac output and reduces peripheral vascular resistance. however, the effects of testosterone on heart function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular remodeling have not been fully elucidated. this study was conducted to investigate the effects of testosterone on heart function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular remodeling in male rats post-myocardial infarction. a total of 86 male rats were randomly assigned to undergo ligation of the coronary artery (n=70) or pseudosurgery (n=16). after 6 weeks, a left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) of 45% was defined as a successful model of chf. the model rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups, namely low-dose testosterone (tu), high-dose tu and placebo (pl) groups. after treatment for 12 weeks, the expression of several mrna transcripts in myocardial tissue was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. immunofluorescence was used to measure myocardial caspase-3 expression. compared to the pl group, lvef was significantly improved in the tu treatment groups. moreover, the mrna expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase 2a was significantly reduced, while the mrna expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 was markedly increased in the tu groups. tu treatment also significantly reduced caspase-3 expression. therefore, different doses of tu suppressed ventricular remodeling and improved left ventricular function, reduced apoptosis and prevented mortality in a chf rat model.
low_testosterone	serum testosterone is reduced in up to 90% of men with cirrhosis, with levels falling as liver disease advances. testosterone is an important anabolic hormone, with effects on muscle, bone, and hematopoiesis. many of the features of advanced liver disease are similar to those seen in hypogonadal men, including sarcopenia, osteoporosis, gynecomastia, and low libido. however, the relative contribution of testosterone deficiency to the symptomatology of advanced liver disease has not been well established. more recently, it has been demonstrated that low testosterone in men with cirrhosis is associated with increased mortality, independent of the classically recognized prognostic factors, such as the model for end-stage liver disease score. only several small clinical trials have examined the role of testosterone therapy in men with cirrhosis, none of which have resolved the issue of whether or not testosterone is beneficial. however, in men with organic hypogonadism due to structural hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis disease, testosterone therapy has been shown to improve muscle mass and bone mineral density, increase hemoglobin, and reduce insulin resistance. despite initial concerns linking testosterone with hepatocellular carcinoma, more recent data suggest that this risk has been overstated. there is, therefore, now a strong rationale to assess the efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy in cirrhosis in well-designed randomized controlled trials.
low_testosterone	introduction. women suffer from depression more frequently than men, which indicates that sex hormones might be involved in the etiology of this disease. aims. the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between testosterone and depression pathophysiology in depressive women along with sexual function. we also investigated whether antidepressant treatment causes any change in levels of this hormone or in sexual function. methods. premenopausal female patients aged 25-46 years (n = 52) with diagnosed major depression were included in this study as the patient group, and 25- to 46-year-old premenopausal women without depression (n = 30) were included as the control group. main outcome measures. serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg) levels were measured twice, before and after the antidepressant treatment. bioavailable testosterone (cbt) levels were calculated using the assay results for total testosterone (tt), shbg, and albumin according to the formulas of vermeulen et al. depression severity was measured using the 17-item hamilton depression rating scale, and sexual function was evaluated with the arizona sexual experience scale. results. the mean tt and cbt levels significantly increased in the patient group after the antidepressant treatment (p < 0.001). pre-treatment tt and cbt levels were significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group (p0.05). there were no significant differences among the groups in terms of shbg level. conclusion. the low testosterone levels in depressed women compared with women in the control group and the elevated levels post-pharmacotherapy suggest that testosterone may be involved in depression.
low_testosterone	background. growth hormone is the major regulator of growth and body composition. pulsatile gh secretion declines exponentially with age. testosterone replacement is being increasingly offered to older men with age-related low testosterone. testosterone administration has been shown to stimulate gh secretion. however, little is known about the effect of testosterone aromatization to estradiol on gh pulsatility and its impact on igf-1 in older men. objective. this randomized controlled proof-of-concept trial investigated the relative effects of testosterone and estradiol on gh pulsatility and igf-1 in older men with low testosterone. design. thirty-seven men, >= 65 years with total testosterone <350 ng/dl were randomized to 5 g transdermal testosterone gel (tt), 1 mg oral aromatase inhibitor (ai) or placebo daily for 12 months. primary outcome was deconvolution and approximate entropy analyses of pulsatile including basal and entropic modes of secretion performed at baseline and 3 months. secondary outcomes included igf-1 evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months. results. at 3 months, mean gh and in igf-1 were similar between the three groups. at 6 months, igf-1 significantly increased by delta 15.3 +/- 10.3 ng/ml in the tt-group compared to placebo (p = 0.03). both intervention groups significantly increased gh pulse frequency (tt-group, p = 0.04; ai-group, p = 0.05) compared to placebo. the gh secretory-burst mode (duration) significantly decreased in the tt-group (p = 0.0018) compared to placebo while it remained unchanged in the ai-group (p = 0.059). conclusions. in older men, testosterone increases gh pulse frequency while the aromatization to estradiol is involved in the rise of igf-1 levels.

low_testosterone	objectives: to analyze the predictive value of psa for progression and the role of testosterone for quality of life (qol) in patients with androgen deprivation therapy (adt) for metastatic prostate cancer. materials and methods: psa and testosterone data were used from a phase iii trial randomizing patients without progression and psa < 4 ng/ml (n = 193), after 6 months induction course, between continuous (cad) (n = 96) and intermittent (iad) (a = 97) adt. the 2-year risk of progression was calculated for baseline psa, 'fast' and 'slow' psa decline to < 4 ng/ml (60 days cut-oft), psa nadir, performance status and pain. testosterone kinetics and qol were also evaluated. univariate kaplan meier survival analysis and log rank tests were used to compare the risk of progression. results: for progression analysis, 173 patients' data were available. the 2-year risk of progression for baseline psa < 50 ng/ml, 50 to= 500 ng/ml was 25%, 55%, and 76% (p = 0.03) in cad, and 38%, 64%, and 85% (p = 0.006) in iad, respectively. the 2-year risk of progression for psa nadir0.2 to 4 ng/ml in cad was 31% and 70% (p < 0.001), respectively. in the tad group, a similar trend was seen. patients with psa nadir 0.2 ng/ml, though had significantly higher 2-year risk of progression compared to cad (53% vs. 31% (p = 0.03), respectively. psa decline showed no predictive value. patients without pain had a significantly lower 2-year risk of progression in both groups. without adt testosterone remained at castrate level for 4 months. after the first and second iad cycle 92% and 46%, respectively, had a normalized testosterone. no qol difference was found, although more side effects occurred in cad. conclusions: metastatic prostate cancer patients with high baseline psa, pain, and high psa nadir have a poor prognosis with adt. patients with low psa nadir do significantly worse with tad compared with cad. low testosterone after adt and incomplete testosterone recovery may explain similar qol. therefore, tad is not a good treatment option for many metastatic prostate cancer patients. 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
fungal_infection	arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that affects physiological and biochemical functions. the cpa2 gene in yeast encodes a large subunit of arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (cps) and is involved in arginine biosynthesis. here, an ortholog of yeast cpa2 was identified in the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae, and was named mocpa2. mocpa2 is an 1180-amino acid protein which contains an atp grasp domain and two cpsase domains. targeted deletion of mocpa2 supported its role in de novo arginine biosynthesis in m. oryzae as mutant phenotypes were complemented by arginine but not ornithine. the delta mocpa2 mutant exhibited defects in asexual development and pathogenicity but not appressorium formation. further examination revealed that the invasive hyphae of the delta mocpa2 mutant were restricted mainly to the primary infected cells. in addition, the delta mocpa2 mutant was unable to induce a plant defense response and had the ability to scavenge ros during pathogen-plant interactions. structure analysis revealed that the atp grasp domain and each cps domain were indispensable for the proper localization and full function of mocpa2. in summary, our results indicate that mocpa2 plays an important role in arginine biosynthesis, and affects growth, conidiogenesis, and pathogenicity. these results suggest that research into metabolism and processes that mediate amino acid synthesis are valuable for understanding m. oryzae pathogenesis.
fungal_infection	near-infrared (nir) hyperspectral imaging system was used to detect five concentration levels of ochratoxin a (ota) in contaminated wheat kernels. the wheat kernels artificially inoculated with two different ota producing penicillium verrucosum strains, two different non-toxigenic p. verrucosum strains, and sterile control wheat kernels were subjected to nir hyperspectral imaging. the acquired three-dimensional data were reshaped into readable two-dimensional data. principal component analysis (pca) was applied to the two dimensional data to identify the key wavelengths which had greater significance in detecting ota contamination in wheat. statistical and histogram features extracted at the key wavelengths were used in the linear, quadratic and mahalanobis statistical discriminant models to differentiate between sterile control, five concentration levels of ota contamination in wheat kernels, and five infection levels of non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels. the classification models differentiated sterile control samples from ota contaminated wheat kernels and non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels with a 100% accuracy. the classification models also differentiated between five concentration levels of ota contaminated wheat kernels and between five infection levels of non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels with a correct classification of more than 98%. the non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels and ota contaminated wheat kernels subjected to hyperspectral imaging provided different spectral patterns. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
fungal_infection	agarwood formation in aquilaria malaccensis could be artificially stimulated by fungal infection. furthermore, a. malaccensis adapts to this infection by developing typical included phloem boundary within xylem tissues. naturally synthesized agarwood requires a lengthy process of up to 30 years, which impedes its continuous production. therefore, recent effort has been allocated to the elucidation of agarwood formation to stimulate its process rapidly. in this study, we artificially induced agarwood formation by injection and inoculation of cultivated aquilaria malaccensis with four strains of fusarium solani isolated from different places in indonesia. the results showed that a. malaccensis responded differently upon wounding and fungal inoculations compared to healthy trees. all wounded and inoculated samples resulted in the formation of typical discoloration zone surrounding injection sites. further anatomical observation revealed that both samples also developed included phloem structures in which resinous agarwood compounds were accumulated. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis of the inoculated samples yielded some important agarwood compounds such as tridecanoic acid, alpha-santalol, and spathulenol, which were not present in both healthy controls and only wounded samples. notably, one of the tested f. solani, strain gorontalo displayed promising results as a candidate for artificially induced agarwood formation in a. malaccensis in terms of color, odor, and chemical constituents.
fungal_infection	here, we report a patient developing a postoperative peritoneal infection by aspergillus fumigatus. while galactomannan serum levels were negative throughout the time course, galactomannan levels in peritoneal fluids yielded high results. serological testing of peritoneal fluids for fungal antigens might be a useful and easily applicable tool to support diagnosis of intraabdominal aspergillosis, which represents a rare type of invasive fungal infection.
fungal_infection	host-associated microbiomes perform many beneficial functions including resisting pathogens and training the immune system. here, we show that amphibians developing in captivity lose substantial skin bacterial diversity, primarily due to reduced ongoing input from environmental sources. we combined studies of wild and captive amphibians with a database of over 1 000 strains that allows us to examine antifungal function of the skin microbiome. we tracked skin bacterial communities of 62 endangered boreal toads, anaxyrus boreas, across 18 time points, four probiotic treatments, and two exposures to the lethal fungal pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) in captivity, and compared these to 33 samples collected from wild populations at the same life stage. as the amphibians in captivity lost the bd-inhibitory bacteria through time, the proportion of individuals exposed to bd that became infected rose from 33% to 100% in subsequent exposures. inoculations of the bd-inhibitory probiotic janthinobacterium lividum resulted in a 40% increase in survival during the second bd challenge, indicating that the effect of microbiome depletion was reversible by restoring bd-inhibitory bacteria. taken together, this study highlights the functional role of ongoing environmental inputs of skin-associated bacteria in mitigating a devastating amphibian pathogen, and that long-term captivity decreases this defensive function.
diabetes	prolonged hyperglycemia activates the formation of advanced glycation end-products (ages). major dicarbonyl compounds such as methylglyoxal or glyoxal are found to be the main precursors of ages and n(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (cml) found to be predominantly higher in the diabetic population. we hypothesized that phloretin from apple and [6]-gingerol from ginger inhibit formation of ages and suppress the receptor for advanced glycation end products (rage) via nuclear factor erythroid-2-related-factor-2 (nrf2)-dependent pathway. phloretin and [6]-gingerol were supplemented at two different doses to c57bl/6 mice on high fat diet or standard diet for a period of 17 weeks. phloretin or [6]-gingerol supplementation significantly reduced plasma glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, ages and insulin levels. phloretin and [6]-gingerol also decreased the levels of ages and cml levels, via nrf2 pathway, enhancing gsh/gssg ratio, heme oxygenase-1 and glyoxalase 1 in liver tissue. these results suggest that phloretin and [6]-gingerol are potential dietary compounds that can alleviate diabetes-induced complications.

diabetes	background: gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) is associated with both short-and long-term adverse health consequences for both the mother and her offspring. the aim was to study the prevalence and risk factors for gdm in beijing. methods: the study population consisted of 15,194 pregnant women attending prenatal care in 15 hospitals in beijing, who delivered between june 20, 2013, and november 30, 2013, after 28 weeks of gestation. the participants were selected by cluster sampling from the 15 hospitals identified through random systematic sampling based on the number of deliveries in 2012. a questionnaire was designed to collect information. results: a total of 2987 (19.7%) women were diagnosed with gdm and 208 (1.4%) had diabetes in pregnancy (dip). age (or: 1.053, 95% ci: 1.033-1.074, p < 0.01), family history of diabetes mellitus (or: 1.481, 95% ci: 1.254-1.748, p < 0.01), prepregnancy body mass index (bmi) (or: 1.481,95% ci: 1.254-1.748, p < 0.01), bmi gain before 24 weeks (or: 1.126, 95% ci: 1.075-1.800, p < 0.01), maternal birth weight (p < 0.01), and fasting plasma glucose at the first prenatal visit (p < 0.01) were identified as risk factors for gdm. in women with birth weight < 3000 g, gdm rate was significantly higher. conclusions: one out of every five pregnant women in beijing either had gdm or dip and this constitutes a huge health burden for health services. prepregnancy bmi and weight gain before 24 h week are important modifiable risk factors for gdm. ensuring birth weight above 3000 g may help reduce risk for future gdm among female offsprings.
diabetes	background: advancements in research and clinical care have considerably extended the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. however, with this extended survival come comorbidities. one of the leading co-morbidities is cf-related bone disease (cfbd), which progresses with disease severity and places patients at high risk for fractures, particularly of the ribs and vertebrae. evidence that cf patients with vertebral fractures had higher bone mineral density (bmd) than the nonfracture group led us to postulate that bone quality is impaired in these patients. we therefore examined rib specimens resected at the time of lung transplant in cf patients to measure parameters of bone quantity and quality. methods: in this exploratory study, we analysed 19 end-stage cf and 13 control rib specimens resected from otherwise healthy lung donors. bmd, bone microarchitecture, static parameters of bone formation and resorption and microcrack density of rib specimens were quantified by imaging, histomorphometric and histological methods. variables reflecting the mineralization of ribs were assessed by digitized microradiography. the degree of bone mineralization (g/cm(3)) and the heterogeneity index of the mineralization (g/cm(3)) were calculated for trabecular and cortical bone. results: compared to controls, cf ribs exhibited lower areal and trabecular volumetric bmd, decreased trabecular thickness and osteoid parameters, and increased microcrack density, that was particularly pronounced in specimens from patients with cf-related diabetes. static parameters of bone resorption were similar in both groups. degree of mineralization of total bone, but not heterogeneity index, was increased in cf specimens. conclusion: the combination of reduced bone mass, altered microarchitecture, imbalanced bone remodeling (maintained bone resorption but decreased formation), increased microdamage and a small increase of the degree of mineralization, may lead to decreased bone strength, which, when coupled with chronic coughing and chest physical therapy, may provide an explanation for the increased incidence of rib fractures previously reported in this population. 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
diabetes	type-2 diabetes (t2d) is associated in observational studies with both higher bone mineral density (bmd) and higher fracture risk for given bmd. these relationships may however be confounded by factors such as body mass index (bmi). here we used mendelian randomization (mr) to obtain non-confounded estimates of the effect of t2d and glycemic traits on bmd. we identified genetic variants strongly associated with t2d risk (34,840 t2d cases and 114,981 controls) and fasting glucose (133,010 nondiabetic individuals), but not associated with bmi, and determined the effects of these variants on bmd (up to 83,894 individuals). using these variants as instrumental variables, we found that a genetically-increased risk of t2d increased femoral neck bmd (+0.034 sd in bmd per unit increase in log-odds of t2d [95% ci, 0.001 to 0.067; p=0.044]). genetically-increased fasting glucose also increased femoral neck bmd (+0.13 sd in bmd per mmol/l increase in fasting glucose [95% ci, 0.01 to 0.25; p=0.034]). similar nonsignificant trends were observed for the effects of t2d and fasting glucose on lumbar spine bmd. our results indicate that both genetically-increased t2d risk and genetically-increased fasting glucose have weak positive effects on bmd.

parenting	although parenting is one of the most commonly studied predictors of child problem behavior, few studies have examined parenting as a multidimensional and dynamic construct. this study investigated different patterns of developmental trajectories of two parenting dimensions (harsh discipline [hd] and parental warmth [pw]) with a person-oriented approach and examined the associations between different parenting patterns and child externalizing problems and callous-unemotional traits. data were drawn from the combined high-risk control and normative sample (n = 753) of the fast track project. parent-reported hd and observer-reported pw from kindergarten to grade 2 were fit to growth mixture models. two subgroups were identified for hd (low decreasing, 83.0 %; high stable, 17.0 %) and pw (high increasing, 78.7 %; low increasing, 21.3 %). the majority of parents (67.0 %) demonstrated the low decreasing hd and high increasing pw pattern, while the prevalence of the high stable hd and low increasing pw pattern was the lowest (6.8 %). parenting satisfaction, parental depression, family socioeconomic status, and neighborhood safety predicted group memberships jointly defined by the two dimensions. children from the high stable hd and low increasing pw pattern showed the highest levels of externalizing problems in grades 4 and 5. children from the low decreasing hd and low increasing pw pattern showed the highest levels of callous-unemotional traits in grade 7. these findings demonstrate the utility and significance of a person-oriented approach to measuring parenting as a multidimensional and dynamic construct and reveal the interplay between hd and pw in terms of their influences on child developmental outcomes.
parenting	backgroundpractices to facilitate self-determination have not received appropriate attention in research concerning parents with intellectual disabilities (id). likewise, parenting interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities have seldom observed both parent and child behavioural outcomes. methodsthis study evaluated the effectiveness of a parenting intervention embedded with self-determination facilitation practices for two dyads of a parent with intellectual disabilities and their young child. the interventions focused on increasing parents' ability to correctly implement steps of a parenting routine while reducing occurrence of challenging child behaviour. resultsthe results of the study demonstrated two basic effects of correctly completed steps of the parenting routine and a reduction of challenging child behaviour. parents also reported decreased feelings of stress during the routine following completion of the intervention. conclusionsimplications for future research and replication of this pilot study are discussed.
parenting	providing educative help at home means that professionals have to enter into the intimacy of families and share daily tasks often for a long time. family support workers spend many hours alongside parents, helping them with their domestic and parenting tasks. this paper reports findings from an ethnographic study in which the researcher notes and gathers personal accounts relating to material and non-material exchanges between professionals and parents. it analyses the various forms of exchanges between families and family support workers that are permitted, tolerated or excluded by employers. it shows the informal side of professionals working with parents at home.
parenting	the present study was designed to examine mothers' emotional reactions, causal attributions, and socialization strategies in response to preschool children 's engagement in proactive and reactive physical aggression with peers during free play at school. participants were 84 mothers (m-age=31.83, sd=4.48) with preschool-aged children (m-age=4.92, sd=0. 97), residing in ankara, turkey. supporting our expectations, mothers reacted with negative emotions to both functions of aggressive behaviours, with less anxiety, disappointment, embarrassment, and guilt for reactive aggression. they also believed that reactive aggression is more contextually dependent and intentional and reported more indirect (e.g., asking the child, teacher, or other children to find out more about the situation and aggressive episode) and other-oriented strategies (e.g., telling the other child to behave properly) to address these behaviours. overall, our findings suggest that turkish mothers' feelings, perceptions, and socialization approaches to childhood aggression vary depending on the functions of aggression, and mothers perceive preschool-aged children 's engagement in reactive aggression in the school setting as relatively more acceptable than proactive aggression. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
parenting	purpose patients with advanced disease are living longer and commonly used patient-reported outcome measures (proms) may miss relevant elements of the quality of extended survival. this systematic review examines the measures used to capture aspects of the quality of survival including impact on patients' everyday lives such as finances, work and family roles. methods searches were conducted in medline, embase, cinahl and psycinfo restricted to english language articles. information on study characteristics, instruments and outcomes was systematically extracted and synthesised. a predefined set of criteria was used to rate the quality of studies. results from 2761 potentially relevant articles, 22 met all inclusion criteria, including 10 concerning financial distress, 3 on roles and responsibilities and 9 on multiple aspects of social well-being. generally, studies were not of high quality; many lacked bias free participant selection, had confounding factors and had not accounted for all participants. high levels of financial distress were reported and were associated with multiple demographic factors such as age and income. there were few reports concerned with impacts on patients' roles/responsibilities in everyday life although practical and emotional struggles with parenting were identified. social difficulties were common and associated with multiple factors including being a caregiver. many studies were single time-point surveys and used non-validated measures. exceptions were employment of the cost and social difficulties inventory (sdi), validated measures of financial and social distress respectively. conclusions impact on some important parts of patients' everyday lives is insufficiently and inconsistently captured. further prom development focussing on roles and responsibilities, including work and caring for dependents, is warranted. implications for cancer survivors factors such as finances, employment and responsibility for caring for dependants (e.g. children and elderly relatives) can affect the well-being of cancer survivors. there is a need to ensure that any instruments used to assess patients' social well-being are broad enough to include these areas so that any difficulties arising can be better understood and appropriately supported.
birth_control	endocrine-disrupting chemicals (edcs) in municipal effluents directly affect the sexual development and reproductive success of fishes, but indirect effects on invertebrate prey or fish predators through reduced predation or prey availability, respectively, are unknown. at the experimental lakes area in northwestern ontario, canada, a long-term, whole-lake experiment was conducted using a before-after-control-impact design to determine both direct and indirect effects of the synthetic oestrogen used in the birth control pill, 17 alpha-ethynyloestradiol (ee2). algal, microbial, zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities showed no declines in abundance during three summers of ee2 additions (5-6 ng l(-1)), indicating no direct toxic effects. recruitment of fathead minnow (pimephales promelas) failed, leading to a near-extirpation of this species both 2 years during (young-of-year, yoy) and 2 years following (adults and yoy) ee2 additions. body condition of male lake trout (salvelinus namaycush) and male and female white sucker (catostomus commersonii) declined before changes in prey abundance, suggesting direct effects of ee2 on this endpoint. evidence of indirect effects of ee2 was also observed. increases in zooplankton, chaoborus, and emerging insects were observed after 2 or 3 years of ee2 additions, strongly suggesting indirect effects mediated through the reduced abundance of several small-bodied fishes. biomass of top predator lake trout declined by 23-42% during and after ee2 additions, most probably an indirect effect from the loss of its prey species, the fathead minnow and slimy sculpin (cottus cognatus). our results demonstrate that small-scale studies focusing solely on direct effects are likely to underestimate the true environmental impacts of oestrogens in municipal wastewaters and provide further evidence of the value of whole-ecosystem experiments for understanding indirect effects of edcs and other aquatic stressors.
birth_control	the role of secularization in the european fertility decline has been of interest to demographers, who often explore the relationship on a macro-level or by identifying religious affiliation by proxy. however, the relationship has not been thoroughly studied on an individual level utilizing indicators of personal religious conviction and affiliation. the aim of the present article is to examine reproductive practices by religious affiliation in order to understand the impact of secularization on fertility decline. this is accomplished using event history analysis of longitudinal parish register data from sundsvall (1860-1921) where religious affiliation is identified on a family level. reproductive practices are analysed using cohort tfr, descriptive statistics and cox proportional hazard regressions. free-church affiliates had, overall, a higher probability of having another child than did affiliates to the state church. however, these differences decreased over time, and as fertility dropped throughout society free-church affiliates showed the strongest significant reduction in probability of another birth. this indicates that over time, within the free churches, ideas about respectability and restraint came to mean that birth control, in the form of abstinence within marriage, became an important practice in the formation of gendered religious identities - leading to a relatively early decrease in fertility.
birth_control	using longitudinal data from jiangsu fertility intention and behaviour study (jfibs) from year 2007 and 2010, this study analyses the fertility intention and behaviour of women who are qualified to have two children from a psychosocial point of view. based on the theory of planned behaviour, the theoretical framework from fertility intention to fertility behaviour is reconstructed. by observing the phenomenon from the micro-level, the gap between female fertility intention and behaviour and its associated factors are studied. the result shows that, given the situation of being qualified to have two children according to the government 's birth control policy, when faced with the choice of whether to have a second child or not, people tend to make their decisions rationally. attitudes towards fertility, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control all contribute significantly to the discrepancy between fertility intention and behaviour. in addition, the formation of a concrete birth plan is a major driving force for translating fertility intention into action.
birth_control	sexual risk behaviors are common among college students, but differences between 2- and 4-year students have not been explicitly tested. survey data from 9,748 unmarried sexually active minnesota college students (in 2010 or 2011) were used multilevel logistic regression models to test differences in eight high risk sexual health behaviors and outcomes between students attending 2- vs. 4-year colleges. odds of sex without a condom, sex without reliable birth control, unplanned pregnancy, and stis were significantly lower among 4-year students than 2-year students, after adjusting for demographic covariates. health promotion approaches targeted to the needs of 2- or 4-year students may be needed. for example, messaging and outreach efforts encouraging condom use may be especially beneficial for sexual health programs at 2-year colleges.

birth_control	exogenous cortisol administration has been used to test the influence of glucocorticoids on a variety of outcomes, including memory and affect. careful control of factors known to influence cortisol and other endogenous hormone levels is central to the success of this research. while the use of hormonal birth control (hbc) is known to exert many physiological effects, including decreasing the salivary cortisol response to stress, it is unknown how hbc influences circulating cortisol levels after exogenous cortisol administration. to determine those effects, we examined the role of hbc on participants' cortisol levels after receiving synthetic cortisol (hydrocortisone) in two separate studies. in study 1, 24 healthy women taking hbc and 26 healthy men were administered a 0.1 mg/kg body weight intravenous dose of hydrocortisone, and plasma cortisol levels were measured over 3 h. in study 2, 61 participants (34 women; 16 were on hbc) received a 15 mg hydrocortisone pill, and salivary cortisol levels were measured over 6 h. taken together, results from these studies suggest that hbc use is associated with a greater cortisol increase following cortisol administration. these data have important methodological implications: (1) when given a controlled dose of hydrocortisone, cortisol levels may increase more dramatically in women taking hbc versus women not on hbc or men; and (2) in studies manipulating cortisol levels, women on hormonal contraceptives should be investigated as a separate group.
heart_disease	background and aims: patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) are often characterized by premature coronary artery disease (cad) with heterogeneity at onset. the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of lipoprotein (a) [lp(a)] with the fh phenotype, genotype and roles of lp(a) in determining cad risk among patients with and without fh. methods: we enrolled 8050 patients undergoing coronary angiography, from our lipid clinic. clinical fh was diagnosed using the dutch lipid clinic network criteria. mutational analysis (ldlr, apob, pcsk9) in definite/probable fh was performed by target exome sequencing. results: lp(a) levels were increased, with a clinical fh diagnosis (unlikely, possible, definite/probable fh) independent of the patients status, with lp(a)-hyperlipoproteinemia [lp(a)-hlp] (median 517.70 vs. 570.98 vs. 604.65 mg/l, p < 0.001) or without (median 89.20 vs. 99.20 vs. 133.67 mg/l, p < 0.001). patients with lp(a)-hlp had a higher prevalence of definite/probable fh than those without (6.1% vs. 2.4%, p0.05). multivariate analysis showed that lp(a) and fh phenotype were both significant determinants in predicting the early onset and severity of cad. subsequently, patients with lp(a)-hlp in definite/probable fh increased significantly the cad risk (all p < 0.05). conclusions: lp(a) levels were higher in patients with fh phenotype than in those without, but no difference were found in fh patients of different mutated backgrounds. moreover, lp(a) and fh played a synergistic role in predicting the early onset and severity of cad.

heart_disease	an increasing evidence base suggests that low bone mineral density (bmd) and fractures are associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd). we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence of low bmd and fractures as risk factors for future cvd. two independent authors searched major databases from inception to august 1, 2016, for longitudinal studies reporting data on cvd incidence (overall and specific cvd) and bmd status and fractures. the association between low bmd, fractures, and cvd across longitudinal studies was explored by calculating pooled adjusted hazard ratios (hrs)+/- 95% confidence intervals (cis) with a random-effects meta-analysis. twenty-eight studies (18 regarding bmd and 10 fractures) followed a total of 1,107,885 participants for a median of 5 years. taking those with higher bmd as the reference, people with low bmd were at increased risk of developing cvd during follow-up (11 studies; hr=1.33; 95%ci, 1.27 to 1.38; i-2=53%), after adjusting for a median of eight confounders. this finding was confirmed using a decrease in one standard deviation of baseline bmd (9 studies; hr=1.16; 95% ci, 1.09 to 1.24; i-2=69%). the presence of fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing cvd (hr=1.20; 95% ci, 1.06 to 1.37; i-2=91%). regarding specific cvds, low bmd was associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular conditions, and cvd-associated death. fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular conditions and death due to cvd. in conclusion, low bmd and fractures are associated with a small, but significant increased risk of cvd risk and possibly death.

heart_disease	objectives: ambulatory systolic-diastolic pressure regression index (asdpri) as a composite marker of cardiovascular (cv) properties is related to cv complications. however, genetic determinants of asdpri are not known. the aim of this study is to report the relationship between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) and asdpri in hypertensive patients with cad confirmed by coronary angiography.methods: a total of 1345 hypertensive subjects with cad were included. snps were selected from genome-wide association studies. snps were reported to be associated with coronary artery disease risk. there were significant differences in 24h and daytime and nighttime asdpris for phctr1, lpa and adamts7 polymorphisms. genetic risk score (grs18) was constructed to evaluate additive effect of 18 snps for asdpri.results: analysis of covariance revealed a significant relationship between the ppab2b (-0.85; 95ci -1.85--0.16, p<0.02), wdr12 (-1.31; 95ci -2.19--0.43, p< 0.01) polymorphisms and nighttime asdpri dipping. analysis of covariance revealed a significant relationship between grs 18 and 24-h asdpri ( 0.34; 95ci 0.16-0.31, p<0.01).conclusions: in conclusion, adamts7 and lpa polymorphisms are related to 24-h asdpri but ppab2b and wdr12 gene polymorphisms are associated with nighttime asdpri dipping. a total of 24-h asdpri is determined by grs18.
heart_disease	background: omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 fas) have several beneficial effects on cardiovascular (cv) disease risk factors. these effects on cv risk profile may be mediated by several factors, including epigenetic modifications. our objective is to investigate, using genome-wide dna methylation analyses, methylation changes following an n-3 fa supplementation in overweight and obese subjects and to identify specific biological pathways potentially altered by the supplementation. results: blood leukocytes genome-wide dna methylation profiles of 36 overweight and obese subjects before and after a 6-week supplementation with 3 g of n-3 fas were compared using genomestudio software. after supplementation, 308 cpg sites, assigned to 231 genes, were differentially methylated (fdr-corrected diffscore >= vertical bar 13 vertical bar similar to p <= 0.05). using ingenuity pathway analysis system, a total of 55 pathways were significantly overrepresented following supplementation. among these pathways, 16 were related to inflammatory and immune response, lipid metabolism, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular signaling. changes in methylation levels of cpg sites within akt3, atf1, hdac4, and igfbp5 were correlated with changes in plasma triglyceride and glucose levels as well as with changes in the ratio of total cholesterol/hdl cholesterol following the supplementation. conclusions: these data provide key differences in blood leukocytes dna methylation profiles of subjects following an n-3 fa supplementation, which brings new, potential insights on metabolic pathways underlying the effects of n-3 fas on cv health.
heart_disease	background: as the approach to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) lowering becomes increasingly intensive, accurate assessment of ldl-c at very low levels warrants closer attention in individualized clinical efficacy and safety evaluation. we aimed to assess the accuracy of ldl-c estimation at very low levels by the friedewald equation, the de facto clinical standard, and compare its accuracy with a novel, big data-derived ldl-c estimate. methods: in 191,333 individuals with friedewald ldl-c < 70 mg/dl, we compared the accuracy of friedewald and novel ldl-c values in relation to direct measurements by vertical auto profile ultracentrifugation. we examined differences (estimate minus ultracentrifugation) and classification according to levels initiating additional safety precautions per clinical practice guidelines. results: friedewald values were less than ultracentrifugation measurement, with a median difference (25th to 75th percentile) of -2.4 (-7.4 to 0.6) at 50-69 mg/dl, -7.0 (-16.2 to -1.2) at 25-39 mg/dl, and -29.0 (-37.4 to -19.6) at < 15 mg/dl. the respective values by novel estimation were -0.1 (-1.5 to 1.3), -1.1 (-2.5 to 0.3), and -2.7 (-4.9 to 0.0) mg/dl. among those with friedewald ldl-c < 15, 15 to < 25, and 25 to < 40 mg/dl, the classification was discordantly low in 94.9%, 82.6%, and 59.9% of individuals as compared with 48.3%, 42.4%, and 22.4% by novel estimation. conclusions: estimation of even lower ldl-c values (by friedewald and novel methods) is even more inaccurate. more often than not, a friedewald value < 40 mg/dl is underestimated, which translates into unnecessary safety alarms that could be reduced in half by estimation using our novel method.
allergies	cannabis sativa (c.sativa) is well-known for its medicinal, industrial and recreational use. however, allergies in relation to cannabis sativa (c.sativa) are rarely reported. c. sativa is one of the common weeds found in pakistan and its pollen grains are common in spring and fall season. although categorized as an aeroallergen, there are limited number of reports regarding allergenic potential in c. sativa. therefore, the current study is aimed at exploring the ige-binding potential among the c.sativa pollen in local pollen allergic patients. initial screening of c. sativa sensitized individuals was carried out by dot blot from the sera of pollen allergic patients. proteins from the pollen grains were extracted and resolved on 10% gel. eight bands were visible on gel however only one protein fragment i.e. of 14kda size was found to bind to ige as analyzed through protein gel blot analysis. strong ige affinity of a 14 kda protein fragment from c. sativa pollen extract suggests its allergenic potential. further study is required to find the exact nature of this protein fragment.
allergies	introduction: the therapeutic use of animals has been debated for decades, and its use explored in a variety of settings and populations. however, there is no uniformity on naming these interventions. evidence based knowledge is essential to implement effective strategies in hospital. this review focused on the use of animal programs for hospitalized patients, and considered the potential risks. methods: the following databases were searched: pubmed, scopus, psychinfo, ebsco animals, proquest, web of science, cinahl, and medline, and prisma guidelines were adhered to. results: out of 432 articles were identified 36 articles suitable for inclusion into the review. data was heterogeneous in terms of age of patient, health issue, animals used and the length of interactions, which made comparison problematic. studies on children, psychiatric and elderly patients were the most common. the animal-intervention programs suggested various benefits such as reducing stress, pain and anxiety. other outcomes considered were changes in vital signs, and nutritional intake. most studies used dogs, but other animals were effectively employed. the major risks outlined were allergies, infections and animal-related accidents. zoonosis was a possible risk, as well as common infections as methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus. the implementation of simple hygiene protocols was effective at minimizing risk. the literature suggested that the benefits outweighed by far the risks. conclusion: the human relationship with animals can be useful and relatively safe for inpatients with various problems. moreover, the implementation of security precautions and the careful selection of patients should minimize the risks, particularly those infection-related. many aspects remain unclear, further studies are required.

allergies	with the turn of this century, novel food processing techniques have become commercially very important because of their profound advantages over the traditional methods. these novel processing methods tend to preserve the characteristic properties of food including their organoleptic and nutritional qualities better when compared with the conventional food processing methods. during the same period of time, there is a clear rise in the populations suffering from food allergies, especially infants and children. though, this fact is widely attributed to the changing livelihood of population in both developed and developing nations and to the introduction of new food habits with advent of novel foods and new processing techniques, their complete role is still uncertain. under the circumstance, it is very important to understand the structural changes in the protein as food is processed to comprehend whether the specific processing technique (conventional and novel) is increasing or mitigating the allergenicity. various modern means are now being employed to understand the conformational changes in the protein which can affect the allergenicity. in this review, the processing effects on protein structure and allergenicity are discussed along with the insinuations of recent studies and techniques for establishing a platform to investigate future pathway to reduce or eliminate allergenicity in the population.
allergies	aim: this study investigated whether allergies among schoolchildren increased in sweden between 1979 and 2007 and whether the geographical differences observed in previous studies remained. methods: we collected questionnaire data on asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (arc) and eczema in children aged seven to eight years from molndal, gothenburg, in south-western sweden and kiruna in northern sweden in 1979 (n = 4682), 1991 (n = 2481) and 2007 (n = 1029). the same regions and questions were used in all three studies, and extra questions on food allergy or intolerance were added in 2007. results: in 1979, 1991 and 2007, the total prevalence of asthma was 2.5%, 5.7% and 7.1%, arc was 5.5%, 8.1% and 11.1% and eczema was 7.1%, 18.3% and 19.7%, respectively. asthma prevalence remained higher in kiruna, but no significant regional differences were seen for arc and eczema. almost 20% reported a history of food allergy or intolerance, with a higher prevalence in kiruna. the allergy risk was reduced if both parents were born outside sweden. conclusion: the prevalence of arc continued to increase between 1991 and 2007, but increases in asthma and eczema started to level off in 1991. some geographical differences remained, but total allergy rates were similar in kiruna and molndal in 2007.
allergies	background: th9 cells are a newly discovered cd4(+) t helper cell subtype, characterized by high interleukin (il)-9 secretion. growing evidences suggest that th9 cells are involved in the pathogenic mechanism of multiple sclerosis (ms). mast cells are multifunctional innate immune cells, which are perhaps best known for their role as dominant effector cells in allergies and asthma. several lines of evidence point to an important role for mast cells in ms and its animal models. simultaneously, there is dynamic ""cross-talk"" between th9 and mast cells. the aim of the present study was to examine the il-9-mast cell axis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) and determine its interaction after neutralizing anti-il-9 antibody treatment. methods: female c57bl/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 5 in each group): mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog)-induced eae (eae group), eae mice treated with anti-il-9 antibody (anti-il-9 abs group), and eae mice treated with igg isotype control (igg group). eae clinical score was evaluated. mast cells from central nervous system (cns) were detected by flow cytometry. the production of chemokine recruiting mast cells in the cns was explored by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). in mice with mog-induced eae, the expression of il-9 receptor (il-9r) complexes in cns and spleen mast cells was also explored by rt-pcr, and then was repeating validated by immunocytochemistry. in vitro, spleen cells from eae mice were cultured with anti-il-9 antibody, and quantity of mast cells was counted by flow cytometry after co-culture. results: compared with igg group, il-9 blockade delayed clinical disease onset and ameliorated eae severity (t = -2.217, p = 0.031), accompany with mast cells infiltration decreases (day 5: t = -8.005, p < 0.001; day 15: t = -11.857, p < 0.001; day 20: t = -5.243, p = 0.001) in anti-il-9 abs group. the messenger rna expressions of c-c motif chemokine ligand 5 (t = -5.932, p = 0.003) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (t = -4.029, p = 0.004) were significantly decreased after il-9 neutralization in anti-il-9 abs group, compared with igg group. in mog-induced eae, the il-9r complexes were expressed in cns and spleen mast cells. in vitro, splenocytes cultured with anti-il-9 antibody showed significantly lower levels of mast cells in a dose-dependent manner, compared with splenocytes cultured with anti-mouse igg (5 mu g/ml: t = -0.894, p = 0.397; 10 mu g/ml: t = -3.348, p = 0.019; 20 mu g/ml: t = -7.639, p < 0.001). conclusions: this study revealed that il-9 neutralization reduced mast cell infiltration in cns and ameliorated eae, which might be relate to the interaction between il-9 and mast cells.
menopause	objective: equol, an active metabolite possessing estrogen-like activity, is produced by the action of intestinal flora on soy isoflavones. there is an increasing evidence regarding its efficacy in the relief of menopausal symptoms, suppression of decreased bone mineral density, and lipid profile improvement. only those with equol-producing capacity, however, seem to benefit. thus, we examined the relationship between equol producer status and parameters associated with lifestyle-related diseases in women from their 20s to 80s. methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted among 743 women (21-89 y; average age: 52.5 +/- 11.8 y) who have undergone health screening at tokyo midtown medical center and given consent to participate in the study. the relationship between equol producer status and metabolic parameters was assessed. results: in our study, 236 women (32%) were equol producers. equol producers had significantly lower triglycerides and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with nonproducers. equol-producing women in their 50s showed significantly lower body fat level, visceral fat area, triglyceride levels, pulse wave velocity, uric acid levels, and high sensitivity c-reactive protein levels. in addition, women in their 60s showed significantly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. in multivariate logistic regression, for women in their 50s, equol production was significantly associated with lower arterial stiffness and uric acid levels, and a high ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid, whereas it was significantly associated with lower urinary n-telopeptides in their 60s. conclusions: equol producer status was associated with favorable metabolic parameters, in women in the early phase postmenopause, with the transitional periods noted with declining intrinsic estrogen levels.
menopause	objective: the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator, the pituitary gonadotropes, the ovaries, and the uterus play a crucial role in female fertility. a decline in reproductive performance represents a complex interplay of actions at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. recently, in the field of female reproductive aging attention is drawn to the carbonyl stress theory. advanced glycation end products (ages) contribute directly to protein damage, induce a chain of oxidative stress (os) reactions, and increase inflammatory reactions. here, we highlight some of the mechanisms underlying glycation damage in the ovary. methods: searches of electronic databases were performed. articles relevant to possible role of os, ages, and receptor for age (rage) in aging ovary were summarized in this interpretive literature review. results: follicular microenvironment undergoes an increase in os with aging. data support the role of os in ovulatory dysfunction because ages are well-recognized mediators of increased os. rage and age-modified proteins with activated nuclear factor-kappa b are expressed in human ovarian tissue. it was suggested that accumulation of ages products at the level of the ovarian follicle might trigger early ovarian aging or could be responsible for reduced glucose uptake by granulosa cells, potentially altering follicular growth. moreover, impaired methylglyoxal detoxification causing relevant damage to the ovarian proteome might be one of the mechanisms underlying reproductive aging. conclusions: further investigation of the role for the age-rage axis in the ovarian follicular environment is needed, and results could relate to assisted reproduction technology outcomes and new measures of ovarian reserve.
menopause	the widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (art) has transformed hiv from a life limiting condition to one with near-normal life expectancy. hiv is associated with an increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis, with people living with hiv (plhiv) potentially experiencing these conditions at a younger age than their hiv-negative counterparts. the mechanisms driving bone disease in hiv are complex and include: an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors; other comorbid conditions; and hiv-associated factors such as viral effects, systemic inflammation, and art-related factors. one-third of plhiv in the united kingdom are female, and increasing numbers of women living with hiv (wlhiv) are reaching menopausal age. oestrogen decline in the context of an elevated background risk of poor bone health results in wlhiv being at greater risk of osteoporosis than women without hiv. european hiv guidelines therefore recommend routine screening of postmenopausal wlhiv using frax (c) for clinical risk factors, with or without bone mineral density scanning. data support the use of calcium and vitamin d supplementation, and bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis in plhiv. additionally, some patients with confirmed osteoporosis may benefit from a switch to an art agent with a better bone safety profile. however, there remains a notable paucity of data on hiv and menopause, including the impact of hormone replacement therapy on the bone health of wlhiv. in conclusion, it is important that clinicians are aware that postmenopausal wlhiv are a group at particular risk of bone disease, who require proactive screening and advice about preventative measures.

menopause	background although aromatase inhibitors have proven to be an effective treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitorinduced arthralgia (aia) is an adverse event associated with low compliance with treatment. the aim of this literature study is to assess the prevalence of aia and to provide an overview of significant predictors for the development of aia. methods a systematic review was conducted using pubmed, cochrane library and web of science. a meta-analysis was performed and heterogeneity has been investigated by moderator analyses. the meta-analysis was repeated with studies that were considered as best evidence, i. e. studies with an above-average score on the strobe checklist. results twenty-one studies (13,177 participants) were included. prevalence rates ranged from 0.200 to 0.737. meta-analysis resulted in a pooled estimate of 0.459 (95% ci = [0.397-0.520) with a high heterogeneity (i-2 = 98%). moderator analysis showed no differences regarding heterogeneity. predictors for the development of aia included a body mass index of 25-30 kg/m(2) (or = 0.33), taxane-based chemotherapy (or = 4.08), stage iii cancer (or = 0.32) and a duration of menopause of 5-10 years (or = 1.10) or>10 years (or = 0.44-3.29) (an or < 1 indicates a predictor of lower risk of aia). discussion despite the established benefits of ai, an important portion of the patients experiences aia. more research is needed to investigate the efficacy of treatments such as exercise therapy for aia.
menopause	lamotrigine (ltg) is an antiepileptic drug that is metabolized via glucuronidation. since the glucuronidizing enzyme is inducible by estrogens, ltg serum concentrations may fall by 50-60% when combined with hormonal contraceptives that contain ethinyl estradiol (ee). little is known about a possible interaction between estrogens used for hormone replacement therapy (hrt) and ltg, and the few available data are conflicting. data from serum samples analyzed for ltg were therefore retrieved from a routine therapeutic drug monitoring database. users of hrt and ee were identified and matched with controls for age and dose. no enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inhibiting comedication was allowed. ltg serum concentration-to-dose ratios (cdrs) were calculated. case groups and their respective control groups were compared by the mann-whitney u test. seventy-nine hrt users (dose range 1-4 mg/day) and 200 ee users (dose range 20-40 g/day), as well as 158 and 400 matching controls, respectively, could be included. both ee users and hrt users had significantly lower mean ltg cdrs than their respective matched controls. these results suggest that hrt with estrogens may reduce serum ltg concentrations.
emergency_contraception	since the development of combined oral contraceptives over 50 years ago, significant innovations have occurred in the domain of the progestin. evolving knowledge of progestin mechanism of action and physiology has allowed for development of novel progestins with limited steroid receptor cross-reactivity, decreased side effect profiles, and pharmacokinetics optimized for modern delivery systems. this review summarizes current knowledge of progestin physiology, modern delivery systems, and developments of progestin agonists and antagonists for contraception.
emergency_contraception	in argentina, campaigns for the recognition of sexual and reproductive rights have sparked opposition through litigation in which the dynamics of legal action have come from self-proclaimed ""pro-life"" ngo5, particularly since 1998, when the conservative ngo portal de belen successfully achieved the banning of emergency contraception through the courts. the activities of these groups, acting as a ""civil arm"" of religion, are focused primarily on obstructing access to legally permissible abortions and bringing about the withdrawal of a number of recognized public policies on sexual and reproductive health, particularly the 2002 national programme for sexual health and responsible procreation. this paper analyzes the litigation strategies of these conservative ngos and how their use of the courts in argentina has changed over the years. it gives examples of efforts in local courts to block individual young women from accessing legal abortion following rape, despite a ruling by the national supreme court of justice in 2012 that no judicial permission is required. in spite of major advances, the renewed influence of the catholic hierarchy in the argentine political scene with the accession of the new pope poses challenges to the work by feminists and women 's movements to extend and consolidate sexual and reproductive rights.

emergency_contraception	the human progesterone receptor (pr) plays a key role in reproductive function in women. pr antagonists have numerous applications in female health care including regular and emergency contraception, and treatment of hormone-related pathological conditions such as breast cancer, endometriosis, and leiomyoma. the main factor limiting their long-term administration is the fact that they cross-bind to other oxo-steroid receptors. ulipristal acetate (upa), a highly potent pr antagonist, has recently come onto the market and is much more selective for pr than the other oxo-steroid receptors (androgen, ar, glucocorticoid, gr, and mineralocorticoid, mr receptors) and, remarkably, it displays lower gr-inactivating potency than ru486. we adopted a structural approach to characterizing the binding of upa to the oxo-steroid receptors at the molecular level. we solved the x-ray crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain (lbd) of the human pr complexed with upa and a peptide from the transcriptional corepressor smrt. we used the x-ray crystal structure of the gr in its antagonist conformation to dock upa within its ligand-binding cavity. finally, we generated three-dimensional models of the lbd of androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors (ar and mr) in an antagonist conformation and docked upa within them. comparing the structures revealed that the network of stabilizing contacts between the upa c11 aryl group and the lbd is responsible for its high pr antagonist potency. it also showed that it is the inability of upa to contact gln642 in gr that explains why it has lower potency in inactivating gr than ru486. finally, we found that the binding pockets of ar and mr are too small to accommodate upa, and allowed us to propose that the extremely low sensitivity of mr to upa is due to inappropriate interactions with the c11 substituent. all these findings open new avenues for designing new pr antagonist compounds displaying greater selectivity.

emergency_contraception	objective emergency contraception (ec) accessibility has evolved differently in catalunya as compared with other autonomous communities in spain. free-of-charge access within the public health system was authorised in 2004, and over-the-counter (otc) access was implemented in 2009. the aim of the study is to assess the impact of these measures on demand and users' profiles at our institution. methods a retrospective study, in our emergency department, was conducted to evaluate ec requests in relationship to accessibility modifications. the age of women and which days of the week they attended were analysed. results the number of ec requests, the distribution by age and the demand over the week remained stable after access to ec became free of charge. however, requests sharply decreased following otc access implementation. distribution by age also changed, with a significant increase in requests from women under 25 years (72% vs 56%, p < 0.001). demand was greatest on sunday and monday, and this distribution persisted over the study period. conclusion ec requests remained unchanged following free-of-charge access to ec, but decreased after otc implementation. women currently seeking ec at no cost at our institution are more likely to be younger and to request it on a monday.
skin_care	there are conditions in dermatology that cause severe cracking and flaking of the skin, representing a failure of normal desquamation. several hygroscopic substances that affect the moisturization of the stratum corneum have been identified for the treatment of scaling disorders. prominent among these are polyols and alpha hydroxy acids. we elaborated a new pharmaceutical product that combines the biomolecules glycerol and ammonium lactate. the aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical stability and rheologic properties of the new skin care preparation.
skin_care	a sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was established for the simultaneous determination of thirteen n-nitrosamines (nas) in skin care cosmetics. the cosmetics samples were firstly dispersed by water and subsequently extracted and purified using salting out-acetonitrile homogeneous extraction method. finally, the extracting solution was concentrated by slow nitrogen gas blowing. all of the samples were separated by innowax capillary chromatographic column, and detected by selected ion monitoring (sim) mode of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and quantified by isotope internal standard method. the method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. under the optimized condition, the calibration curves were linear over the selected concentration ranges of 2-500 mu g/l for all the thirteen analytes, with calculated coefficients of determination (r-2) of greater than 0.996. the limits of detection (lods) and the limits of quantitation (loqs) of the method were 3-15 mu g/kg and 10-50 mu g/kg, respectively. recoveries were calculated at three levels of concentration spiked in two kinds of cosmetics (skin care cream and water). the values were found between 93.8% and 121.0% with relative standard deviation (rsd) values of 2.5-7.2% for intra-day precision (n = 6) and 3.3-6.7% for inter-day precision (n = 5). the method was successfully applied to analyze twenty-two cosmetics samples and n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma) was detected in one sample with the concentration of 207 mu g/kg.

skin_care	background: cutaneous adverse events can have an important negative influence on quality of life and compliance in affected patients. palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia (ppe; hand-foot syndrome) is a cutaneous toxicity associated with chemotherapeutic treatment, which necessitates treatment interruption or dose reduction in severe cases. this case report of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-induced ppe shows the influence of mechanical stress on the development of skin lesions in various locations and the importance of patient education and compliance. case report: we present the case of a 43-year-old female patient diagnosed with ovarian cancer and having undergone surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment. the development of extensive grade 3 ppe affecting numerous areas of the body particularly exposed to mechanical pressure necessitated dermatological treatment. the combination of local application of an antioxidant-containing ointment and the patient 's compliance made it possible to continue chemotherapy without interruption or dose reduction. conclusion: the development of ppe often limits the use of chemotherapeutic agents, and this case report can provide a possible therapeutic and preventive strategy for affected patients.
skin_care	ethnopharmacological relevance: plukenetia volubilis l. (euphorbiaceae) is a domesticated vine distributed from the high-altitude andean rain forest to the lowlands of the peruvian amazon. oil from the cold-pressed seeds, sold under the commercial name of sacha inchi oil (sio) is actually much in favour because it contains a high percentage of omega 3 and omega 6, and is hence used as a dietary supplement. sio is also used traditionally for skin care, in order to maintain skin softness, and for the treatment of wounds, insect bites and skin infections, in a tropical context where the skin is frequently damaged. aims of the study: this study was designed in order to verify whether the traditional use of sio for skin care would have any impact on staphylococcus aureus growth and skin adherence, as s. aureus is involved in many skin pathologies (impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles and subcutaneous abscesses) being one if the main pathogens that can be found on the skin. therefore, our objective was to assess sio bactericidal activity and interference with adherence to human skin explants and the keratinocyte cell line. cytotoxicity on that cells was also determined. the activity of sio was compared to coconut oil (coco), which is widely used for skin care but has different unsaturated fatty acids contents. materials and methods: laboratory testing with certified oil, determined antibacterial activity against radio labelled s. aureus. cytotoxic effects were measured with xtf on keratinocyte cells and with neutral red on human skin explants; phenol was used as cytotoxic control. adherence assays were carried out by mixing h3-labelled s. aureus bacteria with keratinocyte cells and human skin explants, incubated with oils 2 h before (to determine the inhibition of adherence, assimilated to a preventive effect) or 2 h after the contact of the biological material with s. aureus (to assess the detachment of the bacteria, assimilated to a curative effect). residual radioactivity measured after washings made it possible to determine the adherence intensity. bactericidal effect was determined by colony counting on trypticase soy agar. results: laboratory assays showed that sio and coco, tested undiluted, were not cytotoxic on keratinocytes nor human explants and were not bactericidal neither. sio was more active as antiadherent (preventive) than coco on keratinocytes. there was no significant difference between detachment effects (curative) of both oils on keratinocytes but sio was almost 5 times more active on the detachment of s. aureus from human skin explants. conclusion: from that study it can be concluded that the use of sio on dermal cells is safe and efficient in the inhibition of s. aureus adherence. our results tend to support the traditional use of undiluted sio in skin care.

myelofibrosis	mutations in the calreticulin (calr) gene are found in the majority of janus kinase 2-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms mpn and, thus far, have exclusively been reported as acquired, somatic mutations. we assessed the mutational status of exon 9 of the calr gene in 2000 blood samples submitted to our centre and identified 12 subjects (0.6%) harbouring distinctive calr mutations, all with an allelic frequency of 50% and all involving indels occurring as multiples of 3 bp. buccal cell samples obtained from these patients confirmed the germline nature of the mutations. importantly, these germline mutations were not diagnostic of mpn. we thus report for the first time the identification and confirmation of germline mutations in calr distinct from those somatic mutations that define classical mpn. the finding of a non-standard calr mutation with an allelic frequency of 50% should raise suspicion of the possibility of a germline calr mutation and these cases investigated further.
myelofibrosis	we evaluated ruxolitinib in 65 patients with myelofibrosis according to age, sex, time of diagnosis, grade of fibrosis, prognostic score risk, janus kinase (jak) status, primary or secondary myelofibrosis, previous treatment, and dosage. outcome measures were response rate, time to response, duration of response, and event-free survival and survival. kaplan and meier curves show a significant difference in event-free survival according to the prognostic score, in favor of patients with low int1 (p = 0.0009). the cox stepwise model confirmed the result, the int2 high-risk score being the most powerful negative independent parameter (0.001), followed by jak (0.008); other parameters, such as diagnosis more than 5 years earlier, grade iii-iv fibrosis, and ruxolitinib dose have a negligible impact. time to response was shorter (p = 0.001) in primary myelofibrosis. in conclusion, ruxolitinib is effective, with a better outcome in patients with a low-int1 risk score. this may suggest considering an earlier administration in the disease course.
myelofibrosis	primary myelofibrosis is a unique entity among bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative diseases, manifesting as bone marrow fibrosis and pancytopenia. considerable evidence indicates that genetic and epigenetic abnormalities can result in defective clonal hematopoietic stem cell proliferation in addition to bone marrow microenvironment alteration. the ""bad seeds in bad soil"" theory illustrates the orchestrating efforts of hematopoietic stem cells, stromal cells, and their surrounding signaling molecules in myelofibrosis progression and malignancy transformation, though the exact mechanism of myelofibrosis is still not clear. this study reviews current concepts and questions regarding the pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis and discusses the emerging targeted therapy aimed at restoring normal bone marrow environment and halting bone marrow fibrotic deterioration.
myelofibrosis	myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn) are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells. mutation of janus-kinase 2 (jak2) is the most frequent genetic event detected in philadelphia-negative mpn. in advanced phases, the clinical hallmark of the disease is a striking inflammatory syndrome. so far, the cellular and molecular basis of inflammation is not fully understood. we, therefore, sought to investigate the relationship of activating jak2 mutation and aberrant cytokine expression in mpn. cytokine array was performed to identify jak2v617f-related cytokine expression and secretion. cxcl10 mrna expression was analyzed by qpcr in peripheral blood cells. to exclude paracrine/autocrine stimulation as a potential mechanism, we generated ba/f3-epor-jak2wt or epor-jak2v617f cells lacking cxcl10 receptor. pharmacologic inhibition of jak2 kinase was achieved by jak-inhibitor treatment. signaling pathways and downstream effectors were characterized by western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, luciferase reporter assays, qpcr, and chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies. we identified cxcl10 as the most highly induced cytokine in jak2-mutated cell lines. in mpn patients, cxcl10 is highly expressed in jak2v617f but not jak2wt mpn or healthy donor controls. moreover, cxcl10 expression correlates with jak2v617f allelic burden. high cxcl10 correlates with the presence of clinical risk factors but not with clinical symptoms and quality of life. pharmacologic inhibition of mutated jak2 kinase inhibits cxcl10 expression. nf kappa b signaling is activated downstream of jak2v617f receptor and directly induces cxcl10 expression. our data provide first evidence for a link between oncogenic jak2v617f signaling and cell intrinsic induction of cxcl10 induced by activated nfkb signaling.
myelofibrosis	the social media platform twitter has provided the hematology/oncology community with unprecedented, novel methods of interpersonal communication and increased ability for the dissemination of important updates in a rapidly moving field. the advent, and subsequent success, of disease-specific twitter communities have further enabled interested healthcare stakeholders to become quickly organized around a unique set of rare medical conditions, such as hematologic malignancies, that, historically, generally lack large amounts of reliable online information. one example is the twitter community #mpnsm (myeloproliferative neoplasms on social media), which was started approximately one and half years ago and has served as a recognized venue for discussion among many members of the mpn community, including patients, researchers, providers, and advocacy organizations. this article will focus on understanding the impact of the founding of this community via the analysis of advanced twitter metrics of user experience, from the first year of use for this novel healthcare hashtag.
hypothyroidism	the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis (hpt) is coordinated by hypophysiotropic thyrotropin releasing hormone (trh) neurons present in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. hypophysiotropic trh neurons act as energy sensors. trh controls the synthesis and release of thyrotropin, which activates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones; in target tissues, transporters and deiodinases control their local availability. thyroid hormones regulate many functions, including energy homeostasis. this review discusses recent evidence that covers several aspects of trh role in hpt axis regulation. knowledge about the mechanisms of trh signaling has steadily increased. new transcription factors engaged in trh gene expression have been identified, and advances made on how they interact with signaling pathways and define the dynamics of trh neurons response to acute and/or long-term influences. albeit yet incomplete, the relationship of trh neurons activity with positive energy balance has emerged. the importance of tanycytes as a central relay for the feedback control of the axis, as well as for hpt responses to alterations in energy balance, and other stimuli has been reinforced. finally, some studies have started to shed light on the interference of prenatal and postnatal stress and nutrition on hptaxis programing, which have confirmed the axis susceptibility to early insults.
hypothyroidism	hypothyroidism is associated with the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but cellular mechanisms have been scarcely analyzed. thyroid hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of bile acids that are endogenous ligands of the farnesoid receptor (fxr alpha), which have been involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. however, the relationship between thyroid hormones and fxr alpha expression in the liver is yet unknown. control (n = 6) and methimazole-induced hypothyroid (n = 6) female rabbits were used to evaluate the amount of lipids and glycogen, vascularization, hepatocytes proliferation, immune cells infiltration, and expression of fxr alpha. student-t or mann-whitney u tests were carried out to determine significant differences. hypothyroidism induced steatosis, glycogen loss, fibrosis, and a minor vascularization in the liver. in contrast, hypothyroidism increased the proliferation of hepatocytes and the infiltration of mast cells, but did not modify the number of immune cells into sinusoids. these changes were associated with a minor anti-fxr alpha immunoreactivity of periportal hepatocytes and pericentral immune cells. our results suggest that hypothyroidism induces a moderate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, alllowing the hepatic regeneration. the fxr alpha may be involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in hypothyroid subjects.
hypothyroidism	no serological cut-off exists to separate low t3 syndrome (lt) and central hypothyroidism (ch). the objective of this retrospective study was to propose such a cut-off. the first participant group comprised 52 patients from the age of six to twenty years. this group consisted of patients of 36 anorexia nervosa with lt and 16 ch. the second participant groups comprised 229 patients of all the same range of ages at the same hospital and included lt (n = 58) and ch (n = 4) patients, respectively. the third group of participants comprised 125 lt and 27 ch patients at the same hospital at all ages less than eighteen years. the last group of participants comprised 10 ch patients from the other two hospitals. the main outcome measure was ft3/ft4 ratio (pg/ml, ng/dl respectively). this ratio in the first group was significantly different (p < 0.05) between lt and ch. when the cut off value of fi3/ft4 was set as 2.0, the sensitivity of the lt and ch patients in the second group was 62% and 100%, respectively. this cut-off value of 2.0 was useful for distinguishing lt from ch only above the age of two years, as shown in the third group. the ft3/ft4 in 10 subjects with ch in the last group, aged 2 to 7 years, ranged from 2.55 to 7.71. in conclusion, tt3/if4 less than 2.0 suggests lt rather than ch for patients from the age of two to eighteen years.
hypothyroidism	background: myxedema coma is a life-threatening and emergency presentation of hypothyroidism. however, the clinical features and outcomes of this condition have been poorly defined because of its rarity. methods: we conducted a retrospective observational study of patients diagnosed with myxedema coma from july 2010 through march 2013 using a national inpatient database in japan. we investigated characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and in-hospital mortality of patients with myxedema coma. results: we identified 149 patients diagnosed with myxedema coma out of approximately 19 million inpatients in the database. the mean (standard deviation) age was 77 (12) years, and two-thirds of the patients were female. the overall proportion of in-hospital mortality among cases was 29.5%. the number of patients was highest in the winter season. patients treated with steroids, catecholamines, or mechanical ventilation showed higher in-hospital mortality than those without. variations in type and dosage of thyroid hormone replacement were not associated with in-hospital mortality. the most common comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (40.3%). the estimated incidence of myxedema coma was 1.08 per million people per year in japan. multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that higher age and use of catecholamines (with or without steroids) were significantly associated with higher in-hospital mortality. conclusions: the present study identified the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with myxedema coma using a large-scale database. myxedema coma mortality was independently associated with age and severe conditions requiring treatment with catecholamines.

hypothyroidism	the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hypothyroidism among hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its related factors, and to assess the prevalence of macrovascular and microvascular diseases among type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients with hypothyroidism and euthyroidism. a total of 1662 type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients hospitalized at the metabolic diseases hospital, tianjin medical university from 1 january 2008 to 1 march 2013 were included in this study. information on demographic and anthropometric factors and additional variables related to hypothyroidism were collected from medical records. prevalence rates were calculated and standardized using direct method based on the age-specific and sex-specific structure of all participants. data were analyzed using binary logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders. the prevalence of hypothyroidism among type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients was 6.8 %, and 77.0% of the patients with hypothyroidism had subclinical hypothyroidism. the prevalence of hypothyroidism increased with age, and was higher in women (10.8 %) than in men (3.4 %). older age (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1. 05 to 2.89), female gender (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 3.87), and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody (odds ratio, 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.83 to 8.79) were associated with higher odds of hypothyroidism among type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients. the type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients with hypothyroidism had higher prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases than those with euthyroidism after adjustment for age and gender. the prevalence of hypothyroidism among type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients was 6.8 %, and most patients had subclinical hypothyroidism. older age, female gender, and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody could be indicators for detecting hypothyroidism in type 2 diabetes mellitus inpatients.
headache	objective: to investigate the common complications from the microsurgical treatment of large intracranial vestibular schwannoma (vs) via suboccipital retrosigmoid approach and to propose strategies for minimizing such complications. methods: we selected all patients with large unilateral vs from the collected database (1999-2013) who underwent microsurgical resection as their initial treatment for histopathologically confirmed vs. tumors larger than 30 chi 20 mm were defined as large. results: a total of 1167 patients with vs were included. gross total tumor resection was achieved in 1006 patients (86.2%). the mortality rate is 0.77%. the facial nerve was preserved anatomically in 1083 cases (92.8%), and the functional valuation of the facial nerve according to postoperative house-brackmann scale showed 423 patients (36.2%) in grades i-ii, 534 cases (45.8%) in grade iii, and 210 patients (18.0%) in grade iv-vi. the main short-term postoperative complication included new hearing loss (american institute of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery grade d) in 634 cases (54.3%), disequilibrium in 250 cases (21.4%), labial herpes in 127 cases (10.9%), meningitis in 115 (9.85%) and lower cranial nerve deficit in 77 cases (6.59%). follow-up data were available for 978 of the 1167 patients (83.8%). long-term complications include hearing loss (american institute of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery grade d) (75.8%), permanent facial paralysis (11.9%), facial numbness (10.9%), tinnitus (2.96%), chronic headache (2.25%), and taste disturbance (1.43%). conclusions: the key factors for reducing surgical complications include careful assessment of the functions of acoustic and facial nerves as well as a thorough understanding of anatomy via the retrosigmoid approach before operation, skillful microsurgical technique, and monitoring of multiple cranial nerves during resection.
headache	gentiana veitchiorum hemsl., gentianaceae, a traditional tibetan medicine, was used for the treatment of liver jaundice with damp-heat pathogen, as well as for headache and chronic pharyngitis. a rapidultra-performance liquid chromatography, photodiode array detector, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed for the fast and accurate identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of g. veitchiorum. in fact, eighteen compounds were detected and identified on the basis of their mass spectra, fragment characteristics and comparison with published data. especially, the ms fragmentation pathways of iridoid glycosides and flavone c-glycosides were illustrated. five compounds among them were quantified by uhplc-pda, including swertiamarin, gentiopicroside, sweroside, isoorientin, and isovitexin. the proposed method was then validated based on the analyses of linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery. the overall recoveries for the five analytes ranged from 96.54% to 100.81%, with rsd from 1.05% to 1.82%. in addition, ten batches of g. veitchiorum from different areas were also analyzed. the developed method was rapid and reliable for both identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of g. veitchiorum, especially for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of iridoid glycosides and flavone c-glycosides.

headache	background: patients with sickle cell disease (scd) may experience many complications of the central nervous system (cns) including stroke, silent cerebral infarcts, and neuropsychological deficits. cranial epidural hematoma is a rare but potentially serious complication. procedure: case series of cranial epidural hematomas in children with scd from three different institutions is considered, along with a literature review of cranial epidural hematomas in this population. results: seven children with scd with cranial epidural hematomas were identified from three different institutions. all patients were male and the age at presentation ranged from 10 to 18 years. two patients presented with headache (28.6%), while the rest had no neurologic symptoms at presentation. four patients required urgent neurosurgical intervention (57.1%) and one patient died (14.3%). a literature review identified 18 additional cases of cranial epidural hematomas in children with scd. of these, treatment ranged from supportive care to neurosurgical intervention. twelve patients completely recovered (66.7%), one patient had long-term cognitive impairment (5.6%), and four patients died (22.2%). combined with our data, cranial epidural hematomas have a mortality rate of 20.0%. conclusions: although rare, cranial epidural hematoma can be fatal and should be considered in patients with acute neurological symptoms.
headache	background: three successive editions of the international classification of headache disorders and multiple guideline papers on headache care have described evidence based diagnosis and treatment of headache disorders. it remains unknown, however, to which extent this has improved the diagnosis and management of headache. that was the aim of our study in which we also analysed differences between three social groups in russia. methods: we studied 1042 students (719 females, 323 males, mean age 20.6, age range 17-40), 1075 workers (146 females, 929 males, mean age 40.4, age range 21-67) and 1007 blood donors (484 females, 523 males, mean age 34.1, age range 18-64). we conducted a semi-structured, validated, face-to-face professional interview. data on prevalence and associated factors have previously been published. a section of the interview focused on previous diagnosis and treatment, the topic of this paper. results: only 496 of 2110 participants (23%) with headache in russia had consulted because of headache. students consulted more frequently (35%), workers and blood donors less often (13% and 14%). only 12% of the patients with ichd-3beta diagnosis of migraine and 11.7% with ichd-3beta diagnosis of tension-type headache (tth) had previously been correctly diagnosed. triptans were used by only 6% of migraine patients. only 0.4% of migraine patients and no tth patients had received prophylactic treatment. conclusion: despite existing guidelines about diagnosis and treatment, both remain poor in russia. according to the literature this is only slightly better in europe and america. dissemination of existing knowledge should have higher priority in the future.
headache	background migraine is a prevalent disorder characterised by recurrent headache attacks preceded or accompanied by aura in a subgroup of patients. migraine often occurs together with major depressive disorder (mdd). alterations of adipokine levels have been reported both in migraine and in mdd. in this cross-sectional study, we aimed to assess the associations between serum leptin and adiponectin levels and migraine or migraine subtypes. analyses were adjusted for a lifetime history of mdd in order to investigate the association between adipokines and migraine under consideration of depression status. methods we included 3025 participants from the colaus/psycolaus study. the impact of leptin and adiponectin levels on a diagnosis of migraine was analysed by binary regression analyses, adjusting for variables known to influence adipokine levels. subgroup analyses were conducted based on the presence of aura. results crude leptin levels were significantly higher in subjects with migraine than controls (mann-whitney u=515,102, p=6x10(-7)). when performing adjusted analyses, leptin levels were found to be significantly higher in subjects with migraine (odds ratio=1.22, p=0.024) and migraine with aura (odds ratio=1.34, p=0.004). conclusion high leptin levels might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and migraine with aura.
overactive_bladder	introduction and hypothesisthe validity and reliability of measurement of urinary ngf as a diagnostic biomarker in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction (lutd) is uncertain. we aimed to evaluate both the diagnostic and discriminant validity, and the test-retest reliability of urinary ngf measurement in women with lutd. methodsurinary ngf was measured in women with lutd (n=205) and asymptomatic subjects (n=31). urinary ngf was assayed using an elisa method and normalized against urinary creatinine. ngf/creatinine ratios were compared between symptom subgroups using mann-whitney u test, and between different urodynamic diagnoses using the kruskal-wallis test. receiver operator characteristic (roc) analysis was employed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinary ngf. test-retest reliability of ngf measurement was assessed using intra-class correlation (icc). resultsurinary ngf was significantly but non-specifically increased in symptomatic patients when compared to controls (13.33 vs. 2.05ng ngf/g cr, p<0.001). on multivariate logistic regression ngf was a good predictor of patients having oab or not, however, the adjusted odds ratio only 1.006. roc analysis demonstrated poor discriminant ability between different symptomatic groups and urodynamic groups. using a cut off of 13.0ng ngf/g creatinine the test provides a sensitivity of 81%, but a specificity of only 39% for overactive bladder. the assays demonstrated good test-retest reliability with icc of 0.889. conclusionsalthough urinary ngf can be reliably assayed, and is increased in various lutds, it discriminates poorly between these disorders therefore has very limited potential as a biomarker. neurourol. urodynam. 35:944-948, 2016.

overactive_bladder	purpose: nocturia is common and bothersome in older adults, especially those who are also incontinent. since nocturnal polyuria is a major contributor, we examined factors associated with nocturnal polyuria in this population to identify those possibly amenable to intervention. materials and methods: we analyzed baseline data from 2 previously completed studies of urge urinary incontinence. the studies involved 284women (mean age +/- sd 72.9 +/- 7.9 years) who also completed 3-day voiding diaries. participants with a nocturnal polyuria index greater than 33% were categorized as having nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal polyuria index nocturnal urinary volume per 24hour urine volume). associations between nocturnal polyuria and various demographic, clinical and sleep related parameters were determined. results: overall 55% of the participants had nocturnal polyuria. multivariable regression analysis revealed that age, body mass index, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, time spent in bed and duration of first uninterrupted sleep were independent correlates of nocturnal polyuria. participants with a larger nocturnal excretion reported a shorter duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void and worse sleep quality despite spending similar time in bed. conclusions: body mass index, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blockers, time in bed and duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void are independently associated with nocturnal polyuria in older women with urge urinary incontinence, and are potentially modifiable. these findings also confirm the association between sleep and nocturnal polyuria. further studies should explore whether interventions to reduce nocturnal polyuria and/or increase the duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void would help to improve sleep quality in this population and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for sedative hypnotics.
overactive_bladder	to determine the efficacy of physiotherapy and behavior therapy and to find specific subgroups of women with overactive bladder syndrome that might gain increased benefit from this therapy. women with ae10 micturitions per 24-h period were included. six to nine therapy sessions were held within a 14-day interval. efficacy end point was a reduction in micturitions and in episodes of nocturia. secondary outcomes included iciq-oab, iciq-oabqol and visual analog scales. follow-up was 6 months. levene test, student 's t test, pearsona ' s and spearman 's correlations were utilized as well as the friedman test and a multivariable-multilevel model. 32 women were included. mean age was 51 +/- 15.9 (years +/- standard deviation, sd). mean body mass index (bmi) was 24.4 +/- 4.8 (kg/m(2) +/- sd). there was a 22.9% reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 h (11.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.3 p < 0.001), a 21.3% reduction during the day (10.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.1 p < 0.001) and a 34.7% reduction in episodes of nocturia (1.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.8 p = 0.026). both iciq-oab (8.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 5.8 +/- 2.7 vs. 6.3 +/- 3.3 p < 0.001) and iciq-oabqol (73.4 +/- 25.9 vs. 47.5 +/- 14.5 vs. 47.7 +/- 18.6 p < 0.001) questionnaires as well as vas (7.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.7 p < 0.001) showed significant improvement persisting in the 6-month follow-up. in addition, in a multivariable model controlling for age, women who were overactive bladder syndrome therapy na < ve responded significantly better than those who had already been under therapy (p < 0.001). this study shows the efficacy of physiotherapy and behavior therapy in women with overactive bladder syndrome with a post-therapy effect especially for women with no prior treatment.
overactive_bladder	to investigate the effect of solifenacin succinate on intraocular pressure (iop) and dry eye in patients with overactive bladder (oab). the study was conducted prospectively between october 2014 and november 2015. a total of 93 female oab patients with a mean age of 48.59 +/- 11.28 years (range 19-75 years) were evaluated. a full ophthalmic examination, including the schirmer i test and iop measurements, was conducted. solifenacin succinate (5 mg/day) was started orally. all procedures were repeated at the 4- and 12-week follow-up, and the effects and side effects were documented. no statistically significant difference was observed in iop (p = 0.282, p = 0.189) and tear secretion (p = 0.122, p = 0.071) values from the baseline (day 0) to the 12th week in oab patients using solifenacin succinate. solifenacin succinate treatment was terminated in 3 patients owing to dry eye in 1 patient, increased iop in 1 patient, and systemic side effects in 1 patient. constipation and dry mouth at various rates were the most common systemic side effects observed. solifenacin succinate is useful in eliminating oab symptoms in female patients, but can cause systemic side effects. it had no significant side effects on tear secretion (schirmer i) and iop. we concluded that solifenacin succinate could be reliably used in pure oab patients without comorbidity in terms of dry eye and iop. we believe that prospective studies with larger series are still needed to reach a definite conclusion.
overactive_bladder	moderate urinary dysfunctions including frequent urination and over reactive bladder are age-related deteriorating urinary condition and saw palmetto extract and pumpkin seed oil have been used for the prevention. in the course of evaluation of activities against urinary dysfunctions in edible fruits, we found that extract of seaberry (sbe) suppressed bladder constriction. in carbacol-induced constriction in rat bladder specimen, sbe (10 mu g/ml) significantly suppressed the constriction. sbe also suppressed tgf-beta-induced constriction of collagen gel containing bladder muscle cells. among the constituents in sbe, ursolic acid (1-100 m) and isorhamnetin 7-o-rhamunoside (10 mu m) significantly suppressed carbacol-induced bladder constriction. on the other hand, 3-o-coumaroyl 2,23-dihydroxy oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, uvaol, pomolic acid, oleanolic aldehyde and isorhamnetin 7-o-rhamnoside significantly suppressed tgf-beta-induced collagen gel constriction containing bladder muscle cells at 1 or 10 mu m. these results suggest that several triterpenoids and a flavonoid glycoside suppressed bladder constriction and sbe may contribute to suppression of urinary dysfunctions caused by overactive bladder.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	introduction: colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states, and new strategies to prevent, detect, and treat the disease are needed. the receptor, guanylate cyclase c (gucy2c), a tumor suppressor expressed by the intestinal epithelium, has emerged as a promising target. areas covered: this review outlines the role of gucy2c in tumorigenesis, and steps to translate gucy2c-targeting schemes to the clinic. endogenous gucy2c-activating ligands disappear early in tumorigenesis, silencing its signaling axis and enabling transformation. pre-clinical models support gucy2c ligand supplementation as a novel disease prevention paradigm. with the recent fda approval of the gucy2c ligand, linaclotide, and two more synthetic ligands in the pipeline, this strategy can be tested in human trials. in addition to primary tumor prevention, we also review immunotherapies targeting gucy2c expressed by metastatic lesions, and platforms using gucy2c as a biomarker for detection and patient staging. expert commentary: results of the first gucy2c targeting schemes in patients will become available in the coming years. the identification of gucy2c ligand loss as a requirement for colorectal tumorigenesis has the potential to change the treatment paradigm from an irreversible disease of genetic mutation, to a treatable disease of ligand insufficiency.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundsleep disturbances are well-documented among persons with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). difficulty in falling asleep, shorter sleep time, frequent arousal and awakenings, or non-restorative sleep are the most common manifestations. sleep disturbances are also related to a higher risk of having ibs. some researchers have provided evidence of a positive association between poorer subjective sleep quality and increased severity and frequency in gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms in those with ibs. however, findings from studies using objective sleep and activity measures, such as polysomnography and actigraphy, are inconclusive. purposethis systematic review of the literature between 1990 and 2015 evaluates the evidence of sleep disturbances in adults with ibs and their relationship with gi symptoms.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	gut microbiota is the largest organ of the human body. although growth of bacteria more than 10(5) colony forming unit (cfu) per milliliter in culture of upper gut aspirate is used to diagnosis small intestinal bacterial over-growth (sibo), 10(3) cfu or more is being considered to suggest the diag-nosis, particularly if colonic type bacteria are present in the upper gut. although neither very sensitive nor specific, hydrogen breath tests are widely used to diagnose sibo. rifaximin is the best treatment for sibo due to its broad spectrum, lack of systemic absorption, and safety profile.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: ""gluten-related disorders"" is a term that encompasses different diseases induced by the ingestion of gluten-containing food. because of their incidence the scientific community has been intensively studying them. aim: to support gastroenterologists with a correct nomenclature and diagnostic approach to gluten related disorders in adulthood. methods: the italian association of hospital gastroenterologists and endoscopists (aigo) commissioned a panel of experts to prepare a position statement clarifying the nomenclature and diagnosis of gluten related disorders, focusing on those of gastroenterological interest. each member was assigned a task and levels of evidence/recommendation have been proposed. results: the panel identified celiac disease, wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity as the gluten related disorders of gastroenterological interest. celiac disease has an autoimmune nature, wheat allergy is ige-mediated while the pathogenesis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is still unknown as is the case of non-ige mediated allergy. diagnosis should start with the serological screening for celiac disease and wheat allergy. in case of normal values, the response to a gluten-free diet should be evaluated and a confirmatory blind food challenge carried out. conclusions: gluten-related disorders are clinically heterogeneous. patients should be carefully managed and specific protocols applied for a correct differential diagnosis in gastroenterological setting.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: the detection of celiac disease (cd) is suboptimal. aims: we hypothesized that misdiagnosis is leading to diagnostic delays, and examine this assertion by determining if patients have increased risk of abdominal surgery before cd diagnosis. methods: through biopsy reports from sweden 's 28 pathology departments we identified all individuals with cd (marsh stage 3; n=29,096). using hospital-based data on inpatient and outpatient surgery recorded in the swedish patient register, we compared abdominal surgery (appendectomy, laparotomy, biliary tract surgery, and uterine surgery) with that in 144,522 controls matched for age, sex, county and calendar year. conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ors). results: 4064 (14.0%) individuals with cd and 15,760 (10.9%) controls had a record of earlier abdominal surgery (or = 1.36, 95% ci = 1.31-1.42). risk estimates were highest in the first year after surgery (or = 2.00; 95% ci = 1.79-2.22). appendectomy, laparotomy, biliary tract surgery, and uterine surgery were all associated with having a later cd diagnosis. of note, abdominal surgery was also more common after cd diagnosis (hazard ratio =1.34; 95% ci = 1.29-1.39). conclusions: there is an increased risk of abdominal surgery both before and after cd diagnosis. surgical complications associated with cd may best explain these outcomes. medical nihilism and lack of cd awareness may be contributing to outcomes.

polycythemia_vera	polydatin (pd), a natural precursor of resveratrol, has a variety of biological activities, including anti-tumor effects. however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of pd has not been fully elucidated. the present study demonstrated that pd significantly inhibited the proliferation of the molt-4 leukemia cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner by using cell counting kit-8 assay. pd also dose-dependently increased the apoptotic rate and caused cell cycle arrest in s phase in molt-4 cells, as revealed by flow cytometry. in addition, pd dose-dependently decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and led to the generation of reactive oxygen species in molt-4 cells. western blot analysis revealed that the expression of anti-apoptotic protein b-cell lymphoma 2 ( bcl-2) was decreased, whereas that of pro-apoptotic protein bcl-2-associated x was increased by pd. furthermore, the expression of two cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin d1 and cyclin b1, was suppressed by pd. of note, the pro-apoptotic and cell cycle-inhibitory effects of pd were potentiated by janus kinase (jak2) inhibition. in conclusion, the results of the present study strongly suggested that pd is a promising therapeutic compound for the treatment of leukemia, particularly in combination with jak inhibitors.
polycythemia_vera	chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml) is a unique disease entity with overlap components of both myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms. cmml is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm characterized by monocytosis, cytopenias, and extramedullary manifestations such as splenomegaly. the disease is rare and has undergone revisions in its classification. we review the recent classification strategies as well as diagnostic criteria, focusing on the new insights into the genetic alterations and unique pathophysiology of the disease. we also discuss the latest molecular characterization of the disease, including how molecular factors affect current prognostic models. finally, we focus on available treatment strategies, with a special emphasis on experimental and forthcoming therapies.

polycythemia_vera	although bcr-abl negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn) - and especially myelofibrosis (mf) - are recognized to be associated with autoimmune phenomena, immune derangements in mpn have been much less studied. myeloid -derived suppressor cells (mdsc) are one type of important immune modulator cell. therefore, we studied mdscs in mpn disease. mdscs were studied in two cohorts: the first cohort was 55 patients including 16 primary myelofibrosis (pmf), 7 post-polycythemia vera (pv)mf, 2 post-essential thrombocythemia (et)-mf, 11 et, 17 pv, 2 undefined mpn disorder, and 23 normal controls; the second cohort included 38 patients: 17 et, 7 pmf, 3 et-mf, 2 pv-mf, 9 pv patients, and 20 normal volunteers. the second cohort was studied using freshly collected specimens and a comparable age group as controls. cd11b(+), cd14(-), and cd33(+) cells were defined as mdscs in both cohorts by flow cytometry. since there are no differences in mdsc levels among different mpn categories, they were grouped as mpns. the results showed that mdscs were significantly elevated in mpns compared with controls in both cohorts. we also performed rt-pcr and found that mpn patients have significantly elevated arginase-1 mrna compared with controls, and sorted mdscs were found to have suppressor t cell activity in mpns, substantiating the hypothesis that levels of mdscs are, in fact, deranged in mpns. mdsc levels were not correlated with jak2 status, white blood cells, hb levels, platelet counts, splenomegaly, or the degree of bone marrow fibrosis (in mf). further studies in immune therapy involving mdsc inhibitors or differentiation may be developed to treat mpn disease.

polycythemia_vera	we describe 2 cases of skeletal ""superscan"" with f-18-choline pet/ct in prostate cancer (pca) patients. both cases demonstrated diffuse skeletal involvement besides their primary prostate tumor. the first impression was that this presentation would be related to diffuse tumoral skeletal invasion by pca as often seen in tc-99m-mdp bone scintigraphy. in both cases, the bone involvement was shown to be caused by hematological disease (polycythemia vera and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), demonstrating the importance of also considering the presence of myeloproliferative syndromes when presented with diffuse bone disease on choline pet/ct performed in pca patients.
polycythemia_vera	the discovery of jak2 v617f mutation in the mid-2000s started to fill the gap between clinical presentation of polycythemia vera (pv), first described by vaquez at the end of the 19th century, and spontaneous erythroid colony formation, reported by prchal and axelrad in the mid-1970s. the knowledge on this mutation brought an important insight to our understanding of pv pathogenesis and led to a revision of the world health organization diagnostic criteria in 2008. jak-stat is a major signaling pathway implicated in survival and proliferation of hematopoietic precursors. high prevalence of jak2 v617f mutation among myeloproliferative neoplasms (>95% in pv and similar to 50% in primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia) together with its role in constitutively activating jak-stat made jak2 a privileged therapeutic target. ruxolitinib, a jak 1 and 2 inhibitor, has already proven to be efficient in relieving symptoms in primary myelofibrosis and pv. in the latter, it also appears to improve microvascular involvement. however, evidence regarding its potential role in altering the natural course of pv and its use as an adjunct to current standard therapies is sparse. therapeutic advances are needed in pv as phlebotomy, low-dose aspirin, cytoreductive agents, and interferon alpha are the only therapeutic tools available at the moment to influence outcome. even though several questions are still unanswered, this review aims to serve as an overview article of the potential role of ruxolitinib in pv according to current literature and expert opinion. it should help hematologists to visualize the place of this tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the field of current practice and offer criteria for a careful patient selection.
