headache	posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres) is a reversible clinical and neuroradiological syndrome which may appear at any age and characterized by headache, altered consciousness, seizures, and cortical blindness. the exact incidence is still unknown. the most commonly identified causes include hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, and some cytotoxic drugs. vasogenic edema related subcortical white matter lesions, hyperintense on t2a and flair sequences, in a relatively symmetrical pattern especially in the occipital and parietal lobes can be detected on cranial mr imaging. these findings tend to resolve partially or completely with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. here in, we present a rare case of unilateral pres developed following the treatment with pazopanib, a testicular tumor vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) inhibitory agent.
headache	migraine headache and its associated symptoms have plagued humans for two millennia. it is manifest throughout the world, and affects more than 1/6 of the global population. it is the most common brain disorder, and is characterized by moderate to severe unilateral headache that is accompanied by vomiting, nausea, photophobia, photophobia, and other hypersensitive symptoms of the senses. while there is still a dear lack of understanding of its neurophysiology, it is beginning to be understood, and it seems to suggest migraine is a disorder of brain sensory processing, characterized by a generalized neuronal hyperexcitability. the complex symptomatology of migraine indicates that multiple neuronal systems are involved, including brainstem and diencephalic systems, which function abnormally, resulting in premonitory symptoms, ultimately evolving to affect the dural trigeminovascular system, and the pain phase of migraine. the migraineur also seems to be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in homeostasis, such as sleep, feeding and stress, reflecting the abnormality of functioning in these brainstem and diencephalic systems. implications for therapeutic development have grown out of our understanding of migraine neurophysiology, leading to major drug classes, such as triptans, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, and 5-htif receptor agonists, as well as neuromodulatory approaches, with the promise of more to come. the present review will discuss the current understanding of the neurophysiology of migraine, particularly migraine headache, and novel insights into the complex neural networks responsible for associated neurological symptoms, and how interaction of these networks with migraine pain pathways has implications for the development of novel therapeutics.

heart_disease	stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) is used widely in adult ischemic heart disease, but data in children is limited. we sought to evaluate feasibility, accuracy and prognostic value of stress cmr in children with suspected coronary artery disease (cad). stress cmr was reviewed from two pediatric centers over 5 years using a standard pharmacologic protocol. wall motion abnormalities, perfusion deficits and late enhancement were correlated with coronary angiogram (cag) when available, and clinical status at 1 year follow-up for major adverse cardiovascular events (mace; coronary revascularization, non-fatal myocardial infarction and death due to cad) was recorded. sixty-four stress perfusion cmr studies in 48 children (10.9 +/- 4.8 years) using adenosine; 59 (92%) and dipyridamole; 5 (8%), were reviewed. indications were kawasaki disease (39%), post arterial switch operation (12.5%), post heart transplantation (12.5%), post anomalous coronary artery repair (11%), chest pain (11%), suspected myocarditis or cad (3%), post coronary revascularization (3%), and others (8%). twenty-six studies were performed under sedation. of all studies performed, 66% showed no evidence of ischemia or infarction, 28% had perfusion deficits and 6% had late gadolinium enhancement (lge) without perfusion deficit. compared to cag, the positive predictive value (ppv) of stress cmr was 80% with negative predictive value (npv) of 88%. at 1 year clinical follow-up, the ppv and npv of stress cmr to predict mace were 78 and 98%. stress-perfusion cmr, in combination with lge and wall motion-analysis is a feasible and an accurate method of diagnosing cad in children. in difficult cases, it also helps guide clinical intervention by complementing conventional cag with functional information.
emergency_contraception	unintended pregnancy continues to be a substantial public health problem. emergency contraception (ec) provides a last chance at pregnancy prevention. several safe and effective options for emergency contraception are currently available. the yuzpe method, a combined hormonal regimen, was essentially replaced by other oral medications including levonorgestrel and the antiprogestin ulipristal. the antiprogestin mifepristone has been studied for use as emergency contraception. the most effective postcoital method of contraception is the copper intrauterine device (iud). obesity and the simultaneous initiation of progestin-containing contraception may decrease the effectiveness of some emergency contraception.
heart_disease	survival following ovarian cancer diagnosis is generally low; understanding factors related to prognosis could be important to optimize treatment. the role of previously diagnosed comorbidities and use of medications for those conditions in relation to prognosis for ovarian cancer patients has not been studied extensively, particularly according to histological subtype. using pooled data from fifteen studies participating in the ovarian cancer association consortium, we examined the associations between history of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and medications taken for these conditions and overall survival (os) and progression-free survival (pfs) among patients diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma. we used cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and stage to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) overall and within strata of histological subtypes. history of diabetes was associated with increased risk of mortality (n = 7,674; hr = 1.12; 95% ci = 1.01-1.25). no significant mortality associations were observed for hypertension (n = 6,482; hr = 0.95; 95% ci = 0.88-1.02) or heart disease (n = 4,252; hr = 1.05; 95% ci = 0.87-1.27). no association of these comorbidities was found with pfs in the overall study population. however, among patients with endometrioid tumors, hypertension was associated with lower risk of progression (n = 339, hr = 0.54; 95% ci = 0.35-0.84). comorbidity was not associated with os or pfs for any of the other histological subtypes. ever use of beta blockers, oral antidiabetic medications, and insulin was associated with increased mortality, hr = 1.20; 95% ci = 1.03-1.40, hr = 1.28; 95% ci = 1.05-1.55, and hr = 1.63; 95% ci = 1.20-2.20, respectively. ever use of diuretics was inversely associated with mortality, hr = 0.71; 95% ci = 0.53-0.94. histories of hypertension, diabetes, and use of diuretics, beta blockers, insulin, and oral antidiabetic medications may influence the survival of ovarian cancer patients. understanding mechanisms for these observations could provide insight regarding treatment.
sports_injuries	background: osteoid osteoma (oo) is a common benign bone tumour that is rarely found in the talus. its nidus is difficult to detect on early imaging. the atypical symptoms of oo and the presence of concurrent trauma or sports injuries may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. we herein analyse a case of misdiagnosis of oo of the talus and discuss how to improve the early diagnosis of this rare lesion, thereby permitting rapid treatment. case presentation: a 23-year-old man with a history of left ankle sprains and chronic pain was diagnosed with another ankle sprain and managed conservatively based on normal x-ray findings. after 1 year of recurring pain, he was diagnosed with ankle traumatic arthritis and underwent arthroscopic surgery. his preoperative ankle x-ray findings were still normal, and magnetic resonance imaging at that time demonstrated bone marrow oedema of the left talus. his symptoms reappeared shortly after surgery and progressively worsened. magnetic resonance imaging performed 3 months after surgery demonstrated widespread bone marrow oedema of the talus. the patient presented to our hospital for pain assessment and was diagnosed with oo of the talus 3 years after his symptoms began. preoperative computed tomography (ct) demonstrated a typical nidus of oo of the talus. after a second surgery, the patient 's symptoms completely resolved, and pathologic examination confirmed that the lesion was oo. the patient recovered 3 months later and was able to walk normally. conclusions: oo of the ankle joint exhibits a progressive course and is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. patients with oo of the talus often have atypical imaging findings, no signs of ankle instability, and no anterior talofibular ligament tenderness. ct is valuable for diagnosing oo, although multiple ct scans may be required to detect the nidus. proper imaging helps doctors to achieve the correct diagnosis early in the disease course, significantly shortening the treatment cycle and improving the patient 's quality of life.
parkinson's_disease	background and purposeportugal has been identified as one of the countries with a high prevalence of lrrk2-g2019s, considered to be the most frequent known cause of familial and sporadic parkinson 's disease (pd). the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of pd in portugal using a door-to-door methodology. methodsa cross-sectional study was conducted in the portuguese community-dwelling population; that is, elderly people living in the community on their own, aged 50years and resident in mainland portugal, in two phases: (i) a questionnaire was applied to screen potential cases of pd; and (ii) screened cases were evaluated by an expert in pd to confirm diagnosis. resultsthe adjusted prevalence of pd for the portuguese community-dwelling population aged 50years was 0.24%. the estimated total number of cases of pd for the portuguese population is 180/100000 inhabitants. conclusionsthe results of this study show that a geographical region with a high frequency of a causal mutation for pd does not automatically imply a high prevalence of patients with pd.
emergency_contraception	ulipristal acetate (upa) was licensed as an emergency contraceptive (ec) in europe in 2009. by the end of may 2013, over 1.4 million courses had been used. the rationale for using upa for ec in favor of the much more commonly used levonorgestrel (lng) is based on data on efficacy, safety and side effects. efficacy: in two large clinical trials among women presenting for ec up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, upa was as effective as lng at preventing pregnancy. when the two trials were combined in a meta analysis upa was superior, almost halving the risk of pregnancy compared with lng. biomedical studies have shown that upa inhibits or delays ovulation more effectively than lng at a stage of the cycle when the risk of pregnancy is highest. safety and side effects: upa and lng have similar side effect profiles and to date no serious adverse events have been attributed to use of upa for ec. data on pregnancies conceived in association with upa use are reassuring. there is no evidence for teratogenesis or for any increased risk of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. availability: use of upa will remain limited until it is available without a doctor 's prescription.
birth_control	half of all pregnancies in the usa are unintended, suggesting a high incidence of either improper or nonuse of contraceptives. emergency birth control (ebc) provides individuals with additional insurance against unplanned pregnancy in the presence of contraception failure. this study is the first to estimate the impact of switching ebc from prescription to nonprescription status in the usa on abortions and risky sexual behavior as measured by std rates. utilizing state-level variation in access to ebc, we find that providing individuals with over-the-counter access to ebc leads to increase std rates and has no effect on abortion rates. moreover, individual-level analysis using the national longitudinal survey of youth indicates that risky sexual behavior such as engaging in unprotected sex and number of sexual encounters increases as a result of over-the-counter access to ebc, which is consistent with the state-level std findings. copyright (c) 2015john wiley & sons, ltd.
skin_care	cosmetic skin care products currently in the market demonstrate an increasing trend toward antiaging products. selection of the right formulation approach is the key to successful consumer acceptance. nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs) for dermal application can render added benefits to the formulation. tretinoin a derivative of vitamin a, is a retinoid with anti-aging and anti-acne potential. the present study was aimed at formulating nlcs of tretinoin for reducing the skin irritation potential, increasing the drug loading capacity and prolonging the duration of action. the nlcs were optimized using the response surface methodology based on the particle size. preliminary study, suggested the use of stearic acid, oleic acid, tween 80 and span 60 as solid lipid, liquid lipid and surfactants respectively formed a stable dispersion. nlcs of tretinoin were prepared by hot melt microemulsion and hot melt probe sonication methods. the properties of the optimized nlcs such as morphology, size, zeta potential, stability and in vitro drug release were investigated. tretinoin loaded nlcs in carbopol gel showed a sustained release pattern with isopropyl alcohol as the receptor fluid compared to the marketed gel using franz diffusion cells. eight prepared gel formulations tested were found to follow the higuchi model of drug release. stability studies indicated that the formulations stored at refrigeration and room temperature showed no noticeable differences in the drug content and release profiles in vitro, after a period of 4 weeks. in vivo skin irritation test on male wister rats indicated no irritation or erythema after application of the nlcs loaded gel repeated for a period of 7 days compared to the application of marketed tretinoin gel which showed irritation and slight erythema within 3 days. the results showed that the irritation potential of tretinoin was reduced, the drug loading was increased and the drug release was prolonged by the incorporation into the nlcs.

myelofibrosis	mutations in jak2, mpl and calr genes have been identified in the majority of myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) patients, and patients negative for these three mutations are the so-called triple-negative (tn) mpn. in this study, we examined the mutational profiles of 16 triple-negative mpn patients including 7 essential thrombocythemia (et), 1 primary myelofibrosis and 8 polycythemia vera (pv). targeted next-generation sequencing was performed using the actonco comprehensive cancer panel (ion ampliseq comprehensive cancer panel, life technologies) to target all coding exons of 409 cancer-related genes. overall, 30 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were detected in 12 (75%) patients with a range of 1-5 mutations per sample. notably, one et patient was found to have jak2v617f and kitp551l mutations at very low allele frequency. one mplp70l and 1 mplm602t mutations were identified each in 1 et and 1 pv, respectively. other recurrent mutations were also identified including kmt2c, kmt2d, irs2, syne1, pde4dip, setd2, atm, tnfaip3 and ccnd2. in addition, germline mutations were also found in some cancer-related genes. copy number changes were rare in this cohort of tn mpns. in conclusion, both somatic and germline mutations can be detected in tn mpn patients.
parkinson's_disease	intrastriatal injection of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (manf) protein has been shown to provide neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) - lesioned rat model of parkinson 's disease. here, we used an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (aav9) vector to deliver the human manf (hmanf) gene into the rat striatum 10 days after a 6-ohda lesion to examine long-term effects of hmanf on nigral dopaminergic neurons and mechanisms underlying manf neuroprotection. intrastriatal injection of aav9-hmanf vectors led to a robust and widespread expression of the hmanf gene in the injected striatum up to 24 weeks. increased levels of hmanf protein were also detected in the ipsilateral substantia nigra. the hmanf gene transfer promoted the survival of nigral dopaminergic neurons, regeneration of striatal dopaminergic fibers and an upregulation of striatal dopamine levels, resulting in a long-term improvement of rotational behavior up to 16 weeks after viral injections. by using sh-sy5y cells, we found that intra- and extracellular application of manf protected cells against 6-ohda-induced toxicity via inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway. our results suggest that aav9-mediated hmanfgene delivery into the striatum exerts long-term neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in parkinsonian rats, and provide insights into mechanisms responsible for manf neuroprotection.

menopause	introduction: the purposes of the present study was to examine the effect of intermittent exercise training on musculoskeletal and metabolic health in postmenopausal (pm) and premenopausal (prm) women and, furthermore, to evaluate whether the adaptations can be maintained with a reduced training frequency. methods: eighteen pm (51 +/- 1 yr, mean +/- sem) and 12 prm (48 +/- 1 yr) women participated in floorball training approximately two times per week for 12 wk. in a subgroup (n = 9) of pm women (pm40), exercise training was performed for an additional 40 wk with a reduced training frequency of approximately one training session per week. results: in pm, the body fat percentage decreased (p < 0.05) and the total lean leg mass increased (p < 0.05) during the 12-wk training period, with no changes in prm. in both pm and prm, lean body mass and maximal oxygen uptake ((v)over doto(2max)) were higher, and yo-yo intermittent endurance test 1 (yyiet-1) performance was better (p < 0.05) after the 12-wk training period. procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide was higher (p < 0.05) in pm, and total leg bone mineral density (bmd) was higher (p < 0.05) in both pm and prm after the 12-wk training period. in pm40, total lean leg mass, (v)over doto(2max), yyiet-1 performance, level of procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, and total leg bmd were maintained, whereas whole-body bmd and glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) were reduced (p < 0.05) and the expression of muscle glucose transporter type 4 was higher (p < 0.05). conclusion: twelve weeks of intermittent exercise training increased bmd, intermittent exercise capacity, and (v)over doto(2max) in pm and prm, with pm also having positive changes in body composition. additional 40 wk of training with a reduced frequency was sufficient to preserve these physiological adaptations and also improve blood glucose regulation in pm.
overactive_bladder	objective: this study aimed to assess the role of tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (pde5-i), in recovery of lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (rarp). materials and methods: all patients treated with rarp between october 2010 and august 2013 were enrolled in this retrospective study on prospectively collected data. patients were retrospectively divided into groups according to postoperative treatment: patients taking tadalafil twice weekly from 1 month to 6 months after rarp, and patients not taking tadalafil. the international prostate symptom score (ipss), the overactive bladder symptom score (oabss) and urinary continence (uc) were assessed preoperatively (2 days before rarp) and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after rarp. results: there was no difference in the overall ipss score between the groups. at 6 and 9 months, the ipss storage symptom scores were significantly lower in patients taking tadalafil than in patients not taking tadalafil. in patients with overactive bladder (oab) before rarp (n = 22), no differences in the total scores of oabss were seen between patients taking tadalafil and patients not taking tadalafil. on the other hand, in non-oab patients before rarp (n = 68), at 3, 6 and 9 months, the total scores of oabss were significantly lower in patients taking tadalafil than in patients not taking tadalafil. no differences in uc rates after surgery were seen between the groups. conclusion: postoperative tadalafil treatment may be temporarily effective for the recovery of the ipss storage symptom scores and oabss.
sports_injuries	epidemiologically-based evidence has demonstrated that a substantial number of athletes and exercisers are injured each year, which can result in physical disability as well as other negative physical, social and psychological consequences. accumulated research has indicated that the prevalence of sport and physical activity-related injuries varies based on gender, age group, type of sport, level of participation, and role on the team, among other considerations. although physical causes are the primary contributors to injury, a considerable number of studies have suggested that psychological and social factors also have importance in injury prevention and rehabilitation. among the psychosocial factors investigated, social support has emerged as a significant buffering and coping resource in the recovery process from athletic injuries. however, research has also indicated that sources of social support tend to be less frequently available to athletes during some stages of rehabilitation and do not necessarily meet the athletes' expectations and needs. moreover, some studies have suggested that social support may have detrimental effects under certain circumstances. as such, coaches, athletic trainers and health care professionals should be aware of these complex forms of influence and develop and implement injury rehabilitation processes that are based on a holistic approach in order to promote the athletes' recovery and well-being.
alzheimer's_disease	protein homeostasis (proteostasis) requires the timely degradation of misfolded proteins and their aggregates by protein quality control (pqc), of which molecular chaperones are an essential component. compared with other cell types, pqc in neurons is particularly challenging because they have a unique cellular structure with long extensions. making it worse, neurons are postmitotic, i. e., cannot dilute toxic substances by division, and, thus, are highly sensitive to misfolded proteins, especially as they age. failure in pqc is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as huntington 's disease (hd), alzheimer 's disease (ad), parkinson 's disease (pd), and prion disease. in fact, many neurodegenerative diseases are considered to be protein misfolding disorders. to prevent the accumulation of disease-causing aggregates, neurons utilize a repertoire of chaperones that recognize misfolded proteins through exposed hydrophobic surfaces and assist their refolding. if such an effort fails, chaperones can facilitate the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins through either the ubiquitin (ub)-proteasome system (ups) or the autophagy-lysosome system (hereafter autophagy). if soluble, the substrates associated with chaperones, such as hsp70, are ubiquitinated by ub ligases and degraded through the proteasome complex. some misfolded proteins carrying the kferq motif are recognized by the chaperone hsc70 and delivered to the lysosomal lumen through a process called, chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma). aggregation-prone misfolded proteins that remain unprocessed are directed to macroautophagy in which cargoes are collected by adaptors, such as p62/sqstm-1/sequestosome-1, and delivered to the autophagosome for lysosomal degradation. the aggregates that have survived all these refolding/degradative processes can still be directly dissolved, i. e., disaggregated by chaperones. studies have shown that molecular chaperones alleviate the pathogenic symptoms by neurodegeneration-causing protein aggregates. chaperone-inducing drugs and anti-aggregation drugs are actively exploited for beneficial effects on symptoms of disease. here, we discuss how chaperones protectmisfolded proteins from aggregation andmediate the degradation of terminallymisfolded proteins in collaboration with cellular degradative machinery. the topics also include therapeutic approaches to improve the expression and turnover of molecular chaperones and to develop anti-aggregation drugs.
hypothyroidism	context. subacute thyroiditis (sat) is a transient inflammatory disease that occurs often after an upper respiratory tract infection. permanent hypothyroidism ratio is reported in 5-26% of the sat patients. objective. in this study, we tried to compare the treatment options on permanent hypothyroidism in our sat patients. design. it is a retrospective study. the medical records of sat patients between 2010 and 2015 were analysed. subjects and methods. the medical records of 81 patients were analysed for demographic data, laboratory and clinical course, treatment and 1 year outcome. 81 patients were classified in steroid (n=29), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) (n=33) and steroid+nsaid (n=19) groups. results. male/female ratio was similar and female domination was demonstrated in all groups. in the steroid and nsaid groups the pretreatment thyroid function tests were diagnosed as hyperthyroidism. in the steroid+nsaitd group they were not diagnosed as hyperthyroidism in the beginning. in all groups the thyroid function tests were all in normal levels (p>0.05) one year later. in all groups the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were increased in the pretreatment period and decreased with the treatment. in total, right lobe involvement of thyroiditis was more detected (40/81 (49%)) (p=0.018). permanent hypothyroidism observed in steroid, nsaid, and steroid+nsaid groups were 7/29 (24%), 5/33 (15%), 3/19 (16%) respectively (p>0.05). conclusion. in this study, treatment drug option did not affect the permanent hypothyroidism one year after in our sat patients.
menopause	objectives: quality of life is a sense of physical and psychological well-being and a concept affected by various factors such as place of residence. the present study was conducted with the aim to explore quality of life of postmenopausal women in urban and rural areas of tabriz, iran. materials and methods: the present cross-sectional study was conducted on 544 postmenopausal women from rural and urban areas, selected by cluster sampling method. data were collected through a 3-part questionnaire consisting of demographic details, quality of life (sf-36) and a research made questionnaire for assessment of physical and psychological menopausal symptom. results: following adjustment of basic variables, rural women obtained significantly higher scores in ""physical function"", ""general health"" and ""vitality."" although the subscales of ""bodily pain,"" "" social function and "" role limitation"" were better in urban women. multivariate linear regression results revealed factors affecting quality of life, including the number of children, satisfaction with children 's conduct, income, occupation and score of postmenopausal symptoms in urban women; and satisfaction with children 's conduct, income, chronic diseases, age, postmenopausal duration, education, and score of postmenopausal symptoms in rural women. conclusion: the present study results showed that various dimensions of quality of life were at an acceptable level, but the two groups were significantly different in most subscales. considering the increasing middle-aged and older population, attention to the quality of life of women in these age groups is crucial. the present study determined the difference in dimensions of quality of life between urban and rural women and identified their possible health requirements.
myelofibrosis	introduction: chronic myeloproliferative disorders (cmpd) are chronic myeloid hematological disorders, characterized by increased myeloid cell proliferation and fibrosis. impaired apoptotic mechanisms, increased cell proliferation, uncontrolled hematopoietic cell proliferation and myeloaccumulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of cmpd. the aim of our study was to show the possible role of fas/fasl gene polymorphisms in cmpd pathogenesis and investigate the association with clinical parameters and susceptibility to disease. material and methods: we included 101 (34 polycythemia vera (pv), 23 primary myelofibrosis (pmf), 44 essential thrombocythemia (et)) cmpd patients diagnosed according to the who classification criteria and 95 healthy controls in this study. all the patients and the controls were investigated for fas/fasl gene expression, allele frequencies and phenotype features, and also fas mrna levels were analyzed. results: chronic myeloproliferative disorders patients showed increased fas-670ag + gg genotype distribution compared with the control group (pg gene polymorphism and some clinical parameters such as splenomegaly and thrombosis (p >0.05). no statistically significant difference in fasl+843c>t genotype or allele frequency was found between groups (p >0.05). moreover, no statistically significant difference was detected in fasl and jak2v617f mutations (p >0.05). fas mrna expression was 1.5-fold reduced in patients compared to healthy subjects. conclusions: according to our findings, fas/fasl gene expression may contribute to the molecular and immunological pathogenesis of cmpd. more investigations are needed to support these data.
weight_loss	a detailed transformation process of cation exchange (ce) chemistry from hexagonal phase cds to cds-cu7s4 core-shell heterostructures nanorods and eventually to monoclinic phase cu7s4 nanorods is reported. applications of the nanorods in environmental pollution removal, photothermal conversion and light-induced water evaporation were investigated. the influence of the reaction time, morphology, and crystal phase on the photocatalysis, photothermal conversion and light-induced water evaporation was discussed. the results showed maximum removal value of rhodamine b by 97.8% at 1 h timepoint. aqueous dispersion of the core-shell cds-cu7s4 heterostructures nanorods prepared with 2 h (1.0 g/l) exhibited a good photothermal conversion performance as it saw increase in sample temperature by 37.8 c-circle in 300 s under the irradiation of 980 nm laser. the exposure of as-obtained sample film to simulated sunlight irradiation at 2 h (8 mg) increased the weight loss of pure water by 0.62 g in 30 min with the water evaporation efficiency up to 48.4%. we are reporting an excellent light-induced water evaporation performance potential of the nanorods discussed.
hypothyroidism	down syndrome (ds) is the most common chromosomal disorder causing mental retardation with a worldwide average prevalence of 1-2 cases per 1000 births. this study aimed to determine the comorbidities associated with ds and the coverage of health care services and developmental interventions for ds livebirths in southern thailand. a total of 149 livebirth ds infants, recruited through the prospective birth defects registry system during 2009-2013 in 3 provinces in southern thailand, were regularly followed-up every 3-6 months. the data collection form included the infants' demographic data, associated congenital anomalies, and developmental interventions. the ds infants were born at an average gestational age of 38.5 +/- 2.3 weeks with average birth weight of 2760 +/- 478 g, length 48.5 +/- 2.2 cm, and head circumference 32.7 +/- 1.2 cm. congenital heart diseases, gastrointestinal defects and congenital hypothyroidism were found in 43.0%, 6.7%, and 12.1% of the cases, respectively. the percentage of ds infants who received developmental interventions in this current study were significantly greater than in a previous study covering the years 1992-2002: early stimulation program 90.0% vs. 65.6% (p < 0.01), and speech training program 74.8% vs. 38.9% (p < 0.01), respectively, and the infants in our study began intervention programs significantly earlier, 0.58 +/- 0.39 years vs. 1.69 +/- 0.66 years, respectively. congenital heart disease was the most common comorbidity associated with ds. the coverage of health care services and developmental interventions for ds children has generally improved in southern thailand. one hundred percent coverage of health services and interventions for children with special needs is expected in the near future.
polycythemia_vera	essential thrombocythemia (et) and polycythemia vera (pv) are philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) characterized by the jak2 v617f mutation, which can be found in more than 98% of pv patients and in approximate to 50% of et patients. assessment of the jak2 v617f allele burden by a highly sensitive quantitative pcr (qpcr) assay appears to be a useful tool for monitoring minimal residual disease (mrd) and evaluating treatment efficacy. this report expands and substantiates existing data, showing that ifn-alpha2 is a highly potent immunomodulating agent capable of inducing mrd with low-burden jak2 v617f, major molecular response (mmr), complete hematological remission (chr) and complete histomorphological normalization of the bone marrow in a sub-set of patients with et and pv after long-term treatment (>= 3.5 years). furthermore, long-lasting hematological, molecular and histomorphological remissions are sustained after discontinuation of ifn-alpha2 for up to approximate to 5-6 years.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders in elders. sesamin is a lignan compound and the active constituent of sesame oil with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. this study was carried out to explore the mechanisms underlying sesamin effect against unilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) model of pd. intrastriatal 6-ohda-lesioned rats were pretreated with sesamin at doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg/day for one week. sesamin at a dose of 20 mg/kg attenuated motor imbalance in narrow beam test, lowered striatal level of malondialdehyde (mda) and reactive oxygen species (ros), improved superoxide dismutase (sod) activity, lowered striatal caspase 3 activity and alpha-synuclein expression, attenuated glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) immunoreactivity, depressed nigral neuronal apoptosis, and prevented damage of dopaminergic neurons using tyrosine hydroxylase (th) immunohistochemistry. these findings reveal the reversal effect of sesamin in 6-ohda model of pd via attenuation of apoptosis, astrogliosis, oxidative stress, and down-regulation of alpha-synuclein.

weight_loss	background: laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (lagb) is a safe and proven surgical option for morbid obesity; however, the need for revisional surgery is being increasingly reported. this study reports outcomes and incidence for a large cohort of patients requiring revisional lagb surgery for various indications. methods: a retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 1524 primary lagb placed between 2003 and 2013 by a single surgeon at a single institution was performed, analysing data for all patients in this cohort requiring revisional lagb surgery. results: a total of 434 revisions were performed on 349 patients. a total of 278 patients had a single revision, with 71 patients having two or more revisions. revisions amounting to 213 were band repositions, 68 were band removal only and 153 were band removal with conversion to another bariatric procedure, mostly roux-en-y gastric bypass (n = 143). a total of 47 (35.1%) band-to-band' revision patients were lost to follow-up. patients undergoing band-to-band' revision for a slipped band, patient intolerance and mechanical band failure had mean excess weight loss (ewl) at 4 years of 49.9% (n = 35), 38.6% (n = 10) and 67.4% (n = 6), respectively. port or tubing revisions were not included. mean follow-up for band-to-band' revision patients was 33.4 months (standard deviation 26.4 months). 22.9% of patients required one or more band revision procedures by 2013, increased from 13% in 2008. conclusion: continued ewl is achieved with repositioning or replacement of a lagb. however, a significant and increasing rate of re-operation over time exists.
alzheimer's_disease	in patients with alzheimer 's disease (ad) and in a triple transgenic (3xtgad) mouse model of ad low glucose metabolism in the brain precedes loss of memory and cognitive decline. the metabolism of ketones in the brain by-passes glycolysis and therefore may correct several deficiencies that are associated with glucose hypometabolism. a dietary supplement composed of an ester of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate and r-1,3 butane diol referred to as ketone ester (ke) was incorporated into a rodent diet and fed to 3xtgad mice for 8 months. at 16.5 months of age animals were killed and brains dissected. analyses were carried out on the hippocampus and frontal cortex for glycolytic and tca (tricarboxylic acid) cycle intermediates, amino acids, oxidized lipids and proteins, and enzymes. there were higher concentrations of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate in the hippocampus of ke-fed mice where there were also higher concentrations of tca cycle and glycolytic intermediates and the energy-linked biomarker, n-acetyl aspartate compared to controls. in the hippocampi of control-fed animals the free mitochondrial [nad(+)]/[nadh] ratio were highly oxidized, whereas, in ke-fed animals the mitochondria were reduced. also, the levels of oxidized protein and lipids were lower and the energy of atp hydrolysis was greater compared to controls. 3xtgad mice maintained on a ke-supplemented diet had higher concentrations of glycolytic and tca cycle metabolites, a more reduced mitochondrial redox potential, and lower amounts of oxidized lipids and proteins in their hippocampi compared to controls. the ke offers a potential therapy to counter fundamental metabolic deficits common to patients and transgenic models.
heart_disease	purpose to propose a treatment strategy for simultaneously discovered non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) and cardiovascular disease (cvd). methods of 1302 patients who underwent surgery for nsclc, cvd requiring invasive treatment was simultaneously discovered in 33 (3 %). the details of the treatments as well as the short- and long-term outcomes of pulmonary resection were analyzed. results cvd included coronary artery disease in 20 patients, valvular disease in 6, abdominal aortic aneurysm in 5, and congenital heart disease in 2. twenty-six patients underwent two-stage treatment, while seven received simultaneous surgery. in 23 patients whose treatment for cvd preceded that for lung cancer, the median interval between those treatments was 78 days (range 18-197 days). postoperative complications occurred in 8 (31 %) of 26 patients who underwent 2-stage treatment and in 3 (43 %) of 7 who underwent simultaneous surgery. notably, of 3 patients who underwent lobectomy or bilobectomy, 2 (67 %) experienced respiratory dysfunction that required intubation. the 5-year overall survival rate of all 33 patients was 84.5 %. conclusion the outcomes of two-stage treatment in the present cohort were favorable. given our experience, simultaneous surgery for lung cancer and cvd should, therefore, be selected only for patients who may benefit from that strategy.
menopause	backgroundthe aim of the present study was to investigate whether age at menarche is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) later in life. methodsthe association between age at menarche and obesity, insulin resistance, and nafld after menopause was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 4128 postmenopausal chinese women; nafld was diagnosed by hepatic ultrasound and information regarding age at menarche was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. resultswomen with age at menarche18years. logistic regression revealed that women with earlier menarche had a higher risk for the age-adjusted prevalence of overweight/obesity, insulin resistance, and nafld, whereas later menarche showed a weaker, but still significant, association with a lower prevalence of nafld. however, further adjustment for some variables and current body mass index (bmi) or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (homa-ir) attenuated the association between later menarche and a lower prevalence of nafld. a decreasing trend in the risk of nafld was seen across increasing levels of age at menarche (age-adjusted p-trend<0.001; multivariate-adjusted p-trend<0.001; multivariate + current bmi-adjusted p-trend=0.03; multivariate + homa-ir-adjusted p-trend=0.06). conclusionage at menarche is associated with the prevalence of nafld later in life, independent of bmi and insulin resistance.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	fluoxetine (flx), a well-known antidepressant drug under the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, exerts its action by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin selectively. in some studies, it has been demonstrated that flx relaxes the intestinal smooth muscle. in this study, we aimed at studying the signal transduction pathway underlying the muscle relaxation effect of flx on electrically stimulated rat ileal muscle contraction. to investigate the possible mechanism involved, various antagonists were used. it was found that inhibition with l-n-g-nitroarginine methyl ester, ondansetron, gr113808 and bicuculline enhanced the relaxation effect of flx. however, the effect of flx was nullified under the presence of atropine, calcium channel modulator (calcium ionophore a23187), and potassium channel blockers (tetraethylammonium chloride, 4-aminopyridine and glybenclamide). specific pathway-inhibiting antagonists, y27632 (rho-kinase inhibitor) and u73122 (phospholipase-c inhibitor) reversed the antagonistic effect of flx, while ml-9 (myosin light chain kinase inhibitor) and chelerythrine (protein kinase c inhibitor) augmented the flx-induced inhibition effect. taken together, we concluded that flx exerts the inhibitory effect on electric field stimulation response in rat ileal smooth muscle by the inhibition of muscarinic receptors, decrease of intracellular calcium level by inhibiting phospholipase c and opens the potassium channels.

weight_loss	methylphenidate (mph) is a stimulant medication commonly prescribed in the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. the possible adverse effects of mph include decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, weight loss, headache, abdominal pain, anxiety and irritability. some case reports have indicated that orofacial dyskinesias could develop under mph administration. we report two cases of mph-induced orofacial dyskinesia in asian patients. the first patient took mph 10 mg once daily for one week and developed lip-smacking and lip-biting with bleeding. the second patient developed oral-buccal dyskinesia immediately after he took one 10 mg dose of mph. the purpose of this case report is to emphasize the importance of clinicians paying close attention to the risk of orofacial dyskinesia related to mph at any point in the treatment, even when patients are receiving standard doses of this agent.
headache	immune checkpoint inhibitors (icis) targeting ctla4 and pd1 constitute a promising class of cancer treatment but are associated with several immune-related disorders. we here review the literature reporting neurological adverse events (naes) associated with icis. a systematic search of literature, up to february 2016, mentioning naes in patients treated with icis was conducted. eligible studies included case reports and prospective trials. one case seen in our ward was also added. within the 59 clinical trials (totalling 9208 patients) analysed, the overall incidence of naes was 3.8% with anti-ctla4 antibodies, 6.1% with anti-pd1 antibodies, and 12.0% with the combination of both. the clinical spectrum of neurological disorders was highly heterogeneous. most of these naes were grade 1-2 and consisted of non-specific symptoms such as headache (55%). the incidence of high grade naes was below 1% for all types of treatment. headaches, encephalopathies and meningitis were the most commonly reported (21%, 19% and 15%, respectively). among the 27 case reports, the most common naes were encephalopathies, meningoradiculoneuritis, guillain-barre like syndromes and myasthenic syndromes. the median time of naes onset was 6 weeks. in most cases, drug interruption and steroids led to neurological recovery, even in conditions where steroids are not usually recommended such as guillain-barre syndrome.

skin_care	background: nasal continuous positive airway pressure (ncpap) is an effective method of ventilation in newborns with respiratory distress syndrome (rds). using an appropriate nasal skin care protocol is identical to prevention or reduction of nasal skin breakdown in those who receive ncpap. this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an evidence-based clinical care protocol on nasal skin integrity in preterm newborns who receive ncpap. materials and methods: a randomized controlled trial was used to conduct the study. a cohort of 110 preterm newborns with a gestational age (ga) of 25 to 36 weeks, receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (ncpap) for rds in the neonatal intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital were selected to perform the study. they were randomly assigned to a protocolized nasal skin care (group a) or to a group receiving the routine care (group b). nasal skin integrity of the preterm neonates, were measured on a daily basis for 10 days using the neonatal skin condition scale (nscs) 24 hours after placement of ncpaps in both groups. results: each intervention and control group included 55 neonates. 65.50% of neonates in the control group and 47.30% of neonates in the intervention group were male. repeated measures analysis showed that nscs scores were significantly lower in intervention group receiving nasal skin care in accordance with the protocol than the control group receiving the routine nasal skin care (p= 0.000). conclusion: in this study, the protocolized care reduced nasal skin breakdown in the preterm newborns receiving ncpap. therefore, it can be used as an effective method in nasal skin care in neonates who are treated by ncpap.
multiple_sclerosis	objective: two disease-modifying therapies are licensed in the eu for use in rapidly-evolving severe (res) relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms), fingolimod and natalizumab. here a discrete event simulation (des) model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of natalizumab and fingolimod in the res population, from the perspective of the national health service (nhs) in the uk, is reported. methods: a des model was developed to track individual res patients, based on expanded disability status scale scores. individual patient characteristics were taken from the res sub-groups of the pivotal trials for fingolimod. utility data were in line with previous models. published costs were inflated to nhs cost year 2015. owing to the confidential patient access scheme (pas) discount applied to fingolimod in the uk, a range of discount levels were applied to the fingolimod list price, to capture the likelihood of natalizumab being cost-effective in a real-world setting. results: at the lower national institute of health and care excellence (nice) threshold of 20,000/quality-adjusted life year (qaly), fingolimod only required a discount greater than 0.8% of list price to be cost-effective. at the upper threshold of 30,000 pound/qaly employed by the nice, fingolimod was cost-effective if the confidential discount is greater than 2.5%. sensitivity analyses conducted using fingolimod list-price showed the model to be most sensitive to changes in the cost of each drug, particularly fingolimod. conclusions: the des model shows that only a modest discount to the uk fingolimod list-price is required to make fingolimod a more cost-effective option than natalizumab in res rrms.
skin_care	ulvans from ulva sp. were tested for their potential cosmetic properties on human dermal fibroblasts. the crude ulvans (ulvan-01, 57 kda), extracted using a patented acid- and solvent-free process, were subjected to depolymerization using ion exchange resin to obtain a low molecular weight ulvan (ulvan-dep, 4 kda). the biochemical characterization and uhplc-hrms analyses of these extracted ulvans showed that they were of high purity and predominantly composed of a repeated ulvanobiouronic acid disaccharide. fibroblast proliferation, as well as hyaluronan and collagen release were assessed, demonstrating that ulvan-01 reduced fibroblast proliferation rate while ulvan-dep had no significant effect. both ulvans were ineffective to induce collagen production but induced a significant increase in hyaluronan production, with a strong influence of the molecular weight. thus, crude and depolymerized ulvans had different metabolic activities on dermal fibroblasts, which makes them promising to envisage further development in the skin care field.

weight_loss	'satiation' and 'satiety' are key terms that have come to be widely used to help understand processes involved in appetite control. satiation is considered to be the signals or processes that bring a meal to an end, whereas satiety is the signals or processes, following the end of a meal, that inhibit eating before hunger returns. protein is the most effective food macronutrient providing a satiating effect. thus, formulating foods with increased protein contents can help to modulate food intake, promoting body weight loss and body weight maintenance thereafter. mechanisms explaining protein-induced satiety are primarily nutrient-specific, but they are of course not mathematically related to satiety. different proteins cause different nutrient-related responses of anorexigenic hormones. glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) release evoked by a high protein meal is stimulated by the carbohydrate content. also, cholecystokinin (cck) and peptide yy (pyy) release is stimulated by a high-protein meal. sensory, cognitive, post-ingestive and post-absorptive signals will determine jointly the feeling of satiation and satiety. oral perception cues also contribute increased expectations of satiating capacity when the oral residence time and in-mouth handling are longer and more laborious. in the present review, the authors want to obtain an overview of the satiating ability of dietary protein and its role in satiation and satiety. this could be really significant in showing the food industry the path for developing protein-rich satiating foods in response to consumer demand.

heart_disease	this prospective single-center observational study compared impedance cardiography [electrical velocimetry (ev)] with transthoracic echocardiography (tte, based on trans-aortic flow) and analyzed the influence of physiological shunts, such as patent ductus arteriosus (pda) or patent foramen ovale (pfo), on measurement accuracy. two hundred and ninety-one triplicate simultaneous paired left ventricular stroke volume (lvsv) measurements by ev (lvsvev) and tte (lvsvtte) in 99 spontaneously breathing neonates (mean weight 3270 g; range 1227-4600 g) were included. for the whole cohort, the mean absolute lvsvev was 5.5 ml, mean lvsvtte was 4.9 ml, resulting in an absolute bland-altman bias of -0.7 ml (limits of agreement loa -3.0 to 1.7 ml), relative bias -12.8 %; mean percentage error mpe 44.9 %; true precision tpev 33.4 % (n = 99 aggregated data points). in neonates without shunts (n = 32): mean lvsvev 5.0 ml, mean lvsvtte 4.6 ml, bland-altman bias -0.4 ml (loa -2.8 to 2.0 ml), relative bias -8.2 %; mpe 50.7 %; tpev 40.9 %. in neonates with shunts (pda and/or pfo; n = 67): mean lvsvev 5.8 ml, mean lvsvtte 5.0 ml, bias -0.8 ml (loa -3.1 to 1.5 ml), relative bias -14.8 %, mpe 41.9 %, tpev 29.3 %. accuracy was affected by pda and/or pfo, with a significant increase in the relative difference in lvsvev versus lvsvtte: subjects without shunts -2.9 % (n = 91), pfo alone -9.6 % (n = 125), pda alone -14.0 % (n = 12), and pda and pfo -18.5 % (n = 63). physiological shunts (pda and/or pfo) in neonates affect measurement accuracy and cause overestimation of lvsvev compared with lvsvtte.
diabetes	backgroundmobile applications (apps) could support diabetes management through dietary, weight and blood glucose self-monitoring, as well as by promoting behaviour change. the present study aimed to evaluate diabetes apps for content, functions and behaviour change techniques (bcts). methodsdiabetes self-management apps for android smartphones were searched for on the google play store. ten apps each from the following search terms were included; diabetes', diabetes type 1', diabetes type 2', gestational diabetes'. apps were evaluated by being scored according to their number of functions and bcts, price, and user rating. resultsthe mean (sd) number of functions was 8.9 (5.9) out of a possible maximum of 27. furthermore, the mean (sd) number of bcts was 4.4 (2.6) out of a possible maximum of 26. apps with optimum bct had significantly more functions [13.8; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 11.9-15.9] than apps that did not (4.7; 95% ci = 3.2-6.2; p < 0.01) and significantly more bcts (5.8; 95% ci = 4.8-7.0) than apps without (3.1; 95% ci = 2.2-4.1; p < 0.01). additionally, apps with optimum bct also cost more than other apps. in the adjusted models, highly rated apps had an average of 4.8 (95% ci = 0.9-8.7; p = 0.02) more functions than lower rated apps. conclusionsdiabetes apps' include few functions or bcts compared to the maximum score possible. apps with optimum bcts could indicate higher quality. app developers should consider including both specific functions and bcts in diabetes apps' to make them more helpful. more research is needed to understand the components of an effective app for people with diabetes.
diabetes	during the last few decades, there has been a tremendous rise in the number of research studies dedicated towards the development of diagnostic tools based on bio-sensing technology for the early detection of various diseases like cardiovascular diseases (cvd), many types of cancer, diabetes mellitus (dm) and many infectious diseases. many breakthroughs have been developed in the areas of improving specificity, selectivity and repeatability of the biosensor devices. innovations in the interdisciplinary areas like biotechnology, genetics, organic electronics and nanotechnology also had a great positive impact on the growth of bio-sensing technology. as a product of these improvements, fast and consistent sensing policies have been productively created for precise and ultrasensitive biomarker-based disease diagnostics. prostate-specific antigen (psa) is widely considered as an important biomarker used for diagnosing prostate cancer. there have been many publications based on various biosensors used for psa detection, but a limited review was available for the classification of these biosensors used for the detection of psa. this review highlights the various biosensors used for psa detection and proposes a novel classification for psa biosensors based on the transducer type used. we also highlight the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of each technique used for psa biosensing which will make this article a complete reference tool for the future researches in psa biosensing.
hepatitis_c	background: chronic hcv patients taking peg-ifn-alpha/r from different ethnic groups have different probabilities of reaching a sustained viral response (svr). there are many influence factors, such as hcv genotype, il-28b single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snp), fibrosis 4 index (fib-4), and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (apri) score. but the baseline factors in relation to treatment outcome was still not much clear. methods: we evaluated data from 231 chronic hcv patients with or without liver fibrosis and their antiviral efficacy after treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (peg-ifn-alpha/r) for 24-48 weeks. il-28b snp and hcv genotypes were analyzed with genome sequencing using pyrosequencing. results: sustained viral response (svr) rates of patients with hcv 1b and 2a genotypes were 52.25% (58/111) and 75.28% (67/89) (p3.25. in addition, when their apri >2, only 30.3% of hcv 1b patients and 50.2% of hcv 2a patients could obtain svr. conclusions: there were high proportion of hcv genotype 1b and 2a in northwest china. in both hcv 1b and 2a genotypes, patients with protective-genotype of il-28b were more likely to obtain svr. however, those with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis were less likely, no matter their genotype. combined factors of hcv genotype, il-28b genotype, fib-4 and arpi may indicate high prediction and clinical value regarding treatment with peg-ifn-alpha/r and prognostic evaluation of chronic hepatitis c patients.
weight_loss	purpose to evaluate the effect of bariatric arterial embolization (bae) with non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol (pva) particles on systemic ghrelin levels, weight change, and gastric ulceration risk in a swine model. materials and methods from march 2014 to february 2015, ten healthy swine were used in the study (mean weight 31.5 kg; range 24.0-41.5 kg). the animals were randomly assigned to two groups: the embolized group (n = 5) in which bae was performed and the control group (n = 5). in the embolized group, bae was performed by selectively infusing 150-250 or 50-150 mu m pva into the gastric arteries that supplied the fundus of the stomach. in the control group, a sham procedure was performed with saline infusion. plasma ghrelin levels were prospectively obtained at baseline and every 2 weeks thereafter. endoscopy was performed 3 weeks after bae to see whether any gastric ulcer occurred. to determine the durability of the occluded arteries, repeated celiac trunk angiography was performed 8 weeks after bae. then, all the swine were killed and necropsies were performed. results the mean post-procedure ghrelin value decreased by 370.0 pg/ml in the embolized group at week 3 (mean 536.0 +/- 334.3 pg/ml) and week 5 (mean 515.0 +/- 150.0 pg/ml, p < 0.05) relative to baseline (880.0 +/- 559.5 pg/ml), respectively, but ghrelin levels were not significantly decreased between the embolized and control groups. there was a significant body weight change as follows: 35.1 +/- 9.5 to 46.6 +/- 15.7 kg and 31.8 +/- 5.8 to 41.2 +/- 6.6 kg at baseline and endpoint in the control and embolized groups, respectively (p < 0.05). however, the difference between groups was not significant at endpoint. in the embolized group, ulcerations were identified in three animals (60%) and the recanalization of the embolized arteries was noted on follow-up angiography in three animals (60%), respectively. conclusion bae with pva particles can transiently suppress ghrelin levels in embolized animals, but levels are not significantly different compared to controls. stomach ulcerations were identified in 60% of the embolized animals.
diabetes	aimprolonged qt interval is related to changes of electrolytes in haemodialysis (hd) and is associated with all-cause mortality in hd patients. it is unknown if prolonged qt interval is associated with all-cause mortality in peritoneal dialysis (pd) patients as the electrolytes were relatively stable in pd. we therefore investigated the association of prolonged qt interval and all-cause mortality in chronic pd patients. methodsthe qt intervals were measured in 2003 and all patients were followed to december 2012. a prolonged qt interval was defined as a qt interval>450ms. the association of prolonged qt interval with all-cause and cardiac-specific mortality was analyzed using cox regression and kaplan-meier analysis. resultsof 306 patients, 196 (64%) patients had prolonged qt interval. the incidence density rate was 9.7 per 100 persons-years for all-cause mortality and 5.6 for cardiac specific mortality in patients with prolonged qt interval. prolonged qt interval was associated with all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio (hr) of 1.59 (95% confidence interval (ci): 1.06-2.39, p=0.03] and cardiac mortality (hr: 1.66, 95% ci: 1.00-2.78, p=0.05) with adjustments for age, gender, diabetes, and vintage of dialysis. longer qt interval (>500ms, 450-500ms, and<450ms) was significantly associated with a worse overall survival (p=0.03, log-rank test) and cardiac mortality free survival (p=0.05, log-rank test). conclusionsprolonged qt interval was associated with all-cause and cardiac mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis. the association is independent of patient 's age and diabetes.
multiple_sclerosis	t-cell migration across the blood-brain barrier (bbb) is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), an animal model of multiple scle rosis (ms). two-photon intravital microscopy (2p-ivm) has been established as a powerful tool to study cell-cell interactions in inflammatory eae lesions in living animals. in eae, central nervous system inflammation is strongly pronounced in the spinal cord, an organ in which 2p-ivm imaging is technically very challenging and has been limited to the lumbar spinal cord. here, we describe a novel spinal cord window preparation allowing to use 2p-ivm to image immune cell interactions with the cervical spinal cord microvascular endothelium during eae. we describe differences in the angioarchitecture of the cervical spinal cord versus the lumbar spinal cord, which will entail different hemodynamic parameters in these different vascular beds. using t cells as an example, we demonstrate the suitability of this novel methodology in imaging the post-arrest multistep t-cell extravasation across the cervical spinal cord microvessels. the novel methodology includes an outlook to the analysis of the cellular pathway of t-cell diapedesis across the bbb by establishing visualization of endothelial junctions in this vascular bed.
sprains_and_strains	the oxford-family planning association contraceptive study includes 17,032 women, initially aged 25-39 years, recruited at 17 british family planning centers during the interval 1968-1974 and subsequently followed-up for periods up to 26 years. this article examines the pattern of referral to hospital for back disorders among these women. certain back disorders have been reported to occur more frequently in oral contraceptive users than in other women, and back pain has also been reported in some women consequent to using an intrauterine device. the disorders considered were spinal osteoarthritis, displaced cervical disc, displaced lumbar disc, other and unspecified displaced disc, cervicalgia, unspecified back pain, and sprains and strains of the back. spinal osteoarthritis and unspecified backache were the only two conditions significantly related (both positively) to age. displaced lumbar disc and other and unspecified displaced disc were strongly positively related to height and weight. unspecified backache showed similar, but less striking (in terms of the magnitude of the relative risks), associations with height and weight. little evidence was found of any association between oral contraceptive use and any of the back disorders, and the same was true for intrauterine device use contraception 2000;60:331-335 (c) 2000 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.
polycythemia_vera	thrombocytosis (defined as platelets >450 x 10(9)/l) has several aetiologies. after having excluded spurious thrombocytosis (e.g., due to microspherocytes, schistocytes, cryoglobulins, or bacteria), the differential diagnosis of true thrombocytosis encompasses secondary causes (as diverse as inflammation, infection, malignancy, iron deficiency, or asplenia), primary hereditary (rare forms of familial thrombocytosis) and primary acquired entities (either in the context of a myelodysplastic syndrome or more frequently a myeloproliferative neoplasia). this manuscript addresses the following aspects: 1) diagnostic approach to thrombocytosis; 2) various mechanisms leading to a high platelet count; 3) potential of some of these mechanisms to modulate platelet function, producing hyperreactive platelets and thus exerting a direct impact on the thrombotic risk; 4) indication of anti-thrombotic treatment in patients with thrombocytosis. there is a single prospective randomized clinical trial showing the benefit of acetyl-salicylic acid in polycythaemia vera. for other types of primary thrombocytosis and for secondary forms, treatment decisions have to be individualized according to the patient thrombotic and bleeding risks, taking into account the mechanism causing thrombocytosis. this manuscript discusses experimental and clinical data suggesting that besides patients with essential thrombocythaemia and other forms of primary thrombocytosis also those with thrombocytosis in the context of chronic inflammation, malignancy, or exposure to high altitude might benefit from anti-platelet treatment.
allergies	background: ocular allergy is a growing public health problem that greatly impacts the day-to-day life of sufferers and their families. other aspects of their activities of daily living such as schooling, professional, and social life are affected hence an increased awareness and knowledge of ocular allergies, their detection and treatment is paramount. this study was to assess the level of knowledge and awareness of ocular allergy among undergraduate students of public universities in ghana. methods: a descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted among 1000 students from three selected public universities in ghana. each respondent completed a questionnaire that had questions concerning awareness and knowledge of ocular allergy. results: out of the 1000 students, 347 (34.7 %) were aware of ocular allergy. of these 347 students, the level of knowledge of ocular allergy was generally low. majority of the students had their source of information about ocular allergy from the media and the internet. there was statistical significant association among awareness of ocular allergy, sources of information and programme of study (p < 0.001). conclusion: level of awareness among university students is generally low. students' programmes of study influenced their knowledge of ocular allergy. public health measures are recommended to help educate students on the prevention and control of ocular allergy as well as the complications associated with this condition.
birth_control	purpose: mutations in the brca1/2 genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. recent studies have suggested that the brca mutation might be associated with occult primary ovarian insufficiency. to evaluate fertility, several studies have validated anti-mullerian hormone (amh) as a direct biomarker for ovarian aging and it is considered a quantitative marker of ovarian reserve. we hypothesize that brca1 gene mutations will be negatively associated with amh levels. methods: we evaluated 124 women aged 18-45 years participating in the northwestern ovarian cancer early detection and prevention program. patients with a history of cancer, ovarian surgery, or exposure to chemotherapy were excluded. linear and logistic regression modeling were performed to evaluate the association between amh levels, age, and brca1 mutation. in logistic models, the outcome low amh' was defined as amh35 years had 10 times the odds of a low amh (35, brca1 was still strongly associated with a low amh (p=0.037). conclusion: women >35 with the brca1 mutation have a lower amh, and hence ovarian reserve, than women without a brca mutation. therefore, young adults with the brca1 mutation should be counseled regarding this potential decrease in ovarian reserve.
hypothyroidism	thyroid hormones are vital in the control of multiple body functions, including the correct performance of the brain. multiple diseases are associated with thyroid gland functioning, including hypothyroidism. to date, little is known regarding the effects of the establishment of this condition at a young age on brain function. here, we evaluated the effect of hypothyroidism in an early postnatal stage in cognitive abilities with focus on the hippocampus. in our model, hypothyroidism was induced in young rats at 21 days of age using 0.05% 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (ptu) for 4 weeks reaching significantly lower levels of ft(4) (control: 1.337 ng/dl +/- 0.115, ptu: 0.050 ng/dl +/- 0.001). following the induction of hypothyroidism, several cognitive tasks were assessed to investigate the effects of hypothyroidism on cognition performance. we determined that hypothyroidism triggers a significant dysfunction in learning and memory processes observed in the morris water maze were the latency times were higher in ptu rats (controls: 37 s; ptu: 57 s). the cognitive impairment was correlated with a reduction in hippocampal plasticity with respect to both long-term potentiation (ltp) (control: 1.45, ptu: 1.00) and depression (ltd) (control: 0.71, ptu: 1.01). furthermore, a decrease in the rate of glucose utilization (control: 223 nmol * mg of protein, ptu:148 nmol * mg of protein) was observed, along with an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in map2 marker in the hippocampus. our findings suggest that the induction of hypothyroidism in a young rat model alters numerous functions at the level of the hippocampus.

senior_health	background. almost 10 years ago senior united kingdom nurses met at heathrow airport to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing nursing. one aspect of this 'heathrow debate' was to encourage nurses to work closer with members of the public. the resulting report stated that nurses have not been effective in working outside their professional area and, in particular, they have not been adept at working in partnership with the public. aim. the aim of this paper is to report a study to obtain the views of general practitioners (gps), community nurses and members of the public on how the public perceive community nursing. a further aim was to explore the perceptions of senior health care managers and policymakers about public involvement in primary care. methods. a two-stage delphi investigation was undertaken with community nurses (n = 38), gps (n = 14) and members of the public (n = 8). in addition, one-to-one interviews were carried out with 34 senior health service managers and policymakers. findings. there was agreement on the following issues: community nurses must work more closely with members of the public; there is a lack of public understanding on the roles of community nurses and specialist nurses; there is public support for nurse prescribing; there is a preference for seeing the community nurse as opposed to the gp; and people prefer one nurse to care for them rather than a variety of nurses. comments from managers and senior policymakers showed agreement on the public being involved in primary care, but an acknowledgement that this was problematic. a number of recommendations are outlined.
menopause	the need for simple self-assessment tools is necessary to predict women at high risk for developing osteoporosis. in this study, tools like the iof one minute test, fracture risk assessment tool (frax), and simple calculated osteoporosis risk estimation (score) were found to be valid for palestinian women. the threshold for predicting women at risk for each tool was estimated. purpose the purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity of the updated iof (international osteoporosis foundation) one minute osteoporosis risk assessment test, frax, score as well as age alone to detect the risk of developing osteoporosis in postmenopausal palestinian women. methods three hundred eighty-two women 45 years and older were recruited including 131 women with osteoporosis and 251 controls following bone mineral density (bmd) measurement, 287 completed questionnaires of the different risk assessment tools. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were evaluated for each tool using bone bmd as the gold standard for osteoporosis. results the area under the roc curve (auc) was the highest for frax calculated with bmd for predicting hip fractures (0.897) followed by frax for major fractures (0.826) with cut-off values 1.5 and 7.8%, respectively. the iof one minute test auc (0.629) was the lowest compared to other tested tools but with sufficient accuracy for predicting the risk of developing osteoporosis with a cut-off value 4 total yes questions out of 18. score test and age alone were also as good predictors of risk for developing osteoporosis. according to the roc curve for age, women >= 64 years had a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. higher percentage of women with low bmd (t-score <=-1.5) or osteoporosis (tscore <=-2.5) was found among women who were not exposed to the sun, who had menopause before the age of 45 years, or had lower body mass index (bmi) compared to controls. women who often fall had lower bmi and approximately 27% of the recruited postmenopausal palestinian women had accidents that caused fractures. conclusions simple self-assessment tools like frax without bmd, score, and the iof one minute tests were valid for predicting palestinian postmenopausal women at high risk of developing osteoporosis.
heart_disease	il1rl1 (also known as st2) is a member of the il-1 superfamily, and its only known ligand is il-33. st2 exists in two forms as splice variants: a soluble form (sst2), which acts as a decoy receptor, sequesters free il-33, and does not signal, and a membrane-bound form (st2), which activates the myd88/nf-kappa b signaling pathway to enhance mast cell, th2, regulatory t cell (treg), and innate lymphoid cell type 2 functions. sst2 levels are increased in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, acute cardiac and small bowel transplant allograft rejection, colon and gastric cancers, gut mucosal damage during viral infection, pulmonary disease, heart disease, and graft-versus-host disease. recently, sst2 has been shown to be secreted by intestinal pro-inflammatory t cells during gut inflammation; on the contrary, protective st2-expressing tregs are decreased, implicating that st2/il-33 signaling may play an important role in intestinal disease. this review will focus on what is known on its signaling during various inflammatory disease states and highlight potential avenues to intervene in st2/il-33 signaling as treatment options.
parkinson's_disease	questions: for people with idiopathic parkinson 's disease, does a 6-week, comprehensive, home exercise program reduce falls and disability and improve health-related quality of life? is the program cost-effective? design: randomised, controlled trial with concealed allocation and assessor blinding. participants: one hundred and thirty-three community-dwelling adults with parkinson 's disease. intervention: the experimental group completed a 6-week home program comprising progressive resistance strength training, movement strategy training and falls education. the control group completed 6 weeks of non-specific life skills training. participants in both groups received weekly therapist-guided sessions for 6 consecutive weeks and a weekly self-directed home program. outcome measures: the primary outcome was the rate of falls, documented for the 12-month period immediately after therapy. secondary outcomes were disability and health-related quality of life, assessed before and after intervention and at a 12-month follow-up. results: a total of 2255 falls were reported by the 12-month follow-up. the proportion of fallers in the experimental and control groups was 61 and 72%, respectively, which was not statistically significantly different (rr = 0.85, 95% ci 0.66 to 1.09). there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of falls (incidence rate ratio = 1.58, 95% ci 0.73 to 3.43). a survival analysis of participant time to first fall did not show a significant between-group difference (log-rank test x(2) = 0.79, p = 0.37). no significant between-group differences occurred for mobility, disability or quality of life. the mean cost of delivering the experimental intervention was aud1596. conclusion: a home program of strength and movement strategy training and falls education does not prevent falls when applied at the dose used in this study. arguably, the dosage of therapy was insufficient. future trials need to explore further therapy content, repetitions and duration, in order to optimise outcomes and cost-effectiveness. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of australian physiotherapy association.
myelofibrosis	background: mutations in janus kinase 2 (jak2), myeloproliferative leukemia (mpl), and calr are highly relevant to philadelphia chromosome (ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. methods: assessing the prevalence of molecular mutations in chinese han patients with essential thrombocythemia (et), and correlating their mutational profile with disease characteristics/phenotype. results: of the 110 subjects studied, 62 carried the jak2 v617f mutation, 21 had calr mutations, one carried an mpl (w515) mutation, and 28 had non-mutated jak2, calr, and mpl (so-called triple-negative et). mutations in jak2 exon 12 were not detected in any patient. two et patients had both calr and jak2 v617f mutations. comparing the hematological parameters of the patients with jak2 mutations with those of the patients with calr mutations showed that the et patients with calr mutations were younger (p = 0.045) and had higher platelet counts (p = 0.043). conclusion: genotyping for calr could be a useful diagnostic tool for jak2/mpl-negative et, since the data suggest that calr is much more prevalent than mpl, therefore testing for calr should be considered in patients who are jak2 negative as its frequency is almost 20 times that of mpl mutation.
parkinson's_disease	123i-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy (mibg) is a useful imaging technique for the diagnosis of dementia with lewy bodies (dlb). however, mibg has a serious disadvantage in that it demands a long examination time. the objective of this study was to evaluate statistically the usefulness of the heart/ mediastinum ratio (h/m) from the early phase of mibg for the differential diagnosis of dlb. in total, 113 patients were examined, including 32 non-dlb (19 with alzheimer 's dementia) and 79 dlb patients. the mean early-h/m ratio was 2.83 in the non-dlb group and 1.95 in the dlb group. the mean delayed-h/m ratio was 3.0 in the non-dlb group and 1.76 in the dlb group. with a cutoff point of 2.27 on early images, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 65%, 94%, and 73%, respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.82, indicating moderate accuracy. this analysis indicates that images from the early phase of mibg alone are sufficient for the differential diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease and dlb.
heart_disease	background: estimating the burden of non-communicable diseases particularly cardiovascular disease (cvd) is essential for health management and policymaking. in this paper, we used a regression model to estimate the future impact of demographic changes on the burden of cvd in iran during the next two decades. methods: disability-adjusted life years (daly) were used to estimate the future burden of cvd in iran. a regression model was used to estimate daly caused by cvd in the iranian population aged 30-100 yr, stratified by age group and sex. the predicted population of iranians aged >= 30 yr was entered into the model and daly were calculated over 2005-2025. to assess the areas of uncertainty in the model, we did sensitivity analysis and monte carlo simulation. results: in the year 2005, there were 847309 dalys caused by cvd in iranian adults aged >= 30 yr. this figure will nearly be 1728836 dalys in 2025. in other words, just because of the aging, daly related to cvd will increase more than two-fold in 2025 compared with 2005. the burden of cvd was higher in men (443235) than in women (404235) in 2005; but in 2025, the difference will be less (867639 vs. 861319). conclusion: the burden of cvd will increase steeply in iran over 2005-2025, mainly because of the aging population. therefore, more attention is needed to deal with the impact of cvd in the following decades in iran.
emergency_contraception	background: emergency contraception ( ec) is widely accepted as a safe method of preventing conception following unprotected coitus. use of ec has been promoted in south africa, yet uptake among women appears to remain low. aim: the aim of this study was to access knowledge and use of ec among women presenting for termination of pregnancy at a district hospital in kwazulu-natal. methods: this was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. data were collected from women attending a termination of pregnancy ( top) service at a district hospital using a questionnaire and analysed descriptively. results: a total of 218 women participated, of whom 25% were under 20 years of age and 87% were single. reported knowledge of ec was good with 70% of participants indicating that they knew about ec. however, knowledge around ec was not complete, with less than 50% knowing the time interval between intercourse and ec action and some believing that ec acted by inducing an abortion. reported usage of ec was only 40%. conclusion: this study revealed that there is much more to be done to enhance knowledge and use of ec in this context. reasons for the discrepancy between knowledge and usage need further exploration.
fungal_infection	the present study was conducted to investigate the comparative parasitic ability of root-knot nematode (rkn: meloidogyne graminicola) in putatively resistant (suraksha) and susceptible (pusa 1121) cultivars of rice and to analyse the relative expression level of plant defence genes upon rkn infection in these cultivars. qrt-pcr analyses of rkn infected roots and their corresponding shoots indicated that phytohormone-mediated host defences were activated during early infection in both susceptible and resistant plants, whereas it was apparently suppressed during later stage of infection in susceptible plants. expression of defence genes in the shoot tissues of resistant plants suggested the successful induction of systemic acquired resistance. in parallel, lignin- and callose-mediated plant basal defence was activated in suraksha. information generated on the rkn-induced expression of defence genes in different rice varieties can be exploited to improve resistance in cultivated species of rice to rkn infection.
cancer	to determine the sensitivity and specificity of hpv16 serology as diagnostic marker for hpv16-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (opscc), 214 hnscc patients from germany and italy with fresh-frozen tumor tissues and sera collected before treatment were included in this study. hundred and twenty cancer cases were from the oropharynx and 94 were from head and neck cancer regions outside the oropharynx (45 oral cavity, 12 hypopharynx and 35 larynx). serum antibodies to early (e1, e2, e6 and e7) and late (l1) hpv16 proteins were analyzed by multiplex serology and were compared to tumor hpv rna status as the gold standard. a tumor was defined as hpv-driven in the presence of hpv16 dna and hpv16 transformation-specific rna transcript patterns (e6*i, e1e4 and e1c). of 120 opscc, 66 (55%) were hpv16-driven. hpv16 e6 seropositivity was the best predictor of hpv16-driven opscc (diagnostic accuracy 97% [95%ci 92-99%], cohen 's kappa 0.93 [95%ci 0.8-1.0]). of the 66 hpv-driven opscc, 63 were hpv16 e6 seropositive, compared to only one (1.8%) among the 54 non-hpv-driven opscc, resulting in a sensitivity of 96% (95%ci 88-98) and a specificity of 98% (95%ci 90-100). of 94 hnscc outside the oropharynx, six (6%) were hpv16-driven. in these patients, hpv16 e6 seropositivity had lower sensitivity (50%, 95%ci 19-81), but was highly specific (100%, 95%ci 96-100). in conclusion, hpv16 e6 seropositivity appears to be a highly reliable diagnostic marker for hpv16-driven opscc with very high sensitivity and specificity, but might be less sensitive for hpv16-driven hnscc outside the oropharynx. what 's new? human papillomavirus (hpv) infection is associated with a subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (opscc). hpv-driven opscc patients have an improved survival, but a reliable marker that is applicable in clinical operations is still needed. here, the authors analyzed hpv16 antibody levels to the oncoproteins e6 and e7 and to the regulatory proteins e1 and e2 in the serum of patients with molecularly-defined tumor hpv status. hpv16 serology could identify hpv-driven opscc patients with very high sensitivity [96% (95%ci 88-98)] and specificity [98% (95%ci 90-100)]. hpv16 serology may thus represent a powerful and accurate diagnostic marker for hpv-driven opscc.
emergency_contraception	this review gives an overview of the mechanisms of action of oral emergency contraception pills (ecps), focusing on the levonorgestrel (lng) and ulipristal acetate (upa) containing ecps. in vivo and in vitro studies have addressed the effect of ec on various possible targets. based on these studies as well as on clinical trials it is clear that the efficacy of ecps to prevent an unintended pregnancy depends on their mechanism of action as well as on their use in relation to the fertile window. while the main effect of both available ecps is to prevent or delay ovulation the window of action for upa is wider than that of lng. this provides the biological explanation for the difference observed in clinical trials and the higher efficacy of upa. neither lng nor upa impairs endometrial receptivity or embryo implantation. correct knowledge on the mechanism of action of ecps is important to avoid overestimating their effectiveness and to advise women on correct use.
parkinson's_disease	a growing number of reports have demonstrated that the widely-used herbicide atrazine (atr) can cause injury to dopamine (da) neurons, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. in this study, we examined the effects of lactational atr exposure in sprague-dawley rats on dopaminergic neuron health later in life. compared with control rats, rats exposed to atr during a critical period of neural development showed decreased striatal da content and increased rates of da turnover. the expression of monoamine oxidase (mao), which is associated with da degradation, was up-regulated, and the expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (vmat2), which is associated with da transport, was down-regulated. the expression of transcription factor nuclear receptor related factor 1 (nurr1), which is associated with da neuron development, was down-regulated. increased age (6-12 months old) increased the statistical significance of the differences of the above indicators in the atr-treated rats compared to the control rats (p < 0.05). taken together, our results indicate that atr exposure during the critical neural development period causes a down-regulation of nurr1, which in turn affects nurr1 target genes, including mao, vmat2 and dat, which are involved in da degradation and transport. reduced expression of these genes impairs the capacity for vesicular storage or reuptake of da, causing decreased levels of striatal da, which can ultimately lead to da neuron injury. da neuron injuries become more severe over time, which suggests that aging can synergistically promote the atr-associated da neuron injuries.

alzheimer's_disease	in alzheimer 's disease, the microtubule-associated protein tau forms intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (nfts). a critical step in the formation of nfts is the conversion of soluble tau into insoluble filaments. accordingly, a current therapeutic strategy in clinical trials is aimed at preventing tau aggregation. here, we assessed altenusin, a bioactive polyphenolic compound, for its potential to inhibit tau aggregation. altenusin inhibits aggregation of tau protein into paired helical filaments in vitro. this was associated with stabilization of, tau dimers and other oligomers into globular structures as revealed by atomic force microscopy. moreover, altenusin reduced tau phosphorylation in cells expressing pathogenic tau, and prevented neuritic tau pathology induced by incubation of primary neurons with tau fibrils. however, treatment of tau transgenic mice did not improve neuropathology and functional deficits. taken together, altenusin prevents tau fibrillization in vitro and induced tau pathology in neurons.
menopause	alzheimer 's disease, cerebrovascular disease and aging-related cognitive impairment and dementia (arcid) increase in prevalence in women with advancing age. the development of alzheimer 's disease, cerebrovascular disease and arcid may be postponed or prevented by protective measures including the active treatment of vascular risk factors and continuing exercise and healthy lifestyle from early-and mid-life onward. bilateral oophorectomy before the natural menopause is associated with an increased incidence of arcid and the increased risk is significantly reduced by estrogen therapy. recent advances in menopause hormone therapy including transdermal estrogen therapy have favorably influenced the balance of benefits and risks. a case can be made for menopause hormone therapy in healthy postmenopausal women for 5-10 years starting during the menopausal transition (the `window of opportunity'), together with all other protective measures, to delay or prevent the development of arcid in later life.
myelofibrosis	an improved route for the synthesis of momelotinib has been developed. a nucleophilic addition reaction between the starting material, 4-morpholinoaniline, and cyanamide gave the 1-(4-morpholinophenyl) guanidine. simultaneously, methyl 4-acetylbenzoate was converted into methyl (e)-4-[3-(dimethylamino) acryloyl] benzoate in the presence of n, n-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal. the enaminone intermediate was then condensed at elevated temperature in alcoholic alkali with the 1-(morpholinophenyl) guanidine to form the desired pyrimidine, which was hydrolysed to the corresponding acid. this procedure is simple in operation, without noble metal catalyst and suitable for industrial production. finally, the desired compound momelotinib was acquired by an amidation reaction.
hepatitis_c	mortality rates on the liver transplant waiting list are increasing. the shortage of organs has resulted in higher utilization of extended criteria donors (ecds), with centers pushing the limits of what is acceptable for transplantation. donor quality is more appropriately represented as a continuum of risk, and careful selection and matching of ecd grafts with recipients may lead to excellent outcomes. although there is no precise definition for what constitutes an ecd liver, this review focuses on frequently cited characteristics, including donor age, steatosis, donation after cardiac death, and donors with increased risk of disease transmission.
hypothyroidism	background: hypothyroidism is referred to be a rare but possible cause of hyponatremia. however, there is only poor evidence supporting this association. since hyponatremia and hypothyroidism are both common conditions themselves, co-occurrence does not have to be causal. methods: to address a potential relationship, a retrospective analysis of data from the division of endocrinology of the medical university of vienna from april 2004 to february 2016 was performed. a total of 8053 hypothyroid patients (48 +/- 18 years of age; 71% female) with thyrotropin >4.0 mu iu/ml and available blood tests for free thyroxine and sodium (na+) within maximal +/- seven days were included and screened for hyponatremia. patients' records were searched for concomitant disease and medication when na+ concentration was <135 mmol/l. results: hyponatremia was present in 448/8053 (5.56%) patients. analysis of medical history revealed potential alternative causes of hyponatremia in 442/448 (98.88%) patients (i.e., side effects of medication, concomitant underlying disease, or other endocrine disorders). this distribution did not differ between patients suffering from clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism. no case of clinically relevant hyponatremia (na+ < 130 mmol/l), present in 111/448 (24.78%) patients could be attributed only to hypothyroidism. there was a very weak but statistically significant trend toward a positive association between thyroid function and serum na+ levels (na+/thyrotropin: r = 0.022, p = 0.046; na+/free thyroxine: r=-0.047, p < 0.001). conclusion: the results suggest that hypothyroid patients with moderate to severe hyponatremia often have other potential explanations for their low serum na+ concentrations in routine care.
headache	despite the huge health and economic burden of migraine headache, few medications have been approved for its prophylactic treatment, most of which can potentially induce serious adverse effects. coenzyme q10 (coq10) is a supplement and has shown preliminary benefits in migraine prophylaxis. we aimed to assess this effect in an adult population. this is an open-label, parallel, add-on, match-controlled trial. eighty patients diagnosed with migraine headache based on international headache society criteria were allocated to receiving only their current preventive drugs or their current preventive drugs plus 100 mg coq10 daily, matching for their baseline characteristics, and were assessed for frequency and severity of attacks, and >= 50 % reduction in attack frequency per month. thirty-six and 37 patients were analyzed in coq10 and control groups, respectively. number of attacks per month dropped significantly in the coq10 group (mean decrease: 1.6 vs. 0.5 among coq10 and control groups, respectively, p < 0.001). a significant reduction was also evident in the severity of headaches (mean decrease: 2.3 vs. 0.6 among coq10 and control groups, respectively, p= 50 % reduction in the frequency of attacks per month, the number needed to treat was calculated as 1.6. no side effects for coq10 were observed. this study suggests that coq10 might reduce the frequency of headaches, and may also make them shorter in duration, and less severe, with a favorable safety profile.
skin_care	purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of incontinence-associated dermatitis (iad) in nursing home residents. methods: records of a cohort of 10,713 elderly (>= 65 years) newly incontinent nursing home residents in 448 nursing homes in 28 states free of iad were followed up for iad development. potential multilevel predictors of iad were identified in 4 national datasets containing information about the characteristics of individual nursing home residents, nursing home care environment, and communities in which the nursing homes were located. a unique set of health practitioner orders provided information about iad and the predictors of iad prevention and pressure injuries in the extended perineal area. analysis was based on hierarchical logistical regression. results: the incidence of iad was 5.5%. significant predictors of iad were not receiving preventive interventions for iad, presence of a perineal pressure injury, having greater functional limitations in activities of daily living, more perfusion problems, and lesser cognitive deficits. conclusion: findings highlight the importance of prevention of iad and treatment/prevention of pressure injuries. a woc nurse offers expertise in these interventions and can educate staff about iad predictors, which can improve resident outcomes. other recommendations include implementing plans of care to improve functional status, treat perfusion problems, and provide assistance with incontinence and skin care to residents with milder as well as greater cognitive deficits.
fungal_infection	background: heroin and its contaminants may be an important source of allergens in young people. we present a case of severe endophthalmitis in a patient that also suffered from anaphylactoid symptoms (hypotension, urticaria, glottic oedema) whenever he ingested lemon. methods: prick tests with a battery of 42 aeroallergens including fruits and citrus fruits (orange, mandarin, grapefruit and lemon) and specific ige to these allergens were carried out. immunodetection was performed using the patient 's serum and the following allergens: lemon, candida, aspergillus, penicillium and alternaria recombinant alt 1 (laboratories diater). results: skin tests were negative for candida, penicillium, aspergillus and cladosporium (alk-spain) as were specific ige antibodies for cap (thermofisher, sweden) and positive only for lemon and, doubtfully, to candida. specific ige tests to pollen, arthropods, fungi, dander and foods were positive only for lemon (0.49 ku/l). serological study of fungi ruled out fungal infection at that time. the immunodetection showed that the patient 's serum recognised a protein of approximately 25 kda of lemon peel, one of approximately 12-13 kda of penicillium, and perfectly recognised alt a 1. conclusions: lemon surface can be contaminated by candida and other fungi. in heroin addicts with positive skin tests for lemon, the possibility of these serious complications should be taken into account.

parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. recently, specific t1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (mri) at 3 tesla was reported to visualize neuromelanin (nm)-related contrast of dopaminergic neurons. using nm-mri, we analyzed whether disease severity and motor complications (mc) are associated with the degree of dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta (snc) in patients with idiopathic pd (pd) and park2. we examined 27 individuals with pd, 11 with park2, and a control group of 18. a 3t mri was used to obtain a modified nm-sensitive t1-weighted fast-spin echo sequence. the size of the snc was determined as the number of pixels with signal intensity higher than background signal intensity +2 standard deviations. nm-mri indicated that the t1 hyperintense area in the snc in patients with pd and park2 was significantly smaller than that in control subjects. when compared with the pd group without mc, both pd with mc and park2 showed a markedly smaller size of nm-rich snc area. receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a sensitivity of 86.96% and a specificity of 100% in discriminating between patients with and without mc (area under the curve = 0.98). correlation analysis between the t1 hyperintense snc area and l-dopa and l-dopa equivalent dose demonstrated a significant negative correlation. the association between a reducing snc nm-rich area and mc with increasing dopaminergic medication dose suggests that nm-mri findings might be a useful tool for monitoring the development of mc in pd and park2.
myelofibrosis	simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of extracellular matrix enzyme lysyl oxidase-like-2, showed preclinical promise and was well tolerated in clinical studies. a phase 2, open-label study of simtuzumab was conducted in patients with primary myelofibrosis (mf), post-polycythaemia vera mf and post-essential thrombocythaemia mf. fifty-four patients were randomized to receive simtuzumab alone (200 or 700 mg [n = 12 each group]) or simtuzumab (200 or 700 mg) with ruxolitinib (n = 15 each group) for 24 weeks. simtuzumab alone or in combination with ruxolitinib showed no clinical benefit at 24 weeks. the mean serum simtuzumab trough concentrations appeared to increase dose-proportionally between the 200-mg and 700-mg treatment groups. therapy-related serious adverse events were pyrexia, pain in extremity (both in 1 patient) and infusion reaction (in another patient). bone marrow fibrosis (bmf) score was reduced at 24 weeks in 2 patients (16.7%) in the simtuzumab 700-mg group, 1 (6.7%) in the simtuzumab 200-mg + ruxolitinib group, and 2 (13.3%) in the simtuzumab 700-mg + ruxolitinib group; similar numbers of patients had increased bmf. simtuzumab alone or with ruxolitinib was well tolerated but did not produce clinical benefit nor consistently reduce bmf in patients with mf by 24 weeks.
allergies	migraine is a common primary headache disorder. the mechanisms underlying the onset of a migraine attack are not completely understood. environmental changes and a number of other factors could induce migraine attacks. the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the frequency of migraine attacks and allergens. migraine patients without aura, and healthy individuals similar in age and gender without a history of headache and allergy were prospectively included in the study. the duration of migraine, the frequency of migraine attacks, the medication history, and the symptoms during attacks were questioned. migraine disability assessment score (midas) and visual analog scale (vas) scores were obtained. allergen extracts including dust, fungi, insect, animal epithelium, pollens, and food allergens were applied for allergy tests. 49 migraine patients and 49 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. there was no significant difference in terms of age and gender. the median migraine disease duration, the number of attacks in a month, and the duration of attacks were, respectively, 5.5 years (1-44), 4 (1-10) day/month, and 24 (4-72) h. the mean midas grade was 2.45 +/- 0.14 (1-4), and mean vas score was 7.89 +/- 0.27 (4-10). the positivity of allergy tests was 55.1 % (27/49) in the migraine group and 32.7 % (16/49) in the control group (p < 0.05). the allergy tests were positive for house dust, red birch, hazel tree, olive tree, nettle, and wheat. the frequency of migraine attacks was higher in allergy-test-positive patients than in negative ones in the migraine group (p = 0.001). the migraine patients who had frequent attacks should be examined for allergies.
diabetes	growing evidence has revealed that a high-fat diet (hfd) could lead to disorders of glycolipid metabolism and insulin-resistant states, and hfds have been associated with the inhibition of testicular steroidogenesis. our previous study demonstrated that 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (bde47) could increase the risk of diabetes in humans and reduce testosterone production in rats. however, whether the hfd affects bde47-inhibited testosterone production by elevating insulin levels and inducing related pathways remains unknown. in male rats treated with bde47 by gavage for 12 weeks, the hfd significantly increased the bde47 content of the liver and testis and increased the weight of the adipose tissue; increased macrovesicular steatosis in the liver and the levels of triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin; further aggravated the disruption of the seminiferous epithelium; and lowered the level of testosterone, resulting in fewer sperm in the epididymis. of note, the hfd enhanced bde47-induced dax-1 expression and decreased the expression levels of star and 3 beta-hsd in the testicular interstitial compartments in rats. in isolated primary leydig cells from rats, bde47 or insulin increased dax-1 expression, decreased the expression of star and 3 beta-hsd, and reduced testosterone production, which was nearly reversed by knocking down dax-1. these results indicated that the hfd aggravates bde47-inhibited testosterone production through hyperinsulinemia, and the accumulation of testicular bde47 that induces the up regulation of dax-1 and the subsequent down-regulation of steroidogenic proteins, i.e., star and 3 beta-hsd, in leydig cells.

parkinson's_disease	the ability of a blood vessel to change diameter in response to a change in carbon dioxide concentration is often referred to as vasomotor reactivity. this study aimed to determine whether vasomotor reactivity is impaired in patients with idiopathic parkinson 's disease in comparison to healthy controls. transcranial doppler was used to measure cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries at baseline and under hypocapnic conditions in 40 patients with idiopathic parkinson 's disease and 50 healthy controls. vasomotor reactivity, assessed under hypocapnic conditions, is not impaired in patients with idiopathic parkinson 's disease in comparison to healthy controls.
overactive_bladder	purpose: the goal of this study was to compare the international prostate symptom storage subscore (ipss-s) and the over-active bladder symptom score (oabss) as tools for assessing the symptoms of overactive bladder (oab). methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted of a sample of 1,341 patients aged 50 years and older with lower urinary tract complaints who had undergone a medical examination at one of several centers. for each patient, we reviewed the international prostate symptom score and the oabss. the patients were divided into 2 groups according to their ipss-s result (group 1, score >= 6; group 2, score <6) and into another 2 groups according to their oabss diagnosis (group 3, oab patients; group 4, non-oab patients). we determined whether the oabss varied to a statistically significant extent between groups 1 and 2. furthermore, we evaluated the correlation of ipss-s severity with the oabss results in group 3, and the oab diagnosis rate was compared between groups 1 and 2. results: in groups 1 and 2, the oabss results were not found to vary to a statistically significant extent (p=0.326). in group 3, no significant correlation was found between ipss-s severity and the oabss results (p=0.385). in the prevalence analysis, no statistically significant difference was found among the groups, and the receiver operating characteristic curve showed an area under the curve of 0.474. conclusions: the results of this cross-sectional analysis suggest that the ipss-s and the oabss are not significantly correlated. although both scores are used to measure oab symptoms, the simultaneous use of ipss-s and oabss is not warranted.
hepatitis_c	background daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy has shown a high virological response for chronic genotype 1 hepatitis c virus (hcv)-infected patients. however, the safety and efficacy of the therapy for older patients are unknown. methods one hundred seventy patients younger than 75 years and 139 patients aged 75 years or older with genotype 1 hcv infection were treated for 24 weeks with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir. pretreatment drug-resistance-associated variants at ns5a-l31 and ns5a-y93 were determined by the invader assay. virological response and adverse events according to age were analyzed. results the sustained virological response (svr) rate for older patients was similar to that for younger patients (97.1 and 92.4 % respectively). in multivariate regression analysis, prior simeprevir treatment (odds ratio 56.6 for absence; p < 0.001) was identified as a significant independent predictor of svr. the svr rate for patients with pretreatment resistance-associated variants (ravs) at a low population frequency (less than 25 %) was similar to that for patients with no detectable ravs. the frequency of adverse events was similar between younger and older patients. all 19 very elderly patients (85 years or older) completed the 24 weeks of treatment and achieved svr. conclusion older patients have a virological response and tolerance of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy similar to those of younger patients. even though ravs were detected, virological response similar to that for patients with no detectable ravs may still be expected for patients with ravs as long as the population frequency is low.
low_testosterone	reference treatment of advanced prostate cancer (pca) relies on pharmacological or surgical androgen deprivation therapy. however, it is only temporarily efficient as tumor cells inevitably adapt to the low testosterone environment and become hormone-refractory (hrpca). we observed that androgen removal in hrpca-derived lncap cells causes different alterations in their ca2+ homeostasis among which a reduction of er ca2+ content. we show that the decrease in [ca2]er is due to a modest overexpression of type 1 ip3r and a threefold increased phosphorylation of ip3r1 on ser-1716, a protein kinase a (pi(a) consensus site, both implicated in er ca2+ leak. accordingly, er ca2+ content was restored by sirna-mediated down-regulation of ip3r1 or by inhibition of its phosphorylation by competition with a permeant tat-peptide containing the ser-1716 consensus phosphorylation sequence or by treatment with the pica inhibitor h89. moreover, inhibition of the ip3r1 phosphorylation by both methods sensitized the lncap cells to androgen deprivation-induced apoptosis. in addition, serca2b overexpression precluded the effect of androgen deprivation on er ca2+ store content and reduced resistance to androgen deprivation. taken together, these results indicate that lowering the er ca2+-store content by increasing ip3r1 levels and ip3r1 phosphorylation by pica is a protective mechanism by which hrpca-derived cells escape cell death in the absence of androgenic stimulation.

fungal_infection	background. fungal infections of the central nervous system (ficns) are important causes of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised pediatric patients. standard diagnostic modalities lack the sensitivity for detecting and therapeutically monitoring these life-threatening diseases. current molecular methods remain investigational. (1 ->3)-beta-d-glucan (bdg) is a cell wall component found in several fungal pathogens, including candida and aspergillus spp. detecting bdg in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) may be an important approach for detecting and therapeutically monitoring ficns. to date, there has been no study that has investigated the effectiveness of csf bdg as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker of ficns in children. methods. serial bdg levels were measured in serum and csf samples obtained from pediatric patients (aged 0-18 years) with a diagnosis of probable or proven candida or aspergillus cns infection. results. nine cases of ficns were identified in patients aged 1 month to 18 years. two patients were infected with an aspergillus species, and 7 patients were infected with a candida species. all the patients at baseline had detectable bdg in their csf. among 7 patients who completed therapy for an ficns, all elevated csf bdg levels decreased to <31 pg/ml. at the time of this writing, 1 patient was still receiving therapy and continued to have elevated bdg levels. one patient died from overwhelming disseminated candidiasis. the lengths of therapy for these 9 children ranged from 2 weeks to 28 months. conclusion. the bdg assay is useful in diagnosing and therapeutically monitoring candida and aspergillus cns infections in pediatric patients.
hepatitis_c	introduction data on the epidemiology of hepatitis c among individuals who use drugs in low-threshold settings are lacking, although crucial to assess the burden of disease and aid in the design of treatment strategies. objective the aim of this study was to characterize the epidemiology and disease related to hepatitis c in a population attending a low-threshold methadone program. materials and methods a cross-sectional study in the population attending the mobile low-threshold methadone program in lisbon, portugal, was carried out. the survey included assessment of risk factors for infection with hepatitis c virus (hcv) and liver disease, hcv serology and rna detection, hcv genotyping, and liver disease staging. results a total of 825 participants were enrolled, 81.3% men, mean age 44.5 years. injecting drug use (idu) was reported by 58.4% - among these, 28.2% were people who inject drugs. excessive drinking and hiv coinfection were reported by 33.4 and 15.9%, respectively. among participants with active infection, 16.9% were followed up in hospital consultation. the overall seroprevalence for hcv was 67.6% (94.2% in idu, 30.0% in non-idu, 97.1% in people who inject drugs, and 75.6% in excessive drinkers). among seropositives for hcv, active infection was present in 68.4%. among individuals with active infection, the most common genotypes were 1a (45.3%) and 3a (28.7%), whereas 30% had severe liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. age 45 years or older, hcv genotype 3, and coinfection with hiv were significant predictors of cirrhosis. conclusion this population has a high burden of hepatitis c and several characteristics that favor dissemination of infection. healthcare strategies are urgently needed to address hepatitis c in this setting. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
multiple_sclerosis	vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (vasp) and ena-vasp-like (evl) are cytoskeletal effector proteins implicated in regulating cell morphology, adhesion, and migration in various cell types. however, the role of these proteins in t-cell motility, adhesion, and in vivo trafficking remains poorly understood. this study identifies a specific role for evl and vasp in t-cell diapedesis and trafficking. we demonstrate that evl and vasp are selectively required for activated t-cell trafficking but are not required for normal t-cell development or for naive t-cell trafficking to lymph nodes and spleen. using amodel of multiple sclerosis, we show an impairment in trafficking of evl/vasp-deficient activated t cells to the inflamed central nervous system of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. additionally, we found a defect in trafficking of evl/vasp double-knockout (dko) t cells to the inflamed skin and secondary lymphoid organs. deletion of evl and vasp resulted in the impairment in alpha 4 integrin (cd49d) expression and function. unexpectedly, evl/vasp dko t cells did not exhibit alterations in shear-resistant adhesion to, or in crawling on, primary endothelial cells under physiologic shear forces. instead, deletion of evl and vasp impaired t-cell diapedesis. furthermore, t-cell diapedesis became equivalent between control and evl/vasp dko t cells upon alpha 4 integrin blockade. overall, evl and vasp selectively mediate activated t-cell trafficking by promoting the diapedesis step of transendothelial migration in a alpha 4 integrin-dependent manner.
headache	objectives the sphenopalatine ganglion (spg) plays a pivotal role in cluster headache (ch) pathophysiology as the major efferent parasympathetic relay. we evaluated the long-term effectiveness of spg stimulation in medically refractory, chronic ch patients. methods thirty-three patients were enrolled in an open-label follow-up study of the original pathway ch-1 study, and participated through 24 months post-insertion of a microstimulator. response to therapy was defined as acute effectiveness in50% of attacks or a50% reduction in attack frequency versus baseline. results in total, 5956 attacks (180.5344.8, range 2-1581 per patient) were evaluated. at 24 months, 45% (n=15) of patients were acute responders. among acute responders, a total of 4340 attacks had been treated, and in 78% of these, effective therapy was achieved using only spg stimulation (relief from moderate or greater pain or freedom from mild pain or greater). a frequency response was observed in 33% (n=11) of patients with a mean reduction of attack frequency of 83% versus baseline. in total, 61% (20/33) of all patients were either acute or frequency responders or both. the majority maintained their therapeutic response through the 24-month evaluation. conclusions in the population of disabled, medically refractory chronic ch patients treated in this study, spg stimulation is an effective acute therapy in 45% of patients, offering sustained effectiveness over 24months of observation. in addition, a maintained, clinically relevant reduction of attack frequency was observed in a third of patients. these long-term data provide support for the use of spg stimulation for disabled patients and should be considered after medical treatments fail, are not tolerated or are inconvenient for the patients.
parenting	background: simulation has become accepted as a method to increase confidence among healthcare professionals. we felt simulation might have similar benefits for parents of babies about to be discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit. purpose: we developed the neonatal home environment learning program to promote parental confidence in anticipation of their infant 's discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. methods: this evaluation study was conducted with 15 mother/father dyads. each participant recorded a self-perceived confidence score before and after the simulation experience. participants also completed a program evaluation and participated in a debriefing session. confidence scores (pre- and postsimulation) and evaluation scores were analyzed with descriptive statistics. responses from the debriefing sessions were analyzed using descriptive phenomenology. results: parents rated the simulation experience highly. during debriefings, parents shared that the simulation made them feel more prepared. two themes emerged from the debriefing data: doing it alone was different than i expected and feeling more confident. clinical implications: a simulation experience for parents helps to ensure a positive transition to home and safe, effective care after discharge of the infant.
multiple_sclerosis	introduction: there have been a wide range of preclinical studies testing cellular therapies to repair the injured spinal cord, yet they remain a challenge to translate because of inconsistencies in efficacy, limited number of patients with acute/subacute sci and the high costs of clinical trials.area covered: this paper focusses on the therapeutic potential of neural precursor cells (npcs) because they can provide the cellular components capable of promoting repair and enhancing functional improvement following spinal cord injury (sci). the authors discuss the challenges of npc transplantation with respect to different populations of npcs of glial and neuronal lineages, the timing of treatment relative to acute and chronic injury, and the progress in ongoing clinical trials.expert commentary: preclinical research will continue to elucidate mechanisms of recovery associated with npc transplants, including increasing the partnership with related fields such as spinal atrophies and multiple sclerosis. the clinical trials landscape will grow and include both acute and chronic sci with increased partnership and strengthened communication between biotechnology, government and academia. there will also be growing effort to develop better biomarkers, imaging and outcome measures for detailed assessment of neurological function and measures of quality of life.
hepatitis_c	background: membranous nephropathy (mn) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. as many clinical cases have reported, it may be associated with hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. antiviral therapy can be various. case summary: we report a case of patient with chronic hcv infection and mn, who presented with was proteinuria. he was treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (harvoni; gilead sciences, foster city, ca) and was found to be virus-free. conclusion: we have reported this case to provide insight into whether ledipasvir-sofosbuvir should be administered for hcv-related glomerulonephritis.
fungal_infection	parasite infection often results in alterations in host behaviour. these changes vary greatly in their magnitude, from slight shifts in the time spent by the host performing a given activity to the appearance of novel behaviours. the effects of parasites can differ with the age and the physiological condition of the host. rickia wasmannii is an ectoparasitic fungal symbiont in myrmica ants that covers the whole body surface of the host and reduces its lifespan. the fungus is present in both young and old individuals, making it an optimal subject for the study of age-related parasitic effects. we tested the effect of fungal infection on the locomotory activity of the myrmica scabrinodis ant in different age categories. the fat content of workers was measured as a proxy for their physiological status. based on our findings, old workers bore more thalli and were leaner than young individuals, while they tended to move at higher speeds and with a lower degree of meandering. young individuals covered smaller distances, at slower speeds and with a higher degree of meandering. contrary to our expectations, the infection intensity of r. wasmannii affected neither the fat content nor the locomotory activity of ant workers. however, the two age classes seem to have different strategies with regards to the relationship between fat content and distance covered. our results suggest that characteristics of locomotory activity differ between the age classes in many respects, and are also influenced by their physiological status, but parasitism by r. wasmannii does not seem to have a straightforward effect on any of the variables studied.

menopause	surgical approaches to endometriosis patients with chronic pelvic pain are multimodal and require individualization. laparoscopic approaches are preferred over laparotomy when conservatively treating endometriosis via excision or ablation/fulguration of lesions. the available data support cystectomy over fenestration or fulguration for endometriomas; however, there may be associated decreases in ovarian reserve with endometrioma treatment. presacral neurectomy may be useful in patients with midline pain and luna is not effective for the treatment of pelvic pain related to endometriosis. appendectomy may be considered prophylactically at the time of the surgery for pelvic pain, although more studies are needed. for deep infiltrating endometriosis, the risks of aggressive bowel surgery must be weighed against the benefits of clear pain reduction. postoperative medical suppressive therapy is strongly recommended to prolong symptom-free intervals of this chronic disease. as definitive therapy, hysterectomy can be helpful especially when combined with endometriosis excision. when performing hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy should be given careful consideration, as this procedure leads to premature surgical menopause and may not decrease the possibility of reoperation and persistence of symptoms in patients aged 30 to 39 years with chronic pain.
parkinson's_disease	objectives this study aimed to examine whether occupational and physical activity (pa) at different ages contribute to parkinson 's disease (pd) risk in a large population-based case-control study in denmark. methods we identified 1828 pd patients from the danish national hospital register and recruited 1909 gender and year of birth matched controls from the danish central population register. occupational and leisure-time pa were determined from a job exposure matrix based on occupational history and self-reported leisure-time information. results no association was found for occupational pa alone in men, but higher leisure-time pa (>= 5 hours/week of strenuous activities) in young adulthood (15-25 years) was associated with a lower pd risk (adjusted odds ratio (oradj) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95% ci) 0.62-0.90); men who engaged in high occupational and high leisure-time pa in young adulthood had the lowest pd risk (oradj 0.58, 95% ci 0.41-0.81). among women, inverse associations were found for occupation pa before age 50 (highest vs lowest, oradj 0.75, 95% ci 0.55-1.06) and strenuous leisure-time pa after age 50 (oradj 0.65, 95% ci 0.87-0.99); no clear pattern was seen for leisure and occupational pa combined. conclusions we observed gender-specific inverse associations between occupational and leisure-time pa and pd risk; however, we cannot preclude reverse causation especially in older ages since pd has a long prodromal stage that might lead to a reduction of pa years before motor symptom onset and pd diagnosis.
birth_control	purpose: the prevalence of intimacy and substance use among adolescents and young adults during cancer therapy has not been well described. methods: the ""resilience in adolescents and young adults with cancer"" study was a prospective, multicenter, mixed-methods cohort study. english-speaking patients 14-25 years old with newly diagnosed cancer were invited to complete a comprehensive survey at the time of enrollment (t1) and 3-6 months later (t2). intimate relationships and health behaviors were assessed with questions adapted from the guidelines for adolescent preventative services assessment. descriptive statistics characterized the prevalence of sexual and substance-related behaviors at each time point. results: of 42 eligible and enrolled participants, 35 (83%) and 25 (59%) completed t1 and t2 surveys, respectively. their mean age was 17.6 years (standard deviation 2.3), 57% were male, and the most common diagnoses were sarcoma and acute leukemia. over a third of participants reported dating at each time point; 26% were sexually active at t1, and 32% at t2. of those endorsing sexual activity, fewer than half reported consistent birth control or condom use and 4 reported their first sexual intercourse during our observation. in addition, 46% (t1) and 44% (t2) reported alcohol use and 23% (t1) and 26% (t2) reported illicit drug use. despite these activities, fewer than 10% endorsed a worry or need to discuss these behaviors with oncology providers. conclusions: intimacy and substance use among adolescents and young adults are common during cancer therapy. clinical and research implications include the identification of optimal communication and patient-centered supports.

menopause	colorectal carcinoma is one of the most fatal cancers, but to date, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood. recent epidemiological studies and clinical trials have begun to provide insights into the links between estrogens and colorectal carcinoma. the results obtained from established animal models indicated that abnormal high levels of estrogens promote the tumorigenesis of colitis-associated carcinoma. estrogens regulate biological events mainly through two distinct receptors (er alpha and er beta). after combined with the receptor, estrogens translocate to nucleus and act as transcription factors to modulate several signaling pathways. since organ destruction and parenchymal loss result in hormone inactivation disorder, patients with liver cirrhosis always have high levels of endogenous estrogens, which are the predominant causes of liver palm, spider angioma, gynecomastia, and testis atrophy. meanwhile, several population-based studies confirmed that patients with liver cirrhosis face higher risks of colorectal carcinoma compared to general population. although the influencing factors may be complicated, the high level of endogenous estrogens has been proposed as an important pathogen. several studies, with the particular focus on menopause women, provided some contradictory results that estrogens may protect patients from cancers. however, the low levels of endogenous estrogens of menopause women, administration route, and the composition of drugs could lead to different conclusions. the exact effect of estrogens on the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma of a patient with liver cirrhosis is only just starting to be dissected.
parenting	objective: although enuresis is relatively common in early childhood, research exploring its antecedents and implications is surprisingly limited, perhaps because the condition typically remits in middle childhood. method: we examined the prevalence, predictors, prognostic factors, and outcomes of primary enuresis in a large (n = 559) multi-method, multi-informant prospective study with a community-based sample of children followed from age 3 years to age 9 years. results: we found that 12.7% of our sample met criteria for lifetime enuresis, suggesting that it is a commonly occurring childhood disorder. males were more than twice as likely as females to have a lifetime diagnosis. significant age 3 predictors of developing primary enuresis by age 9 included child anxiety and low positive affectivity, maternal history of anxiety, and low authoritative parenting. in addition, poorer global functioning and more depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 3 years predicted a greater likelihood of persistence through age 9. by age 9 years, 77% of children who had received a diagnosis of primary enuresis were in remission and continent. however, children who had remitted exhibited a higher rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and greater adhd and depressive symptoms at age 9 compared to children with no lifetime history of enuresis. conclusion: results of the present study underscore the clinical significance of primary enuresis and demonstrate that it shows both strong antecedent and prospective associations with psychopathology. the findings also highlight the possible role of parenting in the development of enuresis.
low_testosterone	a fast and sensitive gc-ms/ms method is proposed to determine pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), testosterone and dihydrotestosterone from human plasma. steroids were extracted by liquid/ liquid extraction, and derivatized with n-methyl-n-trimethylsilyl-trifluoracetamide. electron ionization at 30 ev was applied to generate high abundant precursor ions. specific precursor/product transitions were generated a priori for each compound of interest and these assays were then used to selectively detect and quantify these steroids. using the selected reaction monitoring mode, detection limits in the pg/ml (sub nmol/l) range could be achieved for all four steroid compounds. the method was validated for imprecision, and recovery and applied in a pilot study in patients with hypercholesterolemia. associations of increased cholesterol biosynthesis and low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations were found.

menopause	objective: the current study examined the effects of pharmacologic dopaminergic manipulations on working memory-related brain activation in postmenopausal women to further understand the neurochemistry underlying cognition after menopause. methods: eighteen healthy postmenopausal women, mean age 55.21 years, completed three study days with dopaminergic drug challenges during which they performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging visual verbal n-back test of working memory. acute stimulation with 1.25 mg oral d-2 agonist bromocriptine, acute blockade with 1.5 mg oral haloperidol, and matching placebo were administered randomly and blindly on three study days. results: we found that dopaminergic stimulation increased activation primarily in the posterior regions of the working memory network compared with dopaminergic blockade using a whole brain cluster-level corrected analysis. the dopaminergic medications did not affect working memory performance. conclusions: patterns of increased blood-oxygen-level dependent signal activation after dopaminergic stimulation were found in this study in posterior brain regions with no effect on working memory performance. further studies should examine specific dopaminergic contributions to brain functioning in healthy postmenopausal women to determine the effects of the increased brain activation on cognition and behavior.
hypothyroidism	haizao yuhu decoction (hyd) has been used for approximately 500 years and is well-known in traditional chinese medicine for its efficacy in the treatment of thyroid-related diseases. in this study, a rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of liquiritin, naringin, hesperidin, peimine, liquiritigenin, glycyrrhizic acid, bergapten, nobiletin, osthole, and glycyrrhetinic acid in rat plasma to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of different hyd prescriptions in a rat model of hypothyroidism. the differences in pharmacokinetic parameters among the groups were compared by student 's t-test. the pharmacokinetic profile of liquiritin, naringin, hesperidin, peimine, liquiritigenin, glycyrrhizic acid, bergapten, nobiletin, osthole, and glycyrrhetinic acid showed significant differences between haizao and gancao anti-drug combination and other herbs in hyd. these results may contribute to the rational clinical use of hyd and reveal the compatibility profile of the haizao and gancao anti-drug combination.
hepatitis_c	alpha virus m1 is an oncolytic virus that targets zinc-finger antiviral protein (zap)-defective cancer cells, and may be useful for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). most of hcc patients have hepatitis and need long-term antiviral medication. thus, it is necessary to clarify whether anti-virus medicines influence oncolytic effect of m1. we examined the effect of drugs used to treat hepatitis b/c on m1-mediated oncolysis in vitro and in vivo. interferon (ifn)-alpha induces expression of antiviral ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) in hcc cells with moderate sensitivity to m1 virus. this leads to reduced replication of m1, and blocking of m1-mediated apoptosis. the antagonistic effect of ifn-alpha is positively related with the expressive level of isgs. we also examined a population of 147 hcc patients. a total of 107 patients (73%) had low zap expression in liver tissues relative to adjacent tissues. among these 107 patients, 77% were positive for hepatitis b and 2% were positive for hepatitis c. a combination of m1 virus and ifn should be avoided in those patients with hbv or hcv infection, of who zap expression is low but isgs expression is moderate. in conclusion, this study provides a basis for anti-viral regimens for hcc patients with hepatitis b or c who are given oncolytic virus m1.
parkinson's_disease	objectives we conducted a systematic literature review to identify studies fulfilling good scientific epidemiological standards for use in meta-analyses of relevant risk factors for parkinson 's disease. methods our search identified 103 original publications on associations between work and parkinson 's disease. grade guidelines were used to ensure high scientific quality, and reliable guidelines were applied to classify the papers. of the 103 articles, 47 fulfilled good scientific standards while 56 were methodologically deficient and thus excluded from our meta-analyses. results a total of 23 publications concerned work exposure to pesticides. the weighted relative risk estimate was 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.42-1.97). a funnel plot and bias test indicated that some publication bias concerning smaller studies might have been present. the risk estimate was not influenced by study design (casecontrol, cohort, or cross-sectional study) or gender. higher estimates were found when there was a hereditary taint or onset below age 60. studies on exposure to metals or electromagnetic fields did not show increased risk. conclusions using an elaborated quality protocol, there is now strong evidence that exposure to any pesticide involves a >= 50% increased risk for developing parkinson 's disease.
overactive_bladder	onabotulinumtoxina (btx-a) is a treatment option for patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) or idiopathic overactive bladder (oab) inadequately controlled with or intolerant to oral medications. the currently approved dosing is 100 u for oab and 200 u for ndo which is commonly injected into the detrusor muscle via 20-30 trigone-sparing sites. growing evidence suggests that the efficacy of btx-a may be maintained with fewer injection sites, varying injection depth, and differing injection locations. this review focuses on the recent literature regarding various btx-a injection techniques for the treatment of ndo and oab.
sprains_and_strains	background ultrasound is used in the treatment of a wide variety of musculoskeletal disorders, which include acute ankle sprains. this is an update of a cochrane review first published in 1999, and previously updated in 2004. objectives to evaluate the effects of ultrasound therapy in the treatment of acute ankle sprains. search strategy we searched the cochrane bone, joint and muscle trauma group specialised register (september 2010), the cochrane central register of controlled trials (the cochrane library 2010, issue 3), medline (1966 to september 2010), embase (1983 to september 2010), cinahl (1982 to 2004), and pedro - the physiotherapy evidence database (accessed 01/06/09). we also searched the cochrane rehabilitation and related therapies field database, reference lists of articles, and contacted colleagues. the who international clinical trials registry platform was searched for ongoing trials. selection criteria randomised or quasi-randomised trials were included if the following conditions were met: at least one study group was treated with therapeutic ultrasound; participants had acute lateral ankle sprains; and outcome measures included general improvement, pain, swelling, functional disability, or range of motion. data collection and analysis two authors independently performed study selection, and assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. risk ratios and risk differences together with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences together with 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcome measures. limited pooling of data was undertaken where there was clinical homogeneity in terms of participants, treatments, outcomes, and follow-up time points. main results six trials were included, involving 606 participants. five trials included comparisons of ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound; and three trials included single comparisons of ultrasound with three other treatments. the assessment of risk of bias was hampered by poor reporting of trial methods and results. none of the five placebo-controlled trials (sham ultrasound) demonstrated statistically significant differences between true and sham ultrasound therapy for any outcome measure at one to four weeks of follow-up. the pooled risk ratio for general improvement at one week was 1.04 (random-effects model, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.17) for active versus sham ultrasound. the differences between intervention groups were generally small, between zero and six per cent, for most dichotomous outcomes. authors' conclusions the evidence from the five small placebo-controlled trials included in this review does not support the use of ultrasound in the treatment of acute ankle sprains. the potential treatment effects of ultrasound appear to be generally small and of probably of limited clinical importance, especially in the context of the usually short-term recovery period for these injuries. however, the available evidence is insufficient to rule out the possibility that there is an optimal dosage schedule for ultrasound therapy that may be of benefit.
parkinson's_disease	in order to test therapeutics, functional assessments are required. in pre-clinical stroke research, there is little consensus regarding the most appropriate behavioural tasks to assess deficits, especially when testing over extended times in milder models with short occlusion times and small lesion volumes. in this study, we comprehensively assessed 16 different behavioural tests, with the aim of identifying those that show robust, reliable and stable deficits for up to two months. these tasks are regularly used in stroke research, as well as being useful for examining striatal dysfunction in models of huntington 's and parkinson 's disease. two cohorts of male wistar rats underwent the intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (30min) and were imaged 24h later. this resulted in primarily subcortical infarcts, with a small amount of cortical damage. animals were tested, along with sham and naive groups at 24h, seven days, and one and two months. following behavioural testing, brains were processed and striatal neuronal counts were performed alongside measurements of total brain and white matter atrophy. the staircase, adjusting steps, rotarod and apomorphine-induced rotations were the most reliable for assessing long-term deficits in the 30min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke.
skin_care	data for this study on skin care practices and emollient use in four african sites were collected using in-depth interviews, focus-group discussions and observations. respondents were mothers, grandmothers, fathers, health workers, birth attendants and people selling skin-care products. analysis included content and framework analyses. emollient use was a normative practice in all sites, with frequent application from an early age in most sites. there were variations in the type of emollients used, but reasons for use were similar and included improving the skin, keeping the baby warm, softening/strengthening the joints/bones, shaping the baby, ensuring flexibility and encouraging growth and weight gain. factors that influenced emollient choice varied and included social pressure, cost, availability and deep-rooted traditional norms. massage associated with application was strong and potentially damaging to the skin in some sites. given the widespread use of emollients, the repeated exposure of newborns in the first month of life and the potential impact of emollients on mortality, trials such as those that have been conducted in asia are needed in a range of african settings.
weight_loss	background: associations of obesity with incidence of heart failure have been observed, but the causality is uncertain. we hypothesized that gastric bypass surgery leads to a lower incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in obese people. methods: we included obese people without previous heart failure from a swedish nationwide registry of people treated with a structured intensive lifestyle program and the scandinavian obesity surgery registry. all analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. treatment groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. associations of treatment with heart failure incidence, as defined in the national patient register, were analyzed with cox regression. results: the 25 804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 year and 22.6 kg more after 2 years than the 13 701 lifestyle modification patients. during a median of 4.1 years, surgery patients had lower heart failure incidence than lifestyle modification patients (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.82). a 10-kg achieved weight loss after 1 year was related to a hazard ratio for heart failure of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.97) in both treatment groups combined. results were robust in sensitivity analyses. conclusions: gastric bypass surgery was associated with approximately one half the incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in this study of 2 large nationwide registries. we also observed a graded association between increasing weight loss and decreasing risk of heart failure.
skin_care	with the continuous development of peoples' life, the skin-care is attracting more attention. there are so many factors affecting the skin condition, and there is nonlinear correlation between factors. however, the current research always use single index to evaluate skin condition which would not be accurate. this article is to introduce seven key factors which affect the skin conditions into the evaluation. the skin condition classification model is built by the bp neural network according to the skin condition index. firstly, on the basis of age, the skin condition is classified into three type: youth, middle aged, and the old, then the feature of each kind is extracted, and then according to the seven key factors, the neural network calculation is used to study the skin condition, finally, the neural network classification result is compared with the real age to complete the evaluation. the result proves that, by using the method this article introduced in the classification of skin condition, the similarity with the real age can be 70%, bp neural network can evaluate the skin condition effectively. in addition, the method is simple and practical which supplies effective way to do the evaluation. the physical significance of the evaluation is clear and it uses the difference-information in maximum which is the accurate and effective way to obtain the skin condition information.
birth_control	objectives: intimate partner violence (ipv) is a major problem that could affect reproductive decision making. the aim of this study is to examine the association between ipv and contraceptive use and assess whether the association varies by receipt of prenatal birth control counseling and race/ethnicity. study design: this study analyzed the 2004-2008 national pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system (prams) that included 193,310 women with live births in the united states. ipv was determined by questions that asked about physical abuse by a current or former partner in the 12 months before or during pregnancy. the outcome was postpartum contraceptive use (yes vs. no). multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the influence of experiencing ipv at different periods (preconception ipv, prenatal ipv, both preconception and prenatal ipv, preconception and/or prenatal ipv). data were stratified to assess differential effects by race/ethnicity and receipt of birth control counseling. results: approximately 6.2% of women reported ipv, and 15.5% reported no postpartum contraceptive use. regardless of the timing of abuse, ipv-exposed women were significantly less likely to report contraceptive use after delivery. this was particularly true for hispanic women who reported no prenatal birth control counseling and women of all other racial/ethnic groups who received prenatal birth control counseling. conclusions: ipv victimization adversely affects the use of contraceptive methods following delivery in women with live births. birth control counseling by health providers may mitigate these effects; however, the quality of counseling needs further investigation. better integration of violence prevention services and family planning programs is greatly needed. implications: consistent with national recommendations by the u.s. preventive service task force, clinicians and public health workers are strongly encouraged to screen for ipv. health providers should educate women on effective contraceptive options and discuss long-acting reversible contraceptives that are not partner dependent within the context of abusive relationships.

parenting	food-related parenting behaviors have the potential to impact youth eating behaviors and nutrition knowledge. the present study examined associations between parental behaviors specific to eating (i.e., rules, solicitation, and the creation of a health-focused home environment) and specific unhealthy eating behaviors prevalent during adolescence. additional analyses examined whether such associations were explained by adolescent nutrition knowledge. a total of 145 adolescents (m=14.48, sd=1.75 years) and their mothers (m=43.52, sd=6.76 years) completed questionnaires as part of a larger study investigating parent-adolescent communication. mothers' food-related parenting behaviors were not directly associated with adolescents' engagement in unhealthy eating behaviors. however, more parental rules were associated with greater adolescent nutrition knowledge. in addition, mothers' creation of a health-focused home environment was indirectly associated with less fast food consumption through greater adolescent nutrition knowledge. implications and future directions are discussed.
parenting	the present study investigated whether cortisol stress responses of 6-year-olds were associated with their behavioral functioning at school. additionally, the moderating role of stress in the family environment was examined. to this end, 149 healthy children (m-age = 6.09 years; 70 girls) participated in an age-appropriate innovative social evaluative stress test. saliva cortisol samples were collected six times during the stress test to calculate two indices of the cortisol stress response: cortisol stress reactivity and total stress cortisol. teachers assessed children 's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. stress in the family environment was operationalized as maternally reported parenting stress. results indicated a significant increase in cortisol concentrations in response to the stressor. no significant associations were found between cortisol stress responses and behavioral functioning at school and there was no evidence for moderation by maternal parenting stress. potential theoretical and methodological explanations for these results are discussed.
headache	vagus nerve stimulation (vns) has been reported to be effective in the abortive treatment of both migraine and cluster headache. using validated animal models of acute dural-intracranial (migraine-like) and trigeminal-autonomic (cluster-like) head pain we tested whether vns suppresses ongoing and nociceptive-evoked firing of trigeminocervical neurons to explain its abortive effects in migraine and cluster headache. unilateral vns was applied invasively via hook electrodes placed on the vagus nerve. a single dose of ipsilateral or contralateral vns, to trigeminal recording and dural-stimulating side, suppressed ongoing spontaneous and noxious dural-evoked trigeminocervical neuronal firing. this effect was dose-dependent, with two doses of ipsilateral vns prolonging suppression of ongoing spontaneous firing (maximally by similar to 60%) for up to three hours, and dural-evoked (a delta-fiber; by similar to 22%, c-fiber: by similar to 55%) responses for at least two hours. statistically, there was no difference between ipsilateral and contralateral groups. two doses of vns also suppressed superior salivatory nucleus-evoked trigeminocervical neuronal responses (maximally by similar to 22%) for 2.5 h, to model nociceptive activation of the trigeminal-autonomic pathway. vns had no effect on normal somatosensory cutaneous facial responses throughout. these studies provide a mechanistic rationale for the observed benefits of vns in the abortive treatment of migraine and cluster headache. in addition, they further validate these preclinical models as suitable approaches to optimize therapeutic efficacy, and provide an opportunity to hypothesize and dissect the neurobiological mechanisms of vns in the treatment of primary headaches.

myelofibrosis	polycomb repressive complex (prc) is a critical regulator of normal tissue homeostasis as well as tumorigenesis. ezh2, an enzymatic subunit of prc2, is a histone h3k27 methyltransferase that functions in the regulation of gene silencing. ezh2 overexpression was first identified in prostate and breast cancers and is associated with poor clinical outcome. subsequently, gain-and loss-of-function mutations of ezh2 have been identified in various tumors, including hematological malignancies, implicating ezh2 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene, depending on the cancer type. molecular mechanisms underlying the multifaceted function of ezh2 have been analyzed extensively. however, because ezh2 dysregulation is functionally integrated with multiple other epigenetic events in a context-dependent manner, the precise manner in which ezh2 dysregulation impacts the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies remains to be clarified. in this perspective, we describe recent findings in pathogenic role of ezh2 in hematological malignancies, which may provide insights into the treatment of with cancers with ezh2 dysregulation and the development of novel therapies targeting epigenetic regulators.
hepatitis_c	aim to investigate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of cortex dictamni aqueous extract (cdae) in carbon tetrachloride (ccl4)-induced liver damage in rats. methods the in vitro antioxidant effect of cdae was investigated using alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (abts), beta-carotene bleaching, reducing power, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assays. a linoleic acid system, including ferric thiocyanate (ftc) and thiobarbituric acid (tba) assays, was used to evaluate the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. the in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of cdae against ccl4-induced liver damage were evaluated in sprague-dawley rats. silymarin was used as a positive control. liver damage was assessed by determining hepatic histopathology and liver marker enzymes in serum. enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant levels and lipid peroxide content were measured in the liver. cytochrome p450 2e1 (cyp2e1) protein expression was measured via immunohistochemical staining. nuclear factor e2-related factor (nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), nad(p)h quinine oxidoreductase 1 (nqo1), and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (gamma-gcsc) protein expression was measured by western blot. results our results showed that cdae exhibited a strong antioxidant activity in vitro. cdae scavenged dpph and abts radicals in a dose-dependent manner. cdae inhibited lipid peroxidation with a lipid peroxide inhibition rate of 40.6% +/- 5.2%. in the ftc and tba assays, cdae significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation (p < 0.01). in vivo histopathological studies indicated that ccl4-induced liver injury was alleviated following cdae treatment in rats of both sexes. cdae (160 and 320 mg/kg) significantly prevented ccl4-induced elevations of alkaline phosphatase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels in rats of both sexes (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001). moreover, cdae restored the decreased activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione, which were induced by ccl4 treatment. cdae significantly suppressed the up-regulation of cyp2e1 and promoted nrf2, ho-1, nqo1, and gamma-gcsc protein expression. conclusion cdae exhibits good antioxidant performance in vitro, with marked radical-scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. cdae is effective in preventing ccl4-induced hepatic damage in rats of both sexes. the hepatoprotective activity of cdae may be attributable to its antioxidant activity, which may involve keap1-nrf2-mediated antioxidant regulation.
birth_control	in order to capitalise on new opportunities to advance contraceptive and reproductive health choices globally, organisations working in these fields will need to overcome six institutional obstacles. these are: (i) committee management; (ii) over-medicalisation; (iii) fear of risk and controversy; (iv) conferences, meetings, and symposia; (v) obsession with coordination; and (vi) fear of sex. the reproductive health community will require energy, innovative approaches, and a sharp focus on service delivery to address these hurdles that will otherwise slow down and misdirect programmatic momentum.
skin_care	bigels are biphasic systems produced with an organogel (or oleogel) and a hydrogel mixed together at high shear rates. these systems are promising for different uses, among them the formulation of new cosmetic matrices for cosmetic agents delivery is under investigation. in the present paper, a common cosmetic formulation for skin care was enriched with increasing fractions of monoglycerides of fatty acids/olive oil orginogels, in order to understand the rheology and the microstructure of these systems. small amplitude oscillation tests, nmr-self diffusion analysis, contrast phase microscopy and electric conductivity confirmed that the addition of the organogel caused a microstructural change of the starting material, which turned from o/w to a more complex system where, probably, a matrix-in-matrix structure is present at the highest fractions of added organogel.

headache	aim: we aimed to identify clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with onset of high-altitude headache (hah) after acute exposure at 3700m. method: in two hours, 163 individuals ascended by plane to 3700m. demographic information, physiological and psychological measurements, cognitive function, physical work capacity tests and profile of mood states within one week prior to the departure and within 24 hours after arrival were examined. results: hah patients featured significantly higher vertebral artery diastolic velocity (v-d), heart rate (hr) and pulmonary artery diameter. hah was also associated with a more negative mood state, including scores for tension anxiety, depression, hostility, fatigue and confusion, as well as lower vigor (all p values <0.05). furthermore, negative emotions were positively related to hah severity. hah slightly decreased cognitive functioning. hr, v-d, lack of vigor, confusion and self-reported anxiety (all p values <0.05) were independent risk factors for hah. we have identified three independent baseline predictors for hah including internal diameter of the left ventricle (lvd), athens insomnia scale (ais) and confusion score. conclusions: higher hr, v-d, confusion and self-reported anxiety and insufficient vigor were independent risk factors for hah. furthermore, higher baseline lvd, ais and confusion score are independent predictors of hah.
cancer	the aim was to evaluate the role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (til) in predicting molecular response after preoperative endocrine or cytotoxic treatment for hr+/her2- patients who do not achieve a pathological complete response. stromal (str) til were centrally evaluated on samples from diagnostic core-biopsies of hr+/her2- patients included in two prospective randomized trials: the letlob trial (neoadjuvant endocrine-based treatment) and the giob trial (neoadjuvant chemotherapy-based treatment). pre- and post-treatment ki67 was centrally assessed. strtil were evaluable in 111 cases (n = 73 from the letlob trial and n = 38 from the giob trial). median strtil was 2%. patients with high strtil (strtil aeyen10%, n = 28) had more frequently breast cancer of ductal histology (p = 0.02), high grade (p = 0.049), and high ki67 (p = 0.02). after neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (letlob cohort), a significant ki67 suppression (p 0.01) from pre- to post-treatment was observed in both the low and high strtil groups. high strtil patients achieve more frequently a relative ki67 suppression aeyen50% from baseline as compared to low strtil patients (55 vs. 35%, p non significant). after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (giob cohort), a significant ki67 suppression was observed only for low strtil patients (wilcoxon p = 0.001) and not in the high strtil group (p = 0.612). in this cohort, the rate of patients achieving a relative ki67 suppression aeyen50% from baseline was significantly higher in the high vs low strtil group (64 vs. 10%, p = 0.003). geometric mean ki67 suppression was evaluated in each cohort according to strtil: the lowest value (-41%) was observed for high strtil cases treated with chemotherapy. this hypothesis-generating study suggests that in hr+/her2- breast cancer strtil at baseline may influence the achievement of a molecular response after neoadjuvant treatment. further evaluation in large studies is needed, and interaction with the type of treatment warrants to be explored.
fungal_infection	background: the best predictors of short-and medium-term mortality of cirrhotic patients receiving intensive care support are unknown. methods: we conducted meta-analyses from 13 studies (2523 cirrhotics) after selection of original articles and response to a standardized questionnaire by the corresponding authors. end-points were in-icu, in-hospital, and 6-month mortality in icu survivors. a total of 301 pooled analyses, including 95 analyses restricted to 6-month mortality among icu survivors, were conducted considering 249 variables (including reason for admission, organ replacement therapy, and composite prognostic scores). results: in-icu, in-hospital, and 6-month mortality was 42.7, 54.1, and 75.1%, respectively. forty-eight patients (3.8%) underwent liver transplantation during follow-up. in-icu mortality was lower in patients admitted for variceal bleeding (or 0.46; 95% ci 0.36-0.59; p19 at baseline (or 8.54; 95% ci 2.09-34.91; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.93). high sofa no longer predicted mortality at 6 months in icu survivors. twelve variables related to infection were predictors of in-icu mortality, including sirs (or 2.44; 95% ci 1.64-3.65; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.57), pneumonia (or 2.18; 95% ci 1.47-3.22; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.69), sepsis-associated refractory oliguria (or 10.61; 95% ci 4.07-27.63; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.76), and fungal infection (or 4.38; 95% ci 1.11-17.24; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.85). among therapeutics, only dopamine (or 5.57; 95% ci 3.02-10.27; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.68), dobutamine (or 8.92; 95% ci 3.32-23.96; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.86), epinephrine (or 5.03; 95% ci 2.68-9.42; p < 0.001; ppv = 0.77), and mars (or 2.07; 95% ci 1.22-3.53; p = 0.007; ppv = 0.58) were associated with in-icu mortality without heterogeneity. in icu survivors, eight markers of liver and renal failure predicted 6-month mortality, including child-pugh stage c (or 2.43; 95% ci 1.44-4.10; p26 (or 3.97; 95% ci 1.92-8.22; p < 0.0001; ppv = 0.75), and hepatorenal syndrome (or 4.67; 95% ci 1.24-17.64; p = 0.022; ppv = 0.88). conclusions: prognosis of cirrhotic patients admitted to icu is poor since only a minority undergo liver transplant. the prognostic performance of general icu scores decreases over time, unlike the child-pugh and meld scores, even recorded in the context of organ failure. infection-related parameters had a short-term impact, whereas liver and renal failure had a sustained impact on mortality.
fungal_infection	this retrospective study was designed to investigate the incidence, clinical characteristics and prognosis of corneal perforation in patients with fungal keratitis. clinical data of 648 patients who were diagnosed with fungal keratitis in air force general hospital were obtained in this retrospective study. all participants were divided into the corneal perforation (n=156) and non-perforation groups (n=492). the pathogenesis, etiological characteristics, admission date and clinical symptoms were statistically compared between two groups. clinical prognosis of patients presenting with corneal perforation was retrospectively analysed. the incidence rate of corneal perforation in patients with fungal keratitis was 23.7%. no statistical significance was noted between two groups in terms of history of corneal trauma (r=0.218, p=0.640), contact lens wear (r=0.268, p=0.605) and ocular surface diseases (r=0.353, p=0.553). the proportion of patients who were topically administered with glucocorticoid (chi(2)=14.251, p<0.01) and complicated with diabetes mellitus (chi(2)=22.365, p<0.01) considerably differed between two groups. the type of pathogenic fungus and duration of onset before admission significantly differed between two groups (both p0.05). fungal keratitis patients who were administered with glucocorticoid and complicated with diabetes mellitus had a higher risk of corneal perforation compared with their counterparts. type of pathogenic fungus, admission date, size and infiltration depth of corneal lesion and hypopyon probably served as the risk factors of the incidence of corneal perforation in patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis.
fungal_infection	a lung transplant recipient was diagnosed with penicilliosis due to talaromyces marneffei, a fungus endemic in south-east asia, which was acquired by donor transmission. this first case of talaromyces marneffei-transmission by transplantation underscores that current globalisation of travelling necessitates increased vigilance for transmission of unusual pathogens in organ recipients.
weight_loss	background: obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is a common disorder worldwide; however, epidemiological studies on its prevalence lack in saudi arabia. this study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of osa in saudi arabia. methods: the study was performed from 2013 to 2015 in two stages. the screening stage was first; a random sample of saudi employees (n = 2682) 30-60 years of age completed a survey that included the wisconsin questionnaire. according to these data, the subjects were categorized as habitual, moderate, or nonsnorers (nss). the confirmatory second stage was a case-control study conducted on 346 individuals selected from each group using polysomnography (psg). results: in the first stage, the prevalence of habitual snoring was 23.5%, moderate snoring was 16.6%, while 59.9% of the sample was nss. among the 346 individuals who underwent psg, a total of 235 (67.9%) subjects had osa with an apnea-hypopnea index (ahi) of >= 5; 76 (22.0%) had osa syndrome (osas), defined by an ahi of = 5 plus daytime sleepiness; and 227 (65.6%) had clinically diagnosed osa syndrome (cosas), as defined by the american academy of sleep medicine. a conservative estimate of at least 8.8% (12.8% in men and 5.1% in women) was calculated for the overall prevalence of osa. similarly, the overall estimated prevalence of osas and cosas was 2.8% (4.0% in men and 1.8% in women) and 8.5% (12.4% in men and 4.8% in women), respectively. a multivariate analysis revealed age, gender, obesity, and hypertension as independent risk factors of osa. conclusions: our study demonstrated that the rate and risk factors of osa in the saudi population are similar to those observed in western studies.
cancer	purpose: to evaluate the application of whole genome sequencing (wgs) in determining the inter-foci clonal relationship of multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (mptc). methods: after reviewing ptc patient profiles, 8 cancer foci and germline control samples from 3 mptc patients were analyzed by wgs. single nucleotide variations (snvs), copy number variation (cnv), structural variation and mutational signature were examined. results: the multifocality rate of ptc was 35.1% and mptc were shown to have larger primary tumor diameter, higher rate of lymph node metastasis and less number of accompanying non-cancerous lesions than single ptc in one or both gender groups. out of the 8 cancer foci, 5 foci were identified as clonal independent model with the rest 3 foci as clonal-derived model according to exonic snvs spectrum. non-exonic mutations provided compelling evidence at the genome-wide level for the classification. specific cnv and 12 mutational signatures were also identified. conclusions: wgs could be an impressive tool in clonal relationship determination of ptc by providing a panoramic view of genome-wide somatic mutations. the substantial sequencing data provided additional information that could help studying the mechanism of carcinogenesis.

skin_care	synopsis objectivesto exploit the microbial ecology of bacterial metabolite production and, specifically, to: (i) evaluate the potential use of the pigments prodigiosin and violacein as additives to commercial sunscreens for protection of human skin, and (ii) determine antioxidant and antimicrobial activities (against pathogenic bacteria) for these two pigments. methodsprodigiosin and violacein were used to supplement extracts of aloe vera leaf and cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit which are known to have photoprotective activity, as well as some commercial sunscreen preparations. for each, sunscreen protection factors (spfs) were determined spectrophotometrically. assays for antimicrobial activity were carried out using 96-well plates to quantify growth inhibition of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. resultsfor the plant extracts, spfs were increased by an order of magnitude (i.e. up to similar to 3.5) and those for the commercial sunscreens increased by 10-22% (for 4% w/w violacein) and 20-65% (for 4% w/w prodigiosin). the antioxidant activities of prodigiosin and violacein were approximately 30% and 20% those of ascorbic acid (a well-characterized, potent antioxidant). violacein inhibited s.aureus (ic50 6.990.146m) but not e.coli, whereas prodigiosin was effective against both of these bacteria (ic50 values were 0.680.06m and 0.530.03m, respectively). conclusionthe bacterial pigments prodigiosin and violacein exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and were able to increase the spf of commercial sunscreens as well as the extracts of the two plant species tested. these pigments have potential as ingredients for a new product range of and, indeed, represent a new paradigm for sunscreens that utilize substances of biological origin. we discussed the biotechnological potential of these bacterial metabolites for use in commercial sunscreens, and the need for studies of mammalian cells to determine safety.
hypothyroidism	conservative management trends in diverticulitis may lead to increased hospitalizations secondary to repeated attacks. the study aimed to characterize trends in management and risk-assess patients with diverticulitis that required multiple admissions to identify high utilizers. a total of 265,724 patients with diverticulitis were identified from 1995 to 2014 from the new york sparcs database. patients with >= 2 hospital admissions were stratified across demographics, comorbidities, insurance status, and surgical intervention. in total, 42,850 patients had >= 2 hospital admissions. risk factors for >= 2 admissions included younger age, white race, obesity, hypertension, pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. fifty-two percent of these patients went on to have surgery. the percentage of elective cases increased from 59 to 70 %, while emergent cases conversely decreased from 41 to 30 %. one in five patients admitted with diverticulitis required two or more admissions. numerous patient factors were correlated with increased risk of readmission. these factors may be used to guide treatment decisions and help reduce economic burden in frequent utilizers. trends in surgery rates for these patients could reflect improved treatment options and/or changing clinical practice patterns.
skin_care	context: coffee silverskin (cs), a food by-product of the coffee roasting industry, has been studied as an active ingredient for skin care products due to its high potential of antioxidant activity and low cytotoxicity. another food waste used as ingredient with promising characteristics is obtained from medicago sativa (ms), which antioxidants and isoflavones content is high. objective: the aim of this study is to evaluate and characterize a new body formulation containing two food by-products extracts. materials and methods: different parameters (such as ph, rheological behavior, color, antioxidant content and microbiological analysis) of a body cream formulation containing by-products (csms) and a formulation without extracts (f) were evaluated under a stability study during 180 days at different temperatures. moreover, the in vitro cell toxicity and the in vivo skin safety and protective effects were also assessed. results: formulation showed stable physical properties and antioxidant activity during 180 days of storage. in vitro toxicity was screened in two skin cell lines (fibroblasts and keratinocytes) and any toxicity was reported. the in vivo test carried out showed that, with respect to irritant effects, csms formulation can be regarded as safe for topical application and the skin hydratation improved after 30 days of its use. also, considering the consumer acceptance, more than 90% of volunteers classified it as very pleasant. conclusions: csms formulation is stable and safe for topical use as no adverse and/or side effects were observed during the application period of testing, improving skin protective properties.
fungal_infection	myeloperoxidase (mpo), a leukocyte-derived enzyme mainly secreted by activated neutrophils, is known to be involved in the immune response during bacterial and fungal infection and inflammatory diseases. nevertheless, the role of mpo in a parasitic disease like malaria is unknown. we hypothesized that mpo contributes to parasite clearance. to address this hypothesis, we used plasmodium yoelii nonlethal infection in wild-type and mpo-deficient mice as a murine malaria model. we detected high mpo plasma levels in wild-type mice with plasmodium yoelii infection. unexpectedly, infected mpo-deficient mice did not show increased parasite loads but were able to clear the infection more rapidly than wild-type mice. additionally, the presence of neutrophils at the onset of infection seemed not to be essential for the control of the parasitemia. the effect of decreased parasite levels in mpo-deficient mice was absent from animals lacking mature t and b cells, indicating that this effect is most likely dependent on adaptive immune response mechanisms. indeed, we observed increased gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha production by t cells in infected mpo-deficient mice. together, these results suggest that mpo modulates the adaptive immune response during malaria infection, leading to an attenuated parasite clearance.
parenting	the alabama parenting questionnaire (apq) is a well-known tool to assess empirically identified aspects of positive and negative parenting practices. this study evaluates the psychometric properties of an adapted version of the apq for its use with parents of children between 2 and 6 years of age in chile. the participants were 557 parents of children aged 2 to 6 years. a confirmatory factor analysis showed that the best fit was obtained by a four-factor model (positive reinforcement, parental involvement, inconsistency of disciplinary practices, and punitive practices). the invariance analysis for this model by sex and social composition was positive. disciplinary inconsistency and punitive practices were correlated with externalized and internalized behaviors in children. results suggest that this adaptation of the apq may result in a useful tool for clinical and research purposes in this age group.
parenting	nurturing environments within the context of families, schools, and communities all play an important role in enhancing youth 's behavioral choices and health outcomes. the increasing prevalence rates of obesity among youth, especially among low income and ethnic minorities, highlight the need to develop effective and innovative intervention approaches that promote positive supportive environments across different contexts for at-risk youth. we propose that the integration of social cognitive theory, family systems theory, and self-determination theory offers a useful framework for understanding how individual, family, and social-environmental-level factors contribute to the development of nurturing environments. in this paper, we summarize evidence-based randomized controlled trials that integrate positive parenting, motivational, and behavioral skills strategies in different contexts, including primary care, home, community, and school-based settings. taken together, these studies suggest that youth and parents are most likely to benefit when youth receive individual-level behavioral skills, family-level support and communication, and autonomous motivational support from the broader social environment. future investigators and healthcare providers should consider integrating these evidence-based approaches that support the effects of positive social climate-based interventions on promoting healthy eating, physical activity, and weight management in youth.
sprains_and_strains	high-resolution ultrasound imaging of musculoskeletal tissue is increasing in popularity because of patient tolerability, low cost, ability to visualize tissue in real-time motion, and superior resolution of highly organized tissue such as a tendon. prolotherapy, defined as the injection of growth factors or growth factor production stimulants to grow normal cells or tissue, has been a controversial procedure for decades; it is currently gaining in popularity among physiatrists and other musculoskeletal physicians. this report describes imaging of tendons, ligaments, and media] meniscus disease (from trauma or degeneration). although these tissues have been poorly responsive to nonsurgical treatment, it is proposed that tissue growth and repair after prolotherapy in these structures can be documented with ultrasound and confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging. directions for future research application are discussed.
skin_care	aimthis study determined the effect of physician champions on the two main components of kangaroo mother care (kmc): skin-to-skin care and breastfeeding. methodskmc practices among a retrospective cohort of 648 infants admitted to a rural indian neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) between january 5, 2011 and october 7, 2014 were studied. kmc champions were identified based on their performance evaluation. we examined the effect of withdrawing physician champions on overall use, time to initiation and intensity of skin-to-skin care and breastfeeding, using separate models. resultsin comparison with when kmc champions were present, their absence was associated with a 45% decrease in the odds of receiving skin-to-skin care, with a 95% confidence interval (ci) of 64% to 17%, a 38% decrease in the rate of initiation skin-to-skin care (95% ci 53-82%) and an average of 1.47 less hours of skin-to-skin care (95% ci -2.07 to -0.86). breastfeeding practices were similar across the different champion environments. conclusionwithdrawing physician champions from the nicu setting was associated with a decline in skin-to-skin care, but not breastfeeding. training health care workers and community stakeholders to become champions could help to scale up and maintain kmc practices.
overactive_bladder	introduction. mouth and eye dryness are frequently reported by patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) as side effects of antimuscarinic drugs used for neurogenic overactive bladder. we evaluated the impact of antimuscarinic drugs prescription on these symptoms. methods. ms patients consulting for overactive bladder were included. xerostomia were evaluated at baseline and thirty days after treatment by self-reporting questionnaires (xerostomia quality of life [x-qol] and xerostomia questionnaire [xq]), by salivary flow rate and sugar test. xerophtalmia were evaluated by a self-reporting questionnaire (ocular surface disease index [osdi]) and schirmer test. latrogenic anticholinergic impregnation was evaluated by the anticholinergic drug scale. results. from january to december 2014, 35 patients were included. mean age was 50.1 +/- 10.2 years, mean edss = 4.9. mean anticholinergic impregnation was 0.6 +/- 1.0. before treatment, none correlation was found between anticholinergic impregnation and other parameters. twenty-two patients were evaluated after treatment. at baseline and thirty days after treatment, mean scores were respectively: 0.78 +/- 0.51 and 0.73 +/- 0.43 (p= 0.67) for x-qol, 9.22 +/- 11.8 and 7.03 +/- 11.4 (p=0.32) for xq, 18.8 +/- 14.9 and 13.9 +/- 11.6 (p=0.06) for osdi. mean salivary flow rates were respectively 1.54 +/- 1.11 and 1.22 +/- 1.3 (p= 0.53), positive sugar tests concerned respectively 68% and 55% of patients (p= 0.53), and positive schirmer test concerned 50% before and after treatment. conclusion. eye and mouth dryness exist in our ms population, even before prescription of antimuscarinic treatment, and is not getting worse after prescription. those symptoms should not be the reason to stop an efficient treatment, but should be the reason to find and treat their aetiology.

weight_loss	hematopoietic stem cell transplantation carries nutrition-related risks. therefore, nutritional therapy needs to be initiated before transplantation even takes place. we assessed nutritional risk among patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. we assessed nutrient supply (calorie supply and protein supply) by chart review. assessments were made from the pretreatment phase of transplantation to after the end of parenteral nutrition in 51 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation at shizuoka cancer center between 2007 and 2012. we compared nutrition-related adverse events and parameters between two groups: those in whom % loss of body weight was >= 7.5 and those in whom % loss of body weight was < 7.5. a correlation was observed between changes in weight and skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.89; p= 7.5 group and the % loss of body weight < 7.5 group in the following variables: % loss of body weight, nutrient supply from calories and protein; orally ingested nutrient supply from calories and protein; start day of oral intake; and acute graft-versus-host disease. orally ingested calories were negatively correlated with nutrition-related adverse events in both groups. early and customized nutritional intervention may be optimal for all patients who undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation to ameliorate body weight loss associated with nutrition-related adverse events.
headache	posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres) is associated with several symptoms; of those, visual acuity loss, light oversensitivity (photophobia), and light flashes (photopsia) are known as pres-related eye symptoms. we report a post-partum woman with pres associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome (hellp), in whom color vision abnormality (achromatopsia) was the sole manifestation. cesarean section was performed at 28 weeks due to headache, epigastralgia, and severe hypertension. hellp became evident after delivery. on post-partum day 1, she complained of achromatopsia, stating: all things look brownish-gray. ophthalmologic examination was normal, but brain magnetic resonance imaging showed occipital lobe lesions, indicative of pres, and, interestingly, also color vision center (area v4) lesions, suggesting that the achromatopsia had been caused by brain damage. it may be prudent to question hellp patients concerning achromatopsia.
diabetes	aims/hypothesisinsulin resistance (ir) is a risk factor to assess the development of micro- and macro-vascular complications in type 1 diabetes (t1d). however, diabetes management in adults with t1d is limited by the difficulty of lacking simple and reliable methods to estimate insulin resistance. the aim of this study was to develop a new model to estimate ir via clinical parameters in adults with t1d. methodsa total of 36 adults with adulthood onset t1d (n=20) or childhood onset t1d (n=16) were recruited by quota sampling. after an overnight insulin infusion to stabilize the blood glucose at 5.6 to 7.8mmol/l, they underwent a 180-minute euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. glucose disposal rate (gdr, mgkg(-1)min(-1)) was calculated by data collected from the last 30minutes during the test. demographic factors (age, sex, and diabetes duration) and metabolic parameters (blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin a(1c) [hba(1c)], waist to hip ratio [whr], and lipids) were collected to evaluate insulin resistance. then, age at diabetes onset and clinical parameters were used to develop a model to estimate lngdr by stepwise linear regression. resultsfrom the stepwise process, a best model to estimate insulin resistance was generated, including hba(1c), diastolic blood pressure, and whr. age at diabetes onset did not enter any of the models. we proposed the following new model to estimate ir as in gdr for adults with t1d: lngdr=4.964-0.121xhba(1c) (%)-0.012xdiastolic blood pressure (mmhg)-1.409xwhr, (adjusted r-2=0.616, p<.01). conclusions/interpretationinsulin resistance in adults living with t1d can be estimated using routinely collected clinical parameters. this simple model provides a potential tool for estimating ir in large-scale epidemiological studies of adults with t1d regardless of age at onset.
emergency_contraception	objective to collectively assess consumer attitudes towards and satisfaction with emergency contraception (ec) counselling by student pharmacists in two different locations: an academic healthcare clinic and a retail pharmacy. methods ec counselling was provided by trained student pharmacists utilizing a standardized education toolkit. participants were asked to rate the counselling at the end of the knowledge survey. in addition to descriptive statistics, we compared the self-reported attitudes and satisfaction with the counselling between the two sites. key findings the majority of participants from both settings rated 'strongly agree' on the attitude and satisfaction statements for the ec counselling. participants from the clinic setting rated higher in two of the four statements than the participants from the retail setting. conclusions participants had positive attitudes towards and were highly satisfied with the ec counselling in both settings. ec counselling should be encouraged in practice settings.
headache	background many studies have shown that migraine patients have an interictal habituation deficit of visual evoked potentials (veps). some discordant results were attributed to non-blinded analyses and a lack of repeatability. aims in this study, we compared blinded and non-blinded analyses of the same recordings and assessed test-retest repeatability. methods vep recordings of 25 healthy volunteers (hvs) and 78 episodic migraine patients (ems; 52 interictal, 26 ictal) were analysed by two investigators, one of whom was blinded to diagnosis and headache phase. twelve hvs and nine ems had two recordings for test repeatability. results in both blinded and non-blinded analyses, vep habituation was normal in hvs and ems during an attack, but deficient in ems interictally. intra-individual habituation percentages were highly correlated in two recordings separated by 7 days. conclusions the studies showing a vep habituation deficit in migraineurs between attacks are unlikely to be biased by non-blinding analysis or poor repeatability.
birth_control	inhalation is one of the entry ports for different chemicals into the human body. in order to investigate this application route and its negative health effect to humans, the presence of volatile organic compounds (vocs) in indoor air is monitored since many years. to assess global trends and changes of the distribution and disposition of vocs and the corresponding personal exposure, this study analyzed annual indoor air concentrations collected over a period of 9 (2006-2014) years in the context of a birth control cohort study of 72 vocs. additionally, short time-series expression model (stem) was used to identify certain correlation for vocs from different compound classes. for similar to 42 % of the compounds, a tendency to lower annual median indoor air concentrations was found, and for similar to 10 % of the vocs, a trend to higher annual median indoor air concentrations. no such tendencies were observed for similar to 22 % of the investigated compounds. for similar to 26 % of the vocs, the applied linear regression model was not suitable to predict global trends as annual median values were not linearly distributed. mann-kendall test was used to (i) confirm the results from the linear regression model and to (ii) calculate trends for those compounds, where linear regression was found to be unsuitable. thus, for only approximately four of the investigated vocs, no prediction was possible using both statistical approaches. stem analysis revealed the connection of benzene, ethylbenzene, m+p xylene, alpha-pinene, 3-carene, pentadecane, and decamethlycyclopentasiloxane, in addition to the correlation of 1-butanol, chlorobenzene, heptanal, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol concentrations.
emergency_contraception	background: family planning is the key that help the individuals or couples to avoid unwanted births, to regulate the interval between pregnancies, control the time at which birth occurs in relation to the age of parents and determines the number of children in the family. objectives: 1) to investigate the knowledge and practice of contraceptive methods among the educated working women. 2) to assess women 's knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to emergency contraception. material and methods: a cross sectional study was conducted in 122 respondents among the educated working women in guntur. women in the reproductive age group (18-49 years) were interviewed by administering a pretested mixed questionnaire containing open and closed ended questions after taking an informed consent. the collected data was compiled, processed and analyzed. results: out of 122 women, 115(94.26%) were aware of contraceptive methods. of 103 married women 82 women (79.61%) practiced contraception. a total of 33.98% (35) and 57.28% (59) of the women practiced temporary and permanent methods respectively. the major source of information is electronic and print media 55.65% followed by medical literature 31.30%. out of 122 women, 38 women (31.14%) were aware of emergency contraception and only 3 women (2.45%) practiced emergency contraception. conclusions: awareness and usage of contraception was high in this educated working-women population. permanent method was more preferred than temporary methods. however, a low percentage of women were aware of emergency contraception. hence, programs must be implemented to create more awareness on emergency contraception.
cancer	brain metastasis is common and carries a poor prognosis in melanoma. a single institution, retrospective cohort of 225 melanoma patients was analyzed to determine if braf-v600 mutational status was associated with brain metastasis. eighty-three of the 225 patients (37%) had braf-v600 mutations. at initial diagnosis, braf-v600 mutations were associated with younger age (p0.001), higher proportion of females (p=0.0037), higher ajcc stage (p=0.030), regional lymph node involvement (p=0.047), and family history of cancer (p=0.044). compared to braf-wt, braf-v600 patients had an increased risk of brain metastasis in multivariate analysis (or=2.24; 95% cl=1.10-4.58; p=0.027). however, braf-v600 patients treated with a selective braf inhibitor (brafi) had a similar risk of brain metastasis compared to braf-wt patients (or=1.00; 95% cl=0.37-2.65; p=0.98). moreover, treatment with brafi significantly prolonged the time from initial diagnosis to brain metastasis diagnosis (hr=0.30; 95% cl=0.11-0.79; p=0.015). compared to other tissues, the brain was the most frequent site of metastasis in braf-v600 patients without brafi (42% 7%). the frequency of brain metastasis was lower in braf-wt and braf-v600 patients with brafi (25% 4% and 25% +/- 8%, respectively). the proportion of patients with brain metastasis as the only site was 40%, 60%, and 0% in the braf-wt, braf-v600 without brafi, and braf-v600 with brafi groups, respectively. this study provides evidence on the clinical importance of braf-v600 mutations and braf inhibition in the progression to melanoma brain metastasis. what 's new? when melanoma spreads to the brain, it usually kills the patient inside a year. how can these metastases be predicted and stopped before they become lethal? these authors investigated whether a mutation in the braf gene increases the chances of brain metastasis. from a cohort of 225 melanoma patients, they showed that those carrying a mutation at braf-v600 developed brain metastases more often than those with normal copies of the gene. when patients with the braf-v600 mutation received treatment with braf inhibitor, however, the effect was reversed, and patients experienced the same risk as those without braf mutations.
allergies	to improve access to information on patient history in case of emergency, it should be possible in the future for data for use in an emergency to be stored on the german electronic health card, according to the wishes of the insured person. as a basis, the german medical association developed an emergency dataset that offers the possibility of storing information on existing diagnoses, medications, allergies, medical implants and other information relevant in an emergency. in the present study, the emergency dataset was tested with regard to the usability and the potential benefits from the perspective of clinicians, emergency physicians and paramedics. to test the emergency dataset a two-phase exploratory study was conducted. in phase i of the study 13 primary care physicians completed a total of 64 emergency datasets. in phase ii of the study these datasets were then evaluated from an emergency medicine perspective by 14 clinicians, 14 emergency physicians and 9 paramedics on the basis of fictitious emergency scenarios. the whole validation process was performed purely on paper. clinicians, emergency physicians and paramedics rated the emergency dataset in more than 70 % of the cases reviewed as being of very great or of great benefit. the data fields medication and diagnosis received the highest benefit ratings. the study results indicate the high potential benefits of the emergency dataset in real patient care situations and a further contribution to the optimisation of patient safety can be expected if there is extensive distribution.
parkinson's_disease	during catabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine (kyn) pathway, several endogenous metabolites with neuromodulatory properties are produced, of which kynurenic acid (kyna) is one of the highest significance. the causal role of altered kyna production has been described in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., parkinson 's disease, huntington 's disease, schizophrenia) and therefore kynurenergic manipulation with the aim of therapy has recently been proposed. conventionally, kyna is produced from its precursor l-kyn with the aid of the astrocytic kynurenine aminotransferase-2 (kat-2) in the murine brain. although the mouse is a standard therapeutic research organism, the presence of kat-2 in mice has not been described in detail. this study demonstrates the presence of kat-2 mrna and protein throughout the adult c57bl6 mouse brain. in addition to the former expression data from the rat, we found prominent kat-2 expression not only in the astrocyte, but also in neurons in several brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, substantia nigra, striatum, and prefrontal cortex). a significant number of the kat-2 positive neurons were positive for gad67; the presence of the kat-2 enzyme we could also demonstrate in mice brain homogenate and in cells overexpressing recombinant mouse kat-2 protein. this new finding attributes a new role to interneuron-derived kyna in neuronal network operation. furthermore, our results suggest that the thorough investigation of the spatio-temporal expression pattern of the relevant enzymes of the kyn pathway is a prerequisite for developing and understanding the pharmacological and transgenic murine models of kynurenergic manipulation.
hypothyroidism	background the objective of this study is to overview the attempts of suicide in young females and its relation to pcos and thyroid profile dysfunction. world health report puts that the yearly global prevalence of suicide attempt varies between 2% to 20%. 1 the incidence of attempted suicide is greatly influenced by the differences in age, sex, race, religion, culture, marital status, habitat, climate and social systems. 2 this study aimed to analyse risk factor, mode of attempt, and spectrum association with pcos, thyroid dysfunction in young females. materials and methods the present study was conducted in department of medicine with history of attempted suicides from march 2015 to may 2016 (100 cases). all female (15-49 years) subjects meeting the selection criteria were evaluated. results there were a total of 738 female patients admitted in the emergency ward of our tertiary care centre during the study period of one and half years from 1st march 2015 till 31st may 2016. during this study period, 100 patients of attempt of suicide who were admitted to the medical icu of our tertiary care centre were studied. this resulted in a prevalence of 8.9%, and incidence of attempt of suicides were 96% cases of poisoning out of which 27% were unmarried and 69% were married females and the rest 4% by hanging with 2% each. evaluation of hospitalised patients due to suicidal attempt showed pcos in 14% cases and hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in 16% and 1% cases respectively. among cases with hypothyroidism, signs of depression were present in 81% cases (n=13) whereas 19% cases (n=3) had stress. signs of frustration, anxiety, stress & depression were present in 7%, 7%, 29% and 57% cases respectively among those diagnosed to have pcos. overall, there were 58% cases of stress which led to suicidal attempt. conclusion present study revealed importance of hormonal changes which occur in pcos, hypothyroidism and causes psychophysical changes in young and reproductively active females. an attempt is made to focus on all these issues so that in future we can intervene early and prevent complications.
fungal_infection	introduction: vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) is a common medical health problem of adult women. it is most commonly caused by candida albicans. but there is a change in fungal profile. sabouraud 's dextrose agar (sda) is the most common culture medium used where mixed fungal infection may be missed. it can be detected easily by using chromogenic culture medium. aim: to know the fungal profile of vulvovaginal candidiasis using candida chromagar and antifungal susceptibility pattern in patients attending tertiary care hospital. materials and methods: culture confirmed cases of vvc presented at department of obstetrics and gynaecology of jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research (jipmer), puducherry, india, from july 2015 to december 2015 were included in the cross- sectional study. two high vaginal swabs were collected and inoculated on sda and candida chromagar (hi- media, mumbai, india). after overnight incubation the colonies were counted and colour of the colonies were recorded from candida chromagar. candida spp. were identified by sugar fermentation and assimilation tests and other conventional tests. antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by the disc diffusion method using fluconazole (25 mu g) and voriconazole (1 mu g) as per the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi-m44-a2) guidelines. results: a total of 50 culture confirmed (23.7%) cases were detected from 211 clinically suspected vvc cases. candida glabrata (45.1%) was the most common isolate, followed by candida tropicalis (23.5%), candida albicans (17.6%), candida krusei (9.8%) and candida parapsilosis (3.9%). one mixed infection of c. glabrata and c. albicans was identified on candida chromagar. mixed fungal infection was observed in 2% of positive culture and 0.5% of vvc cases. the antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that 15.7% and 9.8% isolates of candida spp. were resistant and susceptible dose dependent (s-dd) respectively to fluconazole. the increase resistant against fluconazole was because of increased isolation of c. glabrata strains. all strains of candida spp. were susceptible to voriconazole. conclusion: c. glabrata was the most common causative agent of vvc in a tertiary care hospital. chromogenic culture medium facilitates detection of mixed fungal infection. in vitro susceptibility testing should be used to guide the treatment especially in cases of non-albicans candidiasis.
parenting	how do emerging and enduring conditions of motherhood in taiwan shape mothers' interactions with children who are gender or sexually nonconforming? bridging research on the transformation of mothering discourses in taiwan and globally with the small but growing body of work on lgbt family of origin relationships, this article argues that women 's experiences of raising gender and sexually nonconforming children are integrally shaped by the conditions of gender and family inequality in their own lives. these inequalities are sometimes challenged but often reinscribed by new parenting discourses and resources that have proliferated in late 20th and early 21st century taiwan, including new forms of parental labor, accountability for child outcomes, and emerging expert voices on sexuality and parenthood. this analysis is rooted in ethnographic fieldwork and family history interviews with gender and sexually nonconforming people and with their families of origin throughout taiwan, with emphasis on heterosexual mothers' narratives.
sports_injuries	introduction: enduro is an off road motorcycling event. it is a fast, exciting adventure sport with increasing numbers of participants and competitions. materials and methods: we performed search of pubmed, medline, cinahl, and embase databases using the following keywords 'enduro injuries', 'off-road motorcycle injuries' and 'enduro sport'. we identified four studies which described the physiological characteristic of enduro riders and the injury pattern sustained by these athletes. results: hands, wrists and forearms are the predominant areas of overuse in enduro riders. the extremities are the most injured parts in enduro. however, 98% of these injuries are mild to moderate with abbreviated injury scale grades 1 and 2. conclusion: there is paucity of published data on enduro injuries. in depth understanding of the physiological aspect of enduro riders with close monitoring of injuries is needed to promote safety measures in enduro and to reduce risk factors of injury which in turn can help to make enduro a safe alternative to the other dangerous motorcycling sports.
polycythemia_vera	background: hydroxyurea (hu) is among the most commonly used cytoreductive treatments for polycythemia vera (pv), but previous research and clinical experience suggest that not all patients respond optimally, consistently, or durably to hu treatment. this study investigated patterns of hu use and impact on disease control among patients with pv in real-world clinical practice in the united states. methods: oncologists and hematologists recruited between april and july 2014 reported data from patient charts. treatment history and disease symptom comparisons between hu subgroups were performed using chi square tests or one-way analyses of variance for categorical and continuous variables. other analyses were performed using descriptive statistics. results: overall, 329 physicians participated and provided data on 1309 patients with pv (62.3 % male; mean age = 62.5 years, mean time since diagnosis = 5.2 years). in the 229 (17.5 %) patients who had stopped hu, the most common reasons for hu discontinuation-as assessed by the treating clinician-were inadequate response (29.3 %), intolerance (27.5 %), and disease progression (12.7 %). among patients currently on hu, a significant proportion had elevated blood cell counts: 34.4 % had hematocrit values >= 45 %, 59.4 % had platelet levels >400 x 10(9)/l, and 58.2 % had wbc counts >10 x 10(9)/l. two-thirds (66.3 %) of patients had >= 1 elevated count, 40.3 % had >= 2 elevated counts, and 19.8 % had all 3 counts elevated. the most common pv-related signs and symptoms among all patients were fatigue and splenomegaly. conclusions: although many patients with pv benefit from hu therapy, some continue to have suboptimal control of their disease, as evidenced by persistence of abnormally elevated blood cell counts and the continued experience of disease-related manifestations (signs and symptoms). these data further denote a significant medical need for some patients with pv currently or previously treated with hu.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	bioactive food chemicals are substances present in food that are capable of interacting with living cells causing changes in physiological functions. salicylic acid ( sa), a plant hormone involved in plant immune response, is one such bioactive food chemical. aspirin, a commercially available sa, might play beneficial roles in cardiovascular health and colon cancer. it may also cause urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and gastrointestinal symptoms in sa-sensitive individuals. dietary sa might exert similar beneficial effects and/or may induce similar symptoms in hypersensitive individuals. food-related sa sensitivity in relation to gastrointestinal symptoms is not well documented besides a few self-reported questionnaires and the knowledge that low doses of aspirin (equivalent of high dietary intake) can cause gastrointestinal injury. the only direct evidence that suggests benefits of reducing dietary sa was reported in asthmatic individuals. although sa sensitivity in relation to gut symptoms in susceptible individuals is accepted by clinicians, the detection of this disease remains a challenge because of the complicated nature of dietary challenges and the risk of oral aspirin provocation tests in patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions. given the non-ige mediated nature of the disease, in vitro assays like basophil activation may have failed to produce reliable results. however, given the simplicity of this assay, further studies need to be formulated to firmly establish its reliability. formulation of proper dietary strategies for symptom control is also impossible given the controversial and scant nature of the data on sa content of food. this issue needs to be resolved to formulate proper dietary strategies for effective symptom control.
alzheimer's_disease	vascular smooth muscle cell (vsmc) accumulation and hypertrophy are common in vascular disorders, and inflammation has a crucial role in the development of these diseases. to investigate the effect of inflammation on the neurotransmission of vsmc, bioinformatic analysis was performed, following next generation sequencing. genes of lipopolysaccharide (lps)-treated a7r5 cells and phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)-treated a7r5 cells were sequenced via next generation sequencing, and each assay was repeated three times. differentially expressed genes (degs) were obtained using the noiseq package in r. subsequently, their potential functions were predicted by functional and pathway enrichment analyses using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery online tool. interaction relationships of the proteins enriched in pathways associated with neurological diseases, the proteins which had interaction relationships with adrenoceptor 1d (adra1d) or calcium voltage-gated channel subunit 1 s (cacna1s), separately, were obtained from string, and protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks were constructed using cytoscape software. a total of 2,038 degs, including 1,094 upregulated and 944 downregulated genes in the lps treatment group were identified when compared with the control group. enrichment analyses showed that nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit v2 (ndufv2) was involved in several neurological diseases, including oxidative phosphorylation, alzheimer 's disease, parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease. furthermore, ndufv2 (degree, 20) had a higher degree in the ppi network for degs enriched in pathways associated with neurological diseases. in the ppi network for adra1d, cacna1s and the degs interacting with them, prohibitin (phb), oxytocin receptor (oxtr), collapsin response mediator protein 1 (crmp1) and dihydropyrimidinase like 2 (dpysl2) had interaction relationships with both adra1d and cacna1s. to conclude, the present study revealed that ndufv2, phb, oxtr, crmp1 and dpysl2 may have key roles in the effect of inflammation on neurotransmission of vsmc.
fungal_infection	invasive fungal infections, an important cause of mortality, are primarily treated using amphotericin b, which is available in different formulations, both conventional and lipid-based (liposomal, lipid complex, colloidal dispersion and intralipid (r) infusion). the aim of our study was to determine the efficacy and safety of conventional amphotericin b vs its lipid-based formulations. a systematic review followed by pairwise meta-analysis was performed, including randomised controlled trials (rcts) that evaluated the use of lipid-based amphotericin b in patients with any degree of immunosuppression and susceptibility to invasive fungal infection. an electronic search was conducted using pubmed, scopus, web of science and scielo databases. extracted outcomes were related to efficacy (cure) and safety (incidence of adverse events). results were evaluated and meta-analyses were performed. twenty-three rcts were identified (n=2677 participants) for meta-analysis. no significant differences between conventional amphotericin b and any of the five formulations evaluated were observed, with regard to the efficacy analysis. with respect to the adverse events of nephrotoxicity, fever, chills and vomiting, all lipid formulations presented better profiles than the conventional formulation. the present systematic review and meta-analysis showed that conventional amphotericin b presents the same efficacy profile.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's is a neurodegenerative disease affecting large populations worldwide characterized mainly by progressive loss of memory along with various other symptoms. the foremost cause of the disease is still unclear, however various mechanisms have been proposed to cause the disease that include amyloid hypothesis, tau hypothesis, and cholinergic hypothesis in addition to genetic factors. various genes have been known to be involved which are apoe, psen1, psen2, and app among others. in the present study, we have used computational methods to examine the pathogenic effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with abca7, cr1, ms4a6a, cd2ap, psen1, psen2, and app genes. the snps were obtained from dbsnp database followed by identification of deleterious snps and prediction of their functional impact. prediction of disease-associated mutations was performed and the impact of the mutations on the stability of the protein was carried out. to study the structural significance of the computationally prioritized mutations on the proteins, molecular dynamics simulation studies were carried out. on analysis, the snps with ids rs76282929 abca7; cr1 rs55962594; ms4a6a rs601172; cd2ap rs61747098; psen1 rs63750231, rs63750265, rs63750526, rs63750577, rs63750687, rs63750815, rs63750900, rs63751037, rs63751163, rs63751399; psen2 rs63749851; and app rs63749964, rs63750066, rs63750734, and rs63751039 were predicted to be deleterious and disease-associated having significant structural impact on the proteins. the current study proposes a precise computational methodology for the identification of disease-associated snps.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) may play a vital role in the homeostatic regulation of intestinal barrier integrity. we aimed to investigate the physiological role of bdnf in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using postinflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (pi-ibs) mice and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. methodspostinflammatory-ibs mice were induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and allowed to recover for 28days. frequency of defecation, fecal water content, colonic epithelial integrity and expressions of bdnf and tight junction (tj) proteins (occludin, zo-1, claudin-1, claudin-2) of the pi-ibs mice were investigated. based on the results of animal studies, we further performed rt-pcr and western blots to assess how bdnf stimulation and bdnf knockdown impacted tj proteins in the ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells. key resultswater content of stools was significantly increased in the pi-ibs mice compared with controls. colonic mucosa from the pi-ibs mice displayed epithelial barrier defects and exhibited increased protein expressions of bdnf and claudin-2 and decreased protein expressions of occludin, zo-1 and claudin-1. furthermore, a sirna against bdnf in the ht-29 cells could effectively suppress bdnf gene and protein expressions, and subsequently reduce tj gene and protein levels. when the ht-29 cells were incubated with different doses of exogenous bdnf, significant increases of occludin, zo-1 and claudin-1 and decreases of claudin-2 protein were observed. conclusions & inferencesbdnf may play a role in regulating intestinal epithelial barrier via affecting the expression of tj proteins.
hypothyroidism	due to the manifold effects of thyroid hormone across virtually all organ systems, the complications associated with thyroid dysfunction are numerous and diverse. the stresses encountered during the perioperative period may exacerbate underlying thyroid disorders, potentially precipitating decompensation and even death. thus, it is of the utmost importance for the clinician to comprehend the mechanisms by which thyroid disease may complicate surgery and postoperative recovery and to be cognizant of the most effective means of optimizing the status of thyrotoxic and hypothyroid patients perioperatively. this article describes the adverse effects of thyroid dysfunction as they relate to the patient undergoing both thyroid and nonthyroid surgery and recommends treatment approaches aimed at decreasing perioperative risk.
allergies	sterile (noninfected) inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of many widespread diseases, such as allergies and autoimmune diseases. the evolutionarily conserved innate immune system is considered to play a key role in tissue injury recognition and the subsequent development of sterile inflammation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. here, we show that cholesterol sulfate, a molecule present in relatively high concentrations in the epithelial layer of barrier tissues, is selectively recognized by mincle (clec4e), a c-type lectin receptor of the innate immune system that is strongly up-regulated in response to skin damage. mincle activation by cholesterol sulfate causes the secretion of a range of proinflammatory mediators, and s.c. injection of cholesterol sulfate results in a mincle-mediated induction of a severe local inflammatory response. in addition, our study reveals a role of mincle as a driving component in the pathogenesis of allergic skin inflammation. in a well-established model of allergic contact dermatitis, the absence of mincle leads to a significant suppression of the magnitude of the skin inflammatory response as assessed by changes in ear thickness, myeloid cell infiltration, and cytokine and chemokine secretion. taken together, our results provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying sterile inflammation.
cancer	methylation is an important epigenetic dna modification that governs gene expression. the genomic level of methylated dna and its derivatives may serve as important indicators for the initiation and. progression of cancers among other diseases. in this effort we propose a new laser wrapped graphene-ag array as a highly sensitive surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers) sensor for the detection of methylated dna (5-methylcytosine, 5 mc) and its oxidation derivatives namely 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmc) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-cac). excellent sensitivity and reproducibility were achieved with the laser wrapped graphene-ag array as a substrate, with the graphene layer acting as an enhancer of the sers signal due to the effective coupling of the electromagnetic field. in summary, fast (less than 60 min) and sensitive (at a limit of detection 0.2 pg mu l-1, ie. 1.8 pmol l-1) detection of methylated dna and its derivatives was realized with the ability to distinguish methylation levels from a mixture at 0.1%. the sensitive and accurate detection in dna extracted from cells was also accomplished. furthermore our graphene wrapped approach circumvents the direct interaction between ag array and the analytes, thus improving the reusability of the sers substrate even after five cycles of use.
low_testosterone	angina pectoris is the symptomatic manifestation of transient myocardial ischaemia. at the most fundamental level, angina arises when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds the ability of the coronary circulation to provide adequate oxygen delivery to maintain normal myocardial metabolic function. in vivo, the balance of oxygen demand and delivery is a complex physiological process that can be altered by a variety of interventions. lifestyle modification is a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease management, with or without angina. additional pharmaceutical and physical interventions are usually applied to patients with angina. mechanisms of action for these interventions include heart rate modulation, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, metabolic manipulation, revascularization, and others. a number of these interventions have overlapping mechanisms that target angina. additionally, some interventions may directly or indirectly prevent or delay adverse outcomes such as myocardial infarction or death. this review summarizes current evidence for many applied ischaemia treatments documented to modify angina and comments on available evidence relating to improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.
hepatitis_c	we evaluated the preoperative prevalence of risk factors for liver disorders and the relationship between the liver disorders and perioperative outcomes in adult congenital heart disease (achd) patients. this retrospective study included 32 achd patients who underwent reoperative cardiac surgery. preoperatively, 38% of the study patients had risk factors, including congestive liver (cl) due to right heart failure (31%), chronic hepatitis c (hc) (22%), and both cl and hc (16%). the numbers of patients with child-pugh scores 5, 6, 7 and 8 were 22, 7, 2 and 1. median (range) preoperative platelet count and fibrinogen values were 155 (61-330) x 10(3)/mu l and 250 (145-367) mg/dl, respectively. the patients with higher child-pugh scores tended to have longer duration of anesthesia and surgery (p = 0.078, 0.078, respectively), and had significantly higher platelet transfusion (p = 0.031). lower platelet count was associated with longer duration of anesthesia, surgery and cardio pulmonary bypass (cpb), and larger amount of blood loss and platelet transfusion (p = 0.01, 0.011, 0.024, 0.033, 0.021). lower fibrinogen value was associated with longer duration of anesthesia, surgery and cpb, and larger amount of platelet transfusion (p = 0.015, 0.009, 0.009, 0.023). achd patients who underwent reoperative cardiac surgery had a high prevalence of risk factors for liver disorders preoperatively, and liver disorders aggravated some intraoperative outcomes. these findings suggest that the prevention of liver disorders is important for reducing the occurrence of poor outcomes, and that achd patients with liver disorders need attentive perioperative management.
polycythemia_vera	post-transplant erythrocytosis is an infrequent complication and has been reported after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-hsct) in aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. the pre-disposing factors and treatment are not clearly defined. we present 11 post-transplant erythrocytosis cases. more studies should be conducted to distinguish the pathogenesis and follow-up for this rare complication.
fungal_infection	pathogenic fungi have developed many strategies to evade the host immune system. multiple escape mechanisms appear to function together to inhibit attack by the various stages of both the adaptive and the innate immune response. thus, after entering the host, such pathogens fight to overcome the immune system to allow their survival, colonization and spread to different sites of infection. consequently, the establishment of a successful infectious process is closely related to the ability of the pathogen to modulate attack by the immune system. most strategies employed to subvert or exploit the immune system are shared among different species of fungi. in this review, we summarize the main strategies employed for immune evasion by some of the major pathogenic fungi.
weight_loss	purpose oncology practice guidelines recommend incorporating weight management efforts throughout survivorship care; however, some oncologists raise concerns about implementing weight management counseling without damaging patient-provider relationships. this study explores cancer survivors' receptivity to weight management counseling and examines whether views of counseling effectiveness are associated with individual characteristics including health-related perceptions or psychological distress. methods patients presenting to a nci comprehensive cancer center gynecologic oncology ambulatory clinic were asked to complete a survey assessing health and weight history, health perceptions, psychological distress, provider preferences, and weight management counseling perceptions. results two hundred forty-four gynecologic cancer patients (38% endometrial, 37% ovarian, 16% cervical, 8% other) completed surveys. mean participant bmi was 31.6 (sd = 9.6); 69% were overweight/obese. most survivors (>= 85%) agreed that oncologists should discuss healthy eating, exercise, and weight loss; only 14% reported receiving weight management counseling from their oncologist. 79% reported being more likely to attempt weight loss if counseled by a physician; 59% reported counseling would not be offensive. regression results indicated that viewing weight management counseling as effective was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and greater enjoyment of physical activity, while viewing counseling unfavorably was associated with a history of attempting multiple weight loss strategies and an overall view of healthy behaviors as less beneficial (ps < .05). conclusions most gynecologic cancer survivors want weight management counseling from oncologists and believe counseling is effective rather than deleterious, yet obesity remains inadequately addressed. results from this study highlight important topics to be incorporated into weight management counseling.
skin_care	skin-bleaching practices, such as using skin creams and soaps to achieve a lighter skin tone, are common throughout the world and are triggered by cosmetic reasons that oftentimes have deep historical, economic, sociocultural, and psychosocial roots. exposure to chemicals in the bleaching products, notably, mercury (hg), hydroquinone, and steroids, has been associated with a variety of adverse health effects, such as hg poisoning and exogenous ochronosis. in new york city (nyc), skin care product use has been identified as an important route of hg exposure, especially among caribbean-born blacks and dominicans. however, surprisingly sparse information is available on the epidemiology of the health impacts of skin-bleaching practices among these populations. we highlight the dearth of large-scale, comprehensive, community-based, clinical, and translational research in this area, especially the limited skin-bleaching-related research among non-white populations in the us. we offer five new research directions, including investigating the known and under-studied health consequences among populations for which the skin bleach practice is newly emerging at an alarming rate using innovative laboratory and statistical methods. we call for conducting methodologically rigorous, multidisciplinary, and culturally sensitive research in order to provide insights into the root and the epidemiological status of the practice and provide evidence of exposure-outcome associations, with an ultimate goal of developing potential intervention strategies to reduce the health burdens of skin-bleaching practice.
headache	the agony that accompanies the incidence and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (tmds) is an important concern in the oral and maxillofacial region. the objective of this study was to explore the clinical findings after centric relation occlusal splint (cros) treatment and intra-articular injection treatment with liquid phase concentrated growth factors (lpcgfs) in patients with disc displacement without reduction (ddwor). the group under investigation of this retrospective cohort study included patients with ddwor who received treatment from april 2014 until march 2016. the predictor variable was the therapeutic method. the outcome variables included joint crepitus sound, visual analog scale (vas) of temporomandibular joint (tmj) arthralgia, tmd-associated headache, myofascial pain with referral, deviation of the mandible during opening (dom), and maximal interincisal opening (mio). at the stage of cros treatment, evaluation of all variables adopted the individual as the unit; at the stage after lpcgf injection, the evaluation of joint sound adopted the joint as the unit, whereas the other variables adopted the individual as the unit. among the 29 patients, 6 (20.68%) were males and 23 (79.31%) were females. distribution by age ranged from 15 to 84 years (mean age 39.55 +/- 15.49 years). after cros treatment, except for the joint crepitus sound, which failed to achieve significant improvement (p >0.05), other symptoms, such as dom, tmd-associated headache, myofascial pain with referral, tmj arthralgia, and mio, all achieved statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05). after 2ml of lpcgf was injected once after cros treatment, 26 joint crepitus sound symptoms were relieved (p < 0.001) after an average of 48.5 +/- 64.1 days. cros alone can alleviate tmd clinical symptoms, except for the joint crepitus sound. approximately 72.2% of joint crepitus sounds could be improved within 48 days, on average, once 2 ml of lpcgf was injected. comparisons were still required in the future, with the effects of other therapeutic methods.
sports_injuries	introduction: decisions regarding return to play after sports-related concussion partially revolve around athletes' self-reported symptoms. given this emphasis on symptoms, it would be beneficial to be able to identify characteristics that could predict which athletes may be susceptible to developing an increase in postconcussion symptoms following head injury. the purpose of this study was to describe the symptoms that athletes endorse immediately following concussion and to determine what impact injury-related characteristics have on the development of postconcussion symptoms within the first week following concussion. method: participants included 54 collegiate athletes who sustained concussions and were referred to our concussion management program for postconcussion testing. the main outcome measures included the post-concussion symptom scale and an interview querying athletes' retrospective symptoms over time, starting immediately postinjury. results: descriptive statistics revealed that the most common immediate symptoms following concussion include dizziness (endorsed by 83.6% of the sample), headache (65.5%), feeling in a fog (61.8%), and visual disturbance (60.0%). logistic regression analyses indicated that retrograde and anterograde amnesia, as well as loss of consciousness, were not significantly predictive of postconcussion symptoms within one week following concussion (p >.05). however, the total symptom score assessed immediately postinjury, in addition to endorsing immediate headache symptoms following concussion, reliably predicted a higher level of symptom reporting in the first week following concussion (p < .05). finally, receiver-operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis, using 80% sensitivity to predict the high postconcussion symptom group, established cutoff scores of 7.5 for the immediate total symptom score and 0.5 for immediate headache. conclusions: these findings demonstrate the importance of evaluating symptoms immediately following concussion. athletes who endorse more immediate postconcussion symptoms, especially headache symptoms, may be at risk for greater and more severe postconcussion symptoms within the first week following concussion. the present findings have implications for the management and treatment of sports-related concussions.
emergency_contraception	rapid, sensitive, selective and accurate lc/ms/ms method was developed for quantitative determination of levonorgestrel (lng) in rat plasma and further validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, matrix effect, recovery efficiency and stability. liquid-liquid extraction procedure using hexane:ethyl acetate mixture at 80:20 v:v ratio was employed to efficiently extract lng from rat plasma. reversed phase luna column c18(2) (50 x 2.0 mm i.d., 3 mu m) installed on a ab sciex triple quad (tm) 4500 lc/ms/ms system was used to perform chromatographic separation. lng was identified within 2 min with high specificity. linear calibration curve was drawn within 0.5-50 ng.ml(-1) concentration range. the developed method was validated for intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision whose values fell in the acceptable limits. matrix effect was found to be minimal. recovery efficiency at three quality control (qc) concentrations 0.5 (low), 5 (medium) and 50 (high) ng.ml-1 was found to be >90%. stability of lng at various stages of experiment including storage, extraction and analysis was evaluated using qc samples, and the results showed that lng was stable at all the conditions. this validated method was successfully used to study the pharmacokinetics of lng in rats after subq injection, providing its applicability in relevant preclinical studies.

allergies	objectives: to characterize comorbidities, health-related quality-of-life (hrqol), productivity, and healthcare resource use in adults with atopic dermatitis (ad) relative to those without ad, and to evaluate the impact of patient-reported ad severity on these outcomes.methods: data were from the 2013 national health and wellness survey (nhws), which collected self-reported information on demographics, comorbidities, hrqol (sf-36v2 health survey), productivity (work productivity and impairment questionnaire [wpai]), and healthcare utilization, which were weighted to the us general population. the ad cohort consisted of subjects who reported that they experienced ad within the past 12 months (n=428), and the non-ad cohort included all subjects who did not report experiencing ad (n=74,572); 366 ad subjects self-reported mild (n=182) or moderate/severe (n=184) disease. univariable and multivariable analyses compared characteristics and outcomes between cohorts and between ad severity levels.results: the ad cohort was younger than non-ad cohort (44.3 vs. 46.6 years; p=0.0033), and had a higher proportion of females (64.4% vs. 51.8%; p<0.0001). relative to the non-ad cohort, the ad cohort had a significantly higher prevalence of atopic conditions including nasal allergies (46.4% vs. 19.8%) and asthma (22.4% vs. 7.9%), and neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety (42.5% vs. 21.3%) and depression (37.2% vs. 20.9%) (all p<0.0001). units of resource use (healthcare practitioner visits, emergency room, hospitalizations) were higher (all p<0.05) and hrqol was poorer (p<0.0001) with ad. on the wpai, ad employees reported almost twice as much lost work productivity as non-ad employees (30.0% vs. 16.3%; p<0.0001). no clear differences in outcomes were observed among patient-reported ad severity categories, except greater impairment of work productivity and daily activities in those with moderate/severe ad relative to mild.conclusions: the significant burden associated with ad relative to those without ad suggests an unmet need for more effective management strategies. there also appears to be a need for further characterization of disease severity and its impact on hrqol.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	introduction: diagnostic discrimination between inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and functional gastrointestinal disorders is complex, as they cause similar signs and symptoms. faecal calprotectin (fc) is a useful marker in this context, and can be used to select patients who will most benefit from colonoscopy. the aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of fc in discriminating between organic disease and functional disorders. material and methods: the study included 264 patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints consistent with an organic pathology. fc levels were determined and diagnostic accuracy was assessed using the area under the curve obtained from the final diagnosis. results: calprotectin levels in organic bowel disease patients were significantly higher (median 254 mu g/g; 95% confidence interval [ci], interquartile range 105-588.5) than in functional disease patients (95 mu g/g; 95% ci, 47.25-243.92) (p <.0001). similarly, in patients with ibd, the values obtained were higher (270.85 mu g/g; 95% ci, 96.85-674.00) than in those with irritable bowel syndrome (79.70 mu g/g; 95% ci, 36.50-117.25) (p <.0001). for a cut-off of 150 mu g/g, fc had an area under the roc curve to discriminate between organic and functional disease of 0.718, and 0.872 to discriminate between irritable bowel syndrome and ibd. conclusion: our study supports the importance of fc as a marker in the evaluation of patients with ibd. the best diagnostic accuracy is obtained at a cut-off value of 150 mu g/g.

polycythemia_vera	introduction: a single institution case-control study was conducted to evaluate the risk of developing chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) associated with prior autoimmune disease and cardiovascular disease (cvd). method: cases were 323 mpn patients and controls were 333 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) patients. odds ratios (ors) and p-values using fischer 's exact tests were calculated. the data was adjusted for confounding effects by logistic regression. results: a significantly increased risk of mpns compared to cll was observed in subjects with a prior history of any autoimmune disease (or = 1.86, 95%ci 1.16-2.98). a positive association between jak2-v617f positive mpn and any autoimmune disease was observed at follow-up (or = 2.62, 95% ci 1.21-5.67). a significantly increased risk of mpn compared to cll was also observed in subjects with prior thromboembolic events (te-events) (or = 2.09, 95%ci 1.42-3.08). in the mpn group, an increased risk of jak2-v617f-positive disease was observed in subjects with prior te-events (or= 2.19, 95%ci 1.51-3.16). discussion: it is discussed if chronic inflammation in relation to autoimmunity and atherosclerosis might elicit mutations in the hematopoietic stem cell resulting in mpns, or whether this association actually reflects a long-lasting pre-mpn-diagnosis phase, in which the mpn-disease per se contributes to a chronic inflammatory state and immune deregulation.

headache	background. influenza virus infections are associated with a wide spectrum of disease. however, few studies have investigated in detail the epidemiological and virological characteristics of asymptomatic and mild illness with influenza virus infections. methods. in a community-based study in hong kong from 2008 to 2014, we followed up initially healthy individuals who were household contacts of symptomatic persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza, to identify secondary infections. information from daily symptom diaries was used to classify infections as symptomatic (>= 2 signs/symptoms, including fever >= 37.8 degrees c, headache, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sputum), paucisymptomatic (1 symptom only), or asymptomatic (none of these symptoms). we compared the patterns of influenza viral shedding between these groups. results. we identified 235 virologically confirmed secondary cases of influenza virus infection in the household setting, including 31 (13%) paucisymptomatic and 25 (11%) asymptomatic cases. the duration of viral rna shedding was shorter and declined more rapidly in paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic than in symptomatic cases. the mean levels of influenza viral rna shedding in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases were approximately 1-2 log(10) copies lower than in symptomatic cases. conclusions. the presence of influenza viral shedding in patients with influenza who have very few or no symptoms reflects their potential for transmitting the virus to close contacts. these findings suggest that further research is needed to investigate the contribution of persons with asymptomatic or clinically mild influenza virus infections to influenza virus transmission in household, institutional, and community settings.
hepatitis_c	purpose: this study was conducted to evaluate changes in liver stiffness, volume, and function before and after occlusion of spontaneous portosystemic shunt. materials & methods: twenty-four patients (13 men and 11 women) with a mean age of 68.2 years +/- 10.1 (sd) (age range, 49-82 years) underwent percutaneous occlusion of spontaneous portosystemic shunt because of gastric varices (n = 17) or hepatic encephalopathy (n = 7) from march 2011 to june 2013. the liver fibrosis index indicating liver stiffness was calculated by using ultrasound elastography before and after shunt occlusion. liver volume and liver profile were also evaluated. results: spontaneous portosystemic shunt occlusion was uneventfully performed in all patients. the mean liver fibrosis index was significantly decreased from 2.7 +/- 1.0 before shunt occlusion to 2.0 +/- 0.9 (p < 0.001) at 1 month, 2.2 +/- 1.0 at 3 months (p = 0.004), and 1.6 +/- 0.7 at 6 months (p = 0.001) afterwards. a significant increase in the liver volume was observed from 1035.3 +/- 340.1 ml before shunt occlusion to 1116.8 +/- 298.4 ml (p = 0.006) at 1 month and 1174.2 +/- 354.1 ml (p < 0.001) at 3 months afterwards. significant improvement in the child-pugh score was also found at 1 month (6.2 +/- 1.4, p < 0.001), 3 months (6.5 +/- 1.1, p = 0.022), and 6 months (6.0 +/- 0.9, p = 0.004) after shunt occlusion as compared with that (7.2 +/- 1.9) before. conclusion: the liver stiffness decreases along with an increase in liver volume and improvement in liver function after spontaneous portosystemic shunt occlusion.

menopause	introduction: there is considerable amount of controversy about the long term effects of multiparity and duration of breast-feeding on maternal bone mineral density after menopause. this study was conducted to determine whether multiple pregnancy and prolonged duration of breast-feeding are independent predictors of low bone mass in post-menopausal kurdish women. methods: in a retrospective study, we evaluated 991 post-menopausal women with mean age of 58.9 years screened for osteoporosis by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa). according to the parity (1-2, 3-4, 5-7, >7 children) and total duration of breast-feeding (1-24, 25-60, 61-96, >96 months) they were classified. bone mineral density (bmd) results for femoral neck and lumbar spine were classified into three groups (normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis) according to the who criteria. binary logistic regression was used to assess the independent associations of low femur or spine bmd with parity and total duration of breast-feeding. results: we found that women with 5 or more children and having more than 60 months history of total breast-feeding, were older (p<0.001) with higher prevalence of osteoporosis (p<0.001). however, after adjusting for age only parity was independent predictor for osteopenia (or: 1.336; 95% ci 1.29-1.735) while total duration of breast-feeding was not an independent predictor of low bone mass. conclusion: multiparity has a detrimental effect on maternal bmd. history of multiple pregnancy is a risk factor for low bone mass in post-menopausal women. however, prolonged duration of breast-feeding has no long-term adverse effect on maternal bmd in post-menopausal age.
headache	vaccine-induced protection against influenza is not optimal, however it has been suggested that the vaccine may reduce the severity of symptoms among those who develop illness despite being vaccinated. we tested this hypothesis within a countrywide, sentinel general practitioners-based surveillance system in france. we included 2277 individuals aged 65 years or older (of whom 1293 had been vaccinated against influenza, 56.8%) who consulted a general practitioner because of an acute respiratory infection (ari) during 2003-2014. all patients were taken a nasopharyngeal swab, and information was collected on demographic characteristics and symptoms at disease onset. all specimens were tested for respiratory viruses and, if positive for influenza, the virus type and subtype were determined. we compared the average maximum temperature and the frequency of each symptom, between non-vaccinated and vaccinated influenza patients. we then used logistic regression models to calculate the odds of presenting with each symptom between vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated patients, adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season. overall, 675 ari patients (29.6%) tested positive for influenza. the a(h3) virus caused the majority of cases (55.1%), followed by influenza b (22.9%), a not-subtyped (11.7%), and a(h1) (10.3%) viruses. compared to non-vaccinated influenza patients, those who had been vaccinated had a slightly reduced maximum temperature and presented less frequently with myalgia, shivering and headache. in stratified analyses, the observed effect was limited to patients infected with a(h3) or type b viruses. after adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season, the difference remained statistically significant only for headache, which was less frequent among vaccinated individuals (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence intervals 0.48-0.98). in conclusion, the vaccine was found to be modestly associated with less severe clinical presentation of influenza among the elderly. our findings reinforce the need for influenza vaccines providing better protection.

alzheimer's_disease	the microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease (ad). advanced glycation end products (ages)/receptor for advanced glycation end products (rage) or rho/ rho kinase (rock) are both involved in the development of non-specific inflammation. however, there are few reports about their effects on neuroinflammation. here, we explored the mechanism of ages/rage/rho/ rock pathway underlying the non-specific inflammation and microglial polarization in bv2 cells. ages could activate rock pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. rock inhibitor fasudil and rage-specific blacker fps-zm1 significantly inhibited ages-mediated activation of bv2 cells and induction of reactive oxygen species (ros). fps-zm1 and fasudil exerted their anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), nlrp3 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kb) p65. in addition, ages induced both m1 (cd16/32, m1 marker) and m2 (cd206, m2 marker) phenotype in bv2 cells. fasudil and fps-zm1 led to a decreased m1 and increased m2 phenotype. together, these results indicate that the ages/rage/rho/rock pathway in bv2 cells could intensify the non-specific inflammation of ad, which will provide novel strategies for the development of anti-ad drugs.

allergies	background. contact allergies to the preservatives formaldehyde and methylchloroisothiazolinone (mci)/methylisothiazolinone (mi) have been reported to appear together at a statistically significant level. recently, revisions concerning the patch test preparations of mci/mi, mi and formaldehyde have been recommended for the european baseline series. aim. to investigate (i) the number of concomitant contact allergies to the preservatives, (ii) the number of concomitant contact allergies to the preservatives and the fragrance mixes (fm i and fm ii) and (iii) gender differences. methods. patients testedwith theswedish baseline series during the period 2012-2014 at the department of occupational and environmental dermatology in malm, sweden were investigated. results. 2165 patients were patch tested with the baseline series (34% males and 66% females). contact allergies to formaldehyde and mci/mi and/or mi were significantly associated (p<0.001). the associations between contact allergy to mci/mi and/or mi and fmi and/or fm ii, and between formaldehyde and fmi and/or fm ii as well as, were statistically significant (p<0.001). conclusion. contact allergies to formaldehyde and mci/mi and/or mi are significantly associated, as well as contact allergies to these preservatives and fragrance allergy. males and females do not differ significantly concerning contact allergy to fragrances.
allergies	pollen analyses of spider web samples, collected from the recently planted tectona grandis (t. grandis, teak)-dominated tropical deciduous forest of bhulsidih village, korba district (chhattisgarh, central india), shed light on the relationship between the extant vegetation and pollen rain. the study revealed the dominance of pollen of herbs and trees, whereas shrubs, fern spores and algal remains are meagre. among the tree taxa, sapotaceae, syzygium, holoptelea, lannea coromandelica, shorea robusta and grewia are dominating with moderate to low and intermittent presence of madhuca indica, terminalia, mitragyna, schleichera, anacardiaceae, diospyros, emblica officinalis and flacourtia. however, the rest of the forest constituents are either not represented at all despite their presence in the floristics, which could be attributed to their low pollen productivity owing to entomophily as well as their poor pollen preservation pattern. on the other hand, the ground vegetation is represented by the very high frequency of grasses (poaceae) along with tubuliflorae, chenopodiaceae/amaranthaceae and cerealia, however, artemisia, xanthium, malvaceae, caryophyllaceae and justicia in moderate to lower values. ferns, which occur abundantly along the adjoining stream banks, are marked by the sporadic retrieval of trilete spores that could be ascribed to the prevailing damp condition around the sampling provenance. the study, in addition to understanding the pollen-vegetation relationship, could also be helpful in aerobiological study, especially in assessing the allergenicity of various pollen grains/spores in the area of investigation, causing bronchial asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis/pollinosis), naso-bronchial allergy and other respiratory disorders along with conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, food allergies and other health disorders.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	rationale: pseudoprogression, that is, initial tumor growth followed by subsequent tumor regression, has been well described for immunomodulation therapy in melanoma patients. this phenomenon is not well defined in lung cancer. nivolumab, an anti-pd-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for nonsmall cell lung cancer (nsclc) as a second-line therapy. patient concerns and diagnosis: we present a patient with squamous nsclc, suffering from multiple bone and subcutaneous metastases. interventions: the patient was treated with nivolumab. outcomes: a subcutaneous lesion in her upper back grew substantially after the first cycle of nivolumab, and later regressed, with marked improvement in all cancer sites. lessons: such pseudoprogression may serve to predict subsequent clinical response.
parenting	background: parental warmth (pw) has a strong influence on child development and may precede the onset of psychiatric disorders in children. pw is interconnected with other family processes (e.g., coercive discipline) that may also influence the development of psychiatric disorders in children. we prospectively examined the association between pw and child psychiatric disorders (anxiety, major depression disorder, adhd, disruptive behavior disorders) over the course of three years among puerto rican youth, above and beyond the influence of other family factors. methods: boricua youth study participants, puerto rican children 5 to 13 years of age at wave 1 living in the south bronx (new york) (sb) and san juan and canguas (pr) (n = 2,491), were followed for three consecutive years. youth psychiatric disorders were measured by the diagnostic interview schedule for children-iv (disc-iv). generalized linear mixed models tested the association between pw (wave 1) and psychiatric disorders in the next two years adjusting for demographic characteristics and family processes. results: higher levels of pw were related to lower odds of child anxiety and major depressive disorder over time (or = 0.69[0.60; 0.79]; 0.49[0.41; 0.58], respectively). the strength of the association between pw and adhd and disruptive behavior disorder declined over time, although it was still significant in the last assessment (or = 0.44[0.37; 0.52]; 0.46[0.39; 0.54], respectively). pw had a unique influence on psychiatric disorders beyond the influence of other parenting and family processes. stronger associations were observed among girls for depression and adhd. conclusions: incorporating pw behaviors such as acceptance, support, and comforting into interventions focused on parenting skills may help prevent child psychiatric disorders.

overactive_bladder	purpose: study of validity of the medication adherence self-report inventory (masri) for use in clinical practice to treat patients with benign prostatic obstruction (bpo) accompanied with overactive bladder (oab) symptoms.methods: during 12 weeks of the randomized study, 452 patients with bpo and oab symptoms (mean age of 61.3 (12.7)) were studied for adherence to the treatment with tamsulosin, solifenacin and trospium using the masri. external monitoring instruments included the brief medication questionnaire (bmq) and the visual remaining pill count. the state of the prostate gland and the lower urinary tract was monitored using questionnaires i-pss, oab awareness tool, uroflowmetry and voiding diaries.result: correlation between the percentage of men non-adherent to treatment (masri) and the percentage of patients having a belief barrier on the screen of the bmq was r=0.89, p0.05, r=0.92, p0.01, r=0.85, p0.05, a number of missed doses on the regimen screen of the bmq was r=0.79; p0.05; r=0.81; p0.05; r=0.75, p0.05, a number of non-adherent patients according to the bmq was r=0.83 (p0.05), r=0.88 (p0.05), r=0.79, p0.05, the results of the pill count were r=0.65-0.76; p0.05-0.01. these data confirm high validity of the masri.conclusion: the masri is a valid tool for rapid assessment of adherence to treatment of patients with bpo and oab receiving tamsulosin and antimuscarinic drugs and may be recommended for use in clinical practice.
parenting	many psychology applications assess measurement invariance of a construct (e.g., depression) over time. these applications are often characterized by few time points (e.g., 3), but high rates of dropout. although such applications routinely assume that the dropout mechanism is ignorable, this assumption may not always be reasonable. in the presence of nonignorable dropout, fitting a conventional longitudinal factor model (lfm) to assess longitudinal measurement invariance can yield misleading inferences about the level of invariance, along with biased parameter estimates. in this article we develop pattern mixture longitudinal factor models (pm-lfms) for quantifying uncertainty in longitudinal invariance testing due to an unknown, but potentially nonignorable, dropout mechanism. pm-lfms are a kind of multiple group model wherein observed missingness patterns define groups, lfm parameters can differ across these pattern-groups subject to identification constraints, and marginal inference about longitudinal invariance is obtained by pooling across pattern-groups. when dropout is nonignorable, we demonstrate via simulation that conventional lfms can indicate longitudinal noninvariance, even when invariance holds in the overall population; certain pm-lfms are shown to ameliorate this problem. on the other hand, when dropout is ignorable, pm-lfms are shown to provide results comparable to conventional lfms. additionally, we contrast pm-lfms to a latent mixture approach for accommodating nonignorable dropoutwherein missingness patterns can differ across latent groups. in an empirical example assessing longitudinal invariance of a harsh parenting construct, we employ pm-lfms to assess sensitivity of results to assumptions about nonignorable missingness. software implementation and recommendations for practice are discussed.
hepatitis_c	the interpretation of regression models results can often benefit from the generation of nomograms, user friendly' graphical devices especially useful for assisting the decision-making processes. however, in the case of multinomial regression models, whenever categorical responses with more than two classes are involved, nomograms cannot be drawn in the conventional way. such a difficulty in managing and interpreting the outcome could often result in a limitation of the use of multinomial regression in decision-making support. in the present paper, we illustrate the derivation of a non-conventional nomogram for multinomial regression models, intended to overcome this issue. although it may appear less straightforward at first sight, the proposed methodology allows an easy interpretation of the results of multinomial regression models and makes them more accessible for clinicians and general practitioners too. development of prediction model based on multinomial logistic regression and of the pertinent graphical tool is illustrated by means of an example involving the prediction of the extent of liver fibrosis in hepatitis c patients by routinely available markers.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	the present study aimed to determine the preventative effects of fermented chimonobambusa quadrangularis shoot (fcqs) on activated carbon constipation in kun ming mice. fcqs has a more loose fiber tissue structure than unfermented fresh c. quadrangularis shoot (cqs), which is preferable for relieving constipation. in mice fed with fcqs for 9 days the time from consumption to their first black stool defecation (117 min) was shorter than the control group (192 min) and the cqs group (148 min); however, it was longer than the normal (85 min) and bisacodyl treatment (99 min) groups. the gastrointestinal transit of the fcqs group (73.8%) was increased, as compared with the control (37.9%) and cqs (61.7%) groups; however, it was decreased as compared with the normal (100%) and bisacodyl (88.3%) groups. by observing the hemotoxylin and eosin-stained section of mice intestine, it was demonstrated that fcqs reduced injury to the intestinal tract resulting from constipation and alleviated the damage caused to the intestinal villi over the effects observed in the cqs group. furthermore, fcqs was also able to increase the serum levels of motilin, endothelin-1, vasoactive intestinal peptide and acetylcholinesterase compared with the control group. c-kit, stem cell factor (scf), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) mrna and protein expression levels in the small intestinal cells of fcqs-fed mice were increased, as compared with cqs-fed mice. transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1 (trpv1) and nitric oxide synthase (nos) expression levels of small intestinal cells of fcqs-fed mice were reduced, as compared with cqs-fed mice. these findings demonstrated that fcqs may induce improved preventative effects on constipation, compared with cqs.
weight_loss	ulcerative colitis (uc) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease. the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (rip3) was reported to be involved in many inflammatory disease. however, the mechanism of rip3 in the pathogenesis of uc is still unclear. to investigate the effects and possible mechanism of rip3 in uc pathogenesis, rip3-/- mice was used in dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis model. it was found that by dss-induced colitis, rip3-/- mice showed significantly enhanced colitis symptoms, including increased weight loss, colon shortening, and colonic mucosa damage and severity, but decreased production of interleukin 6 and interleukin 1. the results showed that rip3 deficiency could not ameliorate but exacerbate the severity of colitis. on the mechanism, it was found that messenger rna expressions of several repair-associated cytokines including interleukin 6, interleukin 22, cyclooxygenase 2, epithelial growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin and matrix metalloproteinase 10 were siginificant decreased in rip3-/- mice. thus, rip3-/- mice exhibited an impaired tissue repair in response to dss. in a conclusion, rip3 deficiency exerted detrimental effects in dss induced colitis partially because of the impaired repair-associated cytokines expression.
menopause	estrogen withdrawal following menopause results in an increase of osteoclasts formation and bone resorption, which is one of the most important mechanisms of postmenopausal osteoporosis. recently, growing evidence has suggested that receptor-interacting protein 140 was implicated in estrogen-regulated metabolic disease, including fat metabolism and lipid metabolism. however, little is known regarding the role of receptor-interacting protein 140 in the regulation of bone metabolic by estrogen. in the present study, western blotting disclosed that estrogen brings a significant increasing expression of receptor-interacting protein 140 in osteoclasts, but not in osteoblasts and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. furthermore, analysis of trap staining and bone resorption assay showed that depletion of receptor-interacting protein 140 could significantly alleviate the inhibitory effects of estrogen on osteoclasts formation and bone resorption activity. moreover, estrogen could induce osteoclasts apoptosis by increasing receptor-interacting protein 140 expression through the fas/fasl pathway. taken together, receptor-interacting protein 140 might be a critical player in estrogen-mediated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.
diabetes	beyond the current emphasis on body mass index (bmi), it is unknown whether breast cancer risk differs between metabolically healthy and unhealthy normal weight or overweight/obese women. the sister study is a nationwide prospective cohort study. data came from 50,884 cohort participants aged 35 to 74 years enrolled from 2003 through 2009. cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for breast cancer risk. metabolic abnormalities considered included: high waist circumference (88 cm); elevated blood pressure (130/85 mm hg or antihypertensive medication); previously diagnosed diabetes or antidiabetic drug treatment; and cholesterol-lowering medication use. during follow-up (mean, 6.4 years), 1,388 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment. compared to women with bmi <25 kg/m(2) with no metabolic abnormalities (metabolically healthy normal weight phenotype), women with a bmi <25 kg/m(2) and 1 metabolic abnormality (metabolically unhealthy, normal weight phenotype) had increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (hr=1.26, 95% ci: 1.01-1.56), as did women with a bmi 25 kg/m(2) and no metabolic abnormalities (metabolically healthy overweight/obese phenotype) (hr=1.24, 95% ci: 0.99-1.55). furthermore, risk of postmenopausal breast cancer was consistently elevated in women with normal bmi and central obesity (normal weight central obesity phenotype) regardless of the criterion used to define central obesity, with hr for waist circumference 88 cm, waist circumference 80 cm, and waist-hip ratio 0.85 of 1.58, 95% ci: 1.02-2.46; 1.38, 95% ci: 1.09-1.75; and 1.38, 95% ci: 1.02-1.85, respectively. there was an inverse association between premenopausal breast cancer and metabolically healthy overweight/obese phenotype (hr=0.71, 95% ci: 0.52-0.97). our findings suggest that postmenopausal women who are metabolically unhealthy or have central adiposity may be at increased risk for breast cancer despite normal bmi. what 's new? does the association between metabolic factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, or central obesity and risk of breast cancer differ for normal weight and overweight/obese women? in this study, the authors found that normal weight postmenopausal women who are metabolically unhealthy may have an increased risk of breast cancer despite normal body mass index, as do overweight and obese women who are metabolically healthy. these findings suggest that targeting metabolic abnormalities may provide additional targets for prevention strategies to reduce breast-cancer risk.
birth_control	aristotle in his politics, discusses: the territorial size of the city-state, the division of the land between public and private, the size of the population, and the desired per citizen product which is determined on the basis of the concept of good life. in this paper the above elements are combined to construct a model which describes the long-run equilibrium position of the economy of the city-state. this position is determined by the optimal land population ratio and it is reached through changes in population by means of birth control policies.
skin_care	objective: recognizing the state of art regarding care for the skin of newborns. method: it is an integrative literature review. the search for studies was performed in the medline, lilacs and bdenf databases, and 18 studies published between 2009 and 2013 were selected. results: it indicated a variety of orientations, which may be used by health professionals in the care for the skin of newborns. the most frequently addressed topics were: causes for lesions, nursing care in the prevention of lesions, appropriate handling of the newborn infant, assessment of the skin, prevention of transepidermal water loss, body temperature regulation, use of emollients and antiseptics, bath, dressings, fixation of devices, prevention of pressure ulcers, care measures toward punctures and treatment of lesions. conclusion: the study allowed updating the subject, enabling a humanized, individualized and qualified care that ensures the safety of the neonatal patient.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) causes chronic abdominal pain and abnormal bowel movements. the etiology involves complicated interactions among visceral hypersensitivity, disorders related to bowel movements, and stress. changes in the microbiota affect the ibs pathophysiology. we investigated changes in colorectal motility, structure, and microbiota in response to stress due to maternal separation (ms) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) administration in rats. summary: neonatal rats were separated from their mothers for 3 h daily from postnatal day (pnd) 2 to pnd14. the control group included rats of the same age that were not separated. after ms, the rats were undisturbed for 5 weeks. at 8 weeks of age, 10 mu g of crh or saline was intravenously administered to ms and control groups. two hours later, the number of fecal pellets was counted. three hours after crh or saline administration, the rats were sacrificed and colorectal tissue samples and cecal contents were collected to analyze the fecal microbiota. the number of fecal pellets was significantly greater in ms with the crh group. both stressors altered the microbiota composition. key messages: among rats that received crh, ms increased the colorectal motility. stress due to ms altered the gut microbiota composition.

sports_injuries	rotator cuff tears are common and result in considerable morbidity. tears within the tendon substance or at its insertion into the humeral head represent a considerable clinical challenge because of the hostile local environment that precludes healing. tears often progress without intervention, and current surgical treatments are inadequate. although surgical implants, instrumentation, and techniques have improved, healing rates have not improved, and a high failure rate remains for large and massive rotator cuff tears. the use of biologic adjuvants that contribute to a regenerative microenvironment have great potential for improving healing rates and function after surgery. this article presents a review of current and emerging biologic approaches to augment rotator cuff tendon and muscle regeneration focusing on the scientific rationale, preclinical, and clinical evidence for efficacy, areas for future research, and current barriers to advancement and implementation.
polycythemia_vera	thrombopoietin was posited to exist in 1958 and cloned in 1994, and in the ensuing two decades we have learned a great deal about the physiology and pathology of the primary regulator of thrombopoiesis. this paper will review the role of the hormone and its receptor, the product of the c-mpl proto-oncogene, in health and disease, including many unexpected effects in both normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis. amongst these unexpected properties are a non-redundant effect on hematopoietic stem cells, a critical role in all three of the acquired, chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, as well as both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in congenital and acquired states of thrombocytopenia and thrombocythemia.
menopause	background hormone therapy (ht) is widely provided for control of menopausal symptoms and has been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. this is an updated version of a cochrane review first published in 2005. objectives to assess effects of long-term ht (at least 1 year 's duration) on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fracture and cognition in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women during and after cessation of treatment. search methods we searched the following databases to september 2016: cochrane gynaecology and fertility group trials register, cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), medline, embase and psycinfo. we searched the registers of ongoing trials and reference lists provided in previous studies and systematic reviews. selection criteria we included randomised double-blinded studies of ht versus placebo, taken for at least 1 year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. ht included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via the oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or intranasal route. data collection and analysis two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. we calculated risk ratios (rrs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (mds) for continuous data, along with 95% confidence intervals (cis). we assessed the quality of the evidence by using grade methods. main results we included 22 studies involving 43,637 women. we derived nearly 70% of the data from two well-conducted studies (hers 1998; whi 1998). most participants were postmenopausal american women with at least some degree of comorbidity, and mean participant age in most studies was over 60 years. none of the studies focused on perimenopausal women. in relatively healthy postmenopausal women (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease), combined continuous ht increased the risk of a coronary event (after 1 year 's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 3 and 7 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (after 1 year 's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 4 and 11 per 1000), stroke (after 3 years' use: from 6 per 1000 to between 6 and 12 per 1000), breast cancer (after 5.6 years' use: from 19 per 1000 to between 20 and 30 per 1000), gallbladder disease (after 5.6 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) and death from lung cancer (after 5.6 years' use plus 2.4 years' additional follow-up: from 5 per 1000 to between 6 and 13 per 1000). oestrogen-only ht increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (after 1 to 2 years' use: from 2 per 1000 to 2 to 10 per 1000; after 7 years' use: from 16 per 1000 to 16 to 28 per 1000), stroke (after 7 years' use: from 24 per 1000 to between 25 and 40 per 1000) and gallbladder disease (after 7 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) but reduced the risk of breast cancer (after 7 years' use: from 25 per 1000 to between 15 and 25 per 1000) and clinical fracture (after 7 years' use: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000) and did not increase the risk of coronary events at any follow-up time. women over 65 years of age who were relatively healthy and taking continuous combined ht showed an increase in the incidence of dementia (after 4 years' use: from 9 per 1000 to 11 to 30 per 1000). among women with cardiovascular disease, use of combined continuous ht significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (at 1 year 's use: from 3 per 1000 to between 3 and 29 per 1000). women taking ht had a significantly decreased incidence of fracture with long-term use. risk of fracture was the only outcome for which strong evidence showed clinical benefit derived from ht (after 5.6 years' use of combined ht: from 111 per 1000 to between 79 and 96 per 1000; after 7.1 years' use of oestrogen-only ht: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000). researchers found no strong evidence that ht has a clinically meaningful impact on the incidence of colorectal cancer. one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy women 50 to 59 years of age who were taking combined continuous ht and 1637 who were taking oestrogen-only ht versus similar-sized placebo groups. the only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous ht: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. however, other differences in risk cannot be excluded, as this study was not designed to have the power to detect differences between groups of women within 10 years of menopause. for most studies, risk of bias was low in most domains. the overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons was moderate. the main limitation in the quality of evidence was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline, which is the age at which women are most likely to consider ht for vasomotor symptoms. authors' conclusions women with intolerable menopausal symptoms may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose ht, provided they do not have specific contraindications. ht may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (such as breast cancer, in women with a uterus). the risk of endometrial cancer among women with a uterus taking oestrogen-only ht is well documented. ht is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for prevention of deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women. although ht is considered effective for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term ht use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age.
diabetes	activation of casein kinase 2 (ck2) is closely linked to the body disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism and inflammatory reaction. the renal chronic inflammatory reaction in the setting of diabetes is one of the important hallmarks of diabetic renal fibrosis. however, it remains unknown whether ck2 influences the process of diabetic renal fibrosis. the current study is aimed to investigate if ck2 alpha ameliorates renal inflammatory fibrosis in diabetes via nf-kappa b pathway. to explore potential regulatory mechanism of ck2 alpha, the expression and activity of ck2 alpha, which were studied by plasmid transfection, selective inhibitor, small-interfering rna (sirna) and adenovirus infection in vitro or in vivo, were analyzed by means of western blotting (wb), dual luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). the following findings were observed: (1) expression of ck2 alpha, was upregulated in kidneys of di:0:lb and kkay diabetic mice; (2) inhibition of ck2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of ck2 alpha protein expression suppressed high glucose-induced expressions of fn and icam-1 in glomerular mesangial cells (gmcs); (3) inhibition of ck2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of ck2 alpha protein expression not only restrained hcb degradation, but also suppressed hg-induced nuclear accumulation, transcriptional activity and dna binding activity of nf-kappa b in gmcs; (4) treatment of tbb or ck2 alpha rnai adenovirus infection ameliorated renal fibrosis in diabetic animals; (5) treatment of tbb or ck2 alpha rnai adenovirus infection suppressed hcb degradation and nf-kappa b nuclear accumulation in glomeruli of diabetic animals. this study indicates the essential role of ck2 alpha in regulating the diabetic renal pathological process of inflammatory fibrosis via nf-kappa b pathway, and inhibition of ck2 alpha may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy.

heart_disease	introduction we present demographic differences across the gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) spectrum in a uk district general hospital. patients and methods data were prospectively collected over 37 years. at endoscopy patients were categorized as: erosive oesophagitis (eo), barrett 's oesophagus (bo) or nonerosive reflux disease (ner). analysis 1: comparison of eo, bo and ner 1977-2001 when the database for gord without bo closed. analysis 2: demographic differences in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (oac) in total bo population diagnosed 1977-2011. results gord 1977-2001 (n = 11 944): sex, male predominance in eo and bo but not ner; male : female ratios, 1.81, 1.65, 0.87, respectively (p < 0.0001); mean age at presentation, eo 54 years, bo 62 years, ner 50 years; women were older than men by 10, 7 and 6 years, respectively. bo 1977-2011: prevalent oac, 87/1468 (6%); male : female ratio, 4.1 (p < 0.0001); incident oac, 54/1381 (3.9%); male : female ratio, 3.5 (p < 0.0001). among all bo, more men developed oac (3 vs. 0.9%). within each sex, proportion of oac higher among men (4.9 vs. 2.3%); at oac diagnosis women were slightly but not significantly older (69.9 vs. 72.3 years, p = 0.322). conclusion two views may explain our findings. first, women have either milder reflux, or reduced mucosal sensitivity hence reflux remains silent for longer. alternatively, women genuinely develop reflux later, that is, are more protected and for longer from developing gord and its complications. early evidence is emerging that female sex hormones may indeed have a protective role in gord during the reproductive period. we suggest reflux and its consequences may be an example of 'protection' conferred on eve. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
menopause	complementary and alternative medicine (cam) is widely used for menopause, although not all women disclose use to their healthcare providers. this narrative review aims to expand providers' understanding of cross-cultural approaches to treating and managing menopause by providing an overarching framework and perspective on cam treatments. increased provider understanding and awareness may improve not only provider-patient communication but also effectiveness of treatments. the distinction between illness (what patients suffer) and disease (what physicians treat) highlights the gap between what patients seek and doctors provide, and may help clarify why many women seek cam at menopause. for example, cam is often sought by women for whom biomedicine has been unsuccessful or inaccessible. we review the relevance to menopause of three cam categories: natural products, mind-body practices including meditation, and other complementary health approaches including traditional chinese medicine (tcm) and japanese kampo. assessing the effectiveness of cam is challenging because of the individualized nature of illness patterns and associated treatments, which complicate the design of randomized controlled trials. because many women seek cam due to inefficacy of biomedical treatments, or cultural or economic marginalization, biomedical practitioners who make an effort to learn about cam and ask patients about their cam use or interest may dramatically improve the patient-provider relationship and rapport, as well as harnessing the 'meaning response' (moerman, 2002) imbued in the clinical encounter. by working with women to integrate their cam-related health-seeking behaviors and treatments, providers may also boost the efficacy of their own biomedical treatments.

birth_control	the objective of this study was to assess the overall health, including sexual and reproductive health (srh) knowledge and needs, sexual behaviors, and testicular health practices among young minority males. anonymous questionnaires were administered to 18- to 25-year-old males receiving services at health clinics in a large southwestern u.s. city. the survey was completed by 258 males with a mean age of 20.8 years. most young males (67.1%) identified as african american, and 32.9% as hispanic. results suggest study participants lack srh knowledge related to pregnancy and condom effectiveness, and engage in risky sexual behavior including not using birth control at their last sexual encounter. although 21.6% of participants had a sexually transmitted infection (sti) in the past year, approximately 80% perceived their sti/hiv risk as very low or low. respondents had low engagement and lack of knowledge of testicular health practices. the majority of respondents (71.1%) reported having been in a physical fight one or more times and 18.1% reported being victims of intimate partner violence. these data support a need for comprehensive health services for minority young males.
headache	background: visual after-effects are illusions that occur after prolonged viewing of visual displays. the motion after-effect (mae), for example, is an illusory impression of motion after viewing moving displays: subsequently, stationary displays appear to drift in the opposite direction. after-effects have been used extensively in basic vision research and in clinical settings, and are enhanced in migraine. objective: the objective of this article is to assess associations between (1) mae duration and visual symptoms experienced during/between migraine/headache attacks, and (2) visual stimuli reported as migraine/headache triggers. methods: the mae was elicited after viewing motion for 45 seconds. mae duration was tested for three test contrast displays (high, medium, low). participants also completed a headache questionnaire that included migraine/headache triggers. results: for each test contrast, the mae was prolonged in migraine. mae duration was associated with photophobia; visual triggers (flicker, striped patterns); and migraine or headache frequency. conclusions: group differences on various visual tasks have been attributed to abnormal cortical processing in migraine, such as hyperexcitability, heightened responsiveness and/or a lack of intra-cortical inhibition. the results are not consistent with hyperexcitability simply from a general lack of inhibition. alternative multi-stage models are discussed and suggestions for further research are recommended, including visual tests in clinical assessments/clinical trials.
myelofibrosis	the aim of this study was to analyze the mutalion rate of jak2v617f, mplw515l/k and calr genes in adult patients with essential thrombocythemia (et) and the accuracy of the combined detection by the receiver operating curve. three hundred and forty-two cases with high-platelets (>= 300x10(9)/1) were consecutively selected. the patients were analyzed for routine blood examination, bone marrow biopsy and genetic testing. one hundred and fifty-four cases (45.03%) were diagnosed with et and 188 cases of secondary thrombocythemia according to the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumor classification standards of 2008. it was found that the mutant type of three genes showed three bands, whereas only one hand for wild-type. the jak2v617f and mpl mutations did not cause a change in the open reading frame and the calr mutation resulted in its change. the mutation rate of jak2v617f and calr in et group was significantly higher than that in the secondary thrombocythemia group (p < 0.05). the positive mutation rate of mpl was only 4.55%. jak2v617f-positive mutation alone was used to diagnose with et. the area under the curve (auc) was 0.721. the sensitivity was 72.4%, the specificity was 79.5% and the cut-off value was 0.25. when calr-positive mutation alone was used to diagnose et, the auc, sensitivity, specificity and cut-off value were 0.664, 68.4, 82.4 and 0.09%, respectively. jak2v617f combined with calr mutation were used for diagnosis of et. the auc was 0.862, the sensitivity was 85.9%, the specificity was 87.8%, and the cut-off values were 0.21 and 0.07. in conclusion, the positive mutation rate of jak2v617f and calr in et was higher, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis of et were significantly improved using the detection of jak2v617f and calr.
parenting	resilience is related to students' well-being and academic success. while challenges associated with students who are from historically underrepresented backgrounds (i.e. non-traditional students') have been frequently reported, their resilience has received lesser attention. the primary purpose of this study was to compare levels of resilience between traditional' and non-traditional' students. first year students participated in an online mental health survey which included a standardised measure of resilience, demographic questions and an item exploring students' own perception of being non-traditional'. the results showed that students who considered themselves to be non-traditional' in life aspects, including age, employment and parenting responsibility, had significantly higher resilience compared to self-identified traditional students'. however, resilience levels of students who deemed themselves to be non-traditional' in other domains (e.g. household income, cultural background) did not differ significantly from traditional' students. the findings show that life experiences commonly affiliated with being a mature-aged student, including work and being a carer, may contribute to higher resilience. implications in relation to practice and future research were discussed.
headache	background there are various studies on experimentally provoked ice-cream headache' or headache attributed to ingestion or inhalation of a cold stimulus' (hics) using different provocation protocols. the aim of this study was to compare two provocation protocols. methods ice cubes pressed to the palate and fast ingestion of ice water were used to provoke hics and clinical features were compared. results the ice-water stimulus provoked hics significantly more often than the ice-cube stimulus (9/77 vs. 39/77). ice-water-provoked hics had a significantly shorter latency (median 15s, range 4-97s vs. median 68s, range 27-96s). there was no difference in pain localisation. character after ice-cube stimulation was predominantly described as pressing and after ice-water stimulation as stabbing. a second hics followed in 10/39 (26%) of the headaches provoked by ice water. lacrimation occurred significantly more often in volunteers with than in those without hics. discussion hics provoked by ice water was more frequent, had a shorter latency, different pain character and higher pain intensity than hics provoked by ice cubes. the finding of two subsequent hics attacks in the same volunteers supports the notion that two types of hics exist. lacrimation during hics indicates involvement of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex.
alzheimer's_disease	this pilot study examined the status of the master iron regulatory peptide, hepcidin, and peripheral related iron parameters in alzheimer 's disease (ad) and mild cognitive impairment patients, and evaluated the relationship between iron dyshomeostasis and amyloid-beta (a beta), cognitive assessment tests, neuroimaging and clinical data. frozen serum samples from the oregon tissue bank were used to measure serum levels of hepcidin, ferritin, a beta 40, a beta 42 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serum transferrin levels were determined indirectly as total iron binding capacity, serum iron was measured and the percent saturation of transferrin calculated. the study variables were correlated with the patients' existing cognitive assessment tests, neuroimaging, and clinical data. hepcidin, and iron-related proteins tended to be higher in ad patients than controls, reaching statistical significance for ferritin, whereas a beta 40, a beta 42 serum levels tended to be lower. patients with pure ad had three times higher serum hepcidin levels than controls; gender differences in hepcidin and iron-related proteins were observed. patient stratification based on clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes revealed significantly higher levels of iron and iron-related proteins in ad patients in the upper 50% as compared to controls, suggesting that iron dyshomeostasis worsens as cognitive impairment increases. unlike a beta peptides, iron and iron-related proteins showed significant association with cognitive assessment tests, neuroimaging, and clinical data. hepcidin and iron-related proteins comprise a group of serum biomarkers that relate to ad diagnosis and ad disease progression. future studies should determine whether strategies targeted to diminishing hepcidin synthesis/secretion and improving iron homeostasis could have a beneficial impact on ad progression.
skin_care	andrographis paniculata (a. paniculata, chuanxinlian), a medicinal herb with an extremely bitter taste that is native to china and other parts of southeast asia, possesses immense therapeutic value; however, its therapeutic properties have rarely been applied in the field of skin care. in this study, we investigated the effect of an a. paniculata extract (ape) on human epidermal stem cells (epscs), and confirmed its anti-aging effect through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo study. an mtt assay was used to determine cell proliferation. a flow cytometric analysis, with propidium iodide, was used to evaluate the cell cycle. the expression of integrin 1 (cd29), the stem cell marker, was detected with antibodies, using flow cytometry in vitro, and immunohistochemical assays in ex vivo. type 1 collagen and vegf (vascular endothelial growth factor) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). during the clinical study, skin hydration, elasticity, wrinkling, sagging, and dermal density were evaluated before treatment and at four and eight weeks after the treatment with the test product (containing the ape) on the face. the proliferation of the epscs, treated with the ape, increased significantly. in the cell cycle analysis, the ape increased the g2/m and s stages in a dose-dependent manner. the expression of integrin 1, which is related to epidermal progenitor cell expansion, was up-regulated in the ape-treated epscs and skin explants. in addition, the production of vegf in the epscs increased significantly in response to the ape treatment. consistent with these results, the vegf and ape-treated epscs conditioned medium enhanced the type 1 collagen production in normal human fibroblasts (nhfs). in the clinical study, the ape improved skin hydration, dermal density, wrinkling, and sagging significantly. our findings revealed that the ape promotes a proliferation of epscs, through the up-regulation of the integrin 1 and vegf expression. the vegf might affect the collagen synthesis of nhf as a paracrine factor. clinical studies further suggested that treatment with formulations containing ape confers anti-aging benefits. based on these results, we suggest that ape may be introduced as a possible anti-aging agent.
parenting	objective a higher rate of depressive symptoms is found among mothers of children with disabilities compared to other parents. however, there is a lack of study of mothers with children < 3 years of age participating in early intervention (ei) programs. this study aims to more fully describe the extent of mood disorders in these mothers including estimated prevalence, severity and factors associated with maternal mental health, using gold standard clinical diagnostic and symptom measures, and test models associating depressive symptoms with contextual factors and child behavior. methods a cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 women who had at least one child enrolled in ei. mothers were interviewed and completed reliable, valid measures to evaluate mental health, health status, family conflict, parent-child interaction, self-efficacy, social support, child behavioral problems, hardship, endangerment, and child disability. descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses were performed. results we found 8 % of participants met all criteria for a major depressive episode (mde) with 44 % of the sample reporting a past episode and 43 % endorsing recurrent episodes. using the ces-d to assess depressive symptom severity approximately 34 % of mothers screened in a clinically significant range. using linear regression to predict severity of current depressive symptoms demonstrated that current depression severity was primarily predicted by poorer maternal health status, lower self-efficacy and past mde (p < 0.05). conclusions for practice a brief assessment of maternal mood, health and self-efficacy are important factors to assess when evaluating how to support mothers of children in ei.
low_testosterone	background/aims: although polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a common endocrinopathy the pathogenesis is not entirely understood. typically, high androgen levels are associated with increased virilization. we report 2 rare groups of patients with either unexpectedly high testosterone levels despite low virilization as well as patients with low testosterone levels despite high grade of virilization. one possibility for the atypical pcos may be based on an altered androgen receptor (ar) signaling. methods: 6 patients and when available the parents were included in this study. alterations of the metaphase chromosomes by gtg staining, the length of both the trinucleotide cag- and ggc-repeats of the androgen receptor (ar) gene was determined by pcr, further the entire ar gene was sequenced and analyzed. results: the gtg banding revealed no chromosomal alterations and the range of cag- and ggc-repeat lengths are within the normal range. interestingly, by sequencing of the entire ar gene few genetic mutations were identified. conclusion: the detected mutations do not alter the ar protein sequence but they change the codon usage towards less frequent codons that potentially may alter ar protein levels and androgen signaling. in addition to this, we postulate also other causes for manifestation of atypical pcos, which may include ar-coregulators or epigenetic alterations. to our knowledge this is the first report of combining chromosomal analysis of pcos patients with full sequencing of the human ar gene and linking codon usage to pcos.
sprains_and_strains	this study aims to examine the associations between comorbid conditions and healthcare utilization, medical charges, or mortality of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). nebraska state emergency department (ed) discharge, hospital discharge, and death certificate data from 2007 to 2012 were used to study the comorbid conditions of patients with ra. ra was defined using the standard international classification of diseases (icd-9-cm 714 or icd-10-cm m05, m06, and m08). there were more comorbid conditions in patients with ra than in patients without ra. comorbid conditions were majorly related to healthcare utilization and mortality of patients with ra. in addition to injury, fracture, sprains, and strains, symptoms of cardiovascular and digestive systems, respiratory infection, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) were common comorbid conditions for ed visits. in addition to joint replacement and fracture, infections, copd and cardiovascular comorbidities were common comorbid conditions for hospitalizations. cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory comorbidities, dementia, malignant neoplasm, and diabetes mellitus were common comorbid conditions for deaths of patients with ra. in addition, the numbers of comorbid conditions were significantly associated with the length of hospital stay and hospital charges for patients with ra. the findings in this study indicated that comorbid conditions are associated with healthcare utilization, medical charges, and mortality of patients with ra.
polycythemia_vera	background: polycythemia vera has been found in a wide range of hematopoietic tissue disorders, but rarely concomitant with renal abnormality. to our knowledge there is only one available report of a patient with polycythemia vera concomitant with renal angiomyolipoma, and the report does not cover the clinical course of this rare finding. objectives: to report the presentation and clinical course of a patient with polycythemia vera concomitant with right renal angiomyolipoma. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of a patient with polycythemia vera who presented with renal angiomyolipoma. results: our patient presented with a right renal mass and polycythemia vera diagnosed by a point mutation in the gene for janus kinase 2. the mass was diagnosed as renal angiomyolipoma on histopathology. after partial nephrectomy, she was prescribed a low dosage of hydroxyurea without the return of erythrocytosis for a year. conclusions: polycythemia vera responded well to low dosage hydroxyurea, which controlled erythrocytosis after removing the renal mass.
myelofibrosis	although splenomegaly is major characteristic of primary myelofibrosis (pmf), splenomegaly has been devalued due to a less reliable method based on physical examination (pex). we evaluated whether spleen volume (sv) on ct would accurately predict clinical outcomes in pmf. a total of 188 patients were enrolled. sv was quantitated by the automatic volume software. in roc curve, the sv predicted prognosis more accurately than spleen length by pex (p < 0.001). the ideal cut-off value was 378.1 cm(3) for sv, which was divided into high- and low-volume status. patients with low sv status had superior leukemia-free survival and overall survival compared to high sv status (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) in the cox analysis, old age aeyen65 years (p = 0.004, p = 0.001), low hemoglobin < 10.0 g/dl (p = 0.023, p = 0.021), high wbc counts aeyen25 x 10(9)/l (p = 0.003, p = 0.006), peripheral blasts aeyen1 % (p = 0.029, p = 0.020), unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (p = 0.025, p = 0.028), and high sv status (p = 0.004, p = 0.003) were independently associated with survivals. sv measured by ct was important for predicting survival in patients with pmf.
parenting	this research compared the efficacy of two parenting interventions that vary according to the number and the nature of variables in reducing preschoolers' externalizing behavior (eb). the goal was to identify which parenting intervention format (one-variable versus two-variable) caused higher behavioral adjustment in children. the first was a one-variable intervention manipulating parental self-efficacy beliefs. the second was a two-variable intervention manipulating both parents' self-efficacy beliefs and emotion coaching practices. the two interventions shared exactly the same design, consisting of eight parent group sessions. effect on children 's eb and observed behaviors were evaluated through a multi-method assessment at three points (pre-test, post-test and follow-up). the results highlighted that compared to the waitlist condition, the two intervention formats tended to cause a significant reduction in children 's eb reported by their parent. however, the one-variable intervention was found to lead to a greater decrease in children 's eb at follow-up. the opposite was reported for children 's observed behavior, which was improved to a greater extent in the two-variable intervention at post-test and follow-up. the results illustrated that interventions' format cannot be considered as purely interchangeable since their impact on children 's behavior modification is different. the results are discussed for their research and clinical implications.

hypothyroidism	a 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypopituitarism following an acute presentation with cardiac tamponade and hyponatraemia, having recently been investigated for a pericardial effusion. secondary hypothyroidism is a rare cause of pericardial effusion and tamponade, but an important differential to consider. management requires appropriate hormone replacement and, critically, a low threshold for commencing stress dose steroids. clinical signs classically associated with cardiac tamponade are frequently absent in cases of tamponade due to primary and secondary hypothyroidism, and the relatively volume deplete state of secondary hypoadrenalism in hypopituitarism may further mask an evolving tamponade, as the rise in right atrial pressure is less marked even in the presence of large effusion. our case demonstrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for cardiac tamponade in this patient cohort, even in the absence of clinical signs, and for measuring both thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels when evaluating a pericardial effusion.
sprains_and_strains	subcutaneous rupture of the peroneus longus tendon occurring through a fracture of the os peroneum (op) or secondary to posterior dislocation of this uncommon sesamoid bone is rare. the authors report three incidents of this injury, which presented either as fracture of the op with diastasis of the fragments or as posterior dislocation of the whole op without fracture. in all cases conservative treatment yielded satisfactory results. it is emphasized that, in all cases of ankle injury, radiologists should carefully examine the plain radiographs because most op injuries are not seen in images obtained at the time of injury and are discovered retrospectively when the fragments separate. not treating the problem at an early stage may lead to instability of the ankle or to peroneal compartment syndrome.
parenting	the widely publicized violent encounters between police and african american youth have unknown consequences for the emotional and mental health of pregnant african american women. since studies document the hypervigilance black mothers exert to protect children from violence and racism and findings also reveal the association between racial and gendered stress (which includes parenting stressors) and depressive symptoms during pregnancy, an examination of the effects of stress from anticipated negative experiences between black youth and police on maternal mental health is warranted. between july and august 2014, 100 mostly low income pregnant african american women who lived in metropolitan atlanta and were in their first and second trimesters completed the edinburgh postnatal depression scale, selected items from the jackson, hogue, phillips contextualized stress measure, and a demographic form. bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted in response to questions that asked: (1) is the anticipation of negative encounters between black youth and police associated with antenatal depressive symptoms and (2) how does the presence of prior children, male or female, contribute to the association? for question 1, the results showed that anticipated negative african american youth-police experiences were significantly associated with antenatal depressive symptoms chi (2) (2, n = 87) = 12.62, p = .002. for question 2, the presence of a preschool-aged male child in the home was significantly associated with antenatal depression (p = .009, odds ratio = 13.23). the observed associations between antenatal depressive symptoms and anticipated negative police-youth encounters have implications for clinical- and community-based interventions responding to the unique psychosocial risks for pregnant african american women.
emergency_contraception	the japanese government approved the use of oral contraception (oc) in 1999, but oc users remain a small minority in japan. using the results of an online survey conducted in 2010, i examine the factors determining japanese women 's choice of contraceptive method by estimating multinomial choice models. the estimation results indicate that oc use is positively associated with age, willingness to pay for contraceptive effectiveness, frequency of intercourse and experience with abortion or emergency contraception. these findings suggest that oc use increases as women learn from experience and that the low and declining frequency of intercourse in japan offers one explanation for the slow diffusion of oc. additionally, the findings indicate that oc use is more prevalent among women with a higher risk of unintended pregnancies. subjective probabilities regarding each contraceptive method 's contraceptive effectiveness, disruption of romantic moods, partner disapproval, side benefits and minor, non-life-threatening side effects are important determinants of contraceptive choice. the perceived risk levels of oc side effects are significantly higher than the population-based probabilities, implying that increased medical knowledge might increase oc use.
senior_health	background/purpose: randomized controlled trials (rcts) are accepted as the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness of clinical interventions but are rarely reported in pediatric surgery. have rcts submitted to the british association of paediatric surgeons (baps) annual congress during the last 5 years been adequately designed and large enough to produce a valid result? methods: abstracts accepted by the annual baps congress meetings between 1996 and 2000 were examined in collaboration with a senior health services researcher. the quality of the design, methodology, statistical analysis and conclusions, and the adequacy of the sample size were assessed for all identifiable clinical rcts. results: from 760 accepted abstracts, there were only 9 rcts (1%) of clinical interventions. in only 4 trials was the relevant primary end-point specified at the outset of the study, and none documented the method of randomization. only one abstract mentioned blinding with respect to the intervention or outcome measure. sample sizes were inadequate to detect even large clinical differences. to date, only one of these rcts has been published in an english-language, peer-reviewed journal. conclusions: clear guidelines exist for the conduct of rcts, yet compliance with these standards was rarely documented in abstracts of pediatric surgical rcts presented at baps. sample sizes were inadequate. rcts in pediatric surgery are difficult to perform, but the specialty would benefit from well-designed, carefully conducted, multicentre, clinical rcts to advance evidence-based practice. copyright 2003, elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.
menopause	this paper reviews the efficacy, safety, and systemic absorption of estradiol with tx-004hr, an investigational, low-dose 17 beta-estradiol vaginal softgel capsule, designed to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy (vva) in postmenopausal women, with an improved user experience. in phase 2 (nct02449902) and phase 3 rejoice (nct02253173) studies, tx-004hr significantly improved the proportions of vaginal superficial and parabasal cells and vaginal ph, and in the phase 3 study decreased the severity of dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vulvar and/or vaginal itching or irritation. in two randomized, phase 1 trials, estradiol c-max and auc(0-24) were significantly lower with 10 mu g and 25 mu g tx-004hr than with the same doses of an approved vaginal estradiol tablet. a substudy (n= 72) of the rejoice trial showed that estradiol c-avg and auc(0-24) with 4 mu g and 10 mu g tx-004hr were not different from placebo on days 1 and 14. while tx-004hr 25 mu g was associated with higher c-avg and auc(0-24) versus placebo on days 1 and 14, these levels remained within the postmenopausal range. estradiol day-84 values for all three doses were not different from placebo, demonstrating no estradiol accumulation. all tx-004hr doses were well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile in all reviewed studies. the local vaginal efficacy of tx-004hr was significantly better than that of placebo, while the overall safety profile was similar to that of placebo. negligible to very low systemic estradiol absorption was observed whether given at 4, 10, or 25 mu g. if approved, tx-004hr may be an alternative option for women with symptomatic vva without increasing mean systemic estradiol absorption above postmenopausal levels.

alzheimer's_disease	abnormal buildup of the microtubule associated protein tau is a major pathological hallmark of alzheimer 's disease (ad) and various tauopathies. the mechanisms by which pathological tau accumulates and spreads throughout the brain remain largely unknown. previously, we demonstrated that a restoration of the major astrocytic glutamate transporter, glt1, ameliorated a buildup of tau pathology and rescued cognition in a mouse model of ad. we hypothesized that aberrant extracellular glutamate and abnormal neuronal excitatory activities promoted tau pathology. in the present study, we investigated genetic interactions between tau and the glt1 homolog deaatl in drosophila melanogaster. neuronal-specific overexpression of human wildtype tau markedly shortened lifespan and impaired motor behavior. rnai depletion of deaatl in astrocytes worsened these phenotypes, whereas overexpression of deaatl improved them. however, the synaptic neuropil appeared unaffected, and we failed to detect any major neuronal loss with tau overexpression in combination with deaatl depletion. to mimic glutamate-induced aberrant excitatory input in neurons, repeated depolarization of neurons via transgenic trpa1 was applied to the adult drosophila optic nerves, and we examined the change of tau deposits. repeated depolarization significantly increased the accumulation of tau in these neurons. we propose that increased neuronal excitatory activity exacerbates tau mediated neuronal toxicity and behavioral deficits.

parenting	an increasing number of research studies have suggested that metacognition is associated with individuals' mental health. specifically, metacognitive beliefs about rumination was proposed to link to the onset and maintenance of depression according to the metacognitive model of depression. the current study aimed to serve as a pilot study exploring how parents' metacognitive beliefs and parenting characteristics are associated with rumination related metacognitive beliefs in adolescents. eighty-five parent-youth dyads were invited to complete a set of questionnaires examining their metacognitive beliefs about rumination followed by a difficult puzzle task, in which parent-adolescent interaction patterns were recorded to examine the parenting style. results found that parents' and adolescents' positive metacognitive beliefs about rumination were significantly associated with each other. in addition, parental negativity was significantly associated with adolescents' positive metacognitive beliefs of rumination and parental over-involvement was marginally associated with adolescents' negative metacognitive beliefs of rumination. the findings highlighted the association between parental factors and adolescents' metacognitive beliefs about rumination. implications on the prevention of adolescent 's depression were discussed.
myelofibrosis	introduction: imatinib mesylate is used extensively for first line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia(cml). however, not many studies have documented morphological changes in bone marrow biopsies produced during imatinib therapy with reference to myelofibrosis. aim: to document the morphological changes produced in the bone marrow during imatinib therapy. materials and methods: this longitudinal study followed up 75 philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia with chronic phase(ph+ cml-cp) patients sequentially, receiving 400-600mg imatinib over a period of 12 or more months. haematologic parameters were measured at admission, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 or more months. morphologic changes in bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were evaluated at admission, 6 months and >= 12 months of treatment in accordance with national comprehensive cancer network(nccn) guidelines. results: complete haematologic response (chr) was seen in 47.1%, 80%, 85.4%, 90.4% at = 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months respectively after therapy. it was noted that patients not showing chr by 3 months were less likely to show chr at 6 months and beyond. bone marrow aspirates and biopsies showed reduction in cellularity and myeloid precursors with regeneration of erythroid precursors in 70-83% at >= 12 months. a significant decrease in myelofibrosis (p-value< 0.04) was noted as early as 6 months. mild to moderate hypoplasia was noted in 31.8% of biopsies within 6 months. pseudo gaucher cells and benign lymphoid nodules were also seen. conclusion: sequential analysis showed that imatinib reduced the grade of myelofibrosis significantly (p-value< 0.04). it also prevented development of myelofibrosis in patients who did not have it at presentation. hence imatinib is effective when used early in the course of cml-cp.
heart_disease	healthy lifestyles are integral in preventing and treating common cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. the aim of this studywas to observe smoking habits, alcohol intake, physical activity and body mass index over a 10-year period in a population-based cohort, particularly focusing on participants with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. included were 4155 participants from the first (2001-2003) and second (2010-2011) follow-ups of the swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung and heart disease in adults (sapaldia). information was collected via health questionnaire; height and weight were measured. in a healthy lifestyle score one point was attributed per criterion; non-smoking, lowrisk alcohol consumption, bmi b 25 kg/ m(2), and regular physical activity. overall in 2010-2011, 16.4% were smokers, 7.7% had at risk alcohol consumption, 25.5% were physically inactive and 57.8% were overweight or obese. both those with hypertension and diabetes had lower mean healthy lifestyle scores than those without disease. women with incident hypertension from 2001 to 2011 had lower odds of improving their healthy lifestyle score during this time period compared to those without this disease. in contrast, women with incident diabetes had higher odds of lifestyle score improvement. in men, neither hypertension nor diabetes was associated with change in lifestyle score. our findings suggest that, irrespective of disease status, preventative attention is needed, particularly in regards to physical activity and bodyweight. these needs could bemet by population-based interventions, a necessary and suitable option in both preventing and treating the non-communicable disease epidemic which currently faces countries worldwide.

weight_loss	the role of nanoparticles (nps) in the enhancement of thermal, wettability and adsorption properties of chitosan (cs) was inspired by loading of caco3 modified with diacid (da) based on l-phenyl aniline (2-8 wt%) within the cs by ultrasound agitation. the diameter of caco3-da into the cs extended from 40 to 70 nm. a thermal test on the cs/caco(3)da nanocomposite (nc) 2 wt% revealed that t5 (temperature with 5% weight loss) was increased up to 312 degrees c, which is twice the value of the pure polymer. the wettability property of the cs/caco3-da ncs was transformed from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity as the caco3-da nps concentration was increased. it is due to decrease of the accessibility of the cs polar groups to water. the cs/caco3-da nc 5 wt% was selected as the adsorbent for uptake of metal ions from the wastewater. it showed maximum adsorption capacity of 21.74 and 29.41 mg.g(-1) for cu(ii) and cd(ii), respectively. these are attributed to strong complexation reaction between the metal ions and functional groups in the obtained nc.
headache	although both sleep disorders and neurologic illness are common and burdensome in their own right, when combined they can have tremendous negative impact at an individual level as well as societally. the socioeconomic burden of sleep disorders and neurologic illness can be identified, (159) but the real cost of these conditions lies far beyond the financial realm. there is an urgent need for comprehensive care and support systems to help with the burden of disease. further research in improving patient outcomes in those who suffer with these conditions will help patients and their families, and society in general.
sports_injuries	the most injured body parts in artistic gymnastics (ag) in the lower extremities are ankle sprains. the purpose of this study was to investigate young artistic gymnasts' risk factors of ankle injuries over a two-year period. two hundred artistic gymnasts aged 9-13 years who compete in the recruits group participated in this study. the results showed that landing and take-off were the phases with the greater frequency of injuries that constitute a factor of danger for the likely appearance of ankle injuries with the majority of ankle injuries being observed during dismounts and floor exercises. further, the duration of daily training and the considerable repetition of jumps constituted risk factors. ligament sprains of the ankle during landing are the most common injuries that usually occur after exercises with back rotation and particularly after back somersaults. the number of take-offs and more than 10 elements daily on the vault affect the appearance of ankle injuries with the most common injuries being achilles tendinitis that occur after front rotation exercises. conclusively, young gymnasts experience a great number of ankle injuries especially during dismounts. to prevent injuries and restrict pressure on the lower extremities, they must use supplementary soft pits and mats during training on the landing phase.
hepatitis_c	aim to investigate the influence of interferon-free antivirus therapy on lipid profiles in chronic hepatitis c virus genotype 1b (hcv1b) infection. methods interferon-free antiviral agents were used to treat 276 patients with chronic hcv1b infection, and changes in serum lipids of those who achieved sustained virologic response (svr) were examined. the treatment regimen included 24 wk of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (dcv + asv) or 12 wk of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (sof + ldv). svr was achieved in 121 (85.8%) of 141 patients treated with dcv + asv and 132 (97.8%) of 135 patients treated with sof + ldv. in the two patient groups (dcv + asv-svr and sof + ldv-svr), serum total cholesterol (tc), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), and triglycerides were measured at baseline during treatment and at 4 and 12 wk after treatment. then, longitudinal changes in lipid profiles were analyzed. results serum levels of tc, ldl-c, and hdl-c were significantly increased throughout the observation period in both the dcv + asv-svr and sof + ldv-svr groups. during antivirus treatment, the increases in tc and ldl-c were significantly greater in the sof + ldvsvr group than in the dcv + asv-svr group (p < 0.001). at 4 and 12 wk after the therapy, serum levels of tc and ldl-c were similar between the two groups and were significantly greater than those at baseline. approximately 75%-80% of the increase in tc was derived from an increased ldl-c. in multiple regression analysis, the difference in therapy protocol (dca + asv or sof + ldv) was an independent predictor that was significantly associated with the increase in tc and ldl-c at 4 wk of therapy. conclusion serum cholesterol significantly increased during sof + ldv treatment. after treatment, hcv elimination was associated with a similar increase in cholesterol regardless of the therapy protocol.
hepatitis_c	background: in chronic hepatitis c, the fibrosis progression rates are extremely variable and can be influenced by factors associated with the host, virus and environment. among the associated metabolic factors, hepatic steatosis is characterized by an accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. in the host, genetic determinants of hepatic steatosis are observed, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (mttp) gene. the mttp -493g/t snp appears to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and influences the plasma concentration of circulating low-density lipoprotein (ldl). the present study investigated the influence of this snp in the development of hepatic steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis c and evaluated the association of hepatic steatosis with certain characteristics of these patients and the hepatitis c virus (hcv). methods: two hundred thirty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis c were genotyped for the mttp -493g/t snp by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assay. the association between hepatic steatosis and selected characteristics of the patient and virus was evaluated using bivariate and multivariate analyses. results: the most prevalent mttp -493g/t genotype was gg (46%) followed by gt (43.5%) and tt (10.5%). multivariate analysis of the total cohort revealed associations between the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammatory activity of moderate to high intensity (p < 0.001), advanced age (p = 0.010), elevated gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt) levels (p = 0.010) and low ldl levels (p = 0.022). hepatic steatosis was also associated with the tt/gt genotype of the mttp -493g/t snp in patients infected with hcv genotype 3 (p < 0.001). conclusions: in chronic hepatitis c patients infected with hcv genotype 3 and with the tt/gt genotype of the mttp -493g/t snp, a significant increase in hepatic steatosis was observed, which may indicate that this snp has a significant influence on the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. furthermore, associations were observed between hepatic steatosis and inflammatory activity of moderate to high intensity, advanced age, elevated ggt and low ldl levels.
headache	we report a case of paradoxical presentation of a postural postdural puncture headache secondary to dural puncture with a 25-gauge whitacre needle for combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. this 27-year old female patient presented to the emergency department with elevated blood pressure and a global headache 9 days after administration of epidural anesthesia for a spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy. the patient reported that the headache was more intense when lying down and immediately improved when she sat or stood up from a recumbent position. the patient was discharged from emergency depai tuient after an improvement following treatment with labetalol, ondansetron, ketorolac, and fluid resuscitation.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	intestinal barrier integrity is a prerequisite for homeostasis of mucosal function, which is balanced to maximise absorptive capacity, while maintaining efficient defensive reactions against chemical and microbial challenges. evidence is mounting that disruption of epithelial barrier integrity is one of the major aetiological factors associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, including infection by pathogens, obesity and diabetes, necrotising enterocolitis, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. the notion that specific probiotic bacterial strains can affect barrier integrity fuelled research in which in vitro cell lines, animal models and clinical trials are used to assess whether probiotics can revert the diseased state back to homeostasis and health. this review catalogues and categorises the lines of evidence available in literature for the role of probiotics in epithelial integrity and, consequently, their beneficial effect for the reduction of gastrointestinal disease symptoms.
low_testosterone	objective: to evaluate the occurrence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following a traumatic brain injury (tbi) and to determine its effect on functional improvement in acute inpatient rehabilitation. methods: a retrospective chart review identified male patients with a primary diagnosis of tbi with or without a skull fracture, an onset date within 6 months prior to admission, and were 16 years of age or older. the percentage of individuals in this population with abnormal hormone levels was determined on the basis of the established normal reference range for each hormone assay. the functional independence measure, which assesses functional outcomes in acute inpatient rehabilitation, was used to examine the relationship between hormone levels and functional improvement. results: hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was identified in nearly 70% of men following tbi. hypogonadism, or low testosterone levels, was observed in 66% of the patients, followed by low levels of free t-4 in 46% and low levels of insulin growth factor-1 in 26% of patients. hypopituitarism associated with impaired functional recovery. specifically, the functional independence measure change per day was significantly lower in patients with low levels of testosterone and insulin growth factor-1. conclusions: these findings suggest the importance of testosterone and insulin growth factor-1 activity in the early stages of physical and cognitive rehabilitation.
menopause	cognitive changes that occur during mid-life and beyond are linked to both aging and the menopause transition. studies in women suggest that the age at menopause onset can impact cognitive status later in life; yet, little is known about memory changes that occur during the transitional period to the postmenopausal state. the 4-vinylcydohexene diepoxide (vcd) model simulates transitional menopause in rodents by depleting the immature ovarian follicle reserve and allowing animals to retain their follicle-deplete ovarian tissue, resulting in a profile similar to the majority of perimenopausal women. here, vehicle or vcd treatment was administered to ovary-intact adult and middle-aged fischer-344 rats to assess the trajectory of cognitive change across time with normal aging and aging with transitional menopause via vcd-induced follicular depletion, as well as to evaluate whether age at the onset of follicular depletion plays a role in cognitive outcomes. animals experiencing the onset of menopause at a younger age exhibited impaired spatial memory early in the transition to a follicle-deplete state. additionally, at the mid-and post-follicular depletion time points, vcd-induced follicular depletion amplified an age effect on memory. overall, these findings suggest that age at the onset of menopause is a critical parameter to consider when evaluating learning and memory across the transition to reproductive senescence. from a translational perspective, this study illustrates how age at menopause onset might impact cognition in menopausal women, and provides insight into time points to explore for the window of opportunity for hormone therapy during the menopause transition period. hormone therapy during this critical juncture might be especially efficacious at attenuating age-and menopause-related cognitive decline, producing healthy brain aging profiles in women who retain their ovaries throughout their lifespan.

multiple_sclerosis	autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system generates proinflammatory molecules and autoantibodies that mistakenly attack their own body. traditional diagnosis of autoimmune disease is primarily based on physician assessment combined with core laboratory tests. however, these tests are not sensitive enough to detect early molecular events, and quite often, it is too late to control these autoimmune diseases and reverse tissue damage when conventional tests show positivity for disease. it is fortunate that during the past decade, research in nanotechnology has provided enormous opportunities for the development of ultrasensitive biosensors in detecting early biomarkers with high sensitivity. biosensors consist of a biorecognition element and a transducer which are able to facilitate an accurate detection of proinflammatory molecules, autoantibodies and other disease-causing molecules. apparently, novel biosensors could be superior to traditional metrics in assessing the drug efficacy in clinical trials, especially when specific biomarkers are indicative of the pathogenesis of disease. furthermore, the portability of a biosensor enables the development of pointof- care devices. in this review, various types of biomolecule sensing systems, including electrochemical, optical and mechanical sensors, and their applications and future potentials in autoimmune disease treatment were discussed.
parkinson's_disease	although non-motor symptoms (nms) of parkinson 's disease (pd) are very common also in early stages of the disease, they are still under-recognized. screening tools for non-motor symptoms, such as non-motor symptoms questionnaire (nmsquest), help clinicians to recognize nms and to evaluate if patients could require further assessment or specific treatments. to validate an adapted italian version of nmsquest and study its psychometric properties, italian pd patients self-completed italian nmsquest, and then underwent a standard clinical evaluation including motor assessment (by hoehn and yahr staging, unified parkinson 's disease rating scale part iii) and non-motor assessment (by montreal cognitive assessment, beck depression inventory, neuropsychiatric inventory, epworth sleepiness scale, scale for outcomes in parkinson 's disease-autonomic and movement disorder society-sponsored revision of the unified parkinson 's disease rating scale part i). somatic comorbidities were quantified using the modified cumulative illness rating scale (cirs). seventy-one subjects were assessed (mean age years 69.8 +/- 9.6 sd; 31% women; mean duration of disease 6.3 +/- 4.6 years; h&y median 2). italian nmsquest showed adequate satisfactory clinimetrics in terms of data quality, precision, acceptability, internal consistency and reliability. a significant correlation was found between nmsquest and most of non-motor assessment scales, while no significant correlation appeared with motor severity as well as with age of patients, disease duration, levodopa equivalent daily dose, l-dopa/dopamine agonists assumption and cirs total score. the italian version of the nmsquest resulted as a reliable instrument for screening nms in italian pd patients.
parkinson's_disease	purpose the purpose of this study was to identify the specific metabolic brain pattern characteristic for parkinson 's disease (pd): parkinson 's disease-related pattern (pdrp), using network analysis of [18f]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (fdg-pet) brain images in a cohort of slovenian pd patients. methodstwenty pd patients (age 70.1 +/- 7.8 years, movement disorder society unified parkinson 's disease motor rating scale (mds-updrs-iii) 38.3 +/- 12.2; disease duration 4.3 +/- 4.1 years) and 20 age-matched normal controls (ncs) underwent fdg-pet brain imaging. an automatic voxel-based scaled subprofile model/principal component analysis (ssm/pca) was applied to these scans for pdrp-slovenia identification. results the pattern was characterized by relative hypermetabolism in pallidum, putamen, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum associated with hypometabolism in sensorimotor cortex, posterior parietal, occipital, and frontal cortices. the expression of pdrp-slovenia discriminated pd patients from ncs (p < 0.0001) and correlated positively with patients' clinical score (mds-updrs-iii, p = 0.03). additionally, its topography agrees well with the original pdrp (p < 0.001) identified in american cohort of pd patients. we validated the pdrp-slovenia expression on additional fdg-pet scans of 20 pd patients, 20 ncs, and 25 patients with atypical parkinsonism (ap). we confirmed that the expression of pdrp-slovenia manifests good diagnostic accuracy with specificity and sensitivity of 85-90% at optimal pattern expression cutoff for discrimination of pd patients and ncs and is not expressed in ap. conclusion pdrp-slovenia proves to be a robust and reproducible functional imaging biomarker independent of patient population. it accurately differentiates pd patients from ncs and ap and correlates well with the clinical measure of pd progression.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objective: hypnotic suggestion is an empirically validated form of pain control; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. methods: thirteen fibromyalgia patients received suggestions to alter their clinical pain, and 15 healthy controls received suggestions to alter experimental heat pain. suggestions were delivered before and after hypnotic induction with blood oxygen level-dependent (bold) activity measured concurrently. results: across groups, suggestion produced substantial changes in pain report (main effect of suggestion, f-2,f- 312 = 585.8; p<.0001), with marginally larger changes after induction (main effect of induction, f-1,f- 312 = 3.6; p = .060). in patients, bold response increased with pain report in regions previously associated with pain, including thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex. in controls, bold response decreased with pain report. all changes were greater after induction. region-of-interest analysis revealed largely linear patient responses with increasing pain report. control responses, however, were higher after suggestion to increase or decrease pain from baseline. conclusions: based on behavioral report alone, the mechanism of suggestion could be interpreted as largely similar regardless of the induction or type of pain experience. the functional magnetic resonance imaging data, however, demonstrated larger changes in brain activity after induction and a radically different pattern of brain activity for clinical pain compared with experimental pain. these findings imply that induction has an important effect on underlying neural activity mediating the effects of suggestion, and the mechanism of suggestion in patients altering clinical pain differs from that in controls altering experimental pain. patient responses imply that suggestions altered pain experience via corresponding changes in pain-related brain regions, whereas control responses imply suggestion engaged cognitive control.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background & aims: approximately one third of patients who present to gastroenterology care with constipation have rectal evacuation disorders. we aimed to compare rectal gas volume, measured by computerized tomography (ct), in constipated patients with and without rectal evacuation disorders. methods: in a retrospective study, wecollected data from1553 patients with constipation, evaluated over 20 years. we analyzed data from 141 patients evaluated by anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion tests, and colon transit tests, collecting records of abdominal and pelvic ct examinations. patients were classified into 3 subgroups: those with rectal evacuation disorders, slow-transit constipation, or normal-transit constipation. two observers used standard ct software to identify variable regions of interest on each cross-sectional ct image that contained rectum and measured areas of gas in each slice; they then summated entire volumes of rectal gas. for the 3 groups, we compared rectal gas volume, maximal rectal gas transaxial area (measured by ct), and area of rectal gas (vertical) on the 2-dimensional abdominal film (scout) using the kruskal-wallis test. results: the intraclass correlation coefficient between 2 observers' measurements of rectal gas volume was 0.99 (p < .001). there were overall group differences in rectal gas volume and the maximal rectal gas transaxial area (both p < .001). themedian rectal gas volumewas higher in patients with rectal evacuation disorders (13.84 cm(3)) than in patients with slow-transit (2.51 cm(3)) or normal-transit constipation (1.33 cm(3), both p < .05). similarly, the area of rectal gas, which correlated with the maximal rectal gas transaxial area (spearman correlation coefficient, 0.7; p < .001), showed overall 3-group differences (p =. 033), with greater areas of rectal gas on the abdominal scout film in patients with rectal evacuation disorders than in those with normal-transit constipation. conclusions: in an analysis of patients with constipation, we found rectal gas volume, determined by abdominal ct imaging, to be greater in patients with than without rectal evacuation disorders.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	cardiac ion channelopathies are an important cause of sudden death in the young and include long qt syndrome, brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and short qt syndrome. genes that encode ion channels have been implicated in all of these conditions, leading to the widespread implementation of genetic testing for suspected channelopathies. over the past half-century, researchers have also identified systemic pathologies that extend beyond the arrhythmic phenotype in patients with ion channel gene mutations, including deafness, epilepsy, cardiomyopathy, periodic paralysis, and congenital heart disease. a coexisting phenotype, such as cardiomyopathy, can influence evaluation and management. however, prior to recent molecular advances, our understanding and recognition of these overlapping phenotypes were poor. this review highlights the systemic and structural heart manifestations of the cardiac ion channelopathies, including their phenotypic spectrum and molecular basis.
heart_disease	an incompetent aortic valve (av) results in aortic regurgitation (ar), where retrograde flow of blood into the left ventricle (lv) is observed. in this work, we parametrically characterized the detailed changes in intra-ventricular flow during diastole as a result of ar in a physiological in vitro left-heart simulator (lhs). the loss of energy within the lv as the level of ar increased was also assessed. the validated lhs consisted of an optically-clear, flexible wall lv and a modular av holder. two-component, planar, digital particle image velocimetry was used to visualize and quantify intra-ventricular flow. a large coherent vortical structure which engulfed the whole lv was observed under control conditions. in the cases with ar, the regurgitant jet was observed to generate a ""kinematic obstruction'' between the mitral valve and the lv apex, preventing the trans-mitral jet from generating a coherent vortical structure. the regurgitant jet was also observed to impinge on the inferolateral wall of the lv. energy dissipation rate (edr) for no, trace, mild, and moderate ar were found to be 1.15, 2.26, 3.56, and 5.99 w/m(3), respectively. this study has, for the first time, performed an in vitro characterization of intraventricular flow in the presence of ar. mechanistically, the formation of a ""kinematic obstruction'' appears to be the cause of the increased edr (a metric quantifiable in vivo) during ar. edr increases non-linearly with ar fraction and could potentially be used as a metric to grade severity of ar and develop clinical interventional timing strategies for patients.
hepatitis_c	about 2.5% of the world population, corresponding to about 177 million individuals, are infected by hepatitis c virus (hcv), a small, single-stranded rna virus. the prevalence of hcv infection among dialysis patients in japan, europe, and north america during the 2012 to 2015 period was found to be 8.7% in the dopps study. nosocomial hcv spread in hemodialysis facilities still occurs. increased hepatic tissue iron has been shown to play a deleterious role in the course of hepatitis c, favor development of fibrosis and cirrhosis and possibly increase the risk of liver cancer in the general population. regular loss of blood in the hemodialysis circuit, in routine blood sampling for laboratory tests (for uremia monitoring), and in gut due to uremic enteropathy, invariably results in iron deficiency for which patients are commonly treated with intravenous (iv) iron preparations. data on the effects of iv iron in hemodialysis patients with hepatitis c are limited (2 studies) and strongly suggest that parenteral iron may contribute to hepatocellular injury. iatrogenic iron overload is extremely prevalent among hemodialysis population worldwide. iron overload and toxicity has emerged as one of the most controversial topic in the management of anemia in dialysis patients. given the known impact of iron in promoting growth and virulence of hcv and the associated liver disease, it is necessary to use iron therapy cautiously and closely monitor plasma markers of iron metabolism and liver iron stores non-invasively by means of mri to avoid iron overload in this vulnerable population.
hypothyroidism	aim of this commentary is to report the most recent views about natural history of subclinical hypothyroidism (sh) according to the different etiologies. in children with idiopathic sh the natural evolution is often favourable, with a high percentage of cases reverting to euthyroidism or remaining sh even after a prolonged follow-up. by contrast, the risk of a significant deterioration of thyroid status is distinctly higher in the sh children with hashimoto 's thyroiditis (ht). this risk is even higher in the cases with both ht-related sh and chromosomal abnormalities, such as turner or down 's syndrome.
hypothyroidism	diabetes and chronic narcotic use negatively affect the quality of bowel preparation before colonoscopy. to investigate whether narcotic use and diabetes have an additive negative impact on bowel preparation. we performed a retrospective study of 2841 patients (mean age 61 +/- 10.2; 94% male) who received outpatient colonoscopies at our veterans affairs medical center between june 2012 and december 2014. we collected information related to demographics, body mass index, indications, and medical/surgical history (diabetes mellitus, stroke, cirrhosis, dementia, constipation, hypothyroidism, and use of narcotics or antidepressants/anxiolytics for more than three months). patients were classified into four groups: (1) diabetics on narcotics, (2) diabetics only, (3) on narcotics only, and (4) neither diabetic nor using narcotics. quality of the bowel preparation was scored using the boston bowel preparation scale (bbps) and categorized as either excellent (bbps >= 7, with no individual segment scoring < 2) or not excellent (bbps < 7). multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the combined impact of narcotic use and diabetes on bowel preparation. bowel preparation quality was excellent in 49%. thirty-eight percent of patients with diabetes who were using narcotics (adjusted or 0.6, ci [0.4, 0.8]) achieved excellent bowel preparation compared with 44% (adjusted or 0.7, ci [0.6, 0.9]) of patients on narcotics only, 48% (adjusted or 0.8, ci [0.7, 0.9]) of diabetics only, and 54% of patients with neither condition. concomitant narcotic use and diabetes have a compounding effect on the quality of bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy.
emergency_contraception	study objective: to assess initiation of sexual activity and contraception methods used among greek adolescents. to determine the association of adolescents' emotional and behavioral status with their sexual activity. design: a descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted. setting, participants: the population (n = 1074, age 14-16) consisted of a random sample, stratified according to locality and population density, of 20 public junior high and high schools located in the urban district of athens, greece. interventions: anonymous self-reported questionnaires were used to assess sexual activity choices and contraception methods. the youth self-report questionnaire was used to evaluate the psychosocial competencies and difficulties of greek adolescents. measures: analyses included frequencies with chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis. main outcome: factors that may influence sexual engagement of greek adolescents were assessed. results: of the adolescents who completed the questionnaire 21.8% reported having experienced sexual intercourse. the male/female ratio was 3/1 (p < .001) and the mean age of sexual debut was 14.5 +/- 0.9 years. condoms were the most preferred contraceptive method (79.9%), followed by withdrawal (38.9%). emergency contraception was used by 9.6% of participants. adolescents with separated, divorced or with a deceased parent, and non-greek nationality have higher possibility of being sexually active. adolescents who reported sexual intercourse had significantly higher score of thought problems (beta = 1.07, se = 0.35, p = .002), attention difficulties (beta = 0.67, se = 0.29, p = .022), delinquent behavior problems (beta = 2.37, se = 0.34, p < .001), aggressive behavior (beta = 1.97, se = 0.48, p < .001), and externalizing problems (beta = 4.18, se = 0.78, p < .001). conclusions: engagement in sexual activities was significantly associated with psychosocial difficulties among adolescents living in greece.
menopause	objective: chronic periodontitis (cp) is associated with increased systemic inflammation and osteoporosis. proinflammatory cytokines, implicated in systemic bone loss, are also associated with periodontitis. the impact of control of systemic inflammation by scaling and root planing (srp) on bone mineral density (bmd) in postmenopausal (pm) osteopenic women with cp was investigated in this study. method and materials: sixty-eight pm osteopenic women with cp were included. the test group (n = 34) received srp along with calcium (500 mg) and vitamin d (250 iu) supplementation twice a day for 6 months, while the control group (n = 34) received calcium (500 mg) and vitamin d (250 iu) supplemen-tation twice a day for 6 months. bmd, serum high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp), and periodontal parameters were recorded at baseline and 6 months. results: improvement in bmd and serum hscrp showed a statistically significant difference between groups at 6 months (p <.001). binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that the test group was 4.82 (or adjusted = 4.82; 95% ci = 1.17-19.71; p =.029) times more likely to exhibit normal bmd at 6 months. the results suggest there is an association of control of systemic inflammation by srp with improved bmd in pm osteopenic women with generalized severe cp.
parenting	objective: to: 1) examine sociodemographic factors associated with high parental self-efficacy and perceived control, and 2) determine how self-efficacy and control relate to the home learning environment (hle), including whether they mediate the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and hle, among low-income parents of young children. methods: cross-sectional survey of english- and spanish speaking parents, 18 years of age and older, with children 15 to 36 months old, to assess parental self-efficacy, perceived control, hle, and sociodemographic characteristics. bivariate analysis identified sociodemographic predictors of high self-efficacy and control. separate multivariate linear regression models were used to examine associations between self efficacy, control, and the hle. formal path analysis was used to assess whether self-efficacy and control mediate the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and hle. results: of 144 participants, 25% were white, 65% were immigrants, and 35% completed the survey in spanish. us-born subjects, those who completed english surveys, or who had higher educational levels had significantly higher mean self-efficacy and perceived control scores (p <.05). higher self-efficacy and perceived control were associated with a positive change in hle score in separate multivariate models (self-efficacy beta =.7 [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.5-0.9]; control beta=.5 [95% ci, 0.2-0.8]). self-efficacy acted as a mediator such that low self-efficacy explained part of the association between parental depressive symptoms, immigrant status, and less optimal hle (p =.04 and <.001, respectively). conclusions: high parental self-efficacy and perceived control positively influence hles of young children. self-efficacy alone mediates the relationship between parental depressive symptoms, immigrant status, and less optimal early home learning.
heart_disease	although it is known that 1-methylnicotinamide (mna) displays vasoprotective activity in mice, as yet the effect of mna on endothelial function has not been demonstrated in vivo. here, using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) we profile the effects of mna on endothelial phenotype in mice with atherosclerosis (apoe/ldlr-/-) in vivo, in comparison to angiotensin (ang) -converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor (perindopril), with known vasoprotective activity. on a biochemical level, we analyzed whether mna-or perindopril-induced improvement in endothelial function results in changes in ace/ang ii-ace2/ang-(1-7) balance, and l-arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine (adma) ratio. endothelial function and permeability were evaluated in the brachiocephalic artery (bca) in 4-month-old apoe/ldlr-/- mice that were non-treated or treated for 1 month or 2 months with either mna (100 mg/kg/day) or perindopril (10 mg/kg/day). the 3d intragate (r) flash sequence was used for evaluation of bca volume changes following acetylcholine (ach) administration, and for relaxation time (t-1) mapping around bca to assess endothelial permeability using an intravascular contrast agent. activity of ace/ang ii and ace2/ang-(1-7) pathways as well as metabolites of l-arginine/adma pathway were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based methods. in non-treated 6-month-old apoe/ldlr-/- mice, ach induced a vasoconstriction in bca that amounted to -7.2%. 2-month treatment with either mna or perindopril resulted in the reversal of impaired ach-induced response to vasodilatation (4.5 and 5.5%, respectively) and a decrease in endothelial permeability (by about 60% for mna-, as well as perindopril-treated mice). improvement of endothelial function by mna and perindopril was in both cases associated with the activation of ace2/ang-(1-7) and the inhibition of ace/ang ii axes as evidenced by an approximately twofold increase in ang-(1-9) and ang-(1-7) and a proportional decrease in ang ii and its active metabolites. finally, mna and perindopril treatment resulted in an increase in l-arginine/adma ratio by 107% (mna) and 140% (perindopril), as compared to non-treated mice. functional and biochemical endothelial profiling in apoe/ldlr-/- mice in vivo revealed that 2-month treatment with mna (100 mg/kg/day) displayed a similar profile of vasoprotective effect as 2-month treatment with perindopril (10 mg/kg/day): i.e., the improvement in endothelial function that was associated with the beneficial changes in ace/ang ii-ace2/ang (1-7) balance and in l-arginine/adma ratio in plasma.
low_testosterone	low total testosterone (tt) and sexual symptoms are common among men with coronary artery disease, however its impact on major adverse cardiovascular events (mace) is still debatable. we investigated whether low tt and coexisting sexual symptoms in men with acute coronary syndrome (acs) can be used to predict the incidence of mace. in the prospective study 120 consecutive men (mean age 58 +/- 9 years; diabetes 27%; current smokers 58%; left ventricular ejection fraction 50 +/- 10%) with acs were included. the group of men with the presence of three sexual symptoms (decreased frequency of morning erections, a lack of sexual thoughts and erectile dysfunction) and with tt serum concentration <3.2 ng/ml was distinguished. all of the patients had their prognosis assessed according to the global registry of acute coronary events (grace score 2.0). primary composite endpoint mace (recurrent ischaemia, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and death) and secondary endpoint - in stent restenosis (isr) were registered during the 18.3 month follow-up period. the mean tt level in the entire group was 3.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml. low tt was diagnosed in 63 (52.5%) men. both low tt and sexual symptoms were diagnosed in 57 (47%) participants. during the follow-up, 29 (24.2%) participants experienced mace, 20 (16.6%) men isr. in the cox proportional hazards regression, high risk of death on the grace score (hr 3.16; 95% ci: 1.5-6.6; p = 0.002), the presence of low tt and sexual symptoms (hr 2.75; 95% ci: 1.26-6.04; p = 0.02) independently predicted an incidence of a mace (p = 0.006). for the secondary endpoint only low tt and sexual symptoms (hr 2.68; 95% ci: 1.03-6.94; p = 0.034) were independent covariates which predicted irs. low tt which coexists with sexual symptoms in males with acs can be used to predict mace, especially irs independently of classic cardiovascular risk factors.
allergies	ailanthus altissima pollen (aap) is considered as an emerging cause of respiratory allergy in united states, italy and iran. however, the allergenic composition of aap is still unknown and has yet to be characterized. the present study aimed to identify aap allergens using a proteomics-based approach. for this purpose, optimized aap protein extracts were analyzed using 1d- and 2d- gel electrophoresis and confronted to twenty sera from individuals with respiratory allergy during the aap season. candidate allergens were detected using the serum from an allergic patient with clinical history of aap pollinosis. ige-binding spots were identified using maldi-tof/of mass spectrometry and database searching. according to our results, aap extracts were rich in proteins (up to 16.25 mg/ml) with a molecular-weight distribution ranging from 10 to 175 kda. two-d electrophoresis of aap extracts revealed 125 protein spots from which 13 were ige reactive. these ige-binding proteins were identified as enolase, calreticulin, probable pectate lyase 6, conserved hypothetical protein and ras-related protein rhn1-like. by our knowledge, this study is the first report identifying aap allergens. these findings will open up further avenues for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of the aap allergy as well as for the cloning and molecular characterization of relevant allergens. biological significance: ailanthus altissima colonizes new areas every year in iran and is spreading aggressively worldwide. according to usda, the tree of heaven is now present as an invasive plant in 30 states in us (www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/treeheaven.shtml) and come to dominate large areas in many regions. up to now, several cases of allergy to a. altissima pollen have been reported in united states, italy and iran [14]. however, there is still no information on the sensitizing allergens and the molecular origin of these clinical symptoms, which constitutes a serious threat to patients suffering from respiratory allergies in these regions. to our knowledge, the current study describes, therefore, the first panel of proteins responsible for ige-mediated a. altissima pollinosis by using a gel-based proteomic approach. this work represents the pioneer proteomic investigation on simaroubaceae spp. and provides useful insights for further studies on the allergens of this widely distributed plant family.

myelofibrosis	introduction: philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (ph-mpn) are characterized by overproduction of one or more blood cell lines. methods: we studied the proliferative characteristics of 91 patients with de novo ph-mpn. colony-forming cells (cfc) and endogenous colonies (ec), from bone marrow (bm) and/or peripheral blood (pb), were analyzed by colony assay based on methylcellulose. the level of circulating cd34(+) cells was determined by flow cytometry. results: the total number of pb cfc in primary myelofibrosis (pmf) was increased compared to the control sample (p < 0.01) and essential thrombocythemia (et) (p < 0.05). the highest number of bm and pb ec was observed in polycythemia vera (pv) (p < 0.01). increased levels of cd34(+) cells characterized early-prefibrotic (57%) and advanced-fibrotic pmf (90%) as compared to pv (34%) and et (32%) (p < 0.01). in the whole ph-mpn group, the total number of pb cfc (p < 0.01), pb ec (p < 0.05), and cd34+ cells (p < 0.01) correlated with the degree of bm fibrosis. higher levels of circulating cd34(+) cells in pmf correlated with the total number of pb ec (p < 0.05) and degree of bm fibrosis (p < 0.01). conclusions: exploration of the pb proliferative characteristics of ph-mpn on diagnosis may be helpful in revealing early-prefibrotic pmf. monitoring the levels of circulating cd34(+) cells may provide a sensitive indicator of fibrotic evolution in pv and pmf.
headache	mind-body medicine is a system of health practices that includes meditation/relaxation training, guided imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback, yoga, art/music therapy, prayer, tai chi, and psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy. clinical hypnosis is an important mind-body tool that serves as an adjunct to conventional medical care for the adolescent patient. clinical hypnosis specifically uses self-directed therapeutic suggestions to cultivate the imagination and facilitate the mind-body connection, leading to positive emotional and physical well-being. there are many similarities between clinical hypnosis and other mind-body/self-regulatory modalities such as visual imagery, mindfulness meditation, yoga, and biofeedback that incorporate experiential learning and mechanisms for change. they may be viewed as subtypes of the hypnotic experience and share the common experience of trance as the entree into self-empowered change in physiologic and psychological states. clinical hypnosis can be used by health care providers to teach adolescents coping skills to deal with a wide variety of conditions such as chronic headaches, recurrent abdominal pain, anxiety, depression, grief and bereavement, phobias, anger, family stressors, sleep disorders, or enuresis. clinical vignettes are given to help illustrate the effectiveness of hypnosis in adolescents.
menopause	introductionafter premenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (rrso) to prevent ovarian cancer, the non-cancer-related morbidity and mortality may be increased if sex hormones are not replaced. several guidelines recommend systemic hormone replacement therapy (hrt) to these women until the expected age of menopause. we aimed to study the use of hrt after rrso. material and methodsparticipants were 324 women after rrso and 11 160 postmenopausal controls. a subsample of 950 controls had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (bso). all participants completed the same questionnaire regarding hrt use. we compared hrt use in the rrso group with the bso controls using logistic regression. resultsamong the women aged 52 years without a history of breast cancer, 51.7% of the rrso group and 48.7% of the bso controls reported current use of systemic hrt (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.76). among the hrt users, systemic estrogen was used by 35.1% and 58.7% in the rrso and bso control groups, respectively (p = 0.001). among the women aged >52 years, 16.8% of the rrso group and 38.4% of the bso controls (p52 years used systemic hrt. doctors should be aware of this practice and prescribe systemic hrt when indicated.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	purpose: pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines are important modulators of the immune response and play a major role in conditions of intestinal inflammation, such as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). cytokine production is regulated genetically, and imbalances in cytokine secretion may affect disease susceptibility and clinical outcomes of various conditions. there is a rapidly growing body of evidence to support an etiologic role for gastrointestinal infection and the associated immune activation in the development of postinfectious ibs. other factors such as psychological stress, anxiety, and depression may likely be involved in the altered profiles of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines that lead to chronic ibs. methods: we searched the literature using pubmed, medline, and google scholar with related key terms and prepared this review article on that basis. findings: interleukin (il)-10 is a regulatory cytokine that inhibits both antigen presentation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. therefore, it is proposed as a potent antiinflammatory biological therapy for ibs. implications: recently, a strong interest in the therapeutic potential of il-10 for ibs has developed. the diverse roles of il-10 in ibs are reviewed here. we conducted an in-depth review on il-10 and ibs to address this question. future studies of il-10 may provide new insights into ibs therapy.

menopause	the pathophysiology of prolapse is not well understood. however, two main theories predominate: either the fibromuscular layer of the vagina develops a defect/tears away from its supports, or its tissues are stretched and attenuated. the aim of this study was to assess how vaginal wall thickness (vwt) is related to vaginal prolapse. the study group comprised 243 women with symptomatic prolapse recruited from the outpatient department of a tertiary referral centre for urogynaecology. a history was taken and women were examined to determine their pop-q score. using a previously validated technique, ultrasonography was used to measure the mean vwt at three anatomical sites on the anterior and posterior walls. scores were then compared using t tests, the kruskal-wallis test and the friedman test. the mean age of the patients was 59.7 years (sd 12.0 years range 38 - 84 years). for each measurement vwt reduced as prolapse grade increased until the prolapse extended beyond the hymen. women with grade 3 prolapse had a significantly higher mean vwt than women with grade 1 or 2 contained prolapse. menopause status did not have a significant effect on the vwt. vwt is lower in women with vaginal prolapse until the prolapse extends beyond the hymen and then vwt is thicker and comparable with women without prolapse. this may be explained by changes in the vaginal tissue including reduction of collagen, elastin and smooth muscle, as well as fibrosis in exposed tissues, rather than by defects in the vagina.
parkinson's_disease	objectives: patients with parkinson 's disease (pd) begin to lose weight several years before diagnosis, which suggests weight variation is associated with some factor(s) that precede the onset of motor symptoms. this study aimed to investigate the association of autonomic nervous system with body weight in patients with pd. materials and methods: the subjects were 90 patients with early de novo pd. we examined the associations of body mass index (bmi) with sympathetic nervous - activity reflected in orthostatic intolerance or cardiac uptake of i-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and parasympathetic nervous activity reflected in constipation or heart rate variability (hrv). results: twelve patients (13.3%) were overweight (bmi>25 kg/m(2)), 62 patients (68.9%) were normal-weight (18.5 <= bmi<25 kg/m(2)), and 16 patients (17.8%) were underweight (bmi<18.5 kg/m(2)). underweight patients had greater disease severity and decrease in blood pressure on head-up tilt-table testing, higher cardiac washout ratio of i-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine, and lower hrv and complained of constipation more often than those with normal-weight or overweight patients. on multiple regression analyses, the correlation of these variables with bmi maintained statistical significance after adjustment for age, sex, symptom duration, and motor subtype. conclusions: dysautonomia and disease severity are closely related to body weight independently of age, sex, symptom duration, and motor subtype. dysautonomia may play a partial role on weight variation in the early stage of pd.
skin_care	one of the most significant, and growing, challenges in modern medicine, i.e. the treatment of chronic wounds, is marked by nonuniform data. this concerns both prevalence and incidence of chronic dermatosis, in particular venous ulcers (ulcus cruris), as well as the impact on the health-related quality of life, and practical and economic parameters of the success of different therapies. the aim of this work is to examine the epidemiology of chronic wounds, in particular age-associated venous ulcers, their impact on health-related quality of life, the treatment regimen, and practical and economic parameters of the success of different therapies. performed were analysis of data on the care of venous ulcers in germany, based on secondary data of barmer gek from 2009 and 2012, comparison with data of a nhs kent community health trust study, and analysis of studies concerning structures, processes and critical success factors for the treatment of chronic wounds, including economic effects. early causal therapy with treatment based on the stage of the wound, consequent goal-oriented interdisciplinary care, and relapse prophylaxis is critical for successful healing of venous ulcers. the costs of treatment significantly correlate with the duration of treatment which can be reduced by up to 60 % using guideline-based concepts for the treatment of chronic wounds. treatment success, in particular with regard to cost-benefit considerations, can be optimized by telemedicine networks of key players who treat chronic wounds.
myelofibrosis	we conducted a 17-year nationwide survey (1999-2015) to elucidate the clinical outcomes of patients with primary myelofibrosis (pmf) in japan. questionnaires were sent annually to approximately 500 hematology departments. newly diagnosed patients with pmf were enrolled in this study, and were followed up annually to collect prognostic information. approximately 50 patients were enrolled per year, yielding a total of 780 patients with pmf included in this study. the median age at diagnosis was 66 years. at the time of analysis, the median survival duration was 47 months, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 59 %. infection and disease transformation into acute leukemia were the most frequent causes of death. of the proposed prognostic models for predicting the outcomes of pmf patients in japan, the dynamic international prognostic scoring system of pmf plus model was the most feasible. forty-three patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allosct) at a median of 343 days after diagnosis. this treatment significantly prolonged the survival of pmf patients, and the 3-year overall survival rate after first allosct was 84 %. a long-term registration study is required for further evaluation of prognosis and the impact of treatments on survival.
senior_health	the objective was to evaluate long-term transverse, anteroposterior and vertical skeletal changes after rapid maxillary expansion (rme). the data were clinical trials that assessed skeletal changes through cephalometric analysis. no surgical or other simultaneous treatment during the evaluation period was accepted. electronic databases (pubmed, medline, medline in-process & other non-indexed citations, cochrane database of systematic reviews, asp journal club, dare, cctr, embase, web of sciences and lilacs) were searched with the help of a senior health sciences librarian. abstracts that appeared to fulfill the initial selection criteria were selected by consensus. the original articles were then retrieved. a methodological checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the selected articles. their references were also hand-searched for possible missing articles. articles without an adequate control group to factor out growth changes were excluded. only three articles (one measuring transverse and two anteroposterior and vertical changes) measured rme stability after active expansion, all of them had some methodological flaws, which limit the attainable conclusions. an individual analysis of these articles was made. long-term transverse skeletal maxillary increase is approximately 25% of the total dental expansion for prepubertal adolescents. better long-term outcomes are expected in transverse changes because of rme in less skeletally mature patients. rme appears not to produce clinically significant anteroposterior or vertical changes in the position of the maxilla and mandible. the conclusions from this systematic review should be considered with caution because only a secondary level of evidence was found. long-term randomized clinical trials are needed.
multiple_sclerosis	the aim of this study was to evaluate thymus function in mice with hypertension. a total of 60 c57bl/6j mice were randomized into control, sham surgery and two-kidney, one-clip groups (n=20 in each). at 4 or 8 weeks after surgery, mice were sacrificed, and blood, spleens, kidneys and thymuses were harvested. the results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the mrna levels of forkhead box protein n1 (foxn1) and autoimmune regulator (aire) in the thymus tissue of mice from the htn group were significantly lower than those from the control group at 4 and 8 weeks (p<0.05). foxn1 and aire expression was also reduced in the sham surgery group at 4 weeks after surgery, but had recovered 4 weeks later. similar results were observed for the expression of signal-joint t cell receptor excision circles and the percentages of t cell subsets. the present study indicates that impaired thymus function is associated with hypertension in mice, which suggests that thymus function may be a novel target for the treatment of patients with hypertension.
weight_loss	bariatric surgery has increased in popularity, with roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) being one of the most frequently performed. this leads to many cases in which the stomach is removed from routine gastroscopy access, sometimes being a major source of concern. performing enteroscopy in these patients is technically difficult. we present our experience with 24 cases in which the aim was to access the detached stomach. retrospective analysis on rygb enteroscopy procedures aimed to access the detached stomach. data recorded: demographic parameters, indication, gas insufflation, time to bypass stomach, total procedure and recovery times, and endoscopic and pathological findings. this study included 24 patients who underwent rygb in the previous 3-36 months. indications were chronic abdominal pain, refractory anemia, or unexplainable weight loss. detached stomach was accessed in 79% of patients. access time ranged from 25 to 55 min. recovery time for all procedures was 86.66 min on average and shorter with co2 insufflation (42.5 min). all detached stomachs showed macroscopic gastritis; four of them were helicobacter pylori positive. significant findings included three patients with jejunojejunostomy stenosis and one patient with a marginal gastrojejunal ulcer, which was later diagnosed with signet ring cell carcinoma of the proximal anastomosis. we present the feasibility and importance of enteroscopy of the detached stomach and believe that this procedure should be performed more frequently. a high index of suspicion is needed for postoperative symptoms in order to exclude significant pathologies and reassure symptomatic patients that there is no abnormality in the bypassed stomach.
cancer	determination of intra-tumor high-uptake area using 2-deoxy-2-[f-18]fluoro-d-glucose ([f-18]fdg) positron emission tomography (pet) imaging is an important consideration for dose painting in radiation treatment applications. the aim of our study was to develop a framework towards automated segmentation and labeling of homogeneous vs. heterogeneous tumors in clinical lung [f-18]fdg-pet with the capability of intra-tumor high-uptake region delineation. we utilized and extended a fuzzy random walk pet tumor segmentation algorithm to delineate intra-tumor high-uptake areas. tumor textural feature (tf) analysis was used to find a relationship between tumor type and tf values. segmentation accuracy was evaluated quantitatively utilizing 70 clinical [f-18]fdg-pet lung images of patients with a total of 150 solid tumors. for volumetric analysis, the dice similarity coefficient (dsc) and hausdorff distance (hd) measures were extracted with respect to gold-standard manual segmentation. a multi-linear regression model was also proposed for automated tumor labeling based on tfs, including cross-validation analysis. two-tailed t test analysis of tfs between homogeneous and heterogeneous tumors revealed significant statistical difference for size-zone variability (szv), intensity variability (iv), zone percentage (zp), proposed parameters ii and iii, entropy and tumor volume (p < 0.001), dissimilarity, high intensity emphasis (hie), and suvmin (p < 0.01). lower statistical differences were observed for proposed parameter i (p = 0.02), and no significant differences were observed for suvmax and suvmean. furthermore, the spearman rank analysis between visual tumor labeling and tf analysis depicted a significant correlation for szv, iv, entropy, parameters ii and iii, and tumor volume (0.68 aerho ae0.84) and moderate correlation for zp, hie, homogeneity, dissimilarity, parameter i, and suvmin (0.22 aerho ae0.52), while no correlations were observed for suvmax and suvmean (rho < 0.08). the multi-linear regression model for automated tumor labeling process resulted in r (2) and rmse values of 0.93 and 0.14, respectively (p < 0.001), and generated tumor labeling sensitivity and specificity of 0.93 and 0.89. with respect to baseline random walk segmentation, the results showed significant (p < 0.001) mean dsc, hd, and suvmean error improvements of 21.4 +/- 11.5 %, 1.4 +/- 0.8 mm, and 16.8 +/- 8.1 % in homogeneous tumors and 7.4 +/- 4.4 %, 1.5 +/- 0.6 mm, and 7.9 +/- 2.7 % in heterogeneous lesions. in addition, significant (p < 0.001) mean dsc, hd, and suvmean error improvements were observed for tumor sub-volume delineations, namely 5 +/- 2 %, 1.5 +/- 0.6 mm, and 7 +/- 3 % for the proposed fuzzy rw method compared to rw segmentation. we proposed and demonstrated an automatic framework for significantly improved segmentation and labeling of homogeneous vs. heterogeneous tumors in lung [f-18]fdg-pet images.
birth_control	introduction in recent research, scientists have begun to suspect that birth control pill use could interfere with key mechanisms that play a role when women choose a sexual partner. many studies have shown that women, particularly during the most fertile days of their menstrual cycle, look for specific physical, psychological, and behavioral characteristics indicative of genetic quality in a short-term partner. aims analysis of the psychometric properties of the partner 's masculinity index (pmi) scale. the scale was built to assess the degree of masculinity in hypothetical short-term partners. methods a total of 395 female italian volunteers from central italy (m=32.9 years old, sd=8.58, range=18-50 years) completed the study. the psychometric properties of pmi were then evaluated. main outcome measures we administered the following self-report questionnaires: (i) pmi; (ii) minnesota multiphasic personality inventory-2 masculinity/femininity scale; and (iii) demographic questionnaire. results exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed a four-factor structure for the pmi. internal consistency of the measure, evaluated with the cronbach 's alpha, was satisfactory. factorial anova results showed that the group of nonpill users obtained higher scores on the pmi scale than the group of pill users (considering the fertile phase of the cycle). conclusions from an evolutionary point of view, changes in preference for indicators of genetic quality in a sexual partner are considered to be functional and adaptive. pill use may have implications for both current and future generations. directions for future research are discussed. gori a, giannini m, craparo g, caretti v, nannini i, madathil r, and schuldberg d. assessment of the relationship between the use of birth control pill and the characteristics of mate selection. j sex med 2014;11:2181-2187.
fungal_infection	fusarium head blight (fhb) is a global problem in small-grains agriculture that results in yield losses and, more seriously, produces harmful toxins that enter the food chain. this study builds on previous research identifying within-field humidity as an important factor in infection processes by fusarium species and its mycotoxin production. environmental variables describing topographic control of humidity (twi), soil texture and related moisture by electrical conductivity (eca), and canopy humidity by density (ndvi) were explored in their relationship to the fungal infection rates, the abundance of trichothecene-producing fusarium spp. as determined by tri 6 gene copies and mycotoxin accumulation. field studies were performed at four field sites in northeastern germany in 2009 and 2011. in the wet year 2011, a high fusarium infection rate resulted in a high abundance of trichothecene-producing fungi as well as high concentrations of mycotoxins. simultaneously, fusarium spp. inhibited the development of other filamentous fungi. overall, a very heterogeneous distribution of pathogen infections and mycotoxin concentrations were displayed in each field in each landscape. the ndvi serves as an important predictor of the occurrence of phytopathogenic fusarium fungi and their mycotoxins in a field and landscape scale. in addition, the eca reflects the distribution of the most frequently occurring mycotoxin deoxynivalenol within the fields and landscapes. in all cases, twi was not found to be a significant variable in the models. all in all, the results extend our knowledge about suitable indicators of fhb infection and mycotoxin production within the field.
emergency_contraception	objective: this study aims to retrospectively investigate the contraceptive methods of different reproductive-aged women in two different regions of yangzhou, china, to understand the changes of the contraceptive methods, and to analyze the targeted improvements of future informed choices of contraception and birth control, and reduce the occurrence of the unintended pregnancies. materials and methods: this study included 13,407 and 20,876 married reproductive-aged women (mcw) that were chosen from a city downtown and a county-level city, respectively, for the group-organized random sampling questionnaire survey. results: there was a significant urban-rural difference in the choice of contraceptive methods in different mcw. the female choices of contraception were single; the accessibility of contraceptive supplies, and personalized services could improve the implementation rate of long-term contraceptive measures. the cooperation of male contraceptive responsibility was related to the education levels and enhanced male-female communication. conclusions: it was very important for urban and rural women with different ages to choose different contraceptive measures, suggesting that these choices require the development of different educational models towards women of different ages and regions. the accessibility to various aspects of counseling and contraceptive measures should be strengthened, meanwhile male participation should also be promoted to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to reduce the health hazards related to sexual activities.
hypothyroidism	setting: in march 2006, the first multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr-tb) treatment programme was implemented in kenya. objective: to describe patients' treatment outcomes and adverse events. design: a retrospective case note review of patients started on mdr-tb treatment at two medecins sans frontieres-supported sites and the national referral hospital of kenya was undertaken. sites operated an ambulatory model of care. patients were treated for a minimum of 24 months with at least 4-5 drugs for the intensive phase of treatment, including an injectable agent. results: of 169 patients, 25.6% were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive and 89.3% were culture-positive at baseline. adverse events occurred in 67.4% of patients: 45.9% had nausea/vomiting, 43.9% electrolyte disturbance, 41.8% dyspepsia and 31.6% hypothyroidism. the median time to culture conversion was 2 months. treatment outcomes were as follows: 76.6% success, 14.5% deaths, 8.3% lost to follow-up and 0.7% treatment failure. hiv-positive individuals (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 3.51, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.12-11.03) and women (aor 2.73, 95%ci 1.01-7.39) had a higher risk of unfavourable outcomes, while the risk was lower in those with culture conversion at 6 months (aor 0.11, 95%ci 0.04-0.32). conclusion: in kenya, where an ambulatory model of care is used for mdr-tb treatment, treatment success was high, despite high rates of hiv. almost half of the patients experienced electrolyte disturbance and one third had hypothyroidism; this supports the view that systematic regular biochemical monitoring is needed in kenya.
cancer	purpose: the study aims to validate a score predicting risk of complications in pediatric patients with chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia (fn) and evaluate the performance of previously published models for risk stratification. patients and methods: children diagnosed with cancer and presenting with fn were evaluated in a prospective single-center study. a score predicting the risk of complications, previously derived in the unit, was validated on a prospective cohort. performance of six predictive models published from geographically distinct settings was assessed on the same cohort. results: complications were observed in 109 (26.3%) of 414 episodes of fn over 15 months. a risk score based on undernutrition (two points), time from last chemotherapy (60 mg/l = five points), and absolute neutrophil count (< 100 per mu l = two points) was used to stratify patients into ""low risk"" (score < 7, n = 208) and assessed using the following parameters: overall performance (nagelkerke r-2 = 34.4%), calibration (calibration slope = 0.39; p = 0.25 in hosmer-lemeshow test), discrimination (c-statistic = 0.81), overall sensitivity (86%), negative predictive value (93%), and clinical net benefit (0.43). six previously published rules demonstrated inferior performance in this cohort. conclusion: an indigenous decision rule using five simple predefined variables was successful in identifying children at risk for complications. prediction models derived in developed nations may not be appropriate for low-middle-income settings and need to be validated before use.
birth_control	background: women can choose from a range of contraceptive methods that differ in important ways. inadequate decision support may lead them to select a method that poorly fits their circumstances, leading to dissatisfaction, misuse, or nonuse. decision support interventions, such as decision aids, may help women choose a method of contraception that best fits their personal circumstances. to guide future decision aid development, we aim to summarize the attributes of contraceptive methods included in available decision aids as well as surveys and interviews of women actively choosing a contraceptive method. methods: we conducted a systematic review to identify attributes of contraceptive methods that may be important to women when engaging in this decision making process. we performed a database search of medline/pubmed, ovid embase, ovid central, ovid psycinfo, ebsco cinahl, popline, and scopus from 1985 until 2013 to identify decision aids, structured interviews and questionnaires reporting attributes of contraceptive options that are of importance to women. a free-text internet search was also performed to identify additional decision support tools. all articles and tools were reviewed in duplicate for inclusion, and a summary list of attributes was compiled. results: we included 20 surveys, 1 semistructured interview report and 19 decision aids, reporting 32 unique attributes. while some attributes were consistently included in surveys/interviews and decision aids, several were included more often in decision aids as opposed to surveys/interviews (e.g., sti prevention, noncontraceptive benefits, how the method is used, requirement of a healthcare provider), and vice versa (e.g., a woman 's vicarious experience with contraceptive methods). key attributes mentioned in both surveys/interviews and decision aids include efficacy (29 total mentioned) and side effects/health risks (28 total mentioned). while a limited number of decision support tools were formally evaluated, many were not rigorously studied. conclusions: many attributes were identified as potentially important to women choosing a method of contraception, but these were inconsistently included in the reviewed resources. formal evaluation of decision support tools for contraceptive choice and involvement of users in the development process may lead to more user-centered design and implementation.
diabetes	the american college of cardiology, society for cardiovascular angiography and interventions, society of thoracic surgeons, and american association for thoracic surgery, along with key specialty and subspecialty societies, have completed a 2-part revision of the appropriate use criteria (auc) for coronary revascularization. in prior coronary revascularization auc documents, indications for revascularization in acute coronary syndromes and stable ischemic heart disease (sihd) were combined into 1 document. to address the expanding clinical indications for coronary revascularization, and to align the subject matter with the most current american college of cardiology/american heart association guidelines, the new auc for coronary artery revascularization were separated into 2 documents addressing sihd and acute coronary syndromes individually. this document presents the auc for sihd. clinical scenarios were developed to mimic patient presentations encountered in everyday practice. these scenarios included information on symptom status; risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing; coronary disease burden; and, in some scenarios, fractional flow reserve testing, presence or absence of diabetes, and syntax score. this update provides a reassessment of clinical scenarios that the writing group felt were affected by significant changes in the medical literature or gaps from prior criteria. the methodology used in this update is similar to the initial document but employs the recent modifications in the methods for developing auc, most notably, alterations in the nomenclature for appropriate use categorization. a separate, independent rating panel scored the clinical scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9. scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization is considered appropriate for the clinical scenario presented. scores of 1 to 3 indicate that revascularization is considered rarely appropriate for the clinical scenario, whereas scores in the mid-range of 4 to 6 indicate that coronary revascularization may be appropriate for the clinical scenario. as seen with the prior coronary revascularization auc, revascularization in clinical scenarios with high symptom burden, high-risk features, and high coronary disease burden, as well as in patients receiving antianginal therapy, are deemed appropriate. additionally, scenarios assessing the appropriateness of revascularization before kidney transplantation or transcatheter valve therapy are now rated. the primary objective of the auc is to provide a framework for the assessment of practice patterns that will hopefully improve physician decision making.
emergency_contraception	objective: ulipristal acetate (upa) 30 mg is safe and effective for emergency contraception (ec). this prospective open-label exploratory study was conducted to obtain additional data on the pharmacodynamic effects of repeated dose of upa 30 mg during an 8-week period (effects on ovulation inhibition, hormonal levels, endometrium and cervical mucus). safety and tolerability data of repeated use of upa ec were also collected. study design: a total of 23 healthy female, healthy sterilized women participated in two substudies receiving upa for 8 consecutive weeks. in substudy 1, upa 30 mg was administered every 7 days (q7d n=12); while in substudy 2, every 5 days (q5d n=11). subjects were monitored three times a week in a baseline cycle and during treatment with transvaginal ultrasounds, hormonal measurements and cervical mucus evaluation. laboratory safety measurements and standard surrogate thrombosis risk markers were measured at baseline and within a few days of the last tablet. a luteal phase endometrial biopsy was taken in the baseline cycle and posttreatment. results: a total of 11/12 (91.7%) and 8/11(72.7%) of the subjects ovulated at least once in substudy q7d and q5d, respectively, with similar, normal hormonal profiles. no effect on cervical mucus was observed. all biopsies were classified as benign in both substudies; 5/11 biopsies on q5d posttreatment were classified as nonphysiological with some of typical progesterone receptor modulator-associated endometrial changes. upa was well tolerated in both treatment arms while clinical laboratory results and surrogate thrombosis markers were reassuring. conclusions: repeat use of 30 mg oral upa every 5 or 7 days for 8 weeks initially delays follicular rupture but ovulation eventually occurs with time in most subjects. safety data indicate that upa 30 mg could be safely administered if needed more than once for ec in a given menstrual cycle.

diabetes	we investigated the relationship among serum insulin level, insulin receptor (ir) expression in renal cell carcinoma (rcc), and outcomes in patients with rcc who underwent nephrectomy. we also explored the role of insulin signaling in rcc progression in a murine rcc allograft renca model using metformin to treat hyperinsulinemia induced by a high-carbohydrate diet. clinically, the ir expression level in rcc tissue was significantly lower in patients with tumor stage pt2-4 and/or distant metastases. the ir expression level in rcc tissue was significantly lower in patients with preoperative serum c-peptide levels greater than or equal to the median than in patients with levels less than the median. high ir expression level was significantly associated with better disease-free and overall survival after nephrectomy. the ir expression level was significantly higher in murine subcutaneous flank tumors of the low-carbohydrate diet group and high-carbohydrate diet plus metformin group than of the high-carbohydrate diet group. in vivo progression of murine tumors was not significantly enhanced by hyperinsulinemia induced by a high-carbohydrate diet and was significantly inhibited by metformin in both the low- and high-carbohydrate diet groups. ir expression in rcc tissue was inversely associated with cancer progression in the clinical and murine experimental model studies. the clinical and murine allograft model study results suggested that hyperinsulinemia does not promote rcc progression. decreased ir expression in high-stage rcc tumors with poor prognosis may be the result of downregulation induced by the host 's hyperinsulinemia.
cancer	tp53 gene mutations occurring in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) and acute myeloid leukemia (aml) are associated with high-risk karyotypes including 17p abnormalities, monosomal and complex cytogenetics. tp53 mutations in these disorders portend rapid disease progression and resistance to conventional therapeutics. notably, the size of the tp53 mutant clone as measured by mutation allele burden is directly linked to overall survival (os) confirming the importance of p53 as a negative prognostic variable. in nucleolar stress-induced ribosomopathies, such as del(5q) mds, disassociation of mdm2 and p53 results in p53 accumulation in erythroid precursors manifested as erythroid hypoplasia. p53 antagonism by lenalidomide or other therapeutics such as antisense oligonucleotides, repopulates erythroid precursors and enhances effective erythropoiesis. these findings demonstrate that p53 is an intriguing therapeutic target that is currently under investigation in mds and aml. this study reviews molecular advances in understanding the role of p53 in mds and aml, and explores potential therapeutic strategies in this era of personalized medicine.
weight_loss	aims: patient selection of weight management treatment option is often guided by a variety of factors. currently, there is no comprehensive tool to facilitate informed decision-making for patients and clinicians. this article aims to synthesise evidence on the treatment effectiveness, health benefits, risks, and patient experiences of treatment options presently available at the weight management clinic at the ottawa hospital (toh), as a first step towards developing a decision aid. methods: narrative and systematic reviews published in english between 1999 and 2014 were included that focused on one or more of the following weight management treatments in adults aged 18years and over: roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb), sleeve gastrectomy (sg), medically supervised meal replacement, and behavioural or lifestyle intervention. results: overall, bariatric surgeries have received the greatest research attention and have been associated not only with greater weight loss and health benefit but also with greater risks, complications, and financial cost. dietary programmes demonstrated weight loss and health benefits to a lesser extent than with surgery but were associated with lower and shorter-term risks and complications. behavioural and lifestyle interventions have been studied less yet have shown significant, albeit small, weight loss outcomes alone and in combination with dietary or surgical options; they also appear to be the lowest risk interventions. patient experiences of weight management options are mixed and not well understood. conclusion: further research is needed; however, this review identified some general trends related to weight loss outcomes, benefits, risks, and barriers for weight management options that have implications for shared treatment decision-making.
low_testosterone	with the aging of the population worldwide, osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures are becoming a serious health care issue in the western world. although less frequent than in women, osteoporosis in men is a relatively common problem. hip and vertebral fractures are particularly relevant, being associated with significant mortality and disability. since bone loss and fragility fractures in men have been recognized as serious medical conditions, several randomized controlled trials (rcts) have been undertaken in males with osteoporosis to investigate the anti-fracture efficacy of the pharmacological agents commonly used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. overall, treatments for osteoporosis in men are less defined than in women, mainly due to the fact that there are fewer rcts performed in male populations, to the relatively smaller sample sizes, and to the lack of long-term extension studies. however, the key question is whether men are expected to respond differently to osteoporosis therapies than women. the pharmacological properties of bisphosphonates, teriparatide, denosumab, and strontium ranelate make such differentiation unlikely, and available clinical data support their efficacy in men with primary osteoporosis as well as in women. in a series of well-designed rcts, alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, and teriparatide were demonstrated to reduce the risk of new vertebral fractures in men presenting with primary osteoporosis (including osteoporosis associated with low testosterone levels) and to improve the bone mineral density (bmd). in preliminary studies, ibandronate, denosumab, and strontium ranelate also showed their beneficial effects on surrogate outcomes (bmd and markers of bone turnover) in men with osteoporosis. although direct evidence about their non-vertebral anti-fracture efficacy are lacking, the effects of bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide, and strontium ranelate on surrogate outcomes (bmd and markers of bone turnover) were similar to those reported in pivotal rcts undertaken in postmenopausal women, in which vertebral and non-vertebral anti-fracture efficacy have been clearly demonstrated. in conclusion, sufficient data exist to support the use of these pharmacological agents in men with primary osteoporosis. further rcts are warranted to establish their long-term efficacy and safety.
birth_control	background & aims: use of exogenous hormones, in the form of oral contraceptives (ocs), has been linked consistently to risk of crohn 's disease (cd). nonetheless, it is not clear how ocs might contribute to the progression of cd. methods: we conducted a prospective study of female patients with cd (age, 16-51 y), identified from the inpatient and outpatient care components of the swedish national patient register from january 2002 through december 2013. information on current oc use was obtained from the prescribed drug register starting in july of 2005 and updated until december of 2013. primary outcomes were defined as first cd-related surgery and first steroid prescription. we used cox proportional hazard modeling with time-varying covariates to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (mv-adjusted hrs). results: we identified 482 incident cases of surgery among 4036 patients with cd, with a median follow-up period of 58 months. compared with nonusers, the mv-adjusted hrs for surgery were 1.14 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.80-1.63) for past users and 1.30 (95% ci, 0.89-1.92) for current users. the risk of surgery increased with longer duration of use (p-trend = .036) and higher prescribed daily dose (p-trend = .016). specifically, for women with more than 3 years of oc use, the mv-adjusted hr for surgery was 1.68 (95% ci, 1.06-2.67). the association was confined to the combination type of oc. we estimated that for every 83 patients with cd receiving the combination type of oral contraceptives for at least 1 year, 1 extra surgery is required. the rate of steroid prescriptions did not appear to increase with past or current use of ocs, compared with patients who have not taken ocs (all pcomparisons >.20). conclusions: in a nationwide analysis of patients in sweden, long-term use of ocs, particularly the combination type, was associated with an increased risk of surgery among women with established cd. clinicians carefully should evaluate and monitor contraceptive options among women with established cd.
skin_care	although rosacea 's impact on physical health is limited, it has profound effects on a person 's psychological well-being. therefore, treating rosacea can greatly affect a person 's quality of life. patient education regarding trigger avoidance and skin care techniques such as moisturizing and sun protection are important non-pharmacologic first steps in treating rosacea. pharmacologic interventions range from topical to systemic medications, with the ideal medication choice dependent on the symptoms and severity of each individual patient. despite this variety of therapeutic options, none of these therapies are completely curative, and therefore further research into the pathophysiology of rosacea is required in order to create more targeted and efficacious treatment options.
alzheimer's_disease	mutations in the trem2 gene confer risk for alzheimer 's disease and susceptibility for parkinson 's disease (pd). we evaluated the effect of trem2 deletion in a 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp)-induced pd mouse model, measuring neurodegeneration and microglia activation using a combined in vivo imaging and postmortem molecular approach. in wild-type mice, mptp administration induced a progressive decrease of [c-11] fecit uptake, culminating at day 7. neuronal loss was accompanied by an increase of trem2, il-1 beta, and translocator protein (tspo) transcript levels, [c-11]pk11195 binding and gfap staining (from day 2), and an early and transient increase of tnf-alpha, galectin-3, and iba-1 (from day 1). in trem2 null (trem2(-/-)) mice, mptp similarly affected neuron viability and microglial cells, as shown by the lower level of iba-1 staining in basal condition, and reduced increment of iba-1, tnf-alpha, and il-1 beta in response to mptp. likely to compensate for trem2 absence, trem2(-/-) mice showed an earlier increment of [c-11] pk11195 binding and a significant increase of il-4. taken together, our data demonstrate a central role of trem2 in the regulation of microglia response to acute neurotoxic insults and suggest a potential modulatory role of tspo in response to immune system deficit.

menopause	the menopause rating scale ( mrs) measures quality of life in menopausal women. it compounds of three dimensions that assess somatic, psychological and urogenital menopausal-related symptoms. however, the validity of the scales may vary according to population characteristics, and there are no validations to date of mrs in american indigenous population. to assess the validity of mrs in indigenous colombian women during menopause. a research was done a sample of 914 indigenous women, 507 postmenopausal women and 407 premenopausal. they were between 4049 years-old, with a mean age of 59.3 +/- 5.9years. mrs was applied to all enrolled women. cronbach 's alpha was applied for the original proposed dimensions, and the dimensions from the results of factor analysis and maximum likelihood methods. a promax rotation was applied to analysis. mrs showed a cronbach 's alpha: 0.86. the somatic dimension: 0.63, the psychological dimension: 0.75, and urogenital: 0.84. score was greater in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal, 14.4 (+/- sd, 6.4) versus 8.4 (+/- sd, 5.9) ( p<0.001). the factor analysis showed two dimensions. the first dimension included items 1,7,8,9,10,11; and accounted for 39.9% of variance. the second dimension included items 2,3,4,5,6; explaining 14.2% of variance. cronbach 's alpha was 0.86 for the first dimension and 0.81 for the second dimension. mrs showed high internal consistency and adequate nomological validity. the factor analysis resulted in two dimensions. these results evidence the need to better assess the validity of the instruments in different populations.
emergency_contraception	emergency contraception (ec) in serbia is available in two products: levonorgestel, which has nonprescription status, and ulipristal acetate, which is a prescription-only medicine. considering their dispensing statuses, gynecologists and pharmacists are health care professionals (hcps) with the widest impact on ec use. yet little is known about their beliefs and practices regarding these medicines. we surveyed 166 gynecologists (during october 2012-october 2013) and 452 community pharmacists (during january-april 2014). results showed significant differences between these two groups, suggesting that provision of ec to users may be inconsistent. gynecologists were more convinced than pharmacists that ec would reduce the abortion rate (86% versus 53%, p <.001). however, they were more concerned than pharmacists that easy access to ec would cause less regular contraceptive use (66% versus 29%, p <.001) and risky sexual behaviors, including initiating sexual activity at a younger age (37% versus 19%, p <.001) and having more sexual partners (33% versus 12%, p <.001). additionally, more pharmacists than gynecologists (12% versus 2%, p <.001) said they would not provide ec to anyone under any circumstance, even to victims of sexual assault. these results indicated a need for reevaluating and establishing official guidelines for dispensing practices.
parenting	this paper explores the relationship between education, parenting and family through the prism and particularities of family learning. family learning is an example of an educational initiative, primarily aimed at parents and linked to wider policy concerns, which can be explored through a mapping of its social geographies; family learning is played out across and productive of different sites, spaces and identities. based on qualitative research undertaken in west london, this paper draws on individual and group interviews with mothers participating in family learning classes and interviews with family learning providers. the key argument we extend is that focusing on the social geographies of family learning - of home, school, work, community and nation - allows us to see how educational initiatives extend the state 's reach in family life, producing particular normative versions of family and good' parenting operating at a range of interconnecting scales. education remains a cornerstone of family policy in the uk and detailed analyses of specific initiatives at the point of implementation - how they are practiced and received - is vital for better understanding their diverse and varied effects in contemporary society.
parkinson's_disease	long-term levodopa therapy in patients with parkinson 's disease (pd) is associated with motor complications including motor fluctuations (mf) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (lid). the time to appearance of mf and lid is apparently related to both the timing and the duration of levodopa therapy, but is highly variable. we performed a retrospective analysis of all levodopa-treated pd patients to explore the effect of time from pd onset to levodopa initiation on time to mf or lid. we used a cox multivariate regression model after stratifying patients into four quartiles, according to the time to levodopa initiation. data from 170 pd patients (117 males, age at onset: 65.1 +/- 11.6 years, time to levodopa treatment: 23.8 +/- 28.4 months) was included in the analysis. early levodopa administration was associated with a shorter time from diagnosis to both mf (p < 0.001) and lid (p = 0.001). the hazard ratio to develop mf and lid from the time of pd diagnosis was 2.48 (p < 0.001) and 2.71 (p = 0.002), respectively. in our population, we found that delaying levodopa administration was associated with a longer time to the appearance of motor complications after diagnosis. while disease duration is the most important determinant of the onset of motor complications, delaying levodopa could prolong the 'complication-free' period.
overactive_bladder	objectivesto investigate the effect of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways on nociception in the lower urinary tract (lut). methodsfemale sprague-dawley rats were used. following intraperitoneal administration of vehicle or milnacipran (30mg/kg), which is one of serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (snri), 0.1% aa was infused into the bladder in normal (n=4, each) and spinal cord injury (sci) (n=4, each) rats for 2h on consciousness, and c-fos, 5-ht and dh were stained using immunohistochemistry at the l6 spinal cord as spinal areas associated with lut. resultsin sci rats, 5-ht or dh-positive fibers were not observed at the l6 spinal cord, while there were many 5-ht and dh-positive fibers in normal rats. the total number of c-fos-positive cells was significantly increased in sci rats compared to normal rats (209.47.1 in normal, 336.4 +/- 28.9 in sci, p < 0.05), which indicated that interruption of supraspinal modulation enhances nocieptive transmission in the lut. regarding the effect of milnacipran administration, the number of c-fos-positive cells was significantly decreased at all region of the l6 spinal cord in normal rats (p < 0.05), while this reduction was not observed in sci rats. this result demonstrated that administration of snri attenuates nocieptive transmission in the lut, indicating that 5-ht and noradrenaline work as mediators of endogenous analgesic mechanisms through the supraspinal descending pain pathways. conclusionssupraspinal projections of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways to the lower lumbar spinal cord modulate nocieptive transmission in the lut. administration of snri attenuates nocieptive transmission in the lut, which could result from enhancement of modulating descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways.
allergies	objective: the relationship between urbanisation and the symptom prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema is not clear, and varying definitions of urban extent have been used. furthermore, a global analysis has not been undertaken. this study aimed to determine whether the symptom prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in centres involved in the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (isaac) were higher in urban than rural centres, using a definition of urban extent as land cover from satellite data. methods: a global map of urban extent from satellite images (mod500 map) was used to define the urban extent criterion. maps from the isaac centres were digitised and merged with the mod500 map to describe the urban percentage of each centre. we investigated the association between the symptom prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema and the percentage of urban extent by centre. results: a weak negative relationship was found between the percentage of urban extent of each isaac centre and current wheeze in the 13-14-year age group. this association was not statistically significant after adjusting for region of the world and gross national income. no other relationship was found between urban extent and symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema. conclusions: in this study, the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in children were not associated with urbanisation, according to the land cover definition of urban extent from satellite data. comparable standardised definitions of urbanisation need to be developed so that global comparisons can be made.
fungal_infection	frogeye leaf spot (fls), caused by the fungus cercospora sojina, is one of the most important soybean diseases and can cause great yield losses. several studies have demonstrated that silicon (si) enhances the plant antioxidant system, especially when they are subjected to stresses. thus, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of si on soybean resistance to fls, on the antioxidant system, on the concentration of reactive oxygen species and on cellular damage during the infection process of c.sojina. plants from cultivars bossier and conquista, susceptible and resistant to fls, respectively, were supplied with either 0 (-si) or 2mm (+si) and non-inoculated or inoculated with c.sojina. fls severity was greater for bossier than for conquista, regardless of the si supply, and it was increased by si for both cultivars. the activities of the most antioxidant enzymes were lower in the +si plants than in the -si plants when they were not inoculated. inoculated plants usually showed an increased enzyme activities and higher concentrations of ascorbate and reduced glutathione than did the non-inoculated plants, regardless of si supply. at advanced stages of fungal infection, the +si-inoculated plants from bossier had higher activity of most antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of superoxide and malondialdehyde compared to the non-inoculated plants as a result of an increased oxidative stress. the results from this study provide the first evidence that si reduces the basal activity of antioxidant enzymes in soybean leaves leading to an increase in host susceptibility to fls.
allergies	hippocrates is often credited with first recognizing that food could be responsible for adverse symptoms and even death in some individuals, but it was not until the seminal observations by prausnitz that the investigation of food allergy was viewed on a more scientific basis. in the first half of the 20th century, there were periodic reports in the medical literature describing various food allergic reactions. in the mid-to late- 1970' s, the studies of charles may and colleagues began to penetrate the medical world 's skepticism about the relevance of food allergy and how to diagnose it, since standard skin testing was known to correlate poorly with clinical symptoms. with may 's introduction of the double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge, the study of food allergy became evidence-based and exponential strides have been made over the past four decades in the study of basic immunopathogenic mechanisms and natural history, and the diagnosis and management of food allergies. today ige-and non-ige-mediated food allergic disorders are well characterized and efforts to treat these allergies by various immunotherapeutic strategies are well under way. copyright (c) 2016, japanese society of allergology. production and hosting by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license.
emergency_contraception	nearly a half million infants in the united states are born preterm or with low birth weight each year. providing women who have had a prior adverse birth outcome with access to family planning can help reduce the incidence of subsequent high-risk pregnancies and adverse outcomes. one effective option to prevent unintended pregnancy for women with a prior adverse birth outcome who either do not use contraception consistently or whose contraception fails is emergency contraception (ec). the purpose of our study was to understand willingness to use ec among african-american women who recently had an adverse birth outcome. the healthy births healthy communities (hbhc) interconceptional care project (iccp) targeted high-risk african-american women from two low-income chicago neighborhoods who recently had an adverse birth outcome. the aim of hbhc iccp was to improve participants' future birth outcomes by providing medical and social services and helping women to clarify their reproductive life goals. information about participants' pregnancy intentions and willingness to use ec was measured in an interview shortly after enrollment into the study. over 90 % of the 131 women in our study either did not want to become pregnant or did not know if they wanted to become pregnant within the next 2 years. these women had 4.4 times higher odds of reporting willingness to use ec as compared to women who reported a desire to become pregnant within the next 2 years (75.6 vs. 50.0 %, respectively; aor: 4.4; 95 % ci 1.1, 17.6). ec is an essential part of the reproductive toolkit for women at high risk of adverse birth outcomes who are not intending pregnancy, along with reproductive life planning and use of effective contraception.
allergies	rhododendron anthopogon d. don., a small compact himalayan shrub growing in nepal, is a known medicinal plant used to treat sore throat, colds, blood disorders, bone disease, potato allergies, and vomiting, and to relieve liver disorders, headaches and back pain. the present study investigated the chemical composition and bioactivities of the leaf essential oil from r. anthopogon from dhankuta, nepal. the essential oil from leaves was obtained by hydrodistillation and a detailed chemical analysis was conducted by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the enantiomeric distribution of monoterpenoid components was determined using chiral gas chromatography and represents the first chiral examination of r. anthopogon essential oil. the essential oil was screened for antimicrobial activity using the microbroth dilution test, and for cytotoxic activity against mcf-7, mda-mb-231, and 5637 using the mtt assay. a total of 70 volatile components were identified from the essential oil. the major components were alpha-pinene (21.5%), delta-cadinene (13.8%), beta-pinene (9.5%), limonene (5.9%), delta-amorphene (4.6%), alpha-muurolene (4.5%), and (e)-caryophyllene (3.2%) with other minor constituents (< 3%). the essential oil showed marginal antibacterial and cytotoxic activities, but no antifungal effects.
fungal_infection	arthrographis kalrae is occasionally described as an opportunistic human pathogen. this study investigated the immune response to a. kalrae during murine experimental infection (7, 14, 28 and 56 days post infection). the fungal load was higher in the early phase and mice presented with neurological syndrome over the course of the infection. there was a gradual increase in the level of anti-a. kalrae igg and increased levels of dth at 14 days. there was decreased ifn-gamma (14-56 days) and an increase in il-4 (7 and 56 days). decreased levels of cytokines (if-gamma, il-4, il-10 and il-17) were observed in the brain at 56 days p.i. the results suggest that the immune response during murine a. kalrae infection modulates to the pattern of th2 response. this study shows for the first time the cytokines and cellular immunomodulation that occur in response to an experimental infection with a. kalrae in mice.

heart_disease	this paper is part 2 of a study of blood flow across cardiovascular stenoses. in part 1, we developed a rigorous mathematical approach for deriving a pressure field from experimental data for a velocity field that can be obtained by direct measurement. in this part, existing methods for quantifying stenoses, with specific reference to cardiac valves, are reviewed. using the mathematically rigorous and physically reasonable approach that we developed in part 1, for a pre-specified flow velocity field proximal to the stenosis and pressure waveform field distal to the stenosis, we ascertain the intra-stenosis and distal flow velocity field, pressure field proximal to and within the stenosis, and energy dissipation, all as functions of position and time. the computed dissipation, kinetic energy and pressure are then presented in an idealized geometry, but relevant to a realistic geometry, with a symmetric stenosis.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	the relationship between the conscious experience of physical symptoms and indicators of objective physiological dysfunction is highly variable and depends on characteristics of the person, the context and their interaction. this relationship often breaks down entirely in the case of ""medically unexplained"" or functional somatic symptoms, violating the basic assumption in medicine that physical symptoms have physiological causes. in this paper, we describe the prevailing theoretical approach to this problem and review the evidence pertaining to it. we then use the framework of predictive coding to propose a new and more comprehensive model of the body-symptom relationship that integrates existing concepts within a unifying framework that addresses many of the shortcomings of current theory. we describe the conditions under which a close correspondence between the experience of symptoms and objective physiology might be expected, and when they are likely to diverge. we conclude by exploring some theoretical and clinical implications of this new account.

multiple_sclerosis	background: multiple sclerosis (ms) as an autoimmune disorder is a common disease occurring in central nervous system (cns) and the remyelination plays a pivotal role in the alleviating neurological impairment in the ms. catalpol, an effective component extracted from the chinese herb radix rehmanniae, which has been proved protective in cerebral diseases. methods: to determine the protective effects and mechanisms of catalpol on ms, the mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) were induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog)(35-55), as a model for human ms. th17 cells were counted by flow cytometric (fcm). the expressions of nerve-glial antigen (ng) 2 and myelin basic protein (mbp) were measured by immunohistochemical staining. olig1+ and olig2+/brdu+ cells were counted by immunofluorescence. olig1 and olig2 gene expressions were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription (qrt) - pcr. results: the results showed that catalpol improved neurological function, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination. it could decrease th17 cells in the peripheral blood. it increased the protein expressions of ng2 and mbp in mice brains, up-regulated markedly protein and gene expressions of olig1 and olig2 in terms of timing, site and targets. conclusions: these data demonstrated that catalpol had a strong neuroprotective effect on eae mice. catalpol also plays a role in remyelination by promoting the expressions of olig1 and olig2 transcription factors.
headache	objectiveto describe the diagnostic types and characteristics of headaches in soldiers with mild traumatic brain injury during the wars in afghanistan and iraq. backgroundpersistent post-traumatic headache interferes with returns to activity or duty. the most commonly cited headache diagnosis after concussion is migraine. we hypothesize that headache diagnosis type, eg, migraine, is not sufficient to predict relationships with occupational outcomes after concussion. methodsthe study sample consisted of all new patients referred for headache evaluation at the brain injury center at womack army medical center over a 1-year time period. the design was retrospective and observational. clinical data reported included demographics, causes of injury, headache characteristics, and headache diagnosis type. after reviewing records for retention or severance from military service, the primary occupational outcome measure was departure from service due to medical cause as determined by a medical evaluation board (meb). the primary outcome measure was to test the strength of association between leaving service for meb and headache characteristics or diagnosis. resultsa total of 95 patients (94% male) with concussion described 166 distinct headache types, the most common being migraine (60%) and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (24%). a total of 25% of all patients remained on active duty. a continuous headache of any type was present in 75% of patients and of these, 23% remained on active duty. of the 51% of patients who had both a continuous and non-continuous headache, 17% remained on active duty (p<.001). therefore, we report that a continuous headache, regardless of diagnosis type was associated with negative occupational outcomes. regardless of headache duration, headache diagnosis type alone was not associated with soldiers' separations from service. conclusionspersistent post-traumatic headache is most likely to present with continuous pain. migraine is the most common primary diagnosis type. the presence of a continuous headache was strongly associated with negative occupational outcomes. primary headache diagnosis type was not. headache characteristics, therefore, may be more important than diagnosis type when determining active duty status. further prospective research is indicated.
low_testosterone	a significant proportion of patients with type2 diabetes mellitus have a low testosterone level relative to reference ranges based on healthy young men. only a small number of these patients suffer from classical hypogonadism as a result of recognizable hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology. the cut-off value of the serum testosterone level in men without obvious hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology is controversial. it is unclear to what extent a low serum testosterone level causally leads to type2 diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome. from a theoretical standpoint, there can be complex interactions among the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, body composition and insulin resistance, which can be further influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors to give rise to metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, and low-grade inflammation to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. although a low serum testosterone level frequently coexists with cardiometabolic risk factors and might serve as a biomarker, more studies are required to clarify the causal, mediating or modifying roles of low serum testosterone level in the development of adverse clinical outcomes. currently, there are insufficient randomized clinical trial data to evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on meaningful clinical outcomes. the risk-to-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy in high-risk subjects, such as those with type2 diabetes, also requires elucidation. the present article aims to review the current evidence on low serum testosterone levels in patients with type2 diabetes, and its implications on cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and adverse clinical outcomes.
alzheimer's_disease	we performed oxygen plasma treatment on reduced graphene oxide (rgo) to improve its surface reactivity with respect to biomolecular interactions. oxygen-plasma-treated rgo surfaces were employed as reactive interfaces for the detection of amyloid-beta (a beta) peptides, the pathological hallmarks of alzheimer 's disease (ad), as the target analytes. by measuring the changes in electrical characteristics and confirmation through topographic analysis, the oxygen-plasma-treated rgo sensors had enhanced surface functionality for better antibody immobilization and sensing performance, with a 3.33-fold steeper slope for the electrical responses versus analyte concentration curve (logarithmic scale) compared to the untreated. the elicited biomolecular reactivity of the rgo surfaces with the oxygen plasma treatment remained at 46-51% of the initial value even after aging for 6 h in ambient conditions. this phenomenon was also confirmed by pretreating the rgo surfaces with a blocking agent and subsequently subjecting them to antibody immobilization. finally, the feasibility of the oxygen-plasma-treated rgo sensors as a diagnostic tool was evaluated with clinical samples of neural-derived exosomal a beta peptides extracted from apparent ad patients and normal controls (nc). in contrast to the untreated sensors (p=0.0460), the oxygen-plasma-treated rgo sensors showed a significant p-value in the identification of clinical samples of ad and nc subjects (p < 0.001). these results suggest that oxygen plasma treatment improves sensor performance without complicated fabrication procedures and should aid in the development of novel diagnostic tools based on carbon nanomaterials.
weight_loss	a series of cerium-zirconium mixed oxides doped with alkaline earth metals was prepared by calcining a mixture of ce0.8zr0.2o2 and the nitrate salt of alkaline earth metals at 1173 k. the results from x-ray diffraction, raman spectroscopy and analytical electron microscopy indicated the alkaline earth compounds were dispersed on the surface of ce0.8zr0.2o2 . the doped mixed oxides were evaluated in the catalytic reaction of solid coke under tight contact conditions with 10 vol.% o-2 in he at 693 k and with 100 vol.% h2o at 993 k using thermogravimetric analysis. for coke oxidation with o-2, the weight loss was first order in coke, and the measured first order rate constant was proportional to the total surface area of catalyst at low catalyst loadings. for coke gasification with h2o, the weight loss was nearly zero order in coke, and the measured areal reaction rate was independent of the total surface area of catalyst at low catalyst loadings. the addition of alkaline earth metals inhibited coke oxidation with dioxygen but promoted coke gasification with steam.

overactive_bladder	enuresis was historically viewed as a primarily psychiatric disorder, but this understanding has changed dramatically since the end of the last century, when it became clear that somatic factors, such as nocturnal polyuria as a result of vasopressin deficiency, nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds, all play a crucial role in enuresis pathogenesis. it has also become clear that enuresis is inherited in the majority of cases, although the correlation between genotype and enuretic phenotype is not straightforward. the standard view of enuresis as being the result of either (i) nocturnal polyuria and high arousal thresholds; or (ii) nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds has become well-established, but further research now complicates the picture. first, psychological/psychiatric problems are overrepresented in enuresis, and might in a minority of cases have a causal or aggravating role. second, nocturnal polyuria is not always linked to vasopressin deficiency. third, nocturnal detrusor overactivity is in itself pathogenetically heterogeneous, and could be linked to constipation. fourth, the sleep of enuretic children might be deep, but possibly also disturbed (by obstructed airways or a distended or contracting bladder). these children might have high arousal thresholds because of the enuresis instead of the other way around. the same might possibly be said about nocturnal polyuria. taking these new insights into account, a new model of enuresis pathogenesis is presented, which is more complicated but hopefully also more true than the standard consensus.
alzheimer's_disease	subjects with mild cognitive impairment (mci) have an increased risk of developing alzheimer 's disease (ad), and their functional brain networks are presumably already altered. to test this hypothesis, we compared magnetoencephalography (meg) eyes-closed resting-state recordings from 29 mci subjects and 29 healthy elderly subjects in the present exploratory study. functional connectivity in different frequency bands was assessed with the phase lag index (pli) in source space. normalized weighted clustering coefficient (normalized cw) and path length (normalized lw), as well as network measures derived from the minimum spanning tree [mst; i.e., betweenness centrality (bc) and node degree], were calculated. first, we found altered pli values in the lower and upper alpha bands in mci patients compared to controls. thereafter, we explored network differences in these frequency bands. normalized cw and lw did not differ between the groups, whereas bc and node degree of the mst differed, although these differences did not survive correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (fdr). as an exploratory study, we may conclude that: (1) the increases and decreases observed in pli values in lower and upper alpha bands in mci patients may be interpreted as a dual pattern of disconnection and aberrant functioning; (2) network measures are in line with connectivity findings, indicating a lower efficiency of the brain networks in mci patients; (3) the mst centrality measures are more sensitive to detect subtle differences in the functional brain networks in mci than traditional graph theoretical metrics.
skin_care	the aim of this study was to determine the difficulties regarding the home care of children following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). the sample of the study includes the families of 73 children in a bone marrow transplant unit between 2010 and 2013, turkey. data were collected using a form included descriptive information and questions about the difficulties and complications of home care. families were telephoned and problems they had encountered were recorded. mann-whitney u-test and the logistic regression analysis were used. the average age of the children was 10.65 +/- 5.03 years, the average age was 8.89 +/- 4.9 when hsct was performed, and the average year after hsct was 1.79 +/- 0.74. 41.1% of the children underwent transplantation with diagnoses of anaemia. primary physical problems that were found after discharge from the hospital were fever (43.8%), decreased appetite (37%), rash (34.2%) and pain (26%). socially, 43.8% of families reported that their children had difficulties with school. primary difficulties regarding care and follow-up were reported as skin care (34.2%) and catheter care (33.3%). in the post-transplantation period, it is important to provide information about potential problems and care to patients and families in order to increase the quality of life.
parkinson's_disease	across all kingdoms in the tree of life, calcium (ca2+) is an essential element used by cells to respond and adapt to constantly changing environments. in multicellular organisms, it plays fundamental roles during fertilization, development and adulthood. the inability of cells to regulate ca2+ can lead to pathological conditions that ultimately culminate in cell death. one such pathological condition is manifested in parkinson 's disease, the second most common neurological disorder in humans, which is characterized by the aggregation of the protein, alpha-synuclein. this review discusses current evidence that implicates ca2+ in the pathogenesis of parkinson 's disease. understanding the mechanisms by which ca2+ signaling contributes to the progression of this disease will be crucial for the development of effective therapies to combat this devastating neurological condition.
headache	respite workers (rw) commonly care for children with intellectual disabilities (id), and pain is common for these children. little is known about factors which inform rw pain assessment and management-related decisions. objectives: to describe/determine the following in response to a series of pain-related scenarios (e.g., headache, falling): (1) factors considered important by rw when assessing children with id 's pain; (2) whether children 's verbal ability impacts pain assessment factors considered; (3) rw assessment and management approach. participants: fifty-six rw (18-67 years, m-age =33.37, 46 female). procedure/measures: in an online survey, participants read and responded to six vignettes manipulating child verbal ability (verbal, nonverbal) and pain source. results: the factors most frequently considered when assessing pain were child behavior (range: 20-57.4%), and history (e.g., pain, general; 3.7-38.9%). factors did not vary by child 's verbal ability. rw indicated varied assessment and management-related actions (range: 1-11) for each scenario. discussion: findings suggest: a) factors informing pain assessment did not depend on whether or not the child was verbal and b) a degree of flexibility in rw response to pain across situations. while these findings are encouraging, ensuring rw have adequate pain assessment and management knowledge specific to children with id is critical.

diabetes	homeless patients have high rates of visual impairment and lower rates of glycemic control than housed patients. although diabetic retinopathy (dr) is the most common cause of new visual impairment and legal blindness in the developed world, little is known about differential risk factors for and rates of dr in homeless versus housed populations. this study aimed to compare the rates of dr between homeless and housed patients with diabetes at the greater los angeles veterans affairs health care system (gla) and identify clinical and psychosocial predictors of dr rates. we performed secondary database analyses of veterans with diabetes who received care at gla between october 1, 2013 and september 30, 2015. we described differences in demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics associated with dr in homeless versus housed patients, and created a logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of dr. we found that diabetic veterans who were homeless, as compared with those who were housed, had higher rates of substance use disorders and mental health diagnoses, more primary care and mental health visits, and were more likely to have had diabetic retinopathy eye screening according to guidelines. multiple logistic regression modeling predicting having dr, revealed that having dr was independently associated with not being homeless (i.e., being housed), older age, having had retinal screening, anemia, higher systolic blood pressure, insulin use, microalbuminuria, and higher hba1c. homeless diabetic veterans' lower rates of dr may be due to the gla va 's tailored and intensive psychological and medical resources for homeless veteran patients.
emergency_contraception	background: emergency contraception refers to contraceptive methods that can be used after a sexual intercourse aim: to analyze the evolution of emergency contraception (ec) consultations on the chilean public health system, at a communal level, in relation to the legal changes that recently took place, aimed to ease the delivery of the benefit. to analyze its association with socioeconomic, demographic and municipal healthcare system characteristics. material and methods: we analyzed data bases of the ministry of health to study ec consultation rates on chilean communes, including consultations on emergency departments and by rape, from 2008 to 2013. we evaluated the association with communal characteristics, obtained from the national municipal information system. results: both the communal consultation rates and percentage of communes with consultations increased progressively during the period, with an explosive increase between 2009 and 2010. we observed a high dispersion in ec consultations both at a communal and regional level. there was an inverse significant association of the number of consultations with the communal poverty rate. conclusions: our results reveal the impact of legal modifications implemented in chile since 2009 on the communal ec consultation rates. on other hand, our results reveal that although these modifications were oriented to favor the delivery of this benefit, a high dispersion subsists, associated with population 's socioeconomic factors, mainly, the communal poverty level.
birth_control	increasing human-animal proximity has also increased risks of zoonotic disease transmission. this study measured the prevalence of anti-toxoplasma gondii, anti-leishmania spp. and anti-leptospira spp. igg antibodies in dogs and cats attended by the birth control project (bcp) from 2004 to 2012 to determine which environmental variables were significantly associated with infectious agents in the study population. blood samples from 271 dogs and 415 cats were collected by jugular or cephalic venipuncture for serological analysis. indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to detect anti-t. gondii and anti-leishmania spp. igg antibodies and microscopic serum-agglutination tests were used to detect anti-leptospira spp. antibodies. data tabulation and statistical analyses were performed using epiinfo (3.4.3). among canine sera samples, 20.6% (56/271), 1.3% (3/236), and 21.6% (51/236) were positive for t. gondii, leishmania spp., and leptospira spp., respectively. higher t. gondii prevalence was found in dogs of unknown breeding history (p=0.0009), those fed raw or undercooked meat (p=0.0101), and those that did not receive the polyvalent vaccine (p=0.0147). there was no statistically significant association between leishmaniosis and leptospirosis and variables evaluated in the epidemiological questionnaire. among feline sera samples, 20.9% (87/415) were positive for t. gondii. the highest prevalence rates were observed in felines that hunted rodents (p=0.0388) and that consumed untreated water (p=0.0294). these results confirmed that ingestion of raw or undercooked meat, drinking untreated water, and predation of rodents were important risk factors for t. gondii infection. a low leishmania spp. serodiagnostic prevalence was observed. the most frequent leptospira spp. serovars were copenhageni, canicola, and butembo.
myelofibrosis	a high number of circulating cd34+ cells has been advocated to distinguish primary myelofibrosis from other philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. we reevaluated the diagnostic interest of measuring circulating cd34+ cells in 26 healthy volunteers and 256 consecutive patients at diagnosis for whom a myeloproliferative neoplasm was suspected. the roc curve analysis showed that a number of cd34+ < 10/mu l excludes the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 90%(area under the curve: 0.93 [0.89-0.98]; p < 0.001). patients with pmf harboring a calr mutation had more circulating cd34+ cells than patients with either a jak 2 or mpl mutation (p = 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively). these results suggest that this fast, simple, non-invasive, and standardized test is of particular interest to exclude the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis.
sports_injuries	objective:to compare head and trunk acceleration during transport on 2 medical utility vehicles.design:within subject.setting:controlled laboratory.participants:nineteen male volunteers (21.8 1.4 years, 176.5 5.5 cm, 90.3 16.1 kg).interventions:participants were secured to a spineboard and stretcher on the husqvarna huv 4421dxl ambulance (huv) and modified john deere gator th (gator) and driven over synthetic field turf transitioning to concrete slab (interval 1) and concrete slab transitioning to natural grass (interval 2). three-dimensional (x, y, and z) accelerometers recorded head and trunk acceleration. at each data point, acceleration of the trunk was subtracted from the acceleration of the head and the peak acceleration difference was determined. independent variables were vehicle (huv, gator) and interval (interval 1, interval 2).main outcome measures:the average peak acceleration differences in 3 directions (x, y, z) were analyzed using a 2-factor within analysis of variance (p 0.05).results:for x, gator in interval 2 (28.34 +/- 7.45 m/s/s) was greater than huv in interval 2 (21.87 +/- 6.28 m/s/s), and huv (11.05 +/- 3.29 m/s/s) and gator (12.56 +/- 4.32 m/s/s) in interval 1. the huv in interval 2 was greater than huv and gator in interval 1. for z, gator in interval 2 (22.12 +/- 4.8 m/s/s) was greater than huv in interval 2 (15.21 +/- 2.84 m/s/s), and huv (9.51 +/- 3.01 m/s/s) and gator (12.5 +/- 3.78 m/s/s) in interval 1. the huv in interval 2 was greater than huv and gator in interval 1. gator in interval 1 was greater than huv in interval 1.conclusions:varying head and trunk accelerations exist in healthy spine-boarded participants during transport on medical utility vehicles dependent on surface and vehicle type.
senior_health	objective to evaluate the effect of introduction of treatment and sterilization guidelines on the number of avoidable injections and on the sterility of needles and syringes. methods in 1991, 66 randomly selected health units in mwanza region, tanzania, were visited and factors were determined that might contribute to hiv transmission by injections. in a workshop with all senior health workers from the region, findings were presented and treatment and sterilization guidelines developed. thereafter, seminars were held at each health centre of the region. four months after the intervention, data were collected at the same health facilities in order to assess changes in prescribing practices, sterilization procedures, and sterility of needles and syringes. results the knowledge on indications for injections improved markedly for paramedical staff. the proportion of outpatients receiving an injection dropped from 23% to 10% and the proportion of patients receiving an avoidable injection dropped from 16% to 6%. procedures for sterilization, keeping sterilized equipment, and administration of injections improved. a smaller proportion of sterilized needles and syringes tended to be contaminated in dispensaries, but this reduction from 44% to 22% was not significant. conclusion considerable improvement in knowledge, prescription practices and sterility procedures was observed at dispensary level after carrying out a training programme.
weight_loss	the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of the essential oil of zanthoxylum bungeanum pericarp (zbeo) on dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced experimental colitis in mice. zbeo decreased dss-induced body weight loss, the disease activity index, colon length shortening, colonic pathological damage, and myeloperoxidase activities. the production of pro-inflammatory mediators was significantly alleviated by zbeo. further mechanistic analysis showed that zbeo inhibited inflammation by regulating nf-kappa b and ppar gamma pathways. zbeo also inhibited nlrp3 activation in colitis in mice. furthermore, zbeo contributed to the maintenance of tight junction architecture by regulating the expression of zonula occludens-1 during colitis. surprisingly, treatment with zbeo increased levels of the commensal bacteria containing lactobacillus and bifidobacteria but reduced escherichia coli levels in the feces of mice. these results suggested that supplementation with zbeo might provide a new dietary strategy for the prevention of ulcerative colitis.
menopause	aims: to evaluate the sampling adequacy and diagnostic accuracy of the endometrial sap-1 sampling device in detecting endometrial lesions based on histopathological examination. materials and methods: in total, 182 patients who required an endometrial biopsy were enrolled in this study. all of the patients underwent endometrial biopsies with the sap-1 sampler prior to hysteroscopy (169/182) or dilatation and curettage (d&c) (13/182). endometrial tissues were obtained at biopsy for histopathological examination. results: adequate endometrial specimens were obtained in 148 of 182 patients (81.32%). menopause (p = 0.000), endometrial thickness (p = 0.004), and the types of endometrial diseases (p = 0.009) differed significantly between the two groups. among the 169 patients who underwent hysteroscopy, sampling scratches were observed in the uterine cavity in 147 cases (86.98%). compared to traditional methods, such as hysteroscopy and d&c, the sampling diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 82.35%, 100%, 100%, and 97.76% for endometrial carcinoma (n=17) and 37.5%, 100%, 100% and 97.76% for endometrial atypical hyperplasia (n=8), respectively. those that were misdiagnosed occurred because the lesions were focal or localized in a small part of the uterine cavity. the sampling diagnostic sensitivity for polyps (n=32) was 12.5%. two patients with submucosal leiomyoma went undiagnosed based on the sample specimens. conclusion: endometrial sampling using the sap-1 sampler is a minimally invasive alternative technique for obtaining adequate endometrial specimens for histopathological examination. the sap-1 sampler was useful in detecting endometrial carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia cases that were not highly suspected to be localized; however, this method was not useful in detecting endometrial polyps and submucosal leiomyomas.
allergies	this review updates the relationship between the adherence to mediterranean diet (meddiet) assessed by questionnaire and asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic eczema in childhood. it deals with the effect of meddiet in children on asthma/wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis/eczema, and also with the effect of meddiet consumption by the mother during pregnancy on the inception of asthma/wheeze and allergic diseases in the offspring. adherence to meddiet by children themselves seems to have a protective effect on asthma/wheezing symptoms after adjustment for confounders, although the effect is doubtful on lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. by contrast, the vast majority of the studies showed no significant effect of meddiet on preventing atopic eczema, rhinitis, or atopy. finally, studies on adherence to meddiet by the mother during pregnancy showed some protective effect on asthma/wheeze symptoms in the offspring only during the first year of life, but not afterward. very few studies have shown a protective effect on wheezing, current sneeze, and atopy, and none on eczema. randomized control trials on the effect of the adherence to meddiet to prevent (by maternal consumption during pregnancy) or improve (by child consumption) the clinical control of asthma/wheezing, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis are needed.
emergency_contraception	objectives: to assess knowledge and provision of emergency contraception (ec), particularly the most effective methods. study design: a web-based survey was distributed to a cross-sectional convenience sample of healthcare providers across specialties treating reproductive-aged women. the survey was sent to 3260 practicing physicians and advanced practice clinicians in 14 academic centers between february 2013 and april 2014. we analyzed responses by provider specialty using multivariable logistic regression. results: the fmal sample included 1684 providers (response rate=51.7%). ninety-five percent of the respondents had heard of levonorgestrel (lng) ec. among reproductive health specialists, 81% provide lng ec in their practice, although only half (52%) had heard of ulipristal acetate (upa) and very few provide it (14%). the majority in family medicine (69%) and emergency medicine (74%) provide lng, in contrast to 42% of internists and 55% of pediatricians. however, the more effective methods [upa and copper intrauterine device (iud)] were little known and rarely provided outside of reproductive health specialties; 18% of internists and 14% of emergency medicine providers had heard of upa and 4% provide it. only 22% of emergency providers and 32% of pediatricians had heard of the copper iud used as ec. among reproductive health specialists, only 36% provide copper iud as ec in their practice. specialty, provider type and proportion of women of reproductive age in the practice were related to knowledge and provision of some forms of ec. conclusions: awareness and provision of the most effective ec methods, upa and the copper iud (which are provider dependent), are substantially lower than for lng ec, especially among providers who do not focus on reproductive health. implications: in our sample of 1684 healthcare providers from diverse specialties who treat reproductive-aged women, knowledge and provision of the most effective forms of ec (upa and the copper iud) are far lower than for lng ec. women should be offered the full range of ec methods.

allergies	indoor visible mold growths are known to be associated with allergies and respiratory illnesses. however, a question remains of their compositions and diversities. using swab sampling and high-throughput dna sequencing, this study analyzed taxonomic compositions and diversities of fungi on indoor surfaces laden with visible mold growths in residential apartments in south korea. the sequencing results showed low species diversities with shannon indices ranging from 0.14 to 2.29 (mean = 1.11). several allergy-related genera were detected on the same surface, where the most abundant cladosporium with a mean relative abundance of 41% co-occurred with less abundant aspergillus (0.094%), rhodotorula (6.3%), cryptococcus (3.7%), alternaria (4.1%), and crivellia (17%). b diversity analyses showed significant differences in the fungal communities between enclosed balconies and other indoor areas (p < 0.05, anosim), emphasizing a need to sample at multiple indoor locations when assessments are made for indoor visible mold growths. high-throughput sequencing is powerful in characterizing compositions and diversities of fungal communities. future studies should examine the relationships between taxonomic compositions and diversities of indoor visible molds and health outcomes of allergies and respiratory illnesses in residential buildings.
sports_injuries	objectives: to explore the performance of retrospective health data collected from athletes before athletics championships for the analysis of risk factors for in-competition injury and illness (i&i). methods: for the 2013 european athletics indoor championships, a self-report questionnaire (phq) was developed to record the health status of 127 athletes during the 4 weeks prior to the championship. physician-based surveillance of in-competition i&i among all 577 athletes registered to compete was pursued during the championships. results: 74 athletes (58.3%) from the sample submitted a complete phq, 21 (28%) of these athletes sustained at least one injury and/or illness during the championships. training more than 12 h/week predisposed for sustaining an in-competition injury, and a recent health problem for in-competition illness. among the 577 registered athletes, 60 injuries (104/1000 registered athletes) were reported. 31% of injuries were caused by the track, and 29% by overuse. 29 illnesses were reported (50/1000 registered athletes); upper respiratory tract infection and gastro-enteritis/diarrhoea were the most reported diagnoses. conclusions: pre-participation screening using athletes' self-report phq showed promising results with regard to identification of individuals at risk. indoor injury types could be attributed to extrinsic factors, such as small track size, track inclination, and race tactics.

overactive_bladder	objectives: although much has been published about the demographic and clinical characteristics of elderly patients with overactive bladder (oab) who were enrolled in clinical trials, very little is known about the general population of elderly americans with oab. we update this gap in the literature by using real-world data to describe this population. methods: we used medicare claims and the medicare current beneficiary surveys from 2006 to 2011 to identify patients with oab. we describe the demographic characteristics, functional impairment and physical limitations, concurrent medical conditions, charlson comorbidity index (cci) scores, and concomitant medication use of patients with oab; these characteristics are also described by sex and age group (65-74 vs. >= 75 years). we also compare the characteristics of oab with non-oab patients. results: we identified 415 elderly patients with oab (average age 79 years; 71% female) and 6868 without oab (average age 77 years; 62% female). patients with oab reported high levels of functional impairment as measured by the activities of daily living (44% vs. 33% for non-oab patients), instrumental adl (53% vs. 40% for non-oab patients), and physical functioning limitation (90% vs. 81% for non-oab patients) scales. elderly patients with oab also experienced high levels of comorbidity burden, as measured by the number of medical conditions (18 vs. 11 for non-oab patients), cci (2.1 vs. 1.4 for non-oab patients), and number of non-oab-related concomitant medications used (11 vs. 8 for non-oab patients). conclusions: elderly patients with oab in the general population have high levels of functional impairment and physical limitations, comorbidity, and concomitant medication use. these characteristics should be taken into consideration when managing oab symptoms and designing future clinical studies. these results, which are representative of elderly patients with oab in the general us population, should, however, be interpreted in light of the key limitations of the data we used: patients may have been misclassified and medical conditions overestimated due to artifacts of diagnosis coding and our results can only be generalized to patients who were enrolled in medicare parts a, b, and d for at least 12 continuous months.
diabetes	there is conflicting evidence regarding long-term effects of unilateral nephrectomy such as cardiovascular diseases. excessive increase in blood pressure (bp) during exercise called ""hypertensive response to exercise"" may be a sign of unborn hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. decrease in glomerular filtration rate (gfr) in patients with unilateral nephrectomy may be associated with disturbance of circadian bp changes without affecting the absolute levels of bp. we aimed to investigate the circadian bp changes and hypertensive response to exercise in normotensive patients with preserved renal functions who had undergone unilateral nephrectomy for other causes rather than organ donation. this study enrolled 32 patients (mean age 43.4 +/- 9.9 years, male 15) with unilateral nephrectomy and 40 healthy controls (mean age 47 +/- 6.1 years, male 17). all patients were undergone both office and ambulatory bp measurements and treadmill stress test. the median time since nephrectomy was 12 (9-22) years in the patient group. the median gfr of the patient group was lower than that of the controls without significance [85.1 (76.0-97.9) vs. 93.2 (84.5-104.9), respectively; p = 0.14]. there was no significant difference between groups in terms of office bp measurements, night time diastolic and systolic bp, mean arterial pressure (map), night/day time ratio of map in ambulatory bp measurements. the results of treadmill stress tests and hypertensive response to exercise ratios were also similar between the groups. this study revealed that there was no increase in long-term cardiovascular risks one decade after unilateral nephrectomy based on circadian bp changes and hypertensive response to exercise in normotensive patients.
birth_control	background: the kingdom of swaziland, following the introduction of the national family planning programme in 1973, has witnessed insufficient scientific publications on the contraceptive practices in the country despite documented high fertility rates and low contraceptive prevalence rates. this study was conducted to understand the practices and potential determinants of contraception among swazi women who requested emergency contraception. methods: the data were collected over a period of one month and analysed using simple descriptive analysis to summarise the data and bivariate analysis to determine relevant factors associated with the use of contraception. results: the majority of participants (79%) use contraceptives. reasons given for not using contraception previously ranged from medical conditions to not being sexually active. widely used contraceptives are male condoms, injectable hormones and combined oral contraceptives while the least popular are implants, and post-coital pills. knowledge of contraceptives came mainly from the health facilities, peers and mass media while parents are the least consulted sources. a high percentage (97%) are aware of sexually transmitted diseases (stds) and that male and female condoms are the best forms of protection against stds. demographic and socio-economic variables are not significantly related to the use of contraceptives. conclusion: the study established that the majority of the participants used some form of contraception and they also delayed their sexual debut up to the age of 18-20 years. the observed changes of increased contraceptive use and later age of sexual debut could be associated with increased levels of education of the participants and the predominant relaxed approach by protestants and zionists who are usually tolerant of contraception. the recommendations, based on the findings of this study, would assist with the planning and implementation of future family planning programmes for which this study serves as a foundation.
alzheimer's_disease	dysregulated proteostasis is a key feature of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. in alzheimer 's disease (ad), progression of symptoms closely correlates with spatiotemporal progression of tau aggregation, with ""early"" oligomeric tau forms rather than mature neurofibrillary tangles (nfts) considered to be pathogenetic culprits. the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ups) controls degradation of soluble normal and abnormally folded cytosolic proteins. the ups is affected in ad and is identified by genomewide association study (gwas) as a risk pathway for ad. the ups is determined by balanced regulation of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. in this work, we performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (itraq)-based tau interactome mapping to gain unbiased insight into tau pathophysiology and to identify novel tau-directed therapeutic targets. focusing on tau deubiquitination, we here identify otub1 as a tau-deubiquitinating enzyme. otub1 directly affected lys48-linked tau deubiquitination, impairing tau degradation, dependent on its catalytically active cysteine, but independent of its noncanonical pathway modulated by its n-terminal domain in primary neurons. otub1 strongly increased at8-positive tau and oligomeric tau forms and increased tau-seeded tau aggregation in primary neurons. finally, we demonstrated that expression of otub1 but not its catalytically inactive form induced pathological tau forms after 2 months in tau transgenic mice in vivo, including at8-positive tau and oligomeric tau forms. taken together, we here identified otub1 as a tau deubiquitinase in vitro and in vivo, involved in formation of pathological tau forms, including small soluble oligomeric forms. otub1 and particularly otub1 inhibitors, currently under development for cancer therapies, may therefore yield interesting novel therapeutic avenues for tauopathies and ad.
allergies	currently, mankind is afflicted with diversified health issues, allergies being a common, yet little understood malady. allergies, the outcome of a baffled immune system encompasses myriad allergens and causes an array of health consequences, ranging from transient to recurrent and mild to fatal. indoor allergy is a serious hypersensitivity in genetically predisposed people, triggered by ingestion, inhalation or mere contact of allergens, of which mite and cockroaches are one of the most-represented constituents. arduous to eliminate, these aeroallergens pose constant health challenges, mostly manifested as respiratory and dermatological inflammations, leading to further aggravations if unrestrained. recent times have seen an unprecedented endeavour to understand the conformation of these allergens, their immune manipulative ploys and other underlying causes of pathogenesis, most importantly therapies. yet a large section of vulnerable people is ignorant of these innocuous-looking immune irritants, prevailing around them, and continues to suffer. this review aims to expedite this field by a concise, informative account of seminal findings in the past few years, with particular emphasis on leading frontiers like genome-wide association studies (gwas), epitope mapping, metabolomics etc. drawbacks linked to current approaches and solutions to overcome them have been proposed.

allergies	background: longitudinal, patient-centered care represents a challenge for general practitioners (gps), and in this context, reminder systems can offer targeted support. this study aimed to identify details of such reminders: (1) contents of care addressed, (2) their mode of display in the electronic health record (ehr), (3) their visual appearance, (4) personnel responsibilities for editing and applying reminders, and (5) use of reminders for patient recall. methods: this mixed-methods study comprised (1) a cross-sectional survey among 185 gp practices from a german university network, and (2) structured observations of reminder utilization in six practices based on a clinical vignette describing a multimorbid senior with 26 care needs. descriptive statistics were performed for survey data. the practice observations were analyzed by portraying different types of reminders. results: seventy-three of 185 practices completed the survey (39.5%): 98.6% reported using reminders in the ehr. frequent care contents addressed were allergies/adverse drug events (95.8%), preventive measures (93.1%), participation in disease management programs (87.5%), chronic diseases (75.0%), and upcoming vaccinations (68.1%). practice observations showed a variety of mainly self-configured reminders. in a patients' ehr, information was displayed (1) compiled in a separate field, (2) scattered throughout the ehr, and/or (3) in a pop-up window. the visual appearance of electronic reminders varied: (1) colored fields with short text, (2) ehr entries and/or billing codes in pre-defined colors, (3) abbreviations within the treatment documentation, (4) symbols within the treatment documentation, (5) symbols linked to free text fields, and (6) traffic light schemes. five practices self-designed reminders 'as needed'; one practice applied an ehr-embedded, pre-defined reminder system. practices used reminders for a mean of 13.3 of the 26 aspects of care detailed in the clinical vignette (range: 9-21; standard deviation (sd): 4.3). practices needed 20-35 min (mean: 27.5; sd: 6.1) to retrieve the information requested. conclusions: most gp practices use self-designed, visual reminders for some aspects of care, yet data-based, sophisticated solutions are needed to improve longitudinal care.
weight_loss	novel organomodified nanoclay (bentonite) was reinforced in polystyrene, polyamide, and polystyrene/polyamide blend matrix to develop a series of nanocomposites using a solution processing technique. modification of bentonite nanoclay was performed via an ion-exchange method with l-serine amino acid. properties of polystyrene/modified bentonite, polyamide/modified bentonite, and polystyrene/polyamide/modified bentonite nanocomposites were studied using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, and cone calorimetry techniques. a unique honeycomb-like pattern was observed for polystyrene/polyamide blend with 0.5 g modified bentonite content. the morphology analysis revealed a co-continuous structure in which nanoclay particles were trapped. the polystyrene/polyamide/modified bentonite nanocomposite also showed fine improvement in thermal properties of the system, that is, initial decomposition temperature = 309-321 degrees c and maximum weight loss temperature = 390-400 degrees c. glass transition temperature (351-385 degrees c) of the series was also higher than the polystyrene/modified bentonite and polyamide/modified bentonite series. increasing nanoclay content decreased the peak heat release rate of polystyrene/polyamide/modified bentonite 0.5 nanocomposite to 145 kw m(-2), indicating improvement in nonflammability. moreover, the blend and nanoclay series possess better flame retardancy than the blend and other nanocomposite series developed.
sprains_and_strains	law enforcement represents an unpredictable work environment with a range of physical tasks demanding high levels of strength, muscular power, anaerobic power, and aerobic endurance. common injuries among officers include sprains and strains with back, ankle, hamstring, and rotator cuff being the predominant injury sites. relying on published research evidence and established systematic exercise program design procedures, exercise professionals can create effective, job-specific training programs for law enforcement officers. law enforcement officers represent tactical athletes who need and deserve advanced exercise prescription to safely and effectively meet the demands of their jobs throughout their careers.
cancer	virtually all cells in the organism secrete extracellular vesicles (evs), a heterogeneous population of lipid bilayer membrane-enclosed vesicles that transport and deliver payloads of proteins and nucleic acids to recipient cells, thus playing central roles in cell-cell communications. exosomes, nanosized evs of endosomal origin, regulate many pathophysiological processes including immune responses and inflammation, tumour growth, and infection. healthy subjects and patients with different diseases release exosomes with different rna and protein contents into the circulation, which can be measured as biomarkers. the discovery of exosomes as natural carriers of functional small rna and proteins has raised great interest in the drug delivery field, as it may be possible to harness these vesicles for therapeutic delivery of mirna, sirna, mrna, lncrna, peptides, and synthetic drugs. however, systemically delivered exosomes accumulate in liver, kidney, and spleen. targeted exosomes can be obtained by displaying targeting molecules, such as peptides or antibody fragments recognizing target antigens, on the outer surface of exosomes. display of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored nanobodies on evs is a novel technique that enables ev display of a variety of proteins including antibodies, reporter proteins, and signaling molecules. however, naturally secreted exosomes show limited pharmaceutical acceptability. engineered exosomemimetics that incorporate desirable components of natural exosomes into synthetic liposomes or nanoparticles, and are assembled using controllable procedures may be more acceptable pharmaceutically. in this communication, we review the current understanding of physiological and pathophysiological roles of exosomes, their potential applications as diagnostic markers, and current efforts to develop improved exosome-based drug delivery systems.

senior_health	recent research demonstrates that, although the risk of disease and disability clearly increases with age, poor health need not be an inevitable consequence of aging. a healthy lifestyle is more influential than genetic factors in assisting older adults avoid the decline and deterioration traditionally associated with aging. many effective strategies for reducing disease and disability are widely underused. the escalante health partnerships is a community-based, nurse-managed health promotion and chronic disease care management program for community-residing older adults. the program base supports a multidisciplinary, collaborative practice model, which has responded to the health needs of members of a community at high risk of having or developing chronic conditions. preliminary comparisons of the health status of program participants with national norms demonstrate that these seniors report better general health, performance of roles, and social functioning, with the strongest correlations occurring between general health and vitality and between general health and role-physical. in addition, these participants have 4.2 doctor visits per year, in comparison with 7.1 office visits for a national comparison group and 1.6 hospital days per year, in comparison with 2.1 hospital days in the same referenced population. this collaborative partnership is a model that can be replicated cost-effectively in other communities.
multiple_sclerosis	background: patients with intermediate uveitis (iu) represent a heterogenous group characterized by a wide spectrum of etiologies and regional differences. aim of the study was to analyze the characteristics of patients with iu examined in an academic center in germany. methods: we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of all patients with intermediate uveitis referred to the eye center, university of freiburg from 2007 to 2014. diagnosis followed the standardization in uveitis nomenclature (sun) criteria. data analysis included: etiology of iu, demographics, complications, treatment and visual acuity. results: we identified 159 patients with intermediate uveitis during that period. mean age at diagnosis was 35 years. most are female (64%), and the mean duration of iu was 6.1 years (range 1 month - 35 years). etiology of iu was idiopathic in 59%. multiple sclerosis (ms) (20%) and sarcoidosis (10%) were frequent systemic causes of iu. other etiologies including infectious diseases (tuberculosis, borreliosis) or immune-mediated conditions (eg, after vaccination) were present in 11%. the pattern of complications included macular edema (cme) (36%), cataract (24%), secondary glaucoma (7%), and epiretinal membrane formation (19%). periphlebitis and optic neuritis were more frequent in conjunction with ms. treatment comprised local and systemic steroids, immunosuppressive agents, biologics, and surgery. best corrected visual acuity was better than 20/25 in 60% of the eyes after more than 10 years of follow-up. conclusions: in our german academic center, most iu cases were idiopathic or associated with ms or sarcoidosis. in contrast to other countries, infectious cases were rare. patients' overall visual prognosis is favorable even when the duration of iu has been long and and despite numerous complications.
emergency_contraception	worldwide, 40% of all pregnancies are unintended. widespread, over-the-counter availability of oral emergency contraception (ec) has not reduced unintended pregnancy rates. the ec visit presents an opportunity to initiate a highly effective method of contraception in a population at high risk of unintended pregnancy who are actively seeking to avoid pregnancy. the copper intrauterine device (iud), the most effective method of ec, continues to provide contraception as effective as sterilization for up to 12 years, and it should be offered as the first-line method of ec wherever possible. increased demand for and supply of the copper iud for ec may have an important role in reducing rates of unintended pregnancy. the ec visit should include access to the copper iud as optimal care but should ideally include access to all highly effective methods of contraception.
multiple_sclerosis	remyelination is the natural repair mechanism in demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (cns) such as multiple sclerosis. several animal models have been used to study demyelination and remyelination. among toxic animal models, oral administration of the toxin cuprizone leads to white and gray matter demyelination. in contrast, focal demyelination models include the stereotactic application of a toxin such as lysolecithin or ethidium bromide. the injection procedure generates a local disruption of the blood-brain barrier (bbb) and might thus trigger a local inflammatory reaction and consequently may influence demyelination and remyelination. in order to study such consequences, we applied stereotactic injections in the cuprizone model where demyelination and remyelination are mediated independent of this procedure. immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the presence of lymphocytes and activated glial cells in the injection area. blood protein stainings were used to assess the integrity of the bbb and myelin staining to evaluate demyelination and remyelination processes. stereotactic injection led to a local disruption of the bbb as shown by local extravasation of blood proteins. along the injection canal, t and b lymphocytes could be detected and there was a tendency of a higher microgliosis and astrocytosis. however, these changes did not influence demyelination and remyelination processes at the site of injection, in the corpus callosum, or in the cerebral cortex. our results suggest that a local stereotactic injection has no major impact on cns demyelination and remyelination.
hypothyroidism	headache attributable to disorders of homeostasis represents a diverse diagnostic category in which external (i.e., high-altitude) or internal (i.e., fasting) demands exceed homeostatic capacity, resulting in symptomatic headaches. metabolic headaches, especially fasting headache, have been observed to be common in the general population. in many cases, a history of migraine is a risk factor, consistent with the hypothesis of an adaptive, evolutionary role of headache to warn against environmental and physiological threats. because many exposures may also be interpreted as migraine triggers, some authors have considered certain disorders in this category to more accurately represent primary headache disorders. nonetheless, these disorders not only represent important clinical entities, recognition of which may prevent medical morbidity, but also interesting exposure-response models to further our understanding regarding headache pathophysiology.
weight_loss	this study analyses the effect of different flow rates on the degradation behaviour of porous magnesium for bone scaffold applications. a simulated boundary of bone marrow movement induced by various physiological activities was considered with a variation in flow rate in the experimental process, also known as a dynamic immersion test. three types of porous magnesium (30%, 41%, and 55%) were immersed in simulated body fluid (sbf) for 24, 48, and 72 h. the results show that the relative weight loss and mechanical properties of the porous magnesium significantly degraded by 68% and 95%, respectively, at increasing flow rates together with an increase in immersion period and porosity.

parenting	the family empowerment scale (fes) was developed specifically to assess empowerment in families with emotional disorders. its relevance to custodial grandfamilies is reflected in the difficulties in grandchildren 's social, emotional, and behavioral functioning, wherein such difficulties may be explained via either reactions to changes in their family structure or in their responses to the newly formed family unit. utilizing 27 items derived from the 34-item version of the fes, which had represented differential levels of empowerment (family, service system, community) as indexed by one 's attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, we explored the factor structure, internal consistency, construct, and convergent validity of the fes with grandparent caregivers. three-hundred forty-three (m age = 58.45, sd = 8.22, n caucasian = 152, n african american = 149, n hispanic = 38) custodial grandmothers caring for grandchildren between ages 4 and 12 years completed the 27 fes items and various measures of their psychological well-being, grandchild psychological difficulties, emotional support, and parenting practices. factor analysis revealed three factors that differed slightly from the originally proposed fes subscales: parental self-efficacy/self-confidence, service activism, and service knowledge. each of the factors was internally consistent, and derived factor scores were moderately interrelated, speaking to the question of convergent validity. the construct validity of these three factors was evidenced by meaningful patterns of statistically significant correlations with grandmothers' psychological well-being, grandchild psychological difficulties, emotional support, and parenting practices. these factor scores were independent of grandmother age, health, and education. these findings suggest the newly identified fes factors to be valuable in understanding empowerment among grandmother caregivers.
menopause	background: as taxanes are increasingly used in oncology, the myalgia-arthralgia syndrome (m-as) that represents an adverse effect of these drugs is becoming more common. nevertheless, information regarding predisposing factors, prevention, and therapy of the syndrome is still lacking. patients and methods: women who had received docetaxel as part of the fec-d(t) regimen for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer were retrospectively identified from the records of our oncology department. data on demographics, disease specifics, adverse effects, and treatment were reviewed. patients were divided into two groups: those who developed m-as after docetaxel treatment and those who did not develop the syndrome. the two groups were compared to identify risk factors for m-as. effectiveness of drugs used for m-as was evaluated. results: sixty-seven patients were identified as fulfilling the inclusion criteria. nineteen patients developed the m-as after the first docetaxel administration. forty-eight patients did not develop the syndrome. three patients in this group were excluded because they had been taking gabapentin or pregabalin at the time of docetaxel administration for another indication. the remaining 45 patients constituted the control group. the two groups were similar in age, menopause status, stage of their cancer, and histology. the m-as group had a higher median body surface area and was more likely to receive less than the three intended cycles of docetaxel. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, atypical antiepileptics, extended corticosteroids, and opioids were drugs used as m-as treatments. conclusion: docetaxel-associated m-as is an adverse effect causing incomplete drug treatment. possible risk factors and effectiveness of treatments for the syndrome are presented.
diabetes	fruit and leaves of junipers are commonly used internally as tea and pounded fruits are eaten to lower blood glucose levels in anatolia. thus, we aimed to evaluate antidiabetic and antioxidant potential and the chemical profile of juniperus foetidissima willd. and j. sabina l. in this study. in-vitro antidiabetic activities of leaf and fruit extracts were examined by their inhibitory activity on a-glucosidase and a-amylase enzymes. then, in-vivo antidiabetic activities of leaf and fruit extracts of juniperus species were investigated on streptozotocininduced diabetic rats. additionally, antioxidant activities (phosphomolybdenum, ferric-reducing antioxidant power and abts radical scavenging activity assays), phytochemical screening tests and high performance liquid chromatography analysis (hplc) were done. in-vitro enzyme inhibitory effects of the extracts were supported by the results of in-vivo antidiabetic activity studies. phytochemical screening tests indicated presence of flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids and carbohydrates in the extracts. amentoflavone was identified as the major compound in the extracts and content of amentoflavone was determined. as a result, juniperus extracts and its active constituents might be beneficial for diabetes and its complications.
weight_loss	the purpose of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility of an intervention designed to facilitate partner support for lifestyle change among overweight and obese adults with serious mental illness (smi). fifteen adults with smi enrolled in a lifestyle intervention at community mental health centers participated with a self-selected partner in an additional 12-week intervention component designed to facilitate social support for health behavior change. participants reported that the program was useful, convenient, and helped them reach their goals. approximately two-thirds (66%) of participants were below their baseline weight at follow-up, including 27% achieving clinically significant weight loss. participants reported significant increases in partner support for exercise and use of persuasive social support strategies. partner support interventions that promote exercising together and positive communication may be effective for helping individuals with smi initiate and sustain health behavior change necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	clinical evidence is accumulating for a role of the microbiome in contributing to or modulating severity of inflammatory diseases. these studies can be organized by various organ systems involved, as well as type of study approach utilized, whether investigators compared the microbiome of cases versus controls, followed patients longitudinally, or intervened with antibiotics, prebiotics, or bacterial introduction. in this review, we summarize the clinical evidence supporting the microbiome as an important mechanism in the onset and maintenance of inflammation.
headache	objective: to identify factors associated with treatment modality selection in acoustic neuromas. study design: prospective observational study. setting: tertiary care neurotology clinic. patients: data were prospectively collected from patients initially presenting to a tertiary care neurotology clinic between 2013 and 2016. patients who did not have magnetic resonance imaging (mri), demographic, psychometric, or audiometric data were excluded from analysis. intervention: demographic information, clinical symptoms, tumor characteristics, and psychometric data were collected to determine factors associated with undergoing acoustic neuroma surgical resection using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis. main outcome measure: the decision to pursue acoustic neuroma surgical resection versus active surveillance. results: a total of 216 patients with acoustic neuroma (mean age 55 years, 58% women) were included. ninety eight patients (45.4%) pursued surgical resection, 118 patients (54.6%) pursued active surveillance. surgical treatment was significantly associated with patient age less than 65, higher grade tumors, growing tumors, larger volume tumors, lower word discrimination scores, class d hearing, headache, and vertigo as presenting symptoms, higher number of total symptoms, and higher headache severity scores (p<0.05). there was no significant association between surgical intervention and preoperative quality of life, depression, and self-esteem scores. on multiple logistic regression analysis, the likelihood of undergoing surgical resection significantly decreased for patients older than age 65 (odds ratio [or] 0.19; 0.05-0.69) and increased in patients with medium (or 4.34; 1.36-13.81), moderately large (or 33.47; 5.72-195.83), large grade tumors (or 56.63; 4.02518.93), tumor growth present (or 4.51; 1.66-12.28), class d hearing (or 3.96; 1.29-12.16), and higher headache severity scores (or 1.03; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.011.05). the likelihood of undergoing surgical resection was completely predictive for giant grade tumors and not significant for small grade tumors and class b or c hearing. conclusions: non-elderly acoustic neuroma patients with larger tumors, growing tumors, significant hearing loss, and worse headaches are more likely to pursue surgical resection rather than active surveillance. psychological factors such as quality of life, depression, and self-esteem do not seem to influence decision-making in this patient population.
heart_disease	this study aimed to verify whether a prolonged exposure to low-level mercury promotes haemodynamic disorders and studied the reversibility of this vascular damage. rats were divided into seven groups: three control groups received saline solution (im) for 30, 60 or 90 days; two groups received hgcl2 (im, first dose, 4.6 mu g/kg, subsequent doses 0.07 mu g/kg/day) for 30 or 60 days; two groups received hgcl2 for 30 or 60 days (im, same doses) followed by a 30-day washout period. systolic blood pressure (sbp) was measured, along with analysis of vascular response to acetylcholine (ach) and phenylephrine (phe) in the absence and presence of endothelium, a nitric oxide (no) synthase inhibitor, an nadph oxidase inhibitor, superoxide dismutase, a nonselective cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitor and an at1 receptor blocker. reactive oxygen species (ros) levels and antioxidant power were measured in plasma. hgcl2 exposure for 30 and 60 days: a) reduced the endothelium dependent relaxation; b) increased the phe-induced contraction and the contribution of ros, cox-derived vasoconstrictor prostanoids and angiotensin ii acting on ati receptors to this response while the no participation was reduced; c) increased the oxidative stress in plasma; d) increased the sbp only after 60 days of exposure. after the cessation of hgcl2 exposure, sbp, endothelium-dependent relaxation, phe-induced contraction and the oxidative stress were normalised, despite the persistence of the increased cox-derived prostanoids. these results demonstrated that long-term hgcl2 exposure increases sbp as a consequence of vascular dysfunction; however, after hgcl2 removal from the environment the vascular function ameliorates.
heart_disease	inflammation has been defined formany years as the response to tissue injury and infection. we are now forced to reconsider this definition by the avalanche of reports that molecules and cells associated with inflammation are activated or expressed in high concentration in a large variety of states in the absence of tissue injury or infection. modest increases in concentration of c-reactive protein, a circulating marker of inflammation, have been reported to be associated with an astounding number of conditions and lifestyles felt to be associated with poor health; these conditions represent or reflect minor metabolic stresses. in recent years we have learned that inflammation is triggered by sentinel cells that monitor for tissue stress and malfunction-deviations from optimal homeostasis-and that molecules that participate in the inflammatory process play a role in restoring normal homeostasis. accordingly, we suggest that inflammation be redefined as the innate immune response to potentially harmful stimuli such as pathogens, injury, and metabolic stress.-antonelli, m., kushner, i. it 's time to redefine inflammation.
sports_injuries	context: kinesio taping (kt) is a taping technique extensively used in rehabilitation of sports injuries; however, the effect of kt on delayed-onset muscle soreness is not entirely clear. objectives: to investigate the effect of kinesio tape on the quadriceps femoris on muscle pain, flexibility, and sprint performance after squat exercise. design: crossover study. setting: university research laboratory. participants: 19 female university students (age 21.0 +/- 1.2 y, weight 53.0 +/- 4.6 kg, height 164 +/- 4 cm). main outcome measures: pressure-pain threshold for quadriceps femoris was recorded using pressure algometry. quadriceps femoris flexibility was measured as the range of motion of knee flexion with a stainless steel goniometer. sprint-speed measurements were conducted using photocells placed at 0 and 20 m. all participants completed both conditions (kt application and no kt application) after a 1-wk washout period. measurements were taken at baseline and 48 h postexercise. for the kt condition, kt was applied immediately before the exercise protocol and remained on the skin for 48 h. results: squat exercise reduced flexibility and increased pain and sprint time compared with baseline. kt application resulted in similar sprint time and muscle pain as the no-kt condition but maintained flexibility compared with baseline. conclusions: kt application immediately before squat exercise has no effect on muscle pain and short sprint performance but maintains muscle flexibility at 2 days of recovery.
allergies	the increasing prevalence of food allergies and the intake of packing foods in the past two decades urge the need for more rapid, accurate, and sensitive assays to detect potential allergens in food in order to control the allergen content. most of the commercial analytical tools for allergen detection rely on immunoassays such as elisa. as far as disadvantages, elisa can be time-consuming and expensive. biosensors appear as a suitable alternative for the detection of allergens because they are rapid, highly sensitive, selective, less expensive, environmentally friendly, and easy to handle. in this study, we developed a microfluidic system integrated with a quantum dots (qdots) aptamer functionalized graphene oxide (go) nano-biosensor for simple, rapid, and sensitive food allergen detection. the biosensor utilized qdots-aptamer-go complexes as probes to undergo conformational change upon interaction with the food allergens, resulting in fluorescence changes due to the fluorescence quenching and recovering properties of go by adsorption and desorption of aptamer-conjugated qdots. this one-step 'turn on' homogenous assay in a ready-to-use microfluidic chip took similar to 10 min to achieve a quantitative detection of ara h 1, one of the major allergens appearing in peanuts. the results suggested this system had remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. the integration of a microfluidics platform in a homemade miniaturized optical analyzer provides a promising way for the rapid, cost-effective, and accurate on-site determination of food allergens. this biosensor can also be extended to the detection of other food allergens with a selection of corresponding aptamers.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	aim to confirm previous conclusions on saccharomyces cerevisiae (s. cerevisiae) cncm i-3856 for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) management. methods an individual patient data meta-analysis was per-formed on two randomized clinical trials studying the effect of s. cerevisiae cncm i-3856 supplementation on gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms in ibs subjects. a total of 579 ibs subjects were included. outcomes were the daily likert scale scores of abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating [area under the curve (auc) and weekly means], responder status, and bowel movements (stool frequency and consistency). statistical analyses were conducted in intent to treat (itt) population, ibs-c subjects and ibs-c subjects with an abdominal pain/ discomfort score higher than or equal to 2 at baseline ("" ibs-c (>=) 2 subpopulation""). results s. cerevisiae cncm i-3856 significantly improved abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating during the second month of supplementation [auc (w5-w8)] with improvement up to the minimal clinically relevant threshold of 10%: a 12.3% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort in the itt population compared to the placebo group (p = 0.0134) has been observed. in the ibs-c >= 2 subpopulation, there were a 13.1% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort and a 14.9% reduction of bloating compared to the placebo group (p = 0.0194 and p = 0.0145, respectively). gi symptoms significantly decreased during supplementation but no statistical differences were reported between groups at the end of the supplementation period. responder status was defined as a subject who experienced a decrease of 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.) or 50% of the abdominal discomfort score from baseline for at least 2 wk out of the last 4 wk of the study. a significant difference between groups was reported in the itt population, when considering the first definition: subjects in the active group had 1.510 higher odds to be a responder (reduction of 1 a.u. of abdominal pain/discomfort) compared with subjects in the placebo group (p = 0.0240). at the end of supplementation period, stool consistency in the active group of the itt population was significantly improved and classified as ""normal"" compared to placebo (respectively 3.13 +/- 1.197 a.u. vs 2.58 +/- 1.020 a.u., p = 0.0003). similar results were seen in the ibs-c = 2 subpopulation (active group: 3.14 +/- 1.219 a.u. vs placebo group: 2.59 +/- 1.017 a.u., p = 0.0009). conclusion this meta-analysis supports previous data linking s. cerevisiae i-3856 and improvement of gi symptoms, in ibs overall population and in the ibs-c and ibs-c = 2 subpopulations.
birth_control	in view of the known sensitivity of the developing central nervous system to pollutants, we sought to assess the effects of exposure to uranium (u) a heavy metal naturally present in the environment on the behavior of young rats and the impact of oxidative stress on their hippocampus. pups drank u (in the form of uranyl nitrate) at doses of 10 or 40 mg.l-1 for 10 weeks from birth. control rats drank mineral water. locomotor activity in an open field and practice effects on a rotarod device decreased in rats exposed to 10 mg.l-1 (respectively, -19.4% and -51.4%) or 40 mg.l-1 (respectively, -19.3% and -55.9%) in compared with control rats. anxiety (+37%) and depressive-like behavior (-50.8%) were altered by u exposure only at 40 mg.l-1. lipid peroxidation (+35%) and protein carbonyl concentration (+137%) increased significantly after exposure to u at 40 mg.l-1. a significant increase in superoxide dismutase (sod, +122.5%) and glutathione peroxidase (gpx, +13.6%) activities was also observed in the hippocampus of rats exposed to 40 mg.l-1. these results demonstrate that exposure to u since birth alters some behaviors and modifies antioxidant status..
diabetes	red raspberry fruit intake was investigated on obese diabetic (db/db) mice for 8 weeks. animals fed isocaloric diets (5.3% freeze-dried raspberry, or control) were assessed for obesity-diabetes-disease risk biomarkers. results showed that raspberry intake improved antioxidant status and lessened plasma interleukin (il)-6 (0.3-fold of control, p0.05). plasma levels of total cholesterol (t-chl), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (ldl-chl), and resistin were higher in the raspberry group. overall, the enhanced detoxifying cell defenses exerted by raspberry intake might be due to its polyphenolics and fibre. this study demonstrates in vivo that raspberry intake, at a dose that can be achieved by human consumption, might protect against diabetes-induced oxidative stress.

birth_control	background: the aim of this study was to investigate contraceptive non-use and associated factors (socio-demographics, sexual behaviour, internal assets and mental health) among undergraduate university students in 22 countries. methods: using anonymous questionnaires, data was collected from 16979 undergraduate university students (mean age 20.8, sd=2.8) from 23 universities in 22 countries. results: of the total sample of 16979 undergraduate university students, 7032 (41.9%) reported to have been sexually active in the past 12 months. of those who had been sexually active, 42.6% reported never (42.7% among male and 42.6% among female students) using contraceptives in the past 12 months. in multivariate regression analysis, among both men and women, younger age, religious affiliation (hindu; and among women only being muslim), intrinsic religiosity, and sexually protective behaviour were associated with contraceptive non-use. lack of internal assets (among men, low life satisfaction and lack of personal control, and among women low personal mastery); among women not having depressive symptoms and among men having ptsd symptoms were associated with contraceptive non-use. conclusion: low contraceptive use was found and several factors identified as associated with contraceptive non-use may help guide intervention efforts.
myelofibrosis	the association of chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) with other myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns), in particular with the v617f mutation in the janus kinase 2 (jak2) gene, is very uncommon, and there are only a few cases reported in the literature. in the present study, the case of a 73-year-old man with cml and persistent thrombocytosis, is reported. the patient achieved a complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response (mr) with imatinib. the patient presented jak2 v617f mutation, and bone marrow morphology was consistent with essential thrombocythemia. the patient was treated with imatinib and hydroxyurea to control the platelet count, and maintains complete mr with imatinib upon 10 years of follow-up. although rare, the association of breakpoint cluster region-abelson rearrangement and jak2 v617f mutation should be investigated in patients with mpn, since both genetic anomalies may be present at diagnosis or may emerge during treatment, and require different therapeutic approaches.
myelofibrosis	allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the sole curative option for myelofibrosis. many transplantation recipients receive a reduced-intensity conditioning (ric) regimen owing to age or comorbidities; however, there is little published evidence to guide the choice of ric regimen. in this study, we compared outcomes in patients who received 1 of 2 frequently used ric regimens for patients with myelofibrosis: fludarabine-busulfan (fb) and fludarabine-melphalan (fm). a total of 160 patients underwent a ric allograft procedure (fb group, n = 105; fm group, n = 55). we have developed a complex statistical model involving weighting and adjustment to permit comparison between these 2 groups. after weighting, the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) was 62% in the fm group and 31% in the fb group (p = .001), and the corresponding incidence of chronic gvhd was 49% and 53%, respectively. the 7-year progression-free survival was were 52% in the fm group versus 33% in the fb group, and the 7-year overall survival rate 52% in the fm group versus 59% in the fb group. nonrelapse mortality (nrm) was 43% in the fm group and 31% in the fb group. multivariable analyses revealed no significant differences in pfs between the 2 groups; however, the relapse rate was significantly lower in the fm group (hazard ratio, 9.21; p = .008), whereas a trend toward reduced nrm was seen in the fb group (hazard ratio, 0.51; p = .068). in conclusion, both regimens appear to be efficient in mediating disease control and can be used to successfully condition patients with myelofibrosis. the fm regimen appears to induce more nrm than the fb regimen, but with augmented control of disease, leading to comparable overall survival rates for both regimens.

headache	context: sports participation is one of the leading causes of concussions among nearly 8 million us high school student-athletes. objective: to describe the epidemiology of sport-related concussion (src) in 27 high school sports during the 20112012 through 2013-2014 academic years. design: descriptive epidemiology study. setting: aggregate injury and exposure data from 27 sports in 147 high schools in the national athletic treatment, injury and outcomes network (nation). patients or other participants: boy and girl high school athletes during the 2011-2012 through 2013-2014 academic years. main outcome measure(s): sport-related concussion counts, percentages, rates per 10 000 athlete-exposures (aes), rate ratios (rrs), and injury proportion ratios (iprs) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (cis). rate ratios and iprs with 95% cis not containing 1.0 were considered significant. results: overall, 2004 srcs were reported among 27 high school sports, for a rate of 3.89 per 10 000 aes. football had the highest src rate (9.21/10 000 aes), followed by boys' lacrosse 6.65/10 000 aes) and girls' soccer (6.11/10 000 aes). the src rate was higher in competition than in practice (rr = 3.30; 95% ci = 3.02, 3.60). among sex-comparable sports, the src rate was higher in girls than in boys (rr = 1.56; 95% ci = 1.34, 1.81); however, the proportion of srcs due to player-to-player contact was higher in boys than in girls (ipr = 1.48; 95% ci = 1.27, 1.73). common symptoms reported among all athletes with srcs were headache (94.7%), dizziness (74.8%), and difficulty concentrating (61.0%). only 0.8% of players with srcs returned to play within 24 hours. the majority of athletes with srcs (65.8%) returned to play between 7 and 28 days. more players had symptoms resolve after 7 days (48.8%) than less than a week (40.7%). conclusions: our findings provide updated high school src incidence estimates and further evidence of sex differences in reported srcs. few athletes with srcs returned to play within 24 hours or a week. most injured players returned after 7 days, despite a smaller proportion having symptoms resolve within a week.
emergency_contraception	background: large sporting events have raised concerns about the effect on the sexual and reproductive health (srh) of visiting and resident populations to the host city and increased demand on srh services. however, there is little evidence to support these concerns. the aim of this study is to investigate if the 2014 xx commonwealth games had an effect on the service demands of a glasgow city-wide integrated srh service. methods: electronic patient records, city-wide pharmacy data and case note review was used to assess aspects of srh; this included overall attendance at integrated services, clinic and community emergency contraception prescriptions, victims of sexual assault, acute sexually transmissible infections (stis), post exposure prophylaxis after sexual exposure (pepse) prescriptions, condom distribution and termination of pregnancy. results: there was a significant decrease in core sexual health attendances, total acute stis and emergency hormonal contraception prescriptions. there was no change in pepse prescriptions or the number of reported sexual assaults throughout the city. conclusions: this study found no evidence that the 2014 xx commonwealth games placed any increased demand on the local srh services, and showed no increase in stis, emergency hormonal contraception prescriptions or sexual assaults. these findings will help service planning in host cities hosting future large sporting events.
weight_loss	background: the risks during early growth on becoming overweight in adulthood are widely studied in humans. however, early-life predictive factors for canine adult overweight and obesity have not yet been studied. to identify factors that may help explain the development of overweight and obesity at adulthood in dogs, a longitudinal study of 2 years was conducted in 24 female beagle dogs of the same age, sexual status, and raised under identical environmental conditions. by means of a hierarchical classification on principal components with the following quantitative values: fat-free mass (ffm), percentage fat mass and pelvic circumference at 2 years of age, three groups of dogs were established and were nominally named: ideal weight (iw, n = 9), slightly overweight (ow1, n = 6) and overweight (ow2, n = 9). with the aim of identifying predictive factors of development of obesity at adulthood parental characteristics, growth pattern, energy balance and plasma factors were analysed by logistic regression analysis. results: at 24 months, the group compositions were in line with the body condition scores (bcs 1-9) values of the iw (5 or 6/9), the ow1 (6/9) and the ow2 (7 or 8/9) groups. logistic regression analysis permitted the identification of neonatal growth rate during the first 2 weeks of life (gr(2w)) and bcs at 7 months as predictors for the development of obesity at adulthood. seventy percent of dogs with either gr2w >125% or with bcs >6/9 at 7 months belonged to the ow2 group. results from energy intake and expenditure, corrected for ffm, showed that there was a greater positive energy imbalance between 7 and 10 months for the ow2, compared to the iw group. conclusion: this study expands the understanding of previously reported risk factors for being overweight or obese in dogs, establishing that (i) 15 out of 24 of the studied dogs became overweight and (ii) gr(2w) and bcs at 7 months of age could be used as predictive factors as overweight adult dogs in the ow2 group had higher values compared the other groups of dogs.
low_testosterone	changes in understanding regarding the relationship of androgens and prostate cancer have led to changes in the use of testosterone therapy. the evidence supports a finite ability of androgens to stimulate prostate cancer growth, with a maximum achieved at low testosterone concentrations, called the saturation model. the saturation point corresponds with maximal androgenic stimulation at 250 ng/dl. evidence is reviewed herein regarding the relationship of testosterone to prostate cancer and the relatively new practice of offering testosterone therapy to men with a history of prostate cancer. although no prospective controlled trials have been performed, results have been reassuring.
senior_health	objective: the paper investigated some of the beliefs around the breastfeeding norm of the postpartum abstinence and how these influence sexual behavior. it was based on a larger project which explored how gender relations affect reproductive processes and the reproductive health of tarok women in north-central nigeria. methods: research was conducted in four tarok communities using qualitative instruments, namely in-depth interviews (idis) and focus group discussion (fgd) guides. participants were female and male community members of 15 years and above. sixteen idis (four per community) were conducted with women, religious and traditional leaders as well as senior health providers. twenty-four fgd sessions (six per community) were held with different groups in the community and data were descriptively analyzed. results: findings demonstrated customary double standards in sexual matters; the significance and influence of certain unfounded traditional beliefs around breastfeeding on sexual behavior and choices; as well as some of the changes that characterize sexual relationships among modern tarok couples brought about by christianity, western education and modernity. conclusion: traditional breastfeeding norms and beliefs seek to overly control women 's sexuality while giving precedence to the interest of the child and its father. the study calls for a change in attitude to meet the demands of the current reality in order to strengthen marital unions and guarantee healthy families.

hepatitis_c	background. highly effective hepatitis c virus (hcv) therapies have spurred a scale-up of treatment to populations at greater risk of reinfection after sustained virologic response (svr). reinfection may be higher in hiv-hcv coinfection, but prior studies have considered small selected populations. we assessed risk factors for reinfection after svr in a representative cohort of canadian coinfected patients in clinical care. methods. all patients achieving svr after hcv treatment were followed with hcv rna measurements every 6 months in a prospective cohort study. we used bayesian cox regression to estimate reinfection rates according to patient reported injection drug use (idu) and sexual activity among men who have sex with men (msm). results. of 497 patients treated for hcv, 257 achieved svr and had at least 1 subsequent rna measurement. during 589 person-years of follow-up (pyfu) after svr, 18 (7%) became hcv rna positive. the adjusted reinfection rate (per 1000 pyfu) in the first year after svr was highest in those who reported high-frequency idu (58; 95% credible interval [cri], 18-134) followed by msm reporting high-risk sexual activity (26; 95% cri, 6-66) and low-frequency idu (22; 95% cri, 4-68). the rate in low-risk msm (16; 95% cri, 4-38) was similar to that in reference patients (10; 95% cri, 4-20). reinfection rates did not diminish with time. conclusions. hcv reinfection rates varied according to risk. measures are needed to reduce risk behaviors and increase monitoring in high-risk idu and msm if hcv elimination targets are to be realized.
overactive_bladder	overactive bladder (oab) is defined by ics (international continence society) as urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. the pharmacological treatment was reduced to antimuscarinic. recently, a new therapeutic class: beta 3-adrenoreceptor agonist is available in france, with encouraging results regarding its tolerance, main obstacle to good compliance regarding antimuscarinic treatment. however, further research is still needed to explore each subgroup as patient with lower urinary tract obstruction and neurological population.

multiple_sclerosis	oriental medicine samhwangsasim-tang (shsst) has traditionally been used in east asia to treat hypertension and its complications. however, little is known about its potential value regarding the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms). in this study, we investigated whether shsst has a beneficial effect in treating myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae). onset-treatment with shsst was found to alleviate neurological symptoms as well as demyelination and glial activation in the spinal cords from the eae mice. the shsst also attenuated the mrna or protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta and tumor necrotic factor-alpha); chemokines ( rantes, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha); inducible nitric oxide synthase; and cyclooxygenase-2 in correspondence with the down-regulation of the nuclear factor-kappa b and mitogen-activated protein kinases signal pathways in the spinal cords from eae mice. interestingly, the protective effect of the shsst was related to a decreased number of th1 cells and an increased number of treg cells in spinal cords from eae mice. taken together, our finding firstly suggested that shsst could delay or mitigate eae with a wide therapeutic time-window by suppressing th1 cell responses and upregulating treg cell responses. also, our findings are strong enough to warrant further investigation of shsst as a treatment for chronic autoimmune diseases including ms.
senior_health	minimal research explores the impact of a career in dementia care on senior health professionals. this study sought positive and negative subjective interpretations from seven senior health professionals regarding their experiences in dementia care. data from semi-structured interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (ipa). one superordinate theme, honouring stigmatised self, overarched four sub-themes: systemic stigma, invalidated, self-respect and moral integrity and growth. stigma was interpreted as systemically entrenched minimisation of aged care and the aged-care workforce, including poor remuneration and training. participants experienced peer invalidation particularly when attempting to resolve complex professional and moral challenges in dementia care. these often occurred in the context of efforts to individualise care, constrained within a medical model. paradoxically, external invalidation motivated a search for redefining self' and moral integrity. by wisely acknowledging career experience, growthful domains of self-respect, optimism, humility and innovation defined professional practice and personal choices. implications are discussed.
hypothyroidism	fetal and neonatal autoimmune hyperthyroidism is a rare, serious but transient disorder. early diagnosis and treatment are key objectives for an optimal prognosis and the well-being of the child. this review focuses on the management of these patients during the fetal and neonatal periods. we propose a diagnostic algorithm for high-risk pregnancies in mothers with current or past hyperthyroidism related to graves' disease, involving repeated fetal thyroid gland assessments from 20 weeks of gestation onwards and maternal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody (trab) determination, with close monitoring if trab levels exceed 2 to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range. in fetuses with goiter, the main clinical issue is determining whether the cause is (1) maternal antithyroid drug (atd) treatment that is appropriate for achieving normal maternal thyroid function but inappropriate and excessive for the fetus, resulting in hypothyroidism and necessitating a decrease in the atd dose during pregnancy, or (2) the presence of trabs resulting in fetal thyroid stimulation and hyperthyroidism, requiring an increase in the maternal atd dose. methimazole/carbimazole treatment should be initiated as soon as possible during the neonatal period, carefully managed and maintained over a period of 1-3 months and then stopped when trab is no longer detectable in serum.

skin_care	sleep is critical to brain health at any age, but especially for the high-risk newborn. protecting it is a challenge in the nicu for many reasons - babies are almost always asleep, it is difficult to tell what stage of sleep they are in, and many sources of sleep disruption in the nicu are not entirely preventable. sleep usually occurs as part of a circadian rhythm at other ages, but high-risk newborns do not exhibit circadian rhythmicity and the nicu environment is not conducive to developing one. both structural and operational strategies to protect sleep and its beneficial effects on the brain are outlined. increased parental interaction with the baby may be the best way to reduce noxious stimuli and provide nurturing stimuli while supporting sleep.

parkinson's_disease	background: the majority of parkinson 's disease (pd) cases are sporadic and idiopathic suggesting that this neurodegenerative disorder is the result of both environmental and genetic factors. stress and neuroinflammation are among the factors being investigated for their possible contributions to pd. experiments in rodents showed that severe chronic stress can reduce the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (snc); the same cells that are lost in pd. these actions are at least in part mediated by increased oxidative stress. here, we tested the hypothesis that the interleukin-13 receptor alpha 1 (il-13ra1), a cytokine receptor whose activation increases the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative damage, participates in the stress-dependent damage of these neurons. methods: mice were subject to daily sessions of 8 h (acute) stress for 16 weeks (5 days a week), a procedure previously showed to induce loss of dopaminergic neurons in the snc. the source and the kinetics of interleukin-13 (il-13), the endogenous ligand of il-13ra1, were evaluated 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 h and at 16 weeks of stress. identification of il-13 producing cell-type was performed by immunofluorescent and by in situ hybridization experiments. markers of oxidative stress, microglia activation, and the number of dopaminergic neurons in il-13ra1 knock-out animals (ii13ra1(y/-)) and their wild-type littermates (ii13ra1(y/+)) were evaluated at 16 weeks of stress and at 20 weeks, following a 4 week nonstressed period and compared to non-stressed mice. results: il-13 was expressed in microglial cells within the sn and in a fraction of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the snc. il-13 levels were elevated during daily stress and peaked at 6 h. 16 weeks of chronic restraint stress significantly reduced the number of snc dopaminergic neurons in ii13ra1(y/+) mice. neuronal loss at 16 weeks was significantly lower in ii13ra1(y/-) mice. however, the loss of dopaminergic neurons measured at 20 weeks, after 4 weeks of non-stress following the 16 weeks of stress, was similar in ii13ra1(y/+) and il13ra1y/-mice. conclusions: il-13, a cytokine previously demonstrated to increase the susceptibility of snc dopaminergic neurons to oxidative stress, is elevated in the sn by restraint stress. lack of il-13ra1 did not prevent nor halted but delayed neuronal loss in the mouse model of chronic restraint stress. il-13/il-13ra1 may represent a target to reduce the rate of da neuronal loss that can occur during severe chronic restraint stress.
diabetes	purpose we investigated the efficiency of the simplified comorbidity score (scs) for predicting postoperative complications and prognosis in elderly patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (vats) for lung cancer. methods we reviewed 216 patients aged 75 years or older, who underwent pulmonary resection by vats for lung cancer between january, 2005 and december, 2012. the scs assigns different scores to patients' comorbidities; namely, smoking (n = 7); diabetes mellitus (n = 5); renal insufficiency (n = 4); and respiratory, neoplastic, and cardiovascular comorbidities or alcoholism (n = 1 each). patients were divided into a high scs group (scs = 9; n = 154) and a low scs group (< 9; n = 62), for a comparative analysis of differences in perioperative factors and prognoses. results limited resection was more frequent in the high scs group (58 %) than in the low scs group (40 %; p = 0.02). postoperative complications were more frequent in the high scs group (45 %) than in the low scs group (15 %; p < 0.01). a logistic regression analysis revealed that a high scs was significantly predictive of postoperative complications (odds ratio 2.7; p = 0.02). the 5-year overall survival rate was 79 % for the low scs group and 52 % for the high scs group (p < 0.01). conclusions the scs can predict the likelihood of postoperative complications and prognosis of elderly patients with vats-treated lung cancers.
low_testosterone	although men with type 2 diabetes (t2d) frequently have lowered testosterone levels, it is not well established whether this is ascribable to the diabetic state per se, or because of other factors, such as obesity. our objective was to determine the prevalence and correlates of low testosterone in middle-aged men with diabetes. we conducted a cross-sectional study in 240 men including 80 men with type 1 diabetes (t1d), 80 men with t2d and 80 men without diabetes. prevalence of a total testosterone 8nmol/l was low, occurring in none of the men with t1d, 6.2% of men with t2d and 2.5% of men without diabetes. men with t1d had higher testosterone levels compared with men without diabetes (p<0.001), even after adjustment for body mass index (bmi) and age (p<0.02). while men with t2d had lower testosterone compared with controls (p=0.03), this was no longer significant when bmi and age were taken into account (p=0.16). in the entire cohort, tt remained inversely associated with bmi independent of age, sex hormone-binding globulin and diabetic status (p=0.01), whereas calculated free testosterone (cft) was independently and inversely associated with age (p<0.001), but not with bmi (p=0.47). these results suggest that marked reductions in circulating testosterone are uncommon in middle-aged men with diabetes. increasing bmi and age are dominant drivers of lowered total and cft, respectively, independent of the presence or absence of diabetes.
diabetes	the nuclear receptor car (nr1i3) regulates hepatic drug and energy metabolism as well as cell fate. its activation can be a critical factor in drug-induced toxicity and the development of diseases, including diabetes and tumors. car inactivates its constitutive activity by phosphorylation at threonine 38. utilizing receptor for protein kinase 1 (rack1) as the regulatory subunit, protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) dephosphorylates threonine 38 to activate car. here we demonstrate that car undergoes homodimer-monomer conversion to regulate this dephosphorylation. by coexpression of two differently tagged car proteins in huh-7 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes, and mouse livers, coimmunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that car can form a homodimer in a configuration in which the pp2a/rack1 binding site is buried within its dimer interface. epidermal growth factor (egf) was found to stimulate car homodimerization, thus constraining car in its inactive form. the agonistic ligand citco binds directly to the car homodimer and dissociates phosphorylated car into its monomers, exposing the pp2a/rack1 binding site for dephosphorylation. phenobarbital, which is not a car ligand, binds the egf receptor, reversing the egf signal to monomerize car for its indirect activation. thus, the homodimer-monomer conversion is the underlying molecular mechanism that regulates car activation, by placing phosphorylated threonine 38 as the common target for both direct and indirect activation of car.
headache	aim: the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of aging on the viscoelastic properties of the upper trapezius (ut) and the sternocleidomastoid (scm) muscle during transition from lying to sitting position. materials and methods: the study included 39 older (mean age 67 +/- 5.9 years) and 36 younger (21.1 +/- 1.8 years) women. tone, stiffness and elasticity of the ut and the scm were measured by means of myotonometry (myotonpro) in lying and then, in sitting position. the results were compared using twoway analysis of variance. results: irrespective of the position, older women presented with significantly higher muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity than younger subjects (p < 0.05). in both groups, the transition from lying to sitting position resulted in a decrease (p0.05) of the scm, and stimulated an increase in the tone, stiffness and elasticity of the ut (p < 0.05). the degree of changes in both study groups was similar, except from the absolute value of the ut elasticity, significantly higher increase in older women than in younger subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: age contributes to an increase in the stiffness and tone of the ut and the scm, as well as to a decrease in the elasticity of these muscles in female subjects. in contrast, age exerts only a slight effect on the mechanical properties of both muscles during transition from lying to sitting position.

skin_care	the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify the prevalence of incontinence and incontinence-associated dermatitis (iad) in australian acute care patients and to describe the products worn to manage incontinence, and those provided at the bedside for perineal skin care. data on 376 inpatients were collected over 2 days at a major australian teaching hospital. the mean age of the sample group was 62 years and 52% of the patients were male. the prevalence rate of incontinence was 24% (91/376). urinary incontinence was significantly more prevalent in females (10%) than males (6%) (chi(2) = 4.458, df = 1, p = 0.035). iad occurred in 10% (38/376) of the sample group, with 42% (38/91) of incontinent patients having iad. semi-formed and liquid stool were associated with iad (chi(2) = 5.520, df = 1, p = 0.027). clinical indication of fungal infection was present in 32% (12/38) of patients with iad. absorbent disposable briefs were the most common incontinence aids used (80%, 70/91), with soap/water and disposable washcloths being the clean-up products most commonly available (60%, 55/91) at the bedside. further data are needed to validate this high prevalence. studies that address prevention of iad and the effectiveness of management strategies are also needed.
myelofibrosis	janus kinase 2 (jak2) plays an essential role in the signaling of hormone-like cytokines and growth factors, which has been convinced as an important target of myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) therapy. in this study, a series of novel pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidine-phenylamide hybrids were designed and synthesized as potential jak2 inhibitors through hybridization strategy. in vitro biological studies showed that most of these compounds exhibited potent activity against jak2. especially, compound 16c was identified as a suitable lead compound, which showed favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in rats (f = 73.57%), excellent in vitro efficacy against erythroleukemic cells (tf-1, ic50 = 0.14 mu m), and high selectivity for jak2 (ic50 = 6 nm with >97-fold selectivity vs jak3).

hypothyroidism	pregnancy sickness is widespread yet its etiology is poorly understood. it is almost certainly endocrine in origin and most likely a product of placental hormones, with human chorionic gonadotropin being the strongest candidate. it has long been known that greater levels of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are associated with a lower incidence of spontaneous abortion, yet the causal mechanisms remain unclear. one current popular explanation is that nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is fetoprotective, inducing aversions to foods, especially meat, dairy and seafoods, which may carry toxins, pathogens or mutagens. however, most spontaneous abortions arise from genetic or epigenetic defects that are present at or near conception. moreover, measurements of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) at the time of implantation, particularly its hyperglycosylated isoform, accurately predict subsequent spontaneous abortion. thus the developmental fate of most embryos is fixed before the onset of the symptoms of pregnancy sickness. an alternative explanation for the link between pregnancy sicicness and spontaneous abortion is the embryo quality hypothesis: high quality embryos are both more likely to produce the biochemical antecedents of pregnancy sickness and avoid spontaneous abortion. recent work has shown that the link between pregnancy sickness and spontaneous abortion grows stronger with maternal age, dramatically so in mothers 35 or older. this reflects the parallel rise in the incidence of autosomal aneuploidies with maternal age. the link between pregnancy sickness and spontaneous abortion exists not because nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is fetoprotective, but because nausea and vomiting is an index of a high quality embryo. pregnancy sickness is not adaptive per se, but the result of an antagonistic pleiotropy over thyroid function, where embryos use hcg to modulate maternal thyroid hormone production during gestation. embryos benefit from the thyroid hormone production that is key to neurodevelopment, but produce maternal nausea and vomiting as a by-product. pregnancy sickness, however, may still serve to protect embryo quality but by a different mechanism that posited under the meph. embryo quality is protected by calibrating the dietary intake of a micronutrient - iodine - critical to neuromotor development. for most humans over most of our evolutionary history, iodine has been in short supply, and iodine deficiency is still the most common source of cognitive impairment across the globe. thus it is of interest that the food aversions most commonly associated with pregnancy sickness, to meat, dairy and seafoods, are also the chief dietary sources of iodine. there is a further intriguing property about iodine: both too little and too much during early pregnancy are damaging to embryo brain development. given that pregnancy sickness is closely linked to iodine intake and thyroid function (hypothyroidism is associated with lower levels of nausea and vomiting, hyperthyroidism with more), an obvious interpretation emerges. the previously described link between diet and pregnancy sickness - pregnancy sickness is less likely when plants and particularly corn/maize are the sole food staples - arises not because plant food staples are safe, as previously suggested, but because these foods are iodine poor and may, in addition, be goitrogenic. pregnancy sickness, which reduces the dietary intake of iodine, is clearly maladaptive under conditions of iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism. conversely, higher levels of pregnancy sickness induced by hyperthyroidism may protect embryos from the inimical effects of excessive dietary iodine during early gestation by reducing the intake of iodine rich foods.

allergies	glycosylation of many proteins has been revealed to be closely related with food allergies, and screening and structural analysis of related glycoproteins and glycoallergens are essential for studies in this field. herein, we describe detailed n-glycoform analysis of all glycoprotein fractions of soybean protein isolate (spi) separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) to disclose structural features of the glycan moieties of more soybean glycoproteins. spi was fractionated by sds-page, and the generated protein bands were recovered and subjected to in-gel n-glycan release and labeling using a one-pot method newly developed by our group, followed by detailed analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) and online hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (hilic-esi-ms/ms). as a result, we found seven bands mainly containing oligomannose-type glycans; two mainly contain core alpha 1,3-facosylated glycans, and six have no glycans. this study is the first report that discovers core alpha 1,3-fucosylated n-glycans in bands 1, 2, and 6 and discloses bands 3, 4, 5, and 7 as glycoproteins and their n-glycoforms. therefore, it can expand our knowledge about soybean protein glycosylation and provide significant structural reference for research of soybean allergens.
diabetes	metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes are nowadays regarded as diseases affecting majority of population. these diseases develop gradually over time in an individual. recently, systematic experiments tracking disease progression are conducted giving a high-throughput complex data. there is a pressing need for developing methods to analyze this complex data to capture the disease mechanism at molecular level. diseases usually develop through perturbations of biological processes in an organism. in this study, we have tried to capture the interlinking between different biological processes that work together to regulate the disease phenotype. here, we have considered a temporal microarray data from an experiment conducted to study obesity and diabetes in mice. we have analyzed the data to obtain perturbed biological processes and developed methods to establish link between these perturbed biological processes. we have derived a mathematical formula to score genes and identified a significant set of genes regulating such a complex process network. the methods developed in our study are also applicable to a broad array of data types.
low_testosterone	purpose of review to update the healthcare providers on the potential contribution of increased basal metabolic rate, hypermetabolism, and low testosterone in the development of weight loss in cancer patients. recent findings cancer cachexia, the loss of skeletal muscle with or without the loss of fat, is a multifactorial syndrome. a wide variation in the frequency of hypermetabolism exists in cancer patients and can only be accurately identified by an indirect calorimeter. the frequency of hypermetabolism increases depending on the histology and stage of tumor, associated with the presence of an acute inflammatory response, and is often accompanied by weight loss. hypogonadism, as a result of chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or the use of opioids to treat chronic pain, is frequently noted in male cancer patients and has been reported to be also associated with anorexia and weight loss. summary cancer patients may develop weight loss, cachexia, which can be distressing for both patients and their family. treatments directed at reducing the basal metabolic rate and supplementation of testosterone in hypogonadic male patients may have the potential to improve lean body mass, but more research is needed.
menopause	premature ovarian failure (pof) is a kind of gynecological disease that causes amenorrhea, infertility, menopause and urogenital symptoms. currently hormone replacement therapy (hrt) is the most popular choice for women with pof to get rid of menopausal syndrome. however, as the popularization of chinese herbs made chinese medicine (cm) shine new lights, physicians are able to treat pof with both meno-herbs and integrated therapy. hrt has its own indications and contraindications. for example, unexplained vaginal bleeding, acute liver damage, liver dysfunction, vascular embolization, and breast cancer are all contraindications of hrt, and cm is taken by more physicians as an adjuvant therapy. this review, including a range of common chinese herbs and formulations according to the existing literature, provides a general description of cm treating pof from the aspects of mechanisms and clinical application. it also highlights acupuncture as a unique physiotherapy for pof. although the validity of cm has been supported by the evidence of many preclinical trials, clinical trials and meta-analysis, the adverse events with cm therapy still exist and no guarantee has been made for its safety. this review concludes the updated information for cm treating pof contributing to further studies.
sports_injuries	the ankle rearfoot complex consists of the ankle and subtalar joints. this is an observational study on two test conditions of the rearfoot complex. using high-speed biplane fluoroscopy, we present a method to measure rearfoot kinematics during normal gait and compare rearfoot kinematics between barefoot and shod gait. six male subjects completed a walking trial while biplane fluoroscopy images were acquired during stance phase. bone models of the calcaneus and tibia were reconstructed from computed tomography images and aligned with the biplane fluoroscopy images. an optimization algorithm was used to determine the three-dimensional position of the bones and calculate rearfoot kinematics. peak plantarflexion was higher (barefoot: 9.1a degrees; 95 % ci 5.2:13.0; shod: 5.7a degrees; 95 % ci 3.6:7.8; p = 0.015) and neutral plantar/dorsiflexion occurred later in the stance phase (barefoot: 31.1 %; 95 % ci 23.6:38.6; shod: 17.7 %; 95 % ci 14.4:21.0; p = 0.019) during barefoot walking compared to shod walking. an eversion peak of 8.7a degrees (95 % ci 1.9:15.5) occurred at 27.8 % (95 % ci 18.4:37.2) of stance during barefoot walking, while during shod walking a brief inversion to 1.2a degrees (95 % ci -2.1:4.5; p = 0.021) occurred earlier (11.5 % of stance; 95 % ci 0.2:22.8; p = 0.008) during stance phase. the tibia was internally rotated relative to the calcaneus throughout stance phase in both conditions (barefoot: 5.1a degrees (95 % ci -1.4:11.6); shod: 3.6a degrees (95 % ci -0.4:7.6); ns.). biplane fluoroscopy can allow for detailed quantification of dynamic in vivo ankle kinematics during barefoot and shod walking conditions. this methodology could be used in the future to study hindfoot pathology after trauma, for congenital disease and after sports injuries such as instability. ii.
parkinson's_disease	while hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity) has been suggested to contribute to the increased prevalence of clinical pain in parkinson 's disease (pd), experimental research is equivocal and mechanisms are poorly understood. we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing pd patients to healthy controls (hcs) in their response to experimental pain stimuli. articles were acquired through systematic searches of major databases from inception until 10/2016. twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 1292 participants (pd = 739, hcs =553). random effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (smd) revealed lower pain threshold (indicating hyperalgesia) in pd patients during unmedicated off states (smd = 0.51) which was attenuated during dopamine-medicated on states (smd = 0.23), but unaffected by age, pd duration or pd severity. analysis of 6 studies employing suprathreshold stimulation paradigms indicated greater pain in pd patients, just failing to reach significance (smd = 0.30, p= 0.06). these findings (a) support the existence of hyperalgesia in pd, which could contribute to the onset/intensity of clinical pain, and (b) implicate dopamine deficiency as a potential underlying mechanism, which may present opportunities for the development of novel analgesic strategies.

menopause	western societies glorify youth and consider middle age as the onset of deterioration. the prevalent discourses on middle-aged women focus primarily on negative developments in their lives such as increased health risks after menopause. little is known, however, about the lived experiences of this age group. in this article, we share information about the health- and ageing-related attitudes of women aged 45-55 years who took part in a physical activity intervention in denmark. drawing on foucault 's concepts of disciplinary power and governmentality, we explored via 15 semi-structured interviews the women 's reasons for participation and their experiences with playing a team game. the interviews revealed that they had internalized the messages of healthy ageing' and felt guilty about their previous inactive lifestyle. however, their participation was also influenced by changing life circumstances. now they had time to exercise and, contrary to previous experiences, they found that playing games provided pleasure.
alzheimer's_disease	early neuropathological changes characteristic of late-onset alzheimer 's disease (load) involve brain stem and limbic structures that regulate neurovegetative functions, including sleep-wake rhythm. indeed, sleep pattern is an emerging biomarker and a potential pathophysiological mechanism in load. we hypothesized that cognitively asymptomatic, middle-aged offspring of patients with load (o-load) would display a series of circadian rhythm abnormalities prior to the onset of objective cognitive alterations. we tested 31 children of patients with load (o-load) and 19 healthy individuals without family history of alzheimer 's disease (control subjects, cs) with basic tests of cognitive function, as well as actigraphy measures of sleep-wake rhythm, cardiac autonomic function, and bodily temperature. unexpectedly, o-load displayed subtle but significant deficits in verbal episodic memory (rey auditory verbal learning test delayed recall 10.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.6, t = 4.97, df = 49, p < 0.01) and language (weschler 's vocabulary 51.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 44.3 +/- 1.5, t = 2.49, df = 49, p < 0.001) compared to cs, even though all participants had results within the clinically normal range. o-load showed a phase-delayed rhythm of body temperature (2.56 +/- 0.47 h vs. 3.8 +/- 0.26 h, t = 2.48, df = 40, p = 0.031). cognitive performance in o-load was associated with a series of cardiac autonomic sleep-wake variables; specifically indicators of greater sympathetic activity at night were related to poorer cognition. the present results suggest sleep pattern deserves further study as a potential neurobiological signature in load, even in middle-aged, at risk individuals.
birth_control	background: abortion in iran, like other islamic countries is severely restricted except in a few exceptions. however, some women who have an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy are seeking abortion. objectives: this study aimed to compare the contraceptive use and its related factors among repeat and first-time induced abortion seekers in iran. patients and methods: in this cross-sectional study, 417 married women (age range, 15-49 years) seeking abortion services at either a hospital or private office in maku city, the northwest of iran, were selected through convenience sampling between december 2010 and march 2011. all the subjects were asked about the contraceptive methods used during the three months before the current pregnancy and the use of any emergency contraception and forced sex. women who mentioned reasons except than completing family size for their applying for abortion were excluded from the analysis. characteristics of women were examined using chi-square and t test. t test and mann-whitney u test were used to compare contraceptive methods and the regularity of contraceptive use between repeat and first-time abortion seekers, respectively. results: about 33.8% of the repeat abortion-seekers and 76.8% of first-time abortion seekers were using male methods (withdrawal and condom). utilization of an intrauterine device for birth control was higher among women seeking repeat abortion than in first-time abortion seekers (p = 0.003). all of 31 pill users in the repeat abortion-seeking group missed three or more pills per month for three times during the three months before contraception. the repeat abortion seekers had used condom more regularly than those in the first-time abortion seekers. forced sex was more prevalent in the abortion seekers who had used male method. conclusions: using male methods are prevalent in abortion-seeker women. an increased focus is needed on training the regular use of pills and using the emergency contraception for all of the couples who are first-time abortion-seekers. moreover, information about the role of forced sex might be efficacious in decreasing illegally induced repeat abortion in couples who use condom or withdrawal methods.
overactive_bladder	to assess changes in the health status of men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (luts/bph) using the eq-5d-3l and oab-5d instruments and to evaluate the sensitivity of the instruments. data were available from a large randomised phase iii trial of men with moderate-to-severe storage and voiding luts/bph (neptune). men received a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin 6 mg plus oral controlled absorption system (ocas (tm)) formulation of tamsulosin (tocas, 0.4 mg), tocas monotherapy or placebo and completed the eq-5d-3l and oab-5d at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12. analysis of covariance was used to estimate changes in eq-5d-3l index, eq-vas and oab-5d. changes in dimension level were summarised using the paretian classification of health change (pchc). improved health-related quality of life from baseline was seen in all treatment arms on eq-5d-3l and oab-5d at week 12, although only oab-5d showed statistically significant differences between active treatment and placebo, both on the index score and using the pchc approach. effect sizes in the active treatment groups were large (>0.8) on oab-5d but small (ae0.2) on eq-5d-3l. eq-5d-3l showed a very high ceiling effect (45% of men reported full health at baseline) and a substantial proportion of these men reported improvements at week 12 in several dimensions of oab-5d. a large ceiling effect on eq-5d-3l substantially limited its sensitivity in this population. oab-5d proved more sensitive to changes in health status and could be considered a complement to ed-5d-3l as a source of utilities for health economic modelling.
fungal_infection	cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by cryptococcus spp. that enters the body via inhalation. this ubiquitous yeast has gained notoriety as an opportunistic pathogen in the immunosuppressed population. the authors report a case of a previously-well adult male presented with left-sided weakness. imaging demonstrated a pulmonary mass and 2 contrast-enhancing intracranial lesions all features suggestive of a primary lung carcinoma with brain metastases. however, further investigations confirmed disseminated cryptococcosis, without evidence of malignancy. the patient was successfully treated with a course of antifungals. to the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of dissemintated cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent adult male, simulating as primary lung carcinoma with brain metastases.

hepatitis_c	yellow fever virus (yfv) replication is highly dependent on host cell factors. yfv ns4b is reported to be involved in viral replication and immune evasion. here interactions between ns4b and human proteins were determined using a gst pull-down assay and analyzed using 1-de and lc-ms/ms. we present a total of 207 proteins confirmed using scaffold 3 software. cyclophilin a (cypa), a protein that has been shown to be necessary for the positive regulation of flavivirus replication, was identified as a possible ns4b partner. 59 proteins were found to be significantly increased when compared with a negative control, and cypa exhibited the greatest difference, with a 22-fold change. fisher 's exact test was significant for 58 proteins, and the p value of cypa was the most significant (0.000000019). the ingenuity systems software identified 16 pathways, and this analysis indicated sirolimus, an mtor pathway inhibitor, as a potential inhibitor of cypa. immunofluorescence and viral plaque assays showed a significant reduction in yfv replication using sirolimus and cyclosporine a (csa) as inhibitors. furthermore, yfv replication was strongly inhibited in treated with both inhibitors using reporter bhk-21-rep-yfv17dlucneolres cells. taken together, these data suggest that cypa-ns4b interaction regulates yfv replication. finally, we present the first evidence that yfv inhibition may depend on ns4b-cypa interaction.
alzheimer's_disease	mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathological mechanism of alzheimer 's disease (ad). amyloid beta-protein (a beta), which plays a central role in ad pathogenesis, is reported to accumulate within mitochondria. however, a question remains as to whether a beta is generated locally from amyloid precursor protein (app) within mitochondria. we investigated this issue by analyzing the expression patterns of app, app-processing secretases, and app metabolites in mitochondria separated from human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells and those expressing swedish mutant apr app, bace1, and pen-2 protein levels were significantly lower in crude mitochondria than microsome fractions while those of adam10 and the other gamma-secretase complex components (presenilin 1, nicastrin, and aph-1) were comparable between fractions. the crude mitochondrial fraction containing substantial levels of cathepsin d, a lysosomal marker, was further separated via iodixanol gradient centrifugation to obtain mitochondria- and lysosome-enriched fractions. mature app, bace1, and all gamma-secretase complex components (in particular, presenilin 1 and pen -2) were scarcely present in the mitochondria-enriched fraction, compared to the lysosome-enriched fraction. moreover, expression of the beta-c-terminal fragment (beta-ctf) of app was markedly low in the mitochondria-enriched fraction. additionally, immunocytochemical analysis showed very little co-localization between presenilin 1 and tom20, a marker protein of mitochondria. in view of the particularly low expression levels of bace1, gamma-secretase complex proteins, and beta-ctf in mitochondria, we propose that it is unlikely that a beta generation from app occurs locally within this organelle.

hypothyroidism	background: early and accurate prediction of outcome in acute stroke is important. the aim of this prospective study was to explore the correlation between serum triiodothyronine level and prognosis in acute ischemic stroke patients. methods: a prospective observational study which included 359 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke from december 2014 to november 2015 was interrogated. serum triiodothyronine (t-3) concentrations were measured on admission to understand their value in predicting functional outcome within 90 d using multivariable models adjusted for confounding factors. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were calculated to define the best cut-off value of triiodothyronine to predict outcome. the accuracy of the test was assessed measuring the area under the roc curve (auroc). results: triiodothyronine was significantly decreased in patients with an unfavorable functional outcome as compared to patients with a favorable functional outcome within 90 d (p = 0.01). binary logistic regression analyses revealed that lower triiodothyronine concentrations on admission were associated with a risk for poor outcomes (or 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.25; p < 0.01). in addition, in roc curve analysis, triiodothyronine may improve the national institutes of health stroke scale (nihss) score in predicting functional outcome. the combined model auroc was 0.84 for 30 d and 0.91 for 90 d, which were both significantly higher than the aurocs of original nihss (0.83 and 0.87), triiodothyronine (0.64 and 0.69) and age (0.57 and 0.68) (all p < 0.05). conclusions: low serum triiodothyronine levels can be a predictive marker of short-term outcome after ischemic stroke. a combined model (triiodothyronine, age and nihss score) can add significant additional predictive information to the clinical score of the nihss.
hypothyroidism	background: associations between vitiligo and thyroid diseases have been reported repeatedly. objective: we investigated the associations between vitiligo and overt autoimmune thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer using the korean national health insurance claims database. methods: we defined patients with vitiligo as those whose records showed >= 4 physician contacts between 2009 and 2013 in which vitiligo was the principal diagnosis. we also established an age-and sex-matched control group without vitiligo (2 per 1 vitiligo patient). the outcomes of interest were concurrent graves disease and hashimoto thyroiditis (the patients were taking relevant thyroid medications) and thyroid cancer. results: the study enrolled 73,336 vitiligo patients and 146,672 controls. patients with vitiligo were at increased risks of graves disease (odds ratio [or] 2.610 [95% confidence interval {ci} 2.319-02.938]), hashimoto thyroiditis (or 1.609 [95% ci 1.437-1.802]), and thyroid cancer (or 1.127 [ 95% ci 1.022-1.242]), compared with the controls. the associations were consistently stronger in males and younger patients. limitations: individual clinical information was not available, and the homogeneous population may limit the generalizability of the results. conclusion: vitiligo was significantly associated with overt autoimmune thyroid diseases and overt thyroid cancer.
sprains_and_strains	objectives: to characterize the types and external causes of pediatric injury-related visits (irvs) to emergency departments (eds), in particular, sports-related injuries. to compare the characteristics of children with irvs with those with non-irvs, specifically, differences in irv rates by race and ethnicity and by health insurance. methods: this was a stratified random-sample survey of eds in the national hospital ambulatory medical care survey (nhamcs), including all irvs for patients less than 19 years of age in 1998 (n = 2,656). national estimates of pediatric irvs were obtained using the assigned patient visit weights in the nhamcs databases and sudaan analyses. measures of association between predictor variables (patient and health insurance characteristics) and whether a child had an irv were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. results: pediatric irvs accounted for more than 11 million ed visits annually. the most common diagnoses for irvs were open wounds, contusions, sprains and strains, and fractures and dislocations. the leading external causes of irvs were sports-related injuries, accidental falls, being struck by objects, and motor vehicle collisions. children with irvs differed from those who presented for non-irvs in many characteristics: they were more likely to be male, to be older, to be of white race, and to have private insurance, and less likely to be of asian or hispanic ethnicity. conclusions: sports and recreation are the leading external causes of pediatric irvs to eds in the united states. there are different patterns of irvs according to gender, age, race, ethnicity, and insurance. identification of specific patterns of injury is necessary for the design of effective prevention strategies.
menopause	objectives: our aim was to explore the experiences of iranian postmenopausal women who sought medical help for their symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (vva). methods: five focus group discussions (fgds) were conducted. participants had to be postmenopausal; had bothersome symptoms of vva for which they came to the clinic; had previously sought medical help for their vva; and had confirmed physical signs of vva upon examination by a gynecologist. results: twenty-five women, aged 49-60 years participated in the five fgds. twenty women said they currently had >1 vva symptom at presentation to the clinic. four major themes emerged from the women 's narrative stories: (1) negative impact of vva on women 's life, (2) psychological distress associated with vva, (3) negative impact of vva on marriage and relationship, (4) inadequate symptom relief from available treatments due to lack of awareness of vva treatment options. none of the participants reported ongoing treatment of their vva with local low-dose estrogen. women further commented that, although local estrogen products were costly, they would like to use them if they were prescribed. conclusions: considering the negative impact of vva symptoms on women 's lives, health professionals in iran should be prescribing approved and effective therapies for symptomatic women.
skin_care	objectives: to assess the provision and need of dermatologic care among dutch nursing home patients and to obtain recommendations for improvement. design: cross-sectional nationwide survey. setting: all 173 nursing home organizations in the netherlands. participants: physicians working in nursing homes. measurements: web-based questionnaire concerning the burden of skin diseases in nursing home patients, diagnostic procedures and therapy, collaboration with dermatologists, physicians' level of education, and suggestions for improvement. results: a total of 126 (72.8%) nursing home organizations, with 1133 associated physicians participated in our study and received the questionnaire. a total of 347 physicians (30.6%) completed the questionnaire. almost all respondents (99.4%) were recently confronted with skin diseases, mostly (pressure) ulcers, eczema, and fungal infections. diagnostic and treatment options were limited because of a lack of availability and experience of the physicians. more live consultation of dermatologists was suggested as being important to improve dermatologic care. other suggestions were better education, more usage of telemedicine applications, and better availability of diagnostic and/or treatment procedures like cryotherapy. conclusion: physicians in nursing homes are frequently confronted with skin diseases. several changes in organization of care and education are expected to improve dermatologic care in nursing home patients.

weight_loss	there is increasing awareness of the detrimental health impact of frailty on older adults and of the high prevalence of malnutrition in this segment of the population. experts in these 2 arenas need to be cognizant of the overlap in constructs, diagnosis, and treatment of frailty and malnutrition. there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of malnutrition and how it should be assessed. while there is consensus on the definition of frailty, there is no agreement on how it should be measured. separate assessment tools exist for both malnutrition and frailty; however, there is intersection between concepts and measures. this narrative review highlights some of the intersections within these screening/assessment tools, including weight loss/decreased body mass, functional capacity, and weakness (handgrip strength). the potential for identification of a minimal set of objective measures to identify, or at least consider risk for both conditions, is proposed. frailty and malnutrition have also been shown to result in similar negative health outcomes and consequently common treatment strategies have been studied, including oral nutritional supplements. while many of the outcomes of treatment relate to both concepts of frailty and malnutrition, research questions are typically focused on the frailty concept, leading to possible gaps or missed opportunities in understanding the effect of complementary interventions on malnutrition. a better understanding of how these conditions overlap may improve treatment strategies for frail, malnourished, older adults.
parenting	parental (parent-to-infant) attachment and parenting alliance are defined as two important components of psychoaffective adjustment to the parental role. this study aimed to build a predictive model of parental attachment and parenting alliance for mothers and fathers using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. specifically, we were interested in assessing how adult romantic attachment, marital quality, and psychological distress influenced parental attachment (parent-to-infant) and parenting alliance. forty heterosexual couples completed questionnaires during the third trimester of pregnancy and 2 months after childbirth. results showed that adult romantic attachment, marital quality, and psychological distress were important antenatal determinants of parental attachment and parenting alliance, although they behaved differently for mothers and fathers. hence, different predictive models were therefore proposed for mothers and fathers. mothers' attachment to the child was influenced by internal factors as adult attachment dimensions; for fathers, it also depended on mothers' antenatal attachment to the child and on marital quality. concerning parenting alliance, both mothers and fathers depended on own and partner 's variables. antenatal variables are important for what occurs during the transition to parenthood in terms of parenting adjustment and act differently for mothers and fathers. it thus is important to assess the psychological functioning of both mothers and fathers.
hypothyroidism	objective: lactating women and their infants are susceptible to iodine deficiency and iodine excess. in south africa, no data exist on the iodine status and thyroid function of these vulnerable groups. methods: in a cross-sectional study, urinary iodine concentrations (uic), thyroid function, and breast-milk iodine concentrations (bmic) were assessed in 100 lactating women from a south african township and their 2-4-month-old breastfed infants. potential predictors of uic, thyroid function, and bmic, including household salt iodine concentrations (sic) and maternal sodium excretion, were also investigated. results: the median (25th-75th percentile) uic was 373 (202-627) mu g/l in infants and 118 (67-179) mu g/l in mothers. median household sic was 44 (27-63) ppm. household sic and maternal urinary sodium excretion predicted uic of lactating mothers. median bmic was 179 (126-269) mu g/l. age of infants, sic, and maternal uic predicted bmic. in turn, infant age and bmic predicted uic of infants. forty-two percent of sic values were within the south african recommended salt iodine fortification level at production of 35-65 ppm, whilst 21% of sic were >65 ppm. thyroid-stimulating hormone, total thyroxine, and thyroglobulin concentrations in the dried whole blood spot specimens from the infants were 1.3 (0.8-1.9) mu/l, 128 +/- 33 mmol/l, and 77.1 (56.3-105.7) mu g/l, respectively, and did not correlate with infant uic or bmic. conclusion: our results suggest that the salt fortification program in south africa provides adequate iodine to lactating women and indirectly to their infants via breast milk. however, monitoring of salt iodine content of the mandatory salt iodization program in south africa is important to avoid over-iodization of salt.
low_testosterone	objectives: although there is consensus that sex hormones modulate memory, we have an incomplete understanding of their role in remembering and forgetting. humans continuously update memory, forgetting old, out-of-date information and encoding new, more relevant information. updating processes can be studied with the list method of directed forgetting. methods: in the list method of directed forgetting task, subjects study two lists of items and, after study of list 1, are asked to either forget or remember the list for an upcoming memory test. free testosterone level was quantified from saliva samples. directed forgetting and saliva testosterone were evaluated in young men (aged between 18 and 28 years). results: following a forget cue, recall of list-1 items was reduced and recall of list-2 items was enhanced. however, only recall of list-2 items was associated with free testosterone level. following a forget cue, participants with low testosterone levels showed higher recall of list-2 items than participants with high testosterone levels. conclusion: the selective association between testosterone level and list-2 recall is consistent with two-mechanism accounts of memory updating, where the forgetting effect is due to impaired retrieval and the enhancement effect to improved encoding. on the basis of this view, the present results indicate that low testosterone levels are associated with improved binding of the newly encoded memories to their context cue.
hepatitis_c	enterovirus 71 (ev71) is one of the major etiological agents of human hand-foot-and-mouth disease (hfmd) worldwide. ev71 infection in young children and people with immunodeficiency causes severe symptoms with a high fatality rates. however, there is still no approved drugs to treat such infections. based on our previous report of a peptide-aldehyde anti-ev71 protease, we present here a highly specific a-hydroxy-nitrile derivative nk-1.9k, which inhibited the proliferation of multiple ev71 strains and coxsackievirus a16 (cva16) in various cells with ec50 of 37.0 nm with low cytotoxicity (cc50 >200 mu m). the hydroxy-nitrile covalent warhead conferred nk-1.9k high potency and selectivity to interact with the cysteine residue of the active site of the viral protease. we also documented the resistance to nk-1.9k with a n69s mutation in ev71 3c(pro). the combination of nk-1.9k and ev71 polymerase or entry inhibitors produced strong synergistic antiviral effects. collectively, our findings suggest our compounds can potentially be developed as drugs for the treatment of hfmd.

cancer	cancer stem cells (cscs) or tumor-initiating cells (tics) as a small subset of neoplastic cells are able to produce a tumor (tumorigenesis), maintain the population of tumorigenic cells (self-renewal), and generate the heterogeneous cells constructing the entire tumor (pluripotency). the research on stationary and circulating cscs due to resistance to conventional therapies and inability in complete eradication of cancer is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies for a more effective reduction in the risk of tumor metastasis and cancer recurrence. this review compiles information about different methods of detection and dissociation, side population, cellular markers, and establishment culture of cscs, as well as characteristics of cscs such as tumorigenicity, and signaling pathways associated with self-renewal and the capability of the same histological tumor regeneration in various cancers.
hepatitis_c	hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is a common and fatal malignancy of the liver. sorafenib is a small molecule multikinase inhibitor that acts against different cancer cell lines and is used for the treatment of hcc. however, some advanced hcc patients fail to respond to sorafenib, and those who do lack a meaningful clinical benefit. interferon-lambda 3 (ifn-lambda 3) is a type iii interferon with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory functions. here, we evaluated the use of ifn-l3 as an adjuvant treatment with sorafenib in hcc. in the present study, cck-8 and colony formation assay results showed that treatment with a combination of ifn-l3 and sorafenib suppresses the viability of hepg2 and smmc7721 liver cancer cell lines more than treatment with either alone. in addition, flow cytometry results confirmed that treatment with a combination of ifn-l3 and sorafenib promotes the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and induces the production of ros more than treatment with either alone. furthermore, using a subcutaneous smmc7721 tumor model, treatment with a combination of ifn-l3 and sorafenib significantly reduced the tumor growth/volume and induced apoptosis compared to treatment with sorafenib alone. these results show that combined treatment with ifn-l3 and sorafenib facilitates a synergistic effect on suppressing hcc cancer growth and promoting cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. thus, ifn-l3 in combination with sorafenib might prove to be a useful adjunctive strategy for the clinical treatment of hcc.

alzheimer's_disease	obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway. the prevalence of this disorder is strictly dependent on its gravity. at >= 15 events/h apnea-hypopnea index (ahi), it ranges from 6 to 17% in the general population, with higher rates in men and increasing with age. the hypoxia induced by osa severely affects the structure and function of blood vessels, culminating in mortality and morbidity. its negative impact influences also cognitive functioning. recent papers showed the relationship between osa and some neurological disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, epilepsy, and headache. osa may accelerate the onset of mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer 's disease (ad) and might also represent an independent risk factor for parkinson 's disease (pd). osa is also frequent in multisystem atrophy. in the early stages of ad, continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) treatment might slow down the progression of the disease, thus highlighting the potential importance of osa screening and a timely intervention in these patients. moreover, cpap is effective in reducing daytime sleepiness in pd. osa may induce seizures by means of sleep disruption and deprivation, as well as cerebral hypoxemia with consequent oxidative stress. it has been demonstrated that cpap treatment is efficacious in controlling epileptic seizures. osa can represent a risk factor for stroke and death, mainly related to the endothelial dysfunction, with the formation of atherosclerosis caused by hypoxia through oxidative stress. cpap treatment in patients with osa and stroke, if delivered in the early stages, is able to increase the magnitude of neurologic improvement after the vascular accident. there is a strong association between osa and headache. in particular, there is a ""sleep apnea headache"" described as a recurrent morning headache, with resolution after effective treatment of sleep apnea. this review clearly shows the importance of taking asleep history in neurological patients and considering the diagnosis and specific treatment of osa in these patients.
hypothyroidism	background: infants <32 weeks' gestation should not be exposed to topical iodine and its avoidance is recommended during pregnancy and breast feeding. exposure to contrast media and topical iodine is frequently used in many preterm neonates. aim: to determine whether thyrotropin levels in preterm infants are affected by exposure to intrapartum/neonatal topical iodine and/or the use of iodinated contrast media. design: infants <32 weeks' gestation were recruited. maternal and neonatal exposures to iodinated contrast media and topical iodine were recorded; levels of thyrotropin and thyroxine were measured from blood-spot cards on postnatal days 7, 14, 28 and the equivalent of 36 weeks' gestation. results: one hundred and twenty-five infants were exposed to topical iodine/contrast media and 48 infants were unexposed. no infants were treated for hypothyroidism; three infants (exposed group) had transient hyperthyro-tropinaemia. mean thyrotropin levels were significantly higher on postnatal days 7, 14 and 28 in infants exposed to topical iodine prior to caesarean section compared to unexposed infants, a relationship which persisted after adjustment. conclusions: in the context of this study, neonatal thyroid dysfunction was seen following exposure to iodine via caesarean section but not via exposure to contrast media.
headache	objectivesthe safety, painless, and tolerability features of transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) have prompted the research on the therapeutic effects of this technique in stroke; however, an in-depth and unarguable examination of the adverse effects of tdcs in stroke patients is still lacking. this review analyzes the reported adverse effects in stroke, looking for factors that may induce side-effects. materials and methodsa comprehensive search of articles published from 1998 to 2015 describing tdcs application in stroke patients performed through data extraction from medline/pubmed database. resultsonly 11.62% of published papers reported the occurrence of tdcs adverse effects in stroke patients. the most common was itching (70%), followed by burning sensation (40%), headache (40%), tingling (30%), sleepiness (20%), difficulty of concentration, mild fatigue, skin redness, and dizziness (10%). no significant difference was found between studies reporting vs. non-reporting adverse effects regarding tdcs parameters (intensity, current density, duration of stimulation, and number of sessions). conclusionin the majority of stroke patients, tdcs did not induce any severe adverse effect. regrettably, many published papers did not provide a careful description of exclusion criteria, nor a systematic report of side effects. our work emphasizes the need of a more meticulous description of the adopted exclusion criteria and of the induced adverse effects, in order to optimize the therapeutic use of tdcs and to better delineate its safety parameters in stroke.
multiple_sclerosis	toxoplasma gondii is a pathogen relevant to psychiatric disorders. we recently showed that reactivation of chronic t. gondii infection induced depression-like behaviors in mice. furthermore, it has been hypothesized that depression-like behaviors are mediated via a host defense mechanism against invading pathogens; proximate mechanisms of this behavioral hypothesis remain unclear. in the present study, we investigate the contribution of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido), inflammation, and interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) to anhedonic and despair-related behaviors in t. gondii-infected mice by using sucrose preference and forced-swim tests, respectively. first, we confirmed that balb/c mice exhibited both sickness and depression-like behaviors during acute infection. treatment of infected wild-type mice with minocycline (anti-inflammatory drug) abated sickness and anhedonic and despair-like behaviors, whereas in t. gondii-infected mice, treatment normalized kynurenine/tryptophan (kyn/trp) ratios in both plasma and brain tissue. additionally, t. gondii infection failed to induce anhedonic and despair-like behaviors or increase the kyn/trp ratio in immunocompromised (ifn-gamma(-/-)) mice, whereas sickness behavior was observed in both immunocompetent and ifn-gamma(-/-) mice following infection. furthermore, treatment with 1-methyl tryptophan (an ido inhibitor) did not affect locomotor activity, attenuated clinical scores and anhedonic and despair-like behaviors, and resulted in normal kyn/trp ratios in t. gondii-infected wild-type mice. although low levels of serotonin and dopamine were observed in the brain during acute and chronic infections, anhedonic and despair-like behaviors were not detected in the chronic stage of infection. collectively, our results demonstrated that immune enhancement in response to infection with t. gondii resulted in ifn-gamma production, ido activation, and inflammation associated with anhedonic and despair-like behaviors.
sports_injuries	introduction: trochanter minor fractures are generally seen between the ages of 13 and 17 years due to sports injuries, while the physis line is open. they are less frequently seen in adults than in adolescents. in this study, an old patient is presented who was admitted to the emergency department twice in one day because of hip pain, and a trochanter minor fracture was detected. case report: an 86-year-old male was brought to the emergency department with complaints of right hip pain and difficulty in walking. on the patient 's first radiologic examination, we could not determine any pathology or fracture, and he was allowed to go home with an analgesic, bed rest, and a proposal of outpatient control. about 18 h after discharge, the patient was readmitted to the emergency clinic. on the second radiologic examination, a displaced fracture of the trochanter minor of the right femur was detected. after preparing the patient for surgery, the trochanter minor was stabilized with a cable and plate system. conclusion: physicians must be more careful on the first examination of hip pain in the elderly and because secondary femoral neck fractures can occur in older patients without any underlying etiology, we suggest that prophylactic surgery must be a choice as the treatment strategy.
weight_loss	the vagal link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (cns) has numerous vital functions for maintaining homeostasis. the regulation of energy balance is one which is attracting more and more attention due to the potential for exploiting peripheral hormonal targets as treatments for conditions such as obesity. while physiologically, this system is well tuned and demonstrated to be effective in the regulation of both local function and promoting/terminating food intake the neural connection represents a susceptible pathway for disruption in various disease states. numerous studies have revealed that obesity in particularly is associated with an array of modifications in vagal afferent function from changes in expression of signaling molecules to altered activation mechanics. in general, these changes in vagal afferent function in obesity further promote food intake instead of the more desirable reduction in food intake. it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these detrimental effects before we can establish more effective pharmacotherapies or lifestyle strategies for the treatment of obesity and the maintenance of weight loss.
alzheimer's_disease	we previously demonstrated 2 statistically distinct factors of degeneration in alzheimer 's disease: one strongly related to white matter damage and age interpreted as""age-and vascular-related"", and the other related to cortical atrophy thought to represent""neurodegenerative changes associated with alzheimer 's disease"". those factors are now replicated in a distinct cross-sectional data set of 364 participants from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative and their interpretation is improved using correlations with csf biomarkers. furthermore, we now show that changes in both factors over 2 years are independently associated with decline in miniemental state examination score in a longitudinal subset of 116 individuals with mild cognitive impairment. progression in the""age-and vascularrelated"" factor was greater for individuals with 2 apoe epsilon 4 alleles and linked to a greater attributable change in miniemental state examination than the""neurodegenerative"" factor. these results suggest benefits of targeting white matter and vascular health to complement interventions focused on the neurodegenerative aspect of the disease, even in individuals with little discernable vascular comorbidity.

skin_care	healthcare associated infections (hcai) represent a major risk to patient safety. as 20-30% of these infections are preventable, the international ""save lives: clean your hands"" campaign is announced by the who annually on 5 may. hand hygiene and particularly hand disinfection is dependent on the time and the execution of the disinfection procedure as well as the efficacy of the substance used. alcohols represent valid and safe substances; however, adequate skin care must also be addressed. appropriate actions include preparing a skin and hand protection plan and if necessary performing an occupational health check (g24).
alzheimer's_disease	some norbenzomorphans exhibit high affinity for sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors, and varying the position of substituents on the aromatic ring of this scaffold has a significant effect on subtype selectivity. in particular, compounds bearing several different substituents at c7 of the norbenzomorphan ring system exhibit a general preference for the sigma 1 receptor, whereas the corresponding c8-substituted analogues preferentially bind at the sigma 2 receptor. these findings suggest that the norbenzomorphan scaffold may be a unique chemical template that can be easily tuned to prepare small molecules for use as tool compounds to study the specific biological effects arising from preferential binding at either sigma receptor subtype. in the absence of structural characterization data for the sigma 2 receptor, such compounds will be useful toward refining the pharmacophore model of its binding site.
emergency_contraception	objective: to determine the prevalence of repeat teenage pregnancy and the interval between first/most recent and repeat pregnancies, as well as to evaluate the sexual/reproductive health characteristics of teenagers with repeat pregnancies. methods: a prospective observational study was undertaken at a hospital in kwazulu-natal, south africa, between may and september 2013. teenagers aged 13-19 years who were pregnant, had recently delivered, or had terminated a pregnancy were enrolled. a questionnaire was used to obtain data. results: among 341 participants, 281 (82.4%) were seen for a first pregnancy and 60 (17.6%) for a repeat pregnancy. the interval between first/most recent and repeat pregnancies was 24 months or lower in 45 (75.0%) of repeat pregnancy participants. only 58 (17.0%) participants had previously used contraception (54[93.1%] of whom stopped within 12 months) and 28 (82%) had used emergency contraception. more participants with repeat pregnancy than with first pregnancy had a positive hiv status (18 [30.0%] vs 26 [9.3%]; p<0.001), more than one sexual partner in the past 12 months (21 [35.0%] vs 35 [12.5%]; p<0.001), and a partner at least 5 years older (38 [63.3%] vs 128 [45.6%]; p<0.001). conclusion: high repeat pregnancy rates, low contraception use, and high hiv prevalence among teenagers in south africa is worrying. focused interventions targeting teenagers following their first pregnancy need to be urgently implemented.

overactive_bladder	objective: the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the voiding dysfunction symptom score (vdss) in evaluation of children with nocturnal enuresis. materials and methods: four hundred children with nocturnal enuresis were included in the study. they were evaluated with vdss, physical examination, urinalysis and 2-day voiding diary. all children with nocturnal enuresis symptoms were treated with desmopressin and/or urotherapy. however, children with overactive bladder symptoms were also treated with anticholinergics. treatment success and change in vdss were compared and assessed between different treatment methods. results: two hundred forty-five children (61.25%) were male and 155 (38.75%) were female. the mean age was 7.6 +/- 3.0 years (range: 5-18). the mean vdss was 9.2 +/- 6.3. 35% of children with nocturnal enuresis had concomitant daytime symptoms. 126 children (31.5%) had a vdss of nine or above and majority of these children were treated with anticholinergic therapy. vdss questionnaire could not help determine treatment success in children with non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. however, children treated with urotherapy and desmopressine showed significant difference in vdsss according to their treatment response. conclusion: vdss has shown to decrease after treatment in children with mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis. the treatment strategies should be checked and modified if vdss does not decrease after proper therapy as this would increase the success of treatment.
skin_care	a 12-kda protein with redox-active dithiol in the active site -cys-gly-pro-cys-, human thioredoxin 1 (trx) has demonstrated an excellent anti-inflammatory effect in various animal models. trx is induced by various oxidative stress factors, including ultraviolet rays, radiation, oxidation, viral infections, ischemia reperfusion and anticancer agents, and are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases. we have demonstrated that systemic administration and transgenic overexpression of trx is effective in a wide variety of in vivo inflammatory disease models, such as viral pneumonia, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indomethacin-induced gastric injury, and dermatitis. our recent studies indicate that topically applied trx prevents skin inflammation via the inhibition of local formation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. these indicate that the activation of inflammasome in skin and mucosa may be regulated by trx. these suggest that application of trx may be useful for the treatment of various skin and mucosal inflammatory disorders. based on these results, we are conducting clinical studies to develop human recombinant thioredoxin 1 (rhtrx) pharmaceuticals. we have also developed substances that increase the expression of trx in the body (trx-inducing substances) in vegetables and other plant ingredients, and we are also developing skin-care products and functional foods that take advantage of the anti-inflammation and anti-allergic action of trx.

senior_health	objectives: to examine the extent of agreement between nursing home residents' (or their proxies') reports of pain presence and intensity as derived from an interview questionnaire and the minimum data set (mds) nearest to the interview date. design: cross-sectional comparison of the 2 data sources on pain measurements. setting: nursing homes included in evaluation projects of evercare program and minnesota senior health options. participants: nursing home residents (n = 3100) were grouped based on the type of respondent answering the interview questionnaire: resident, family proxy, or staff proxy. measurements: we used kappa statistics and multinomial logit regression to examine agreement between the interview questionnaire and the mds on pain presence and intensity. results: presence of pain was reported 1.3 to 1.8 times more often on the questionnaire, depending on the respondent group. agreement on the presence of pain was slight to fair (kappa = 0.17 to 0.28) between the mds and the questionnaire. there was slight agreement on pain intensity (kappa = 0.13 to 0.18). the family proxy respondent group showed the largest discrepancy between questionnaire and the mds in reporting of pain presence and intensity. the staff proxy respondent group had better agreement on pain intensity than did the other respondent groups, but it achieved only slight agreement (kappa = 0.18). conclusions: detecting and quantifying pain in nursing home residents is complex. pain information is best obtained directly from residents; observations should be standardized. the mds should be revised accordingly.
senior_health	the members of the independent and active baby boom generation entering their retirement years may put clinical nurse specialists (cns) in greater demand than ever before as educators, consultants, researchers, and case managers. community-based educational programming to promote health and to monitor and manage chronic health conditions of elders is a recognized method for the cns to meet these growing demands. the application and utilization of baltes and baltes' theoretical model of selective optimization with compensation (soc) in senior health programming holds promise for cnss to assume more integral roles in optimizing health promotion for and self-actualization in community-living elders. senior centers serve older adults who want to stay active, involved with others their age, and current, including learning how to promote their health. the cns can readily infuse the soc model into the planning and organizing of health programming for older adults at senior centers, which will in turn aid elders in maintaining independent functioning, autonomy, and quality of life. a detailed template for developing such theory-driven programming with an example program focused on nutrition is provided. finally, a variety of topics for additional soc-guided program development are presented.
overactive_bladder	objectives: this study aimed to investigate the effect of trospium chloride on cognitive function in postmenopausal women treated for overactive bladder (oab). methods: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted from april 2013 to april 2015. women aged 50 years or older seeking treatment for oab were randomized to either trospium chloride xr 60 mg daily or placebo. baseline cognitive function was assessed via hopkins verbal learning test-revised (hvlt-r), mini mental status exam, mini mental status x, digit span, trails a, trails b, and epworth sleepiness scale. cognitive function was reassessed at week 1 and week 4. a priori power analysis determined that 21 subjects were needed per group. results: although 59 women were enrolled and randomized (28 trospium and 31 placebo), 45 completed assessment (21 trospium and 24 placebo). mean age was 68 years, 78% were white, and 44% had previously taken oab medication. for the primary outcome, there was no difference in hvlt-r total score between trospium and placebo groups at week 4 (p = 0.29). there were also no differences based on the other cognitive tests. therewas a correlation between age and the following week-4 tests: hvlt-r total score (r = -0.3, p = 0.02), hvlt-r total recall subscale (r = -0.4, p = 0.007), trails a (r = 0.4, p = 0.002), and trails b (r = 0.4, p = 0.004). a linear regression model found that hvlt-r total score decreased by 0.372 points for each increased year of age. conclusions: in women aged 50 years and older, there were no changes in cognitive function between those taking trospium and placebo. cognitive function was correlated with age.
parkinson's_disease	research on parkinson 's disease (pd) and drug development is hampered by the lack of suitable human in vitro models that simply and accurately recreate the disease conditions. to counteract this, many attempts to differentiate cell lines, such as the human sh-sy5y neuroblastoma, into dopaminergic neurons have been undertaken since they are easier to cultivate when compared with other cellular models. here, we characterized neuronal features discriminating undifferentiated and retinoic acid (ra)-differentiated sh-sysy cells and described significant differences between these cell models in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) cytotoxicity. in contrast to undifferentiated cells, ra-differentiated sh-sy5y cells demonstrated low proliferative rate and a pronounced neuronal morphology with high expression of genes related to synapse vesicle cycle, dopamine synthesis/degradation, and of dopamine transporter (dat). significant differences between undifferentiated and ra-differentiated sh-sy5y cells in the overall capacity of antioxidant defenses were found; although ra-differentiated sh-sy5y cells presented a higher basal antioxidant capacity with high resistance against h2o2 insult, they were twofold more sensitive to 6-ohda. dat inhibition by 3 alpha-bis-4-fluorophenyl-methoxytropane and dithiothreitol (a cell-permeable thiol-reducing agent) protected ra-differentiated, but not undifferentiated, sh-sy5y cells from oxidative damage and cell death caused by 6-ohda. here, we demonstrate that undifferentiated and ra-differentiated sh-sy5y cells are two unique phenotypes and also have dissimilar mechanisms in 6-ohda cytotoxicity. hence, our data support the use of ra-differentiated sh-sy5y cells as an in vitro model of pd. this study may impact our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of pd and the development of new therapies and drugs for the management of the disease.
multiple_sclerosis	free radical toxicity due to poorly maintained cellular redox levels is crucial events that have been associated with the pathogenesis of guillain-barre syndrome (gbs) patients. uric acid (ua) and albumin correlate with oxidative stress in some degree. we aimed to evaluate the relationship between gbs and serum levels of ua and albumin in the present study. the serum levels of ua and albumin were determined in 203 individuals including 88 patients with gbs and 153 healthy controls (hc). we found that serum levels of ua and albumin in patients with gbs were significantly lower than those in hc group. besides, similar phenomenon was observed when the male and female subgroups were estimated, respectively. additionally, we found that there is no statistic difference among subgroups of gbs regarding ua and albumin. the univariate analysis revealed that both the high ua and high albumin were protective factors for patients with gbs (odds ratio [or] 0.140; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.074-0.264; p<.001 and or 0.016; 95% ci: 0.006-0.038; p<.001, respectively). it was further confirmed by the multivariable logistic regression analysis after adjusting for other potential confounding factors (or 0.168; 95% ci: 0.055-0.514; p=. 002 and or 0.027; 95% ci: 0.011-0.071; p<.001, respectively). in conclusion, we found that patients with gbs had significantly low serum ua and albumin levels. moreover, we demonstrated that both the high ua and high albumin were protective factors for patients with gbs.
hypothyroidism	background/aims: autoimmune hypophysitis (ah) is a rare inflammatory disease of the pituitary gland causing varying degrees of hypopituitarism and/or sellar compression. cranial mri remains the best noninvasive tool to diagnose ah, although a diagnosis of certainty requires pituitary biopsy. the objective of this study was to assess the utility of detecting pituitary antibodies for the diagnosis of ah. methods: a 15-year-old female with turner syndrome (ts), hypothyroidism, and ovarian failure presented acutely with hypocortisolism. laboratory studies revealed secondary adrenal insufficiency. mri showed a hypotrophic pituitary gland and loss of the posterior pituitary bright spot. to establish an autoimmune basis for the adrenal insufficiency, serum was analyzed by double indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of pituitary autoantibodies. results: the patient 's serum contained autoantibodies that recognized 36% of the adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting cells, suggesting that these adenohypophyseal cells were targeted by autoimmunity. the serum contained antibodies that identified the majority of the gonadotropin-secreting cells (fsh 77%, lh 65%). no recognition of gh-, prolactin-, and tsh-secreting cells was found. preabsorption experiments showed that antigenic targets of autoantibodies were not anterior pituitary hormones themselves. conclusion: demonstration of circulating pituitary antibodies expands the diagnostic options for ah. in this adolescent with ts, positive and cell-specific pituitary antibodies suggested that ah was the cause of her secondary adrenal insufficiency.

hepatitis_c	the imbalance of regulatory t cells (tregs) and t helper 17 (th17) cells contributes to the persistent hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. however, modulatory factors associated with tregs-th17 balance were not fully elucidated. arecent study demonstrated an immunoregulatory strategy by inactivation of notch signaling to reverse the disequilibrium of tregs-th17 cells in immune thrombocytopenia. thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of notch signaling in regulating the functions of tregs and th17 cells in chronic hepatitis c. a total of 46 patients with chronic hepatitis c and 17 normal controls (ncs) were enrolled. mrna expressions of notch1 and notch2 were semiquantified by real-time reserve polymerase chain reaction. percentages of tregs-th17, levels of key transcriptional factors, and cytokine productions were measured in response to treatment by dapt, a gamma-secretase inhibitor to suppress notch signaling. we found that notch1 and notch2 mrnas were significantly elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic hepatitis c patients compared with those from ncs. dapt treatment reduced th17 response by downregulation of ror gamma t expression and interleukin (il)-17/il-22 secretion. tregs proportion, foxp3 expression, and il-10 production did not change significantly with dapt treatment in chronic hepatitis c; however, blockage of notch signaling inhibited the suppressive function of tregs. moreover, effective anti-hcv therapy not only reduced notch1 and notch2 expression but also decreased tregs and th17 proportions. the current data provided a novel mechanism underlying the modulation of treg-th17 balance. the link between notch signaling and th cells might lead to a new intervention for breaking immunotolerance of chronic hcv infection.
birth_control	chlormadinone acetate (cma) is a progesterone derivative (17-acetoxy-6-chloro-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione), first synthesized in 1961. it was used as progestin-based hormone replacement therapy; since 1999 it was first used for oral contraception combined with ethinyl estradiol (ee). cma exerts a potent progestagenic effect, about one third higher than that observed with endogenous progesterone. cma is also an anti-estrogen, showing no androgenic effects (at birth control dose). unlike progesterone, it has a mild glucosteroidal effect with no anti-mineralocorticoid effect at all. these biological actions have allowed cma to have a role for therapeutic use in dysmenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and as a contraceptive agent. in addition, cma has exhibited beneficial neuroendocrine effects on women 's mood. cma-ee combination has shown excellent contraceptive efficacy, high tolerability, and compliance due to its risk-benefit profile, having additional benefits on skin and hair, such as reduction of seborrhea and acne. metabolic tolerance of cma has been demonstrated in several clinical studies. currently, cma is formulated to be taken as oral caplets in a 21 caplets package containing 0.03mg/ee and 2mg cma per pill with/without seven placebo additional pills. another presentation has 24 caplets containing 0.02mg/ee and 2mg cma plus four placebo pills.
menopause	objective: multimorbidity related to menopause and/or increased age will put healthcare systems in western nations under ever-greater strain. effective strategies to prevent diseases are thus of high priority and should be started earlier in life. the purpose of the study was to evaluate the long-term effect of exercise on different important health parameters in initially early postmenopausal women over a 16-year period. methods: in 1998, 137 early postmenopausal women with osteopenia living in erlangen-nurnberg were included in the study. eighty-six women joined the exercise group (eg) and conducted two supervised group and two home training sessions per week, whereas the control group (cg: n = 51) maintained their physical activity level. primary outcome parameters were clinical overall fractures incidence; secondary study endpoint was framingham study-based 10-year risk of coronary death/myocardial infarction and low back pain. results: in 2014, 59 women of the eg and 46 women of the cg were included in the 16-year follow-up analysis. framingham study-based 10-year risk of myocardial infarction/coronary death increased significantly (p < 0.001) in both groups; however, changes were significantly more favorable in the eg (5.00% +/- 2.94% vs cg: 6.90% +/- 3.98%; p = 0.02). the ratio for clinical ""overall"" fractures was 0.47 (95% ci: 0.24-0.92; p = 0.03), and thus significantly lower in the eg. although we focused on a high-intensity exercise strategy, low back pain was favorably affected in the eg. conclusions: multipurpose exercise programs demonstrated beneficial effects on various relevant risk factors and diseases of menopause or/and increased age, and should thus be preferentially applied for primary or secondary prevention in postmenopausal women.
fungal_infection	objective. - the occurrence of yeast infections in humans has increased, with the species belonging to genus candida still being the most common cause of infection. nevertheless, infections caused by less common yeasts have been widely reported in recent years. the main objective of this study was to assess the potential of these less common saprophytic yeasts to invade the host cell, which is essential for causing systemic infections. material and methods. - various yeast isolates were identified by dna sequence information of pcr amplified its region. the purported saprophytic yeasts were characterized for internalization by mammalian cells in vitro, by staining the f-actin. conclusion. - the identification of different yeast isolates from various patients revealed that 70% of the isolates belonged to the genus candida, while remaining 30% of the isolates were yeasts not belonging to genus candida. these non-candida clinical isolates, either in yeast or hyphal forms, were efficiently internalized by human epithelial cells. the internalization was marked by a process of actin polymerization surrounding the invading yeast. such uptake by epithelial cells signifies traversal of cell barrier by yeast cells during infection in vivo.

parenting	the secure base script (sbs) framework is one method of assessing implicit internal working models of attachment; recently, researchers have applied this method to analyze narratives regarding relationship experiences. this study examines the associations between attachment avoidance and sbs content when parents recall a positive moment of connection between themselves and their children (relational savoring) as well as their association with parental emotion and reflective functioning (rf). using a sample of parents (n = 155, 92% female) of young children (53% boys, mage = 12.76 months), we found that parental attachment avoidance is inversely associated with sbs content during relational savoring, and that sbs content is an indirect effect explaining the association between attachment avoidance and postsavoring (positive and negative) emotion as well as avoidance and poststressor rf. findings have implications for understanding attachment and parenting.
sports_injuries	traditional treatment of sports injuries includes use of the price principle (protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy modalities, and corticosteroid injections. recent evidence has raised concerns over this traditional treatment approach regarding the use of anti-inflammatories and injectable corticosteroids. more recent treatments, known as regenerative medicine, include platelet-rich plasma and stem cell therapies. evidence for their efficacy in a variety of sports injuries has emerged, ranging from tendinopathy and muscle tears to ligament and chondral injuries. this article reviews the literature regarding established treatments for sports injuries and these more innovative treatments.
sports_injuries	objective: to establish the injury profile of soccer players from a first division brazilian soccer team. in addition, we investigated the association between the characteristics of the injuries and the player 's age and position. method: forty-eight players from a brazilian first division soccer team were followed during one season. descriptive statistics were used to characterize the injury profile. spearman 's tests were used to verify the association between the number and severity of injuries and the player 's age. chi-square test was used to verify the association between type of injury and player 's position. fisher 's exact test was used to verify the association between the severity of injuries and player 's position. results: the incidence of injuries was 42.84/1000 hours in matches and 2.40/1000 hours in training. the injury severity was 19.5 +/- 34.4 days off competition or training. lower limb was the most common location of injury and most injuries were muscular/tendinous, overuse, non-recurrent, and non-contact injuries. player 's age correlated with the amount and severity of muscle and tendon injuries. defenders had more minimal injuries (1-3 days lost), while forwards had more moderate (8-28 days lost) and severe injuries (>28 days lost). furthermore, wingbacks had more muscle and tendon injuries, while midfielders had more joint and ligament injuries. conclusion: the injury profile of the brazilian players investigated in this study reflected regional differences in soccer practices. results confirm the influence of the player 's age and position on the soccer injuries profile.
allergies	introduction this study aimed to determine the prevalence of asthma-like symptoms among schoolchildren with low birth weight (lbw), and to compare the lung function of these children with that of children with normal birth weight. methods this was a comparative cross-sectional study. we recruited children aged 8-11 years from eight primary schools in kota bharu, kelantan, malaysia. the children were divided into two groups: those with lbw (= 2,500 g). parents of the enrolled children were asked to complete a translated version of the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood questionnaire. lung function tests, done using a microloop spirometer, were performed for the children in both groups by a single investigator who was blinded to the children 's birth weight. results the prevalence of 'ever wheezed' among the children with lbw was 12.9%. this value was significantly higher than that of the children with normal birth weight (7.8%). forced vital capacity (fvc), forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced expiratory flow when 50% and 75% of the fvc had been exhaled were significantly lower among the children with lbw as compared to the children with normal birth weight. conclusion lbw is associated with an increased prevalence of asthma-like symptoms and impaired lung function indices later in life. children born with lbw may need additional follow-up so that future respiratory problems can be detected early.
myelofibrosis	inherited disorders of platelet granules are clinically heterogeneous and their prevalence is underestimated because most patients do not undergo a complete diagnostic work-up. the lack of a genetic diagnosis limits the ability to tailor management, screen family members, aid with family planning, predict clinical progression and detect serious consequences, such as myelofibrosis, lung fibrosis and malignancy, in a timely manner. this is set to change with the introduction of high throughput sequencing (hts) as a routine clinical diagnostic test. hts diagnostic tests are now available, affordable and allow parallel screening of dna samples for variants in all of the 80 known bleeding, thrombotic and platelet genes. increased genetic diagnosis and curation of variants is, in turn, improving our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical course of inherited platelet disorders. our understanding of the genetic causes of platelet granule disorders and the regulation of granule biogenesis is a work in progress and has been significantly enhanced by recent genomic discoveries from high-powered genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing projects. in the era of whole genome and epigenome sequencing, new strategies are required to integrate multiple sources of big data in the search for elusive, novel genes underlying granule disorders.
weight_loss	dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric cold plasma (dacp) treatment was evaluated for the inactivation of escherichia coil 0157:h7, surface morphology, color, carbon dioxide generation, and weight loss of bulk romaine lettuce in a commercial plastic clamshell container. the lettuce samples were packed in a model bulk packaging configuration (three rows with either 1, 3, 5, or 7 layers) in the container and treated by dacp (42.6 kv, 10 min). dacp treatment reduced the number of e. coil 0157:h7 in the leaf samples in the 1-, 3-, and 5-layer configurations by 0.4-0.8 log cfu/g lettuce, with no significant correlation to the sample location (p >0.05). in the largest bulk stacking with 7 layers, a greater degree of reduction (1.1 log cfu/g lettuce) was observed at the top layer, but shaking the container increased the uniformity of the inhibition. dacp did not significantly change the surface morphology, color, respiration rate, or weight loss of the samples, nor did these properties differ significantly according to their location in the bulk stack. dacp treatment inhibited e. coli 0157:h7 on bulk lettuce in clamshell containers in a uniform manner, without affecting the physical and biological properties and thus holds promise as a post -packaging process for fresh and fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. published by elsevier ltd.
heart_disease	a warming climate is anticipated to increase the future heat-related total mortality in urban areas. however, little evidence has been reported for cause-specific mortality or nonurban areas. here we assessed the impact of climate change on heat-related total and cause-specific mortality in both urban and rural counties of jiangsu province, china, in the next five decades. to address the potential uncertainty in projecting future heat-related mortality, we applied localized urban- and nonurban-specific exposure response functions, six population projections including a no population change scenario and five shared socioeconomic pathways (ssps), and 42 temperature projections from 21 global-scale general circulation models and two representative concentration pathways (rcps). results showed that projected warmer temperatures in 2016-2040 and 2041-2065 will lead to higher heat-related mortality for total non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, stroke, ischemic heart disease (ihd), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) causes occurring annually during may to september in jiangsu province, china. nonurban residents in jiangsu will suffer from more excess heat-related cause-specific mortality in 2016-2065 than urban residents. variations across climate models and rcps dominated the uncertainty of heat-related mortality estimation whereas population size change only had limited influence. our findings suggest that targeted climate change mitigation and adaptation measures should be taken in both urban and nonurban areas of jiangsu province. specific public health interventions should be focused on the leading causes of death (stroke, ihd, and copd), whose health burden will be amplified by a warming climate.

fungal_infection	with the ongoing economic development, lifestyle changes and an aging population, diabetes mellitus has be come one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world. rhino-orbito-cerebral (roc) mucormycosis is a rare, acute and angioinvasive fungal infection that can be fatal. mucormycosis occurs exclusively in immunocompromised patients with diabetes mellitus and other types of immunodeficiency and has three subtypes: rhino-maxillary, rhino-orbital and roc mucormycosis. the present study reported on a case of roc mucormycosis in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis. in the present case, the pathogen afflicted all of the above organs, including the left eye, nasal cavity, hard palate and cerebrum.
diabetes	streptozotocin (stz) treatment, a common model for inducing diabetes in rodent models, induces thermal hyperalgesia and neuronal toxicity independently of hyperglycemia by oxidizing and activating trpa1 and trpv1. following treatment with stz, cd45(+) immune cells were found to be depleted in sciatic nerve (sn) and drg in mice, prior to hyperglycemia. macrophages were also lost in drg and nf kappa b-p65-activation was increased in sn macrophages. immune cells were significantly reduced in both sn and drg up to three weeks, post-treatment. loss of pns-resident macrophages in response to stz-mediated toxicity may affect the regenerative capacity of the nerve in response to further injury caused by diabetes.

sports_injuries	foot and ankle injuries are the second most common reason for young athletes to present to a primary care physician, and account for up to 30% of visits to sports medicine clinics in this population. heightened performance expectations placed on today 's young athletes have led to intense training and competition demands. with increasing rates of sport participation among children and adolescents, it is important for treating physicians to have an understanding of the evaluation and management of ankle injuries seen in the pediatric athlete. in treating young athletes it is important to keep in mind the unique developmental and anatomic differences between the skeletally mature and skeletally immature ankle. these differences predispose young athletes to unique injuries not seen in adults. these include injuries that result from congenital or developmental variations, acute injuries, and overuse type injuries.
alzheimer's_disease	glutamate is an essential excitatory neurotransmitter that regulates brain functions, and its activity is tightly regulated by glutamate transporters. excess glutamate in the synaptic cleft and dysfunction of excitatory amino acid transporters have been shown to be involved in development of alzheimer 's disease, but the precise regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. using a d-[h-3]-aspartic acid uptake assay, we found that a beta(1-42) oligomers impaired glutamate uptake in astrocytes and neurons. in astrocytes, this process was accompanied by reduced expression of glt-1 and glast as detected by western blot and immunocytofluorescence. however, mrna levels of eaats detected by qpcr in astrocytes and neurons were not altered, which suggests that this process is post-translational. co-localization analysis using immunocytofluorescence showed that ubiquitylation of glt-1 significantly increased. therefore, we hypothesized that a beta(1-42) oligomers-induced endocytosis of astrocytic glt-1 may be involved in ubiquitylation. in addition, a beta(1-42) oligomers enhanced secretion of il-beta,tnf-alpha, and il-6 into culture supernatant, which may be correlated with an inflammatory response and altered eaats expression or function in alzheimer 's disease. these findings support the idea that dysregulation of the glutamatergic system may play a significant role in pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease. furthermore, enhancing expression or function of eaats in astrocytes and neurons might be a new therapeutic approach in treatment of alzheimer 's disease.

weight_loss	as obesity rates continue to rise, both effective prevention and treatment programs are urgently required. combating obesity requires weight management programs that are accessible and scalable to large numbers of people. there is growing evidence that commercial programs, which combine behavior change techniques with the key motivators for changing habits, are effective as the first line in helping people adopt healthier dietary and activity patterns. in particular, digital programs have the potential to provide a service to large numbers of people, be widely accessible and cost effective for the individual. however, to date, digital programs have been relatively under-utilized and under-evaluated. there is little published evidence on the performance of programs on a large scale, outside of partnerships with primary care, where participants self-refer and pay a nominal fee. the purpose of the following study was to examine the interrelated effect of motivation, opportunity, and ability on the behavioral outcomes of a digital commercial weight management program. to address this aim, a thematic content analysis of participants' qualitative responses to habits learned and changes adopted was conducted. findings reveal that habits learned and changes adopted as a result of participating in the program influence not only weight loss outcomes but other health and well-being outcomes as well.
alzheimer's_disease	we previously showed that microglial keratan sulfate (ks) was induced in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. however, the functional roles of the glycan and its synthetic enzyme in neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer 's disease (ad), a progressive disorder, are unclear. in our study, ks modified with sialic acids having a molecular mass of 125-220 kda and the carbohydrate sulfotransferase glcnac6st1 were up-regulated in the brains of two transgenic mouse models (j20 and tg2576) and the brains of patients with ad. glcnac6st1-deficient j20 (j20/glcnac6st1(-/-)) mice demonstrated a complete absence of the microglial sialylated ks. j20/glcnac6st1(-/-) primary microglia showed an increased level of amyloid-beta phagocytosis and were hyperresponsive to interleukin 4, a potent antiinflammatory cytokine. moreover, j20/glcnac6st1(-/-) mice manifested reduced cerebral amyloid-beta deposition. glcnac6st1-synthesizing sialylated ks thus modulates ad pathology. inhibition of ks synthesis by targeting glcnac6st1 may therefore be beneficial for controlling ad pathogenesis.
weight_loss	background: early diagnosis and treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) can prevent future health problems, yet many individuals with these conditions are undiagnosed. this could be due, in part, to primary care physicians' (pcp) screening practices, about which little is known. the objectives of this study were to identify factors that influence pcps' decisions to screen patients for t2dm and to characterize their interpretation and communication of screening test results to patients. methods: we conducted semi-structured chart-stimulated recall interviews with 20 university of michigan health system (umhs) primary care physicians. pcps were asked about their recent decisions to screen or not screen 134 purposively sampled non-diabetic patients who met american diabetes association criteria for screening for t2dm. interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative directed content analysis. data on patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were abstracted from the electronic health record. results: the most common reasons pcps gave for not screening 63 patients for t2dm were knowledge of a previously normal screening test (49%) and a visit for reasons other than a health maintenance examination (48%). the most common reasons pcps gave for screening 71 patients for t2dm were knowledge of a previously abnormal screening test (49%), and patients' weight (42%) and age (38%). pcps correctly interpreted 89% of screening test results and communicated 95% of test results to patients. among 24 patients found to have prediabetes, pcps usually (58%) recommended weight loss and increased physical activity but never recommended participation in a diabetes prevention program or use of metformin. conclusions: previous screening test results, visit types, and patients' weight and age influenced pcps' decisions to screen for t2dm. when patients were screened, test results were generally correctly interpreted and consistently communicated. recommendations to patients with prediabetes could better reflect evidence-based strategies to prevent t2dm.
heart_disease	objective: frequent demands from others in relationships are associated with worse physiological and health outcomes. the present research investigated 2 potential moderators of the relationship between frequency of demands from one 's family and inflammatory profiles among adolescents: (a) closeness of adolescents' relationships with their families, and (b) the frequency with which adolescents provided help to their families. method: two hundred thirty-four adolescents, ages 13-16 (m-age = 14.53; 47.83% male), completed a daily dairy in which they reported on the frequency of demands made by family members. they were also interviewed about the closeness of their family relationships and reported in the daily diary on how frequently they provided help to their families. adolescents also underwent a blood draw to assess low-grade inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine production in response to bacterial stimulation. results: more frequent demands from family predicted higher levels of low-grade inflammation and cytokine production in response to bacterial stimulation in adolescents. family closeness moderated the relationship between frequent demands and stimulated cytokine production such that more frequent demands predicted higher cytokine production among adolescents who were closer to their families. furthermore, frequency of providing help moderated the relationship between frequent demands and both low-grade inflammation and stimulated cytokine production, such that more frequent demands predicted worse inflammatory profiles among adolescents who provided more help to their families. conclusions: these findings build on previous work on family demands and health to show under what circumstances family demands might have a physiological cost.
menopause	purpose the aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of nutraceuticals containing equol, resveratrol, quecitine and passiflora (zemiar (r), avantgarde, pomezia, rome, italy) on quality of life (qol) and sexual function in perimenopausal women. methods sixty perimenopausal women having vasomotor symptoms and being in the -1, +1a of the straw system (amenorrhea for longer than 60 days and fsh < 20 ui/l) were enrolled. the modified kupperman index (ki) was used to evaluate menopause symptoms. the short form-36 (sf-36), female sexual function index (fsfi) and the female sexual distress scale (fsds) were used to assess qol, sexual function and sexual distress, respectively. the study had two follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. results the women reported an improvement in the ki total score from the baseline (35 +/- 4) to the 1st (21 +/- 3, p < 0.05) and the 2nd (18 +/- 2, p < 0.01) follow-ups. at the 1st follow-up, the women reported qol improvements in some functions (p < 0.05); at the 2nd follow-up, they reported improvements in all categories (p < 0.001). at baseline, the total fsfi score was 23.1 +/- 1.2 and the fsds score was 18.1 +/- 1.4, both indicating sexual dysfunction with sexual distress. fsfi and fsds total scores did not change at the 1st follow-up (p = ns). on the contrary, at the 2nd follow-up, the fsfi score had risen to (27.6 +/- 1.5) (p < 0.001) and the fsds score had dropped to (11.3 +/- 1.2) (p < 0.001). conclusion nutraceuticals can be effective in modulating the perimenopausal symptoms in women. the progressive reduction of the vasomotor symptoms reported by women over the nutraceutical usage could contribute to improve their qol and sexual life.
sports_injuries	this study aimed to verify the prevalence and characteristics of sports injuries (si) and determine the association between the physical activity level (pa) and si with perception of health-related quality of life (hrqol) in brazilian basketball master athletes. a cross-sectional study was conducted with 410 male master athletes, between 35 and 85years of age (mean 52.26, sd +/- 11.83). the hrqol was assessed using the medical outcomes study - short form-36. the pa was evaluated using the international physical activity questionnaire. information regarding si was collected using the reported morbidity survey. poisson regression, as estimated by the prevalence ratio (pr), was used as a measure of the association of pa and si with hrqol. the majority of athletes showed a high si prevalence (58.3%) and reported one injury (67.8%) that occurred during training (61.1%) and primarily affected a lower limb (74.6%). the adjusted regression models showed a positive association of pa with the functional capacity (pr=1.46, 95% confidence interval [ci]=1.12-1.90) and physical component (pr=1.32, 95% ci=1.03-1.70) of hrqol. furthermore, the si were negatively associated with hrqol in functional capacity (pr=1.85, 95% ci=1.51-2.27), physical aspects (pr=3.99, 95% ci=3.08-5.18), pain (pr=1.65, 95% ci=1.26-2.16), social functioning (pr=1.79, 95% ci=1.41-2.27), emotional aspects (pr=4.40, 95% ci=3.35-5.78), mental health domains (pr=1.37, 95% ci=1.06-1.68), physical component (pr=2.35, 95% ci=1.90-2.90) and mental component (pr=2.65, 95% ci=2.14-3.29). these results highlighted that master athletes showed a high si prevalence, primarily in the lower limbs. pa positively correlates with the physical hrqol domain, whereas si may decrease the hrqol levels of both physical and mental domains.
sports_injuries	the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for handball injuries in brazilian elite handball players. overall, 339 athletes from 21 handball teams who participated in the two main brazilian championships were followed up during a season. in total, 312 injuries were reported by 201 athletes. the injury incidence rate during training was 3.7/1000 h, and during matches was 20.3/1000 matches. ankle (19.4%, n = 46) and knee (13.5%, n = 32) were the body regions most affected by traumatic injuries. shoulders (44.0%, n = 33) and knee (26.7%, n = 20) were the body regions most affected by overuse injuries. muscle injuries (27.1%, n = 68) was the traumatic injury type most reported. tendinopathy (91.8%, n = 56) was the overuse injury type most observed. previous injury (or: 2.42, ci 95%: 1.51-3.89) and an additional match per week (or: 1.31, ci 95%: 1.05-1.62) were associated with a higher risk of overuse injury. female athletes (or: 1.56, ci 95%: 1.08-2.25) and an additional hour of training per week (or: 1.09, ci 95%: 1.02-1.15) were associated with a higher risk of traumatic injury. this study showed that athletes with previous injury have shown a high risk of developing an overuse injury.
multiple_sclerosis	objectivethe p2x7 receptor (p2x7r) is a key regulatory element in the neuroinflammatory cascade that provides a promising target for imaging neuroinflammation. gsk1482160, a p2x7r modulator with nanomolar binding affinity and high selectivity, has been successfully radiolabeled and utilized for imaging p2x7 levels in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. in the current study, we further characterized its binding profile and determined whether [c-11]gsk1482160 can detect changes in p2x7r expression in a rodent model of multiple sclerosis.methods[c-11]gsk1482160 was synthesized with high specific activity and high radiochemical purity. radioligand saturation and competition binding assays were performed for [c-11]gsk1482160 using hek293-hp2x7r living cells. micro-pet studies were carried out in nonhuman primates. in vitro autoradiography and immunohistochemistry studies were then carried out to evaluate tracer uptake and p2x7 expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) rat lumbar spinal cord at eae-peak and eae-remitting stages compared with sham rats.results[c-11]gsk1482160 binds to hek293-hp2x7r living cells with high binding affinity (k-d=5.090.98nmol/l, k-i=2.63 +/- 0.6nmol/l). micro-pet studies showed high tracer retention and a homogeneous distribution in the brain of nonhuman primates. in the eae rat model, tracer uptake of [c-11]gsk1482160 in rat lumbar spinal cord was the highest at the eae-peak stage (277.74 +/- 79.74psl/mm(2)), followed by the eae-remitting stage(149.00 +/- 54.14psl/mm(2)) and sham (66.37 +/- 1.48psl/mm(2)). the tracer uptake correlated strongly with p2x7-positive cell counts, activated microglia numbers, and disease severity.conclusionwe conclude that [c-11]gsk1482160 has the potential for application in monitoring neuroinflammation.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	management of gut-related symptoms in the pediatric population can be challenging. many factors need to be taken into consideration including psychological, behavioral, social and family environments, and growth and developmental requirements. this review focuses on two issues: potential dietary therapies that are thought to relieve the symptoms of infantile colic, a condition that is believed to be gastrointestinal in nature; and the evidence and dietary considerations surrounding children with irritable bowel syndrome.
allergies	background/aimantibiotic allergies are frequently reported and have significant impacts upon appropriate prescribing and clinical outcomes. we surveyed infectious diseases physicians, allergists, clinical immunologists and hospital pharmacists to evaluate antibiotic allergy knowledge and service delivery in australia and new zealand. methodsan online multi-choice questionnaire was developed and endorsed by representatives of the australasian society of clinical immunology and allergy (ascia) and the australasian society of infectious diseases (asid). the 37-item survey was distributed in april 2015 to members of ascia, asid, the society of hospital pharmacists of australia and the royal australasian college of physicians. resultsof 277 respondents, 94% currently use or would utilise antibiotic allergy testing (aat) and reported seeing up to 10 patients/week labelled as antibiotic-allergic. forty-two per cent were not aware of or did not have aat available. most felt that aat would aid antibiotic selection, antibiotic appropriateness and antimicrobial stewardship (79, 69 and 61% respectively). patients with the histories of immediate hypersensitivity were more likely to be referred than those with delayed hypersensitivities (76 vs 41%, p=0.0001). lack of specialist physicians (20%) and personal experience (17%) were barriers to service delivery. a multidisciplinary approach was a preferred aat model (53%). knowledge gaps were identified, with the majority overestimating rates of penicillin/cephalosporin (78%), penicillin/carbapenem (57%) and penicillin/monobactam (39%) cross-reactivity. conclusionsa high burden of antibiotic allergy labelling and demand for aat is complicated by a relative lack availability or awareness of aat services in australia and new zealand. antibiotic allergy education and deployment of aat, accessible to community and hospital-based clinicians, may improve clinical decisions and reduce antibiotic allergy impacts. a collaborative approach involving infectious diseases physicians, pharmacists and allergists/immunologists is required.
overactive_bladder	over the past two decades, there has been lot of interest in the use of liposomes as lipid-based biocompatible carriers for drugs administered by the intravesical route. the lipidic bilayer structure of liposomes facilitates their adherence to the apical membrane surface of luminal cells in the bladder, and their vesicular shape allows them to co-opt the endocytosis machinery for bladder uptake after instillation. liposomes have been shown to enhance the penetration of both water-soluble and insoluble drugs, toxins, and oligonucleotides across the bladder epithelium. empty liposomes composed entirely of the endogenous phospholipid, sphingomyelin, could counter mucosal inflammation and promote wound healing in patients suffering from interstitial cystitis. recent clinical studies have tested multilamellar liposomes composed entirely of sphingomyelin as a novel intravesical therapy for interstitial cystitis. in addition, liposomes have been used as a delivery platform for the instillation of botulinum toxin in overactive bladder patients. the present review discusses the properties of liposomes that are important for their intrinsic therapeutic effect, summarizes the recently completed clinical studies with intravesical liposomes and covers the latest developments in this field.
headache	background: idiopathic intracranial hypertension (iih) is a syndrome defined by elevated intracranial hypertension without radiographic evidence of a mass lesion in the brain. dural venous sinus stenosis has been increasingly recognized as a treatable cause, and dural venous sinus stenting (dvss) is increasingly performed. methods: a 5 year single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing dvss for medically refractory iih. results: there were 43 patients with a mean imaging follow-up of 6.5 months and a mean clinical follow-up period of 13.5 months. dvss was performed as the first procedure for medically refractory iih in 81.4% of patients, whereas 18.6% of patients included had previously had a surgical procedure (ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt or optic nerve sheath fenestration (onsf)). headache was present in all patients and after dvss improved or remained stable in 69.2% and 30.8%, respectively. visual acuity changes and visual field changes were present in 88.4% and 37.2% of patients, respectively. visual field improved or remained unchanged in 92%, but worsened in 8% after stenting. there was a stent patency rate of 81.8%, with an 18.2% re-stenosis rate. of the 43 procedures performed, there was a 100% technical success rate with zero major or minor complications. conclusion: based on this single-center retrospective analysis, dvss can be performed with high technical success and low complication rates. a majority of patients presented primarily with headache, and these patients had excellent symptom relief with dvss alone. patients presenting with visual symptoms had lower success rates, and this population, if stented, should be carefully followed for progression of symptoms.
overactive_bladder	aims(1) to describe the prevalence of childhood and recent trauma in patients with overactive bladder (oab), and (2) assess the impact of traumatic events on the clinical presentation and the severity of oab symptoms, quality of life, and psychosocial health. methodspatients diagnosed with oab (n=51) and age-matched healthy controls (n=30) were administered the childhood traumatic events scale and recent traumatic events scale, assessing exposure and perceived impact of common traumatic events. among oab patients, validated instruments were administered to correlate traumatic exposure to evaluate adult urinary symptoms (iciq-ui, iciq-oab, oab-q, udi-6, iiq-7, uss), mood dysregulation (hads), sleep and fatigue (promis), and psychological stress (pss). resultschildhood sexual trauma was more prevalent in patients with oab compared to controls (29.4% vs. 6.7%, p=0.041). oab patients also rated their childhood sexual exposure as more traumatic compared to controls (mean ratings of 1.7 vs. 0.4, p=0.050). there was no difference in childhood deaths (p=0.24), parental upheaval (p=0.87), violence (p=0.099), illness/injury (p=0.683), or any recent traumatic events between oab and control subjects. childhood trauma predicted worse bladder pain (p=0.005), worse non-urologic pain (p=0.017), poorer mood (p=0.001), higher anxiety (p=0.029), higher physical symptom burden (p<0.001), and higher psychological stress (p<0.039). however, childhood trauma did not correlate with the severity of oab symptoms (urgency, frequency, incontinence). conclusionsthirty percent of oab patients reported childhood sexual trauma. these patients report more pain symptoms, poorer mood, and greater somatic burden. these data highlight the potentiating role of psychosocial stressors from childhood in the adult suffering from oab. neurourol. urodynam. 35:1017-1023, 2016.

allergies	background: in 2014, the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (isaac) reported that the highest prevalence of symptoms of severe asthma was found in the low-and middle-income countries (lmics), including nigeria. while exposure to biomass fuel use may be an important risk factor in the development of asthma, its association with asthma symptoms severity has not been well-established. the aim of this study is to extend the spectrum of environmental risk factors that may be contributing towards increasing asthma morbidity, especially asthma symptoms severity in rural schoolchildren in nigeria and to examine possible asthma underdiagnosis among this population. methods: authors conducted a cross-sectional survey in three rural communities in nigeria. asthma symptoms were defined according to the isaac criteria. information on the types of household fuel used for cooking was used to determine household cooking fuel status. asthma symptoms severity was defined based on frequencies of wheeze, day-and night-time symptoms, and speech limitations. logistic regression analyses were used to explore associations. results: a total of 1,690 nigerian schoolchildren participated in the study. overall, 37 (2.2%) had diagnosed asthma and 413 (24.4%) had possible asthma (asthma-related symptoms but not diagnosed asthma). children from biomass fuel households had higher proportion of possible asthma (27.7 vs. 22.2%; p < 0.05) and symptoms of severe asthma (18.2 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.048). in adjusted analyses, biomass fuel use was associated with increased odds of severe symptoms of asthma [odds ratios (or) = 2.37; 95% ci: 1.16-4.84], but not with possible asthma (or = 1.22; 95% ci: 0.95-1.56). conclusion: in rural nigerian children with asthma symptoms, the use of biomass fuel for cooking is associated with an increased risk of severe asthma symptoms. there is additional evidence that rural children might be underdiagnosed for asthma.
cancer	thiopurines [e.g. mercaptopurine (mp)] are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia with dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicity. recently, germline variants in nudt15 have been identified as a major genetic cause for mp-related bone marrow suppression, and there is increasing interest in the clinical implementation of nudt15 genotype-guided mp dose individualization. therefore, we sought to evaluate the effects of nudt15 on thiopurine metabolism and identify pharmacologic markers to inform nudt15 genotype-guided mp dosing. in 55 japanese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we simultaneously measured both thioguanine nucleotides (tgn) in red blood cells and dna-incorporated thioguanine (dna-tg) in white blood cells. tgn levels were significantly lower in patients with nudt15 deficiency, likely because of toxicity-related mp dose reduction. in contrast, when exposed to the same dose of mp, dna-tg accumulated more efficiently in vivo with increasing number of risk alleles in nudt15 (p=4.0x10(-9)). cytosolic tgn and nuclear dna-tg were correlated positively with each other across genotype groups (p=6.5x10(-4)), but the ratio of dna-tg to tgn was significantly higher in nudt15-deficient patients (p=3.6x10(-9)), consistent with excessive mp activation. in conclusion, our results suggest that dna-tg is a more relevant mp metabolite than tgn to inform nudt15 genotype-guided dose adjustments.
multiple_sclerosis	in this study, we aimed to assess the levels of b cell activating factor from the tumor necrosis factor family (baff) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (april) in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of patients with anti n-methyl-oaspartate receptor (nmdar) encephalitis and determine their correlation with clinical outcome. baff and april concentrations in csf and serum from 40 patients with anti-nmdar encephalitis and 20 controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). compared with controls, the levels of both baff and april in csf were significantly increased in patients with anti-nmdar encephalitis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). patients with unfavorable outcome had higher levels of baff and april in csf than those who had favorable outcome (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05). baff and april levels in csf were elevated and associated with clinical outcome in patients with anti-nmdar encephalitis, indicating that they may be valuable biomarkers to this disease.

hepatitis_c	background: metabolic syndrome is one of the most important health issues worldwide. obesity causes insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and various diseases throughout the body. the liver phenotype, which is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), frequently progresses to hepatocellular carcinoma. we recently established a new animal model, tsumura-suzuki obese diabetic (tsod) mice, which spontaneously exhibit obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and nash with liver nodules. methods: we examined the effects of coffee intake on various conditions of the metabolic syndrome using tsod mice. the daily volume of coffee administered was limited so that it reflected the appropriate quantities consumed in humans. to clarify the effects of the specific components, animals were divided into two coffee-intake groups that included with and without caffeine. results: coffee intake did not significantly affect obesity and hyperlipidemia in tsod mice. in contrast, coffee intake caused various degrees of improvement in the pancreatic beta cell damage and steatohepatitis with liver carcinogenesis. most of the effects were believed to be caused by a synergistic effect of caffeine with other components such as polyphenols. however, the antifibrotic effects of coffee appeared to be due to the polyphenols rather than the caffeine. conclusions: a daily habit of drinking coffee could possibly play a role in the prevention of metabolic syndrome.
birth_control	in the present study views on contraception and the relationship between the variable gender study and students of the faculty of humanities at the university of magdalena are determined. this article would provide data on sexual risk behaviors of students, which can be useful for the prevention of this problem, thus a descriptive correlational study was conducted using purposive sampling, with a participation of 120 students. the findings support the conclusion that students pose positive reviews and increased use of condoms and pills also have negative opinions of abstinence, intrauterine devices and implants. on the other hand, there is no relationship between gender and views on contraception, also the opinion of students does not differ according to the program.
fungal_infection	for the first time the occurrence of a chytrid, batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) fungus infection in the fresh water prawn, macrobrachium rosenbergii in grow out farms is reported. an extensive survey carried out between 2007 and 2011 in 15 farms (f) indicates that b. dendrobatidis is responsible for major pandemics in m. rosenbergii culture ponds as evidenced by the unique characteristics of the presence of fungal hyphae in claws and other features in the infected prawn. the pathogenicity of the fungus, ld50, histopathology, hematology and immunological response of the infected prawn is reported; the clinical symptoms include dull body color, abnormal protrusion associated with a grayish white color, wooly appearance with radiating grayish white fungal filaments on claw. histopathology studies revealed that the infection resulted in faded eye color, occurrence of dark spots and melanization on the cephalothorax and muscles, translucent musculature, cuticular erosion, tissue atrophy with proliferated and infiltrated cells causing distension and gross enlargement of gill lamellae. an optimum dose of 10(5) zoospores/prawn (ld50) resulted in 50% mortality from 4 to 6 days. at high dose of 10(8) zoospores/prawn, the infection caused total mortality from 2 to 4 days. after 2nd week the total hemocyte counts (thcs) significantly decreased while the phenoloxidase (po) level, relative superoxide anion production level, and superoxide dismutase (sod) activity registered a significant increase (p < 0.05) when compared to control. the cumulative mortality was 90% when challenged with bd for 30 days. the prevalence of infection was high in cooler or winter season (october, november, and december) and low in hot or summer season (march, april, may, and june) indicating a seasonal influence wielding a significant effect on mortality, hematology, and immunology profiles. statement of relevance: in india about 1000 ha of shrimp/prawn ponds were affected by the disease, resulting in an annual loss of rs. 10 million (us$0.23 million) during 1994-95 and rs. 25 million (us$0.58 million) during 1995-96 (ayyappan, 2000). intensive prawn farming favors the rapid deterioration of environmental conditions which increase the incidence of diseases and failure of culture. therefore augmenting the immune resistance and anti-environmental stress of prawns are of primary concern. chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease caused by the chytrid, batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; it is a non-hyphal zoospore fungus belonging to chytridiomycota (canter-lund and lund, 1995) or blastocladiomycota (james et al., 2006) phylum. chytrids are a diverse group of microscopic fungi (barr, 1980; barr, 2001; kendrick, 1992) that disperse in an aqueous environment by motile zoospores with a single posterior whiplash flagellum (sparrow, 1960). chytrids have been well documented in amphibians (longcore et al., 1999; berger et al., 1999). a number of fungal pathogens were isolated and identified from prawns and shrimps (krishnika and ramasamy, 2014; karthikeyan and gopalakrishnan, 2014; hatai, 2012; cruz da silva et al., 2011; ramaiah, 2006). recently, fungal pathogen like aspergillus awamori has been isolated from marine shrimp, liptopenaeus vannamei (karthikeyan et al., 2015) and gilbertella persicaria from penaeus monodon. to our knowledge there is no report of the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infection in fish, prawn, and shrimp.

menopause	the aim of the authors in this randomized controlled study was to assess the effect of exercise and nutrition education on quality of life and early menopausal symptoms. this trial was conducted in east azerbaijan province, iran, during the period from 2013 to 2014 with 108 women allocated into one of four groups (n=27 in each group) by block randomization. the interventions received by the three intervention groups were: nutrition education, aerobic exercise, or exercise plus nutrition education. the control group did not receive any intervention. the greene and menqol menopause symptom scales were completed before and at 8 and 12weeks after the intervention. the mean greene score was significantly lower than the control group in the exercise (adjusted mean difference: -5.1) and exercise plus nutrition groups (-8.0) at the end of week 8 and in the nutrition (-4.8), exercise (-8.7), and exercise plus nutrition (-13.2) groups at the end of week 12. also, the mean menqol score was significantly lower than the control group in the exercise (-8.3) and exercise plus nutrition groups (-13.8) at the end of week 8 and in the nutrition (-6.6), exercise (-13.5), and exercise plus nutrition (-22.1) groups at the end of week 12. nutrition education with aerobic exercise can improve quality of life.
menopause	women younger than 40 years may face early menopause because of premature ovarian failure (pof). the cause of pof can be idiopathic or iatrogenic, especially the cancer-induced oophorectomy and chemo-or radiation therapy. the current treatments, including hormone replacement therapy (hrt) and cryopreservation techniques, have increased risk of ovarian cancer and may reintroduce malignant cells after autografting. decellularization technique has been regarded as a novel regenerative medicine strategy for organ replacement, wherein the living cells of an organ are removed, leaving the extracellular matrix (ecm) for cellular seeding. this study aimed to produce a xenogeneic decellularized ovary (d-ovary) scaffold as a platform for ovary regeneration and transplantation. we have developed a novel decellularization protocol for porcine ovary by treatment with physical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. using hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) staining, dapi staining, scanning electron microscopy (sem), and quantitative analysis, this approach proved effective in removing cellular components and preserving ecm. furthermore, the results of biological safety evaluation demonstrated that the d-ovary tissues were noncytotoxic for rat ovarian cells in vitro and caused only a minimal immunogenic response in vivo. in addition, the d-ovary tissues successfully supported rat granulosa cell penetration ex vivo and showed an improvement in estradiol (e2) hormone secretion.
senior_health	numerous health legislations concerning child mortality, maternal health and life-threatening diseases such as polio and tuberculosis are crafted in the health sector of pakistan. a critical assessment of health legislations points to their in-effective or sub-optimal implementation. by engaging with the concept of public law, there is a strong relationship of public health and health legislations. while the basic purpose of health legislations is to craft and enforce essential health legislations for improving public health, an examination of health legislations across pakistan indicate an extensive health engagement which is facing certain challenges indicating traditional health practices, enforcement constraints arising due to political compulsions and complexities, and systematic problems in the health sector, reflecting issue of governance. through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews held with policy-makers, senior health officials private health entities and parliamentarian tasks forces on millennium development goals, this study engages with health-sector legislations. in so doing, it focuses on the problematic health sector and interventions. it is observed that unless an overarching legislative framework and a shift from programmatic approach to a human rights approach is adopted, the targets of millennium development goals 4, 5 and 6 would remain off-track in pakistan.
sports_injuries	introduction.-middle school children involved in sports sections are the most exposed to fatigue syndrome (or overtraining syndrome). this syndrome can be explored through an auto questionnaire of fatigue (questionnaire de fatigue de l'enfant sportif [qfes]). moreover, the epidemiological studies about sports injuries in all ages reveal a peak in 13-14 years old children. goal.-to determine the influence of the qfes score on the incidence of sports injuries in middle school athletes. methods.-two hundred and seventy-six children aged 11 to 16 years old involved in fifteen middle school sports sections, practicing an average of 10h48 +/- 3h30 min per week in eleven different sports were enrolled. from december 1st 2014 to april 15th 2015, each pupil completed a qfes and an injury questionnaire based on the 2006 and 2007 consensus statement of the international federation of football association (fifa) and the international rugby board (irb). results.-subjects who were injured in the previous two months had a higher qfes mean score compared to non-injured (36.5 +/- 19.6 vs. 25.7 +/- 14.1, p< 0.001). the rate of injuries increased with the qfes score (p < 0.01). the qfes score increased with body mass index (bmi) percentiles (y=0.0999x+25.166; r=0.176; p<0.01). conclusion.-the qfes could be an effective tool to monitor and prevent the fatigue syndrome in middle school athletes. sufficient rest periods in training plans and weight management could prevent children fatigue and sports injuries.

myelofibrosis	the log-rank test is a cornerstone of phase iii oncology clinical trials. however, there are at least three different mathematical procedures that can be named the log-rank test and two of them are widely used by commercial statistical programs. consequently, different p values can be obtained. in the case of a borderline statistical significance, this can mean the difference between the evidence (significant p value) and merely an observation. since all three methods can be reported under the same name, space for possible data manipulation occurs. this should be of a particular concern in a drug regulatory context. randomized clinical trials with borderline significant results should perhaps be required to report p values calculated by all three methods, in order to properly evaluate drug efficacy. an interactive ms excel spreadsheet that uses all three logrank test variants is prepared as a supplementary file accompanying.this article. association of high grade of bone marrow fibrosis with poor outcome in patients with myelofibrosis is used as an example.
cancer	although bcr-abl is the hallmark genetic abnormality of chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), secondary molecular events responsible for the evolution of the disease to blast crisis are yet to be deciphered. taking into account the significant association of ecotropic viral integration site i (evi1) in cml drug resistance, it is necessary to decipher the other roles played by evi1 in cml disease progression. in this regard, we cross-hybridized three microarray datasets and deduced a set of 11 genes that seems to be regulated by evi1 in cml. we observed a strong correlation between evi1 and alpha1, 6-fucosyltransferase (fut8) in the chronic phase of the disease and both of them were found to be up-regulated with the progression of the disease. knockdown of evi1 in a cml cell line not only down-regulated fut8, but also rendered the cells towards erythroid differentiation. our study shows the involvement of evi1 and fut8 axis in blocking erythropoiesis in cml.
hypothyroidism	objectives to analyse the prevalence of hypothyroidism in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients and to elucidate its correlation with disease activity. methods a total of 52 ra patients were enrolled in this study. all patients were assessed fully clinically and underwent routine laboratory investigation including thyroid function testing. results hypothyroidism (defined as having a tsh level >4.20iu/ml) was observed in 20/52 (38.4%). erythrocyte sedimentation rates (esr) were found significantly elevated in patients with hypothyroidism compared to those without (36.324.2 vs. 24.6 +/- 9.0mm/h). disease activity parameters such as das-28-esr, tender joint count; vas scores were also significantly higher in the former. a significant correlation with serum tsh levels was observed with esr and das-28-esr. conclusion thyroid function test should be included in clinical evaluation of ra patients.
alzheimer's_disease	aging associated brain decline often result in some kind of dementia. even when this is a complex brain disorder a physical model can be used in order to describe its general behavior. a probabilistic model for the development of dementia is obtained and fitted to some experimental data obtained from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative. it is explained how dementia appears as a consequence of aging and why it is irreversible.

menopause	sleep complaints are reported by 40-60 % of menopausal women. poor sleep is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. the effect of menopausal hormone therapy on sleep quality is unclear. a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the efficacy of menopausal hormone therapy on self-reported sleep quality. electronic databases (pubmed, scopus, ovid medline, embase, ebm reviews central, and psycinfo) were searched from 2002 to october 2015. randomized trials assessing the effect of menopausal hormone therapy with a minimum follow up of 8 weeks were included. titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently and in duplicate. primary outcome included sleep items within a questionnaire, scale or diary. standardized mean differences across trials were pooled using random-effects models. the search identified 424 articles, from which 42 trials were included. seven trials at a moderate to high risk of bias enrolling 15,468 women were pooled in meta-analysis. menopausal hormone therapy improved sleep quality in women who had vasomotor symptoms at baseline [standardized mean difference -0.54 (-0.91 to -0.18), moderate quality evidence]. no difference was noted when women without such symptoms were analyzed separately or combined. across 31 sleep quality questionnaires, daytime dysfunction was the most evaluated sleep domain. menopausal hormone therapy improves sleep in women with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. heterogeneity of trials regarding study population, formulations, and sleep scales; limit overall certainty in the evidence. future menopausal hormone therapy trials should include assessment of self-reported sleep quality using standardized scales and adhere to reporting guidelines.
diabetes	cancer immune checkpoint therapy has achieved remarkable clinical successes in various cancers. however, current immune checkpoint inhibitors block the checkpoint of not only the immune cells that are important to canter therapy but also the immune cells that are irrelevant to the therapy. such an indiscriminate blockade limits the efficacy and causes the autoimmune toxicity of the therapy. it might be beneficial to use a carrier to target immune checkpoint inhibitors to cancer reactive immune cells. here, we explore a method to load the inhibitors into carriers. we used the anti-programmed death-1 antibody (alpha pd-1) as a model immune checkpoint inhibitor. first, we generated a recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scfv) of apd-1. then, we designed and generated a fusion protein consisting of the scfv and an amphiphilic immune-tolerant elastin-like polypeptide (itep). because of the amphiphilic itep, the fusion was able to self-assemble into a nanoparticle (np). the np was proved to block the pd-1 immune checkpoint in vitro and in vivo. particularly, the np exacerbated diabetes development in nonobese diabetic mice as effectively as natural, intact apd-1. in summary, we successfully expressed apd-1 as a recombinant protein and linked apd-1 to a np, which lays a foundation to develop a delivery system to target apd-1 to a subpopulation of immune cells.
diabetes	purpose thyroid concentrates radioactive iodine by sodium-iodide symporter; this is used for treating hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. pancreas expresses nis and radioactive iodine uptake may damage pancreatic beta-cells and predispose patients to type 2 diabetes. the aim of this study was to determine whether radioactive iodine is associated with glucose metabolism in thyroidectomized rats. methods forty male wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 10/each); control, thyroidectomized, thyroidectomized-treated with 131-i (tx+i), and thyroidectomized-treated with 131-i and l-thyroxine (tx+i+t-4). at the end of study, serum fasting glucose, insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free tetraiodothyronine were measured, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance was calculated. in in vitro experiments, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islets and sodium-iodide symporter mrna expression in thyroid and islets were determined. results compared to control group, free tetraiodothyronine was lower by 41 and 77% and thyroid-stimulating hormone was higher by 36 and 126% in thyroidectomized and tx+i groups, respectively. compared to controls, rats in tx+i group had glucose intolerance as assessed using the area under curve of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (12,376 +/- 542 vs. 20,769 +/- 1070, p < 0.001) and l-thyroxine replacement therapy restored the value (14,286 +/- 328.24) to near normal. fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance were comparable in all groups, however fasting glucose was higher in tx+i group. in in vitro experiments, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islets did not differ between groups. conclusion radioactive iodine therapy per se had no effect on glucose metabolism, just intensified thyroid hormone deficiency and the alterations on glucose metabolism in thyroidectomized rats. l-thyroxine therapy restored the glucose intolerance observed in radioactive iodine-treated thyroidectomized rats.
fungal_infection	rna silencing is a conserved mechanism that utilizes small rnas (srnas) to direct the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. plants utilizing rna silencing machinery to defend pathogen infection was first identified in plant-virus interaction and later was observed in distinct plant-pathogen interactions. rna silencing is not only responsible for suppressing rna accumulation and movement of virus and viroid, but also facilitates plant immune responses against bacterial, oomycete, and fungal infection. interestingly, even the same plant srna can perform different roles when encounters with different pathogens. on the other side, pathogens counteract by generating srnas that directly regulate pathogen gene expression to increase virulence or target host genes to facilitate pathogen infection. here, we summarize the current knowledge of the characterization and biogenesis of host and pathogen-derived srnas, as well as the different rna silencing machineries that plants utilize to defend against different pathogens. the functions of these srnas in defense and counter-defense and their mechanisms for regulation during different plant-pathogen interactions are also discussed.
multiple_sclerosis	semaphorin 3a (sema3a) as an immune modulator could participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. in the current study, we aimed to investigate sema3a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and its serum level in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) patients. fifteen newly determined and untreated rrms patients were chosen and assessed in relapsing and remitting phases in compare with fifteen healthy individuals. in consistent with previous findings in other autoimmune diseases, our results revealed that serum level of sema3a and its expression in pbmcs of rrms patients were significantly lower than in normal subjects. we also evaluated this down regulation predictive value with roc analysis. according to our data, we suggest that sema3a could be involved in pathogenesis of ms and might be a potential diagnostic biomarker for the disease.

parenting	objectiveswhile health promotion and patient education are central to the scope of practice of professional nurses, they often feel ill-equipped to assume the role of sexual health educator and lack adequate knowledge and skills to effectively engage parents in adolescent sexual and reproductive health efforts. design and sampleemploying a mixed-methods study consisting of both pre- and post-test survey and exit interviews, a pilot study was conducted to assess the impact of implementing a parent-based adolescent sexual health intervention on baccalaureate nursing student outcomes (n = 31). resultswe found statistically significant improvements in student outcome expectancies of parenting strategies, barriers to sexual health communication, self-efficacy, and sexual health counseling experience. using thematic content analysis of exit interview content, emerging themes were (1) need for increased sexual and reproductive health (srh) preparation, (2) wanting greater experience and opportunity for involvement in nursing research, and (3) educational gaps in family-focused community public health. conclusionsincorporating adolescent sexual health education into public health nursing clinical training can prepare nurses as parent-based adolescent sexual health educators, a core competency for nurses working with families in communities and across all health care delivery settings.
diabetes	the spontaneously diabetic toni (sdt) rat is a rat model of nonobese type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hepatocellular adenomas have not been reported in this model. we report a hepatocellular adenoma with severe fatty change in a male 42-week-old sdt rat fed a high-fat diet. at necropsy, the animal had a whitish nodular mass of approximately 2 cm in diameter in the right medial lobe. histologically, the mass was well demarcated from the surrounding tissues, slightly compressing the adjacent hepatic parenchyma and widely compartmented by fibrous connective tissues. the mass consisted of vacuolated tumor cells resembling hepatocytes with a solid and occasionally trabecular growth pattern. abundant neutral lipids, which were positive for fat with oil red 0 stain and which ultra structurally had moderately dense material, were contained within the vacuoles of the tumor cells. immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed an increase in immunoreactivity or number for cytokeratin 8/18 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen but were negative for mesenchymal markers. from these findings, the mass could be distinguished from hepatocellular hyperplasia and was diagnosed as hepatocellular adenoma. in rats, hepatocellular adenoma accompanied by severe fatty change is rare, and this is the first report of a hepatocellular tumor with severe fatty change in a sdt rat.
myelofibrosis	philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn) comprise a heterogeneous group of chronic hematological malignancies with significant variations in clinical characteristics. due to the long survival and the feasibility of oral or subcutaneous therapy, these patients are frequently treated outside of larger academic centers. this analysis was performed to elucidate differences in mpn patients in three different health care settings: university hospitals (uh), community hospitals (ch), and office-based physicians (obp). the mpn registry of the study alliance leukemia is a non-interventional prospective study including adult patients with an mpn according to who criteria (2008). for statistical analysis, descriptive methods and tests for significant differences were used. besides a different distribution of mpn subtypes between the settings, patients contributed by uh showed an impaired medical condition, a higher comorbidity burden, and more vascular complications. in the risk group analyses, the majority of polycythemia vera (pv) and essential thrombocythemia (et) patients from uh were classified into the high-risk category due to previous vascular events, while for pv and et patients in the ch and obp settings, age was the major parameter for a high-risk categorization. regarding mpn-directed therapy, pv patients from the uh setting were more likely to receive ruxolitinib within the framework of a clinical trial. in summary, the characteristics and management of patients differed significantly between the three health care settings with a higher burden of vascular events and comorbidities in patients contributed by uh. these differences need to be taken into account for further analyses and design of clinical trials.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundpatients with ehlers-danlos syndromehypermobility type (eds-ht) have increased prevalence of gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms, particularly reflux and dyspepsia. eds-ht is associated with dysautonomia, psychopathology, and chronic pain which can be associated with gi symptoms. the association between gi symptoms and eds-ht in a non-patient' population and the effect of the above-mentioned factors has never been studied. methodsin a cross sectional study, a hypermobility questionnaire was used to screen university students; further clinical examination established the diagnosis of eds-ht. validated questionnaires assessed for gi, somatic, pain and autonomic symptoms, psychopathology and quality of life (qol). these were compared in students with and without eds-ht; logistic regression analysis examined associations between eds-ht, gi symptoms and other variables. key resultsof 1998 students screened, 162 were included: 74 eds-ht (21.0years, 53% female) vs 88 non-eds-ht (21.5years, 65% female). compared to non-eds-ht students, eds-ht students were more likely to have multiple gi symptoms (41.9% vs 27.3% p=.05), particularly postprandial fullness (34.4% vs 15.9%, p=.01) and early satiety (32% vs 17%, p=.03), greater autonomic (p.8). the association between eds-ht and postprandial symptoms was dependent on autonomic factors but independent of pain and psychopathology. pain-related qol scores were reduced in the eds-ht group (80 vs 90, p=.03). conclusions and inferencesthe previously described association between eds-ht, dyspepsia, pain and autonomic symptoms in patients is also present in non-patient groups. future studies are necessary to explore the etiological role of connective tissue in gi and extra intestinal symptoms.
emergency_contraception	the world health organization (who) and the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) provide recommendations for use of emergency contraceptive pills (ecps), including levonorgestrel (lng) and combined oral contraceptives (cocs). a new ecp formulation, ulipristal acetate (upa), is now available worldwide. to determine whether lng, upa or coc (yuzpe) ecps are safe for women with certain characteristics or medical conditions, we searched the pubmed and cochrane databases for articles published from date of inception until may 2015 pertaining to the safety of lng, upa or yuzpe ecp use. for direct evidence, we considered studies that looked at safety outcomes among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics taking ecps compared with women not taking ecps. for indirect evidence, we considered studies that reported pharmacokinetic (pk) data for ecp use among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics and studies that reported safety outcomes among healthy women taking ecps. five studies provided direct evidence; of these five studies, four examined lng or yuzpe use among pregnant or breastfeeding women, and one reported risk of ectopic pregnancy among women repeatedly using lng ecps. poor pregnancy outcomes were rare among pregnant women who used lng or yuzpe ecps during the conception cycle or early pregnancy. breastfeeding outcomes did not differ between women exposed to lng ecp and those unexposed, and there was no increased risk of ectopic pregnancy versus intrauterine pregnancy after repeated use of lng ecps compared with nonuse. forty-five studies provided indirect evidence. one pk study demonstrated that lng passes into breastmilk but in minimal quantities. hi addition, nine studies examined pregnancy outcomes following ecp failure among healthy women, and 35 articles reported adverse events. studies suggest that serious adverse events are rare among women taking any of these ecp formulations. implications: evidence on safety of ecps among women with characteristics or medical conditions listed within who and cdc family planning guidance is limited. however, both direct and indirect evidence for our study question did not suggest any special safety concerns for the use of ecps among women with particular medical conditions or personal characteristics, such as pregnancy, lactation or frequent ecp use. published by elsevier inc.
headache	objective: to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of tadalafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) in real-world clinical practice.methods: this prospective, multicenter, noninterventional, post-marketing surveillance included patients with pah who were observed for up to 2 years after initiation of tadalafil. safety was assessed by analyzing the frequency of adverse drug reactions (adrs), discontinuations due to adverse events (aes), and serious adverse drug reactions (sadrs). effectiveness measurements included the assessment of the change in world health organization (who) functional classification of pah, 6-minute walk test, cardiac catheterization, and echocardiography.results: among 1676 patients analyzed for safety, the overall incidence of adrs was 31.2%. the common adrs (1.0%) were headache (7.0%), diarrhea (1.9%), platelet count decreased (1.8%), anemia, epistaxis, and nausea (1.6% each), flushing (1.3%), hepatic function abnormal (1.1%), hot flush, and myalgia (1.0% each). the common sadrs (0.3%) were cardiac failure (0.7%), interstitial lung disease, worsening of pah, and platelet count decreased (0.3% each). among 1556 patients analyzed for effectiveness, the percentages of patients with improvement of who functional class at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after the initiation of tadalafil, and last observation were 17.1%, 24.8%, 28.9%, and 22.5%, respectively. at all observation points (except pulmonary regurgitation pressure gradient at end diastole at 3 months), the mean 6-minute walk distance, cardiac catheterization, and echocardiogram measurements showed statistically significant improvement.conclusion: this surveillance demonstrated that tadalafil has favorable safety and effectiveness profiles for long-term use in patients with pah in japan.
fungal_infection	backgroundposaconazole is the most active available azole antifungal drug, but absorption and pharmacokinetics are not available to guide dosing regimens in cats. objectiveto determine the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole in cats given an iv solution and po suspension. animalssix healthy, adult research cats. methodsafter a 12-hour fast, each cat received 15 mg/kg of posaconazole po suspension with food. four cats also received 3 mg/kg iv posaconazole after a 7-day washout period. plasma was collected at predetermined intervals for analysis using high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc). concentration data were analyzed using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic analysis for iv administration data and a 1-compartment analysis with first-order input for po administration data using phoenix((r)) software. resultsafter iv dosing, volume of distribution (v-ss) was 1.9 (0.3) l/kg (mean, standard deviation), terminal half-life (t-1/2) was 57.7 (28.4) hours, and clearance was 28.1 (17.3) ml/kg/h. after po dosing, peak concentration (c-max) was 1.2 (0.5) g/ml and t-1/2 was 38.1 (15.0) hours. bioavailability of po suspension was 15.9% (8.6). no adverse effects were observed with either route of administration. conclusion and clinical importancedespite low po absorption, these data allow for simulation of po dosage regimens that could be explored in clinical studies. two regimens can be considered to maintain targeted trough concentrations of 0.5-0.7 g/ml as extrapolated from studies in humans: (1) 30 mg/kg po loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg q48h, or (2) 15 mg/kg po loading dose followed by 7.5 mg/kg q24h.
hepatitis_c	the mechanism of early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is not well understood. to examine whether early intrahepatic metastasis of hcc can be determined by the reliable molecular characteristics of the primary hcc, we focused on early-stage tumors of primary and solitary hcc cases. proteomic differences were investigated between two groups, 11 early (recurrence within 12 months) and 10 late (no recurrence within 48 months) hcc cases, using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. overall, 10 upregulated and 9 downregulated proteins were identified from a total of 1623 protein spots detected in early recurrent hcc. cluster analysis using the 19 proteins successfully divided the 21 hcc samples exactly into the two above groups. a multifunctional protein, transglutaminase 2 (tgm2), was upregulated in the early recurrence group. immunohistochemistry revealed the frequent observation of tgm2-positive hcc cells in the early group, with a tendency of tgm2-positive staining in hcc cells adjacent to fibrous stroma. to examine whether two major tgm2-associated pathways, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) and integrin signaling, were activated in the early recurrence group of hcc, downstream molecules of tgm2 were measured. the mrna level of emt-related genes was highly positively correlated with tgm2 mrna. however, e-cadherin (cdh1) mrna and protein were not downregulated in correlation with tgm2 expression. the phosphorylation of fak and akt and the downregulation of pten were not associated with the quantity of tgm2. therefore, tgm2 might contribute to early hcc recurrence through signaling pathways not related to emt and integrin signaling. the proteomics of strictly classified hccs would be useful for characterizing pro-metastatic hcc and for developing a new therapeutic target for treatment of metastasis.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive loss of cognition. over 35 million individuals currently have ad worldwide. unfortunately, current therapies are limited to very modest symptomatic relief. the brains of ad patients are characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. ad brains also show neurodegeneration and high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (cbd) possesses neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces amyloid-beta production and tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro. cbd has also been shown to be effective in vivo making the phytocannabinoid an interesting candidate for novel therapeutic interventions in ad, especially as it lacks psychoactive or cognition-impairing properties. cbd treatment would be in line with preventative, multimodal drug strategies targeting a combination of pathological symptoms, which might be ideal for ad therapy. thus, this review will present a brief introduction to ad biology and current treatment options before outlining comprehensively cbd biology and pharmacology, followed by in-vitro and in-vivo evidence for the therapeutic potential of cbd. we will also discuss the role of the endocannabinioid system in ad before commenting on the potential future of cbd for ad therapy (including safety aspects).

skin_care	background: the skin of extremely preterm infants is underdeveloped and has poor barrier function. skin maintenance interventions initiated in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) have immediate and lifelong implications when the potential for infection, allergen sensitization, and altered aesthetic outcomes are considered. in addition, the high-level medical needs of extremely preterm infants demand skin-level medical interventions that too often result in unintended skin harm. purpose: we describe the use of a harm prevention, or consequence-centered, approach to skin care, which facilitates safer practice for extremely premature infants. method: neonatal and pediatric advanced practice registered nurses (aprn) came together for monthly meetings to review the evidence around best skin care practices for extremely preterm infants, with an emphasis on reduction of skin harm. findings were focused on the population of interest and clinical implementation strategies. findings: skin care for extremely preterm infants remains overlooked by current literature. however, clinical practice pearls were extracted and applied in a manner that promotes safer skin care practices in the nicu. implications for practice: gentle adhesives, such as silicone tapes and hydrogel-backed electrodes, can help to reduce medical adhesive-related skin injuries. diaper wipes are not appropriate for use among extremely preterm infants, as many ingredients may contain potential allergens. skin cleansers should be ph neutral to the skin and the prophylactic use of petrolatum-based emollients should be avoided. implications for research: further exploration and understanding of skin care practices that examine issues of true risk versus hypothetical risk of harm.
allergies	the systemic administration of opioids leads to potentially severe and undesirable and side effects like sedation and drowsiness, vomiting and nausea, allergies, respiratory depression, and neutrophil dysfunction. the application of nanotechnology in medical field has drawn a great attention in recent times. several treatments available are tedious and expensive. application of nanotechnology brings about faster cure and cost effectiveness. nanoliposomes are one of the widely used names for nanoparticles used in medicine. recently, nanoliposomes are used as a crucial novel drug delivery systems. the use of nanoliposomal formulation brings about a good results to pain control, rapid patient recovery, increased patient comfort, treatment costs reduction, and shortens length of hospitalization. this review presents a brief description about the achievements in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology related to the application of nanoliposomes in anesthesia.

sprains_and_strains	background: wildland fires cost billions of dollars annually and expose thousands of firefighters to a variety of occupational hazards. little is known about injury patterns among wildland firefighters. methods: we examined non-fatal firefighter injuries among federal wildland firefighters reported to the us department of the interior for the years 2003-2007. the risk of disabling injury by job assignment, controlling for demographic and temporal variables, was assessed with logistic regression. results: of the 1301 non-fatal injuries, slips, trips, and falls were the most frequent injury types and sprains/strains were the most common injury. engine crew workers suffered a third of all injuries. handcrews and helitak/smokejumper assignments had increased odds of sprains and strains, which were the most common injury overall. conclusions: while some injuries are equally prevalent by job assignment, others vary. identifying hazards leading to these injuries will be essential to develop prevention strategies.
heart_disease	aims we aimed to analyse trends in annual incidence of hospitalized acute coronary syndrome (acs) in france from 2004 to 2014 methods and results primary diagnosis of acs and subtypes on admissions were selected in national and exhaustive french hospitalization database from 2004 to 2014. age-standardized rates were computed using standardization on the census of the 2010 european population and mean annual percent changes were estimated by using poisson regression model. in 2014, 113 407 patients, 36 480 women (32.2%) and 76 927 men (67.8%) were hospitalized for acs. among women, the proportion aged under 65 years was 25.2% (n = 9206) and there was 34.4% of stemi, 18.2% of nstemi and 47.4% of ua. from 2004 to 2014, the rates of age-standardized admissions for acs in women less than 65 years old increased by 6.3%. this rise in acs was driven by significant increases in stemi (+/- 21.7%) and nstemi (+/- 53.7%). the largest increase in stemi mean annual percent change was observed among women aged 45-54 years old (+/- 3.6%/ per year). after 65 years of age, significant decreases in all acs types were observed conclusion this nationwide study showed substantial rising trends in stemi annual incidence, especially among younger women. this increase could be attributed to increase in smoking and obesity. efforts to strengthen primary prevention of cvd in younger women is needed as the main risk factors are modifiable, and as there is a growing evidence of higher short-term mortality of chd in women.
low_testosterone	purpose to determine the dose-dependent effects of testosterone administration on cognition in women with low testosterone levels. methods 71 hysterectomized women with or without oophorectomy with total testosterone <31 ng/dl and/or free testosterone <3.5 pg/ml received a standardized transdermal estradiol regimen during the 12-week run-in period and were then randomized to receive weekly intramuscular injections of placebo, 3, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg testosterone enanthate for 24 weeks. total testosterone was measured in serum by lc-ms/ms, and free testosterone levels were measured by equilibrium dialysis. cognitive function was evaluated using a comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests at baseline and 24 weeks. results 46 women who had baseline and end-of-treatment cognitive function data constituted the analytic sample. the five groups were similar at baseline. mean on-treatment nadir total testosterone concentrations were 15, 89, 98, 134, and 234 ng/dl in the placebo, 3, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg groups, respectively. no significant changes in spatial ability, verbal fluency, verbal memory, or executive function were observed in any treatment arm compared to placebo even after adjustment for baseline cognitive function, age, and education. multiple regression analysis did not show any significant relation between changes in testosterone concentrations and change in cognitive function scores. conclusion short-term testosterone administration over a wide range of doses for 24 weeks in women with low testosterone levels was neither associated with improvements nor worsening of cognitive function.
hepatitis_c	the aim of the study was to evaluate the association between the gene polymorphisms in interleukin-10 (il-10) and interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) genes with susceptibility and severity of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection among egyptian patients. interleukin-10 -592 a/c, -1082 g/a and ifn-gamma + 874 t/a genotypes were determined in 100 chronic hcv patients and 50 healthy controls using restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and the amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (arms-pcr) respectively. il-10 -592 a/c polymorphism genotyping revealed that the frequency of cc genotype was significantly higher in chronic hcv patients than in controls (58% versus 30%, p < 0.05). regarding il-10 -1082 g/a polymorphism genotyping, a higher frequency of gg genotype was found in chronic hcv patients compared to controls (31% versus 10%, p < 0.05). ifn-gamma + 874 t/a genotyping showed that tt genotype was significantly higher in chronic hcv participants than controls (31% versus 18%, p< 0.05), while a higher frequency of t allele was found in cirrhotic patients compared to noncirrhotic patients (p< 0.05). our observations suggested that il-10 -592 a/c, -1082 g/a, and ifn-gamma + 874 t/a polymorphisms had a strong association with susceptibility to hcv infection. however, no significant association was observed between the cytokines (il-10 and ifn-gamma) genotypes profile and hcv-liver cirrhosis risk in the studied population, except for the high frequency of ifn-gamma + 874 t allele in cirrhotic patients.
parenting	parent training is an effective intervention for parents of children with a variety of childhood disorders, including conduct problems, and parents often view behavioral parent training as acceptable. explanations and rationales for parent training are commonly provided at the beginning of treatment. the purpose of this study was to determine whether changing the description of a behavioral parenting intervention influenced parents' acceptability ratings and whether mothers and fathers differed in their ratings. there were 78 participants (39 mother-father dyads) in this study. participants viewed one of two descriptions of parent training that focused on either addressing deficits in parenting skills or enhancing existing parenting skills. parents' acceptability of the treatment descriptions was evaluated using the treatment evaluation inventory-short form. participants also completed the eyberg child behavior inventory and the parental locus of control scale. a multiple linear regression and a mixed factorial anova were used to analyze the data. there was not a significant interaction between parent gender and parent training description type. there was also not a significant difference in the acceptability of the two parent training descriptions. however, mothers rated both treatment descriptions as more acceptable than did fathers. results indicated that parental locus of control significantly predicted acceptability of the parent training descriptions. the results of the current study suggested that treatment acceptability was not influenced by the way that the interventions were described. future research should focus on how to increase acceptability of parent training for fathers and parents with an external locus of control.
senior_health	background: evidence-informed policymaking is more likely if organisations have cultures that promote research use and invest in resources that facilitate staff engagement with research. measures of organisations' research use culture and capacity are needed to assess current capacity, identify opportunities for improvement, and examine the impact of capacity-building interventions. the aim of the current study was to develop a comprehensive system to measure and score organisations' capacity to engage with and use research in policymaking, which we entitled oracle (organisational research access, culture, and leadership). method: we used a multifaceted approach to develop oracle. firstly, we reviewed the available literature to identify key domains of organisational tools and systems that may facilitate research use by staff. we interviewed senior health policymakers to verify the relevance and applicability of these domains. this information was used to generate an interview schedule that focused on seven key domains of organisational capacity. the interview was pilot-tested within four australian policy agencies. a discrete choice experiment (dce) was then undertaken using an expert sample to establish the relative importance of these domains. this data was used to produce a scoring system for oracle. results: the oracle interview was developed, comprised of 23 questions addressing seven domains of organisational capacity and tools that support research use, including (1) documented processes for policymaking; (2) leadership training; (3) staff training; (4) research resources (e.g. database access); and systems to (5) generate new research, (6) undertake evaluations, and (7) strengthen relationships with researchers. from the dce data, a conditional logit model was estimated to calculate total scores that took into account the relative importance of the seven domains. the model indicated that our expert sample placed the greatest importance on domains (2), (3) and (4). conclusion: we utilised qualitative and quantitative methods to develop a system to assess and score organisations ' capacity to engage with and apply research to policy. our measure assesses a broad range of capacity domains and identifies the relative importance of these capacities. oracle data can be used by organisations keen to increase their use of evidence to identify areas for further development.
cancer	patients with suspected hereditary renal cell cancer (rcc) are under-referred for genetic evaluation. characterizing the prevalence and characteristics of suspected inherited rcc is a crucial step toward advancing personalized, genetically-based cancer risk management for patients and their families. to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of suspected inherited rcc syndromes based on consensus criteria, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients with a diagnosis of rcc in seer (2001-2011, n = 105,754) and in our institutional cancer registry (2004-2013, n = 998). consensus criteria for referral of patients with rcc for genetic evaluation from the american college of medical genetics and genomics and national society of genetic counselors (acmg/nsgc) were applied to the two cohorts. the associations between meeting referral criteria with demographic characteristics were assessed with chi-square tests. overall, 24.0 % of the seer cohort and 33.7 % of our institutional cohort met acmg/nsgc referral criteria for genetic counseling. while white patients more commonly met early onset clear cell rcc criteria, black patients met papillary rcc criteria at twice the rate of whites in both cohorts (p < 0.0001). as many as 1 in 5 individuals with rcc meet referral criteria for genetic evaluation based on newly emerging guidelines, with differences in pathology noted by race. prospective genetic testing studies utilizing emerging referral guidelines should help to refine the genetic spectrum of inherited kidney cancer. this study supports efforts to increase awareness of referral of patients with rcc for genetic counseling particularly among urologic providers.
emergency_contraception	study question: do ulipristal acetate (upa) and mifepristone have an effect on ciliary beat frequency and muscular contractions in the human fallopian tube? summary answer: upa, in resemblance to mifepristone, inhibits ciliary beat and muscular contraction of the human fallopian tube, probably through an agonistic effect on the tubal progesterone receptor. what is known already: upa, like mifepristone, acts as an emergency contraceptive mainly by inhibiting ovulation. little is known about its effects on tubal function. study design, size, duration: this was an in vitro experimental study using fallopian tube samples collected from 11 women undergoing hysterectomy for benign non-tubal gynaecological conditions. participants/materials, setting, methods: the tubal epithelium and longitudinal smooth muscle fibres were isolated, cultured and treated with upa at graded concentrations of 0, 20, 200 and 2000 ng/ml, and mifepristone at graded concentrations of 0, 300, 3000 and 30 000 ng/ml, respectively. after treatment, ciliary beat frequency was determined using a photometric method. basal tone, amplitude and frequency of muscular contraction were recorded through a force transducer. the mrna expression of progesterone receptor (total and pr-b isoform), glycodelin and adrenomedullin were determined by real-time quantitative pcr. main results and the role of chance: there was an overall dose-dependent suppressive effect on ciliary beat frequency (p < 0.0001) after treatment with upa at all concentrations and with mifepristone at 3000 ng/ml or above. the basal tone, amplitude and frequency of muscular contractions were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after treatment with upa at 200 ng/ml or above, and with mifepristone at 3000 ng/ml or above. upa treatment at 200 ng/ml or above significantly up-regulated the mrna expression of progesterone receptor and glycodelin and down-regulated the mrna expression of adrenomedullin in fallopian tube tissue (p < 0.05). limitations, reasons for caution: whether or not the tubal effect may translate into additional mechanisms for contraceptive action in vivo is uncertain. wider implications of the findings: the clinical relevance of upa with regard to contraceptive activity is worthy of further exploration. study funding/competing interest(s): the study was supported by a seed fund from the centre of reproduction, development and growth, faculty of medicine, the university of hong kong. all authors have no competing interest to declare.
birth_control	objectives: to understand women 's preferences for specific features of contraceptive methods, the extent to which features of existing methods match women 's preferences and whether this match differs by racial and ethnic subgroups. study design: using data from 1783 women in family planning and abortion clinics across the united states, we performed analyses of racial and ethnic differences in contraceptive features reported to be ""extremely important"" by participants. we explored how preferences vary for more and less effective contraceptive methods. results: in multivariate analysis, non-hispanic black, latinas and asian pacific islander women were more likely to report the following features as extremely important compared to non-hispanic whites (p<0.05): being able to stop using the method at any time, using a method only with intercourse and the method not changing her menstrual periods. non-hispanic black and latina women were statistically more likely to report that protection against sexually transmitted diseases, having control over when and whether to use the method and being able to become pregnant after stopping use were extremely important. the contraceptive feature preferences of racial and ethnic minority women in our study had a relatively lower match with high efficacy methods and higher match for low efficacy methods compared to white women (p<0.05). conclusions: high rates of unintended pregnancy among minority women may be due in part to differences in contraceptive features preferences and discrepancy between their preferences and the features of currently available highly effective methods.

polycythemia_vera	objectives: calreticulin (calr) mutations are present in 50% to 85% of jak2/mpl wild-type (wt) myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns). the histopathologic features of calr-mutated mpns are unknown. methods: we identified 71 patients with essential thrombocythemia (et), primary myelofibrosis (pmf), and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-et mf) with available calr status. calr was assessed using capillary electrophoresis followed by sanger sequencing confirmation. calr status was correlated with histopathologic features. results: the megakaryocytes of calr-mutated pmf more often were hyperchromatic (20/21) compared with calr-wt cases (10/14) (p = .05). calr-mutated et showed more megakagocytic clustering (7/7) compared with calr-wt cases (5/9) (p = .03). megakalyocytes of calr-mutated post-et mf (8/8) had a predominance of convoluted nuclei compared with calr-wt cases (2/4) (p = .03). calr mutations were more frequent in post-et mf compared with et (p = .04). conclusions: calr-mutated mpns have a higher frequency of megakaryocytic aberrancies compared with calr-wt cases. patients with calr-mutated et appear to be more likely to develop myelofibrosis compared with patients with wt calr.
polycythemia_vera	classic ""bcr-abl1-negative'' mpn is an operational sub-category of mpn that includes polycythemia vera (pv), essential thrombocythemia (et), and primary myelofibrosis (pmf) harboring jak2v617f as the most common mutation. jak2v617f can be detected in about 95 % of patients with pv while remaining 5 % of pv patients carry a somatic mutation of jak2 exon 12. approximately one-third of patients with et or pmf do not carry any mutation in jak2 or mpl. in december 2013, mutations were described in calreticulin (calr) gene in 67-71 and 56-88 % of jak2v617f and mpl negative patients with et and pmf, respectively. since this discovery calr mutations have been reported to be mutually exclusive with jak2v617f or mpl mutations. however recently few studies (eleven published reports) reported the coexistence of jak2v617f and calr in mpn. in the present study we are reporting jak2v617f positive et patient from our center with coexisting calr exon 9 mutation type c.1214_1225del12 (p.e405_d408del) that was never reported before as a coexisting mutation and describing in detail the clinical outcomes.
birth_control	purpose: to explore how attitudes, norms, behaviors, responses to early life experiences, and protective factors influence pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection risks from the perspectives of current and former foster youth to inform the development of prevention strategies. methods: we conducted semi-structured individual qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of 22 current/former foster youth aged 15-21 years (63% female; average age = 18.6 years). we then used theoretical thematic analysis to systematically analyze the data for key themes related to sexual health in four categories: 1) norms and attitudes, 2) responses to early life experiences, 3) protective factors, and 4) youth-driven intervention ideas. results: participants reported a range of sexual experience levels, varied sexual orientations, and also reported varied life experiences prior to and during foster care. we detected several norms and attitudes that likely contribute to risks of early pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. these included that one can tell by looking whether a partner is trustworthy or has a sexually transmitted infection, that condoms are n't necessary with long-term or infrequent partners or if birth control is used, and that teen pregnancy is an inevitable event. with respect to responses to early life experiences, youth frequently described difficulties dealing with strong emotions in the context of romantic and/or sexual relationships; many attributed these difficulties to early experiences with biological family members or in foster care. participants linked emotion regulation difficulties with struggles in trust appraisal, effective communication, and impulsive behaviors. youth also described a variety of protective factors that they felt helped them prevent sexual risk behaviors or improved their lives in other respects. finally, participants endorsed factors likely to improve intervention acceptability and efficacy, including an open, non-judgmental group-based environment, involvement of peer mentors, and inclusion of caregiver and caseworker training components. conclusions: trauma-informed, tailored intervention strategies which address key norms and attitudes and provide broad-based assertiveness and emotion regulation skills are likely to be the most effective strategies to reduce risks of teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections among teens in foster care. group-based interventions that involve peer mentors and caregiver and caseworker components may be especially acceptable and effective for teens in foster and/or kinship care.

fungal_infection	invasive fungal infection is a problem that continues to challenge the healthcare sector. new antifungals and new therapeutic strategies are needed to address this challenge. we previously reported that the combination of a synthetic compound with a drug with known mechanism of action is a good strategy to treat aggressive and resistant fungi. here we revisited our approach and synthesized structural analogues of flucytosine, which is a synthetic antifungal and is being studied for its use in combination therapy with other antifungal drugs. pyrimidin-one and thione (often known as dhpm ' s) as flucytosine analogues were obtained through a biginelli reaction of corresponding aldehydes, ethylacetoacetate and urea/thiourea. structure was confirmed by ftir, 1hnmr, (cnmr)-c-13, cosy and ms (esi+) analysis. all the newly synthesized derivatives were evaluated for the antifungal activity alone and in combination of two most commonly used antifungal drugs, amphotericin b and fluconazole against different clinically isolated candida albicans strains. minimum inhibitory concentration results confirmed that bg4 possess high antifungal activity against all the tested strains (mic = 1-32 pg/ml). for all the combinations with amphotericin b and fluconazole, 37% were synergistic followed by 30% additive and 24% indifferent interactions. interestingly, 9% antagonistic interaction was observed when bg1 and bg3 were combined with fluconazole, however, no antagonistic interaction was observed with amphotericin b. in-depth studies of all the synergies were done by constructing isobolograms with nine different ratio combinations. these results warrant the use of dhpm derivatives as chemosensitising agents which could lower down the dosages of the antifungal drugs to treat invasive fungal diseases.

menopause	the plant flavonoid isoliquiritigenin (isl) is a botanical estrogen widely taken as an herbal supplement to ease the symptoms of menopause. isl has been also shown to have anti-tumor properties in a number of cancer cell backgrounds. however, the effects of isl on normal cells are less well known and virtually unstudied in the context of the pituitary gland. we have established a pituitary explant culture model to screen chemical agents for gene expression changes within the pituitary gland during a period of active proliferation and differentiation. using this whole-organ culture system we found isl to be weakly estrogenic based on its ability to induce cckar mrna expression, an estrogen receptor (er) mediated gene. using a range of isl from 200 nm to 200 nm, we discovered that isl promoted cell proliferation at a low concentration, yet potently inhibited proliferation at the highest concentration. ici182,780 failed to antagonize isl 's repression of pituitary cell proliferation, indicating the effect is independent of er signaling. coincident with a decrease in proliferating cells, we observed down-regulation of transcript for cyclin d2 and e2 and a strong induction of mrna and protein for the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor cdkn1a (p21). importantly, high dose isl did not alter the balance of progenitor vs. differentiated cell types within the pituitary explants and they seemed otherwise healthy; however, tunel staining revealed an increase in apoptotic cell death in isl treated cultures. our results merit further examination of isl as an anti-tumor agent in the pituitary gland.

fungal_infection	two hypotheses were tested with respect to the germination of diplolophium marthozianum, an endemic plant species of the copper-cobalt outcrops in katanga, democratic republic of congo: (1) germination of copper-endemics is limited by fungal infection in the absence of pathogen control and (2) the germination success of this copper-endemic species is copper-dependent. seed lots of twenty seeds were weighed, soaked in different disinfection treatments and then placed in a germination medium containing four distinct copper concentrations for 30 days. seed viability was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment by a cut test. final germination percentage (15.2 +/- 8.2%) and seed viability (24.2 +/- 10.3%) were not affected by copper concentration or disinfection treatments. d. marthozianum is able to germinate in a substrate without added copper, despite pervasive fungal infection. however, seed mass had a significant positive effect on seed germination suggesting that selecting the largest seeds may ensure the highest germination success in ex situ conservation programs.
fungal_infection	mixed fungal infection and acquired echinocandin resistance of candida spp. remain infrequent. in this study we have reported the case of a patient hospitalized for tuberculosis who experienced multiple infections due to three common candida species (c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. tropicalis). furthermore, consecutive isolates from blood cultures and heart valve were found resistant to azoles (c. tropicalis) and to echinocandin with either novel (c. tropicalis) or previously described (c. albicans) missense mutations in the fks gene.
emergency_contraception	research suggests that men should be included in reproductive health decision making to help enhance positive health outcomes for their partners. men affect the use of contraception and what method is used. men 's decisions may be affected by different factors such as gender, education, and the nature of their sexual relationship. a qualitative study was conducted to explore males' experiences and perceptions about emergency contraception (ec), and the meanings males assign to ec. semistructured in-depth focus groups were held with 15 men who engage in heterosexual activity recruited from a university setting in the united states. participants expressed egalitarian views of the contraception decision-making processes, a sense of responsibility regarding reproductive decision making, and that society has a negative stigma toward those who use ec. however, there was a lack of knowledge regarding the copper intrauterine device, which was not viewed as a method of ec. exploring the role and needs of men in reproductive health care discussions and research is an important and growing area. recommendations are provided for health care practitioners, policy, and future research around men and ec.
sports_injuries	background: although it has been suggested that generalized joint hypermobility (gjh) is a risk factor for injury in soccer players, it remains unclear whether this applies to elite female soccer players. purpose: to investigate whether gjh is a risk factor for injury in elite female soccer players. study design: cohort study; level of evidence, 2. methods: elite female soccer players in the netherlands were screened at the start of the 2014-2015 competitive season. gjh was assessed using the beighton score. soccer injuries and soccer exposure were registered throughout the entire season. poisson regression was performed to calculate incidence risk ratios (irrs) using different cutoff points of the beighton score (3, 4, and 5) to indicate gjh. results: of the 114 players included in the study, 20 were classified as hypermobile (beighton score 4). the mean (sd) injury incidence per player was 8.40 +/- 9.17 injuries/1000 hours of soccer, with no significant difference between hypermobile and nonhypermobile players. gjh was not a risk factor for injuries when using beighton score cutoff points of 3 (irr = 1.06 [95% ci, 0.74-1.50]; p = .762), 4 (irr = 1.10 [95% ci, 0.72-1.68]; p = .662), or 5 (irr = 1.15 [95% ci, 0.68-1.95]; p = .602). similarly, gjh was not a significant risk factor for thigh, knee, or ankle injuries evaluated separately. conclusion: this study indicates that gjh is not a risk factor for injuries in elite female soccer players, irrespective of beighton score cutoff point. hypermobile players at this elite level might have improved their active stability and/or used braces to compensate for joint laxity.
weight_loss	elevated concentrations of plasma fatty acids in transition dairy cows are significantly associated with increased disease susceptibility and poor lactation performance. the main source of plasma fatty acids throughout the transition period is lipolysis from adipose tissue depots. during this time, plasma fatty acids serve as a source of calories mitigating the negative energy balance prompted by copious milk synthesis and limited dry matter intake. past research has demonstrated that lipolysis in the adipose organ is a complex process that includes not only the activation of lipolytic pathways in response to neural, hormonal, or paracrine stimuli, but also important changes in the structure and cellular distribution of the tissue in a process known as adipose tissue remodeling. this process involves an inflammatory response with immune cell migration, proliferation of the cellular components of the stromal vascular fraction, and changes in the extracellular matrix. this review summarizes current knowledge on lipolysis in dairy cattle, expands on the new field of adipose tissue remodeling, and discusses how these biological processes affect transition cow health and productivity.
headache	current events within the military and professional sports have resulted in an increased recognition of the long-term and debilitating consequences of traumatic brain injury. mild traumatic brain injury accounts for the majority of head injuries, and posttraumatic headache is the most common adverse effect. it is estimated that between 30% to 90% of traumatic brain injuries result in posttraumatic headache, and for a significant number of people this headache disorder can continue for up to and over a year post injury. often, the most severe and chronic posttraumatic headache has a migraine-like phenotype and is difficult to resolve. in this review we discuss the preclinical findings from animal models of posttraumatic headache. we also describe potential mechanisms by which traumatic brain injury leads to chronic posttraumatic headache, including neuroinflammatory mediators and migraine-associated neuropeptides. there are surprisingly few preclinical studies that have investigated overlapping mechanisms between posttraumatic headache and migraine, especially considering the prevalence and debilitating nature of posttraumatic headache. given this context, posttraumatic headache is a field with many emerging opportunities for growth. the frequency of posttraumatic headache in the general and military population is rising, and further preclinical research is required to understand, ameliorate, and treat this disabling disorder.

heart_disease	context: soluble cd40 ligand (scd40l) can predict cardiovascular events (cve) and mortality in haemodialysis (hd) patients (short-, medium-term follow-up studies).objective: to evaluate the relationship between scd40l and survival, cve and mortality in hd patients on long-term follow-up.methods: we registered 46hd patients' baseline characteristics, mortality and cve for 108 months.results: scd40l correlated positively with c-reactive protein, was higher in survivors, but had no impact on survival and was not predictive for cve or cv mortality.conclusion: the levels of scd40l have no influence on survival or cve and mortality in hd patients in a long-term follow-up.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is the most common cause of neurodegeneration and dementia in the elderly. dysregulated, chronic activation of microglia, the brain 's resident macrophages, induces the release of excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines which has been implicated in the early stages of ad pathology. therefore, suppressing the expression of these inflammatory mediators may decrease or delay the progression of ad. many natural compounds derived from plants have shown anti-inflammatory activity. the naturally occurring 1,2,3,4,6 penta-o-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (pgg), is a polyphenolic compound highly enriched in rhus chinensis millplant. it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that act through the inhibition of many cytokines in different experimental models. in the present study, we investigated the role of pgg as an anti-inflammatory agent in lps/ifny activated bv-2 microglia cells. mouse cytokine antibody arrays were used to assess the effect of pgg on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and elisa experiments were performed to validate the results from the arrays. the results obtained from the cytoldne arrays, and elisa assays showed that pgg decreased the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-5 (mcp-5) 8-fold, and pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9 (pro mmp-9) 10-fold. both of these cytokines are upregulated during the inflammatory process and have been shown to be involved in brain injury, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. therefore, these findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of pgg on activated microglia involving the attenuation of mcp-5 and pro mmp-9 cytokines.

allergies	background: shrimp and house dust mite (hdm) allergies are common in canadians. often, both of these allergies occur in the same patient. this may be due to homology of tropomyosin or other potentially shared proteins. the aim of our study was to assess the frequency of house dust mite sensitization in a shrimp allergic canadian population. methods: we undertook a retrospective chart review of shrimp allergic patients at an outpatient allergy clinic in kitchener, ontario, canada. our primary endpoint was to assess for presence of hdm sensitization in this population. patients were categorized into approximate quartiles. we assessed the severity of the shrimp reactions, correlated shrimp skin test size to hdm skin test size, and measured the proportion of patients with atopic symptoms. results: we identified 95 shrimp allergic patients who were tested for house dust mite. 86 (90.5%) of these patients had a positive skin test to hdm. patients with a shrimp skin test >= 5 mm were 5.31 times (95% ci, 1.55-18.14; p = 0.008) more likely to exhibit a dust mite skin test >= 5 mm than patients with a shrimp skin test < 5 mm. the odds of a patient with a shrimp skin test between 10 and 18 mm having a larger hdm skin test were 3.93 times (95% ci 1.03-14.98, p = 0.045) the odds for a patient with a shrimp skin test size between 3 and 4 mm. we did not find a correlation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp reaction symptom grade (p = 0.301). conclusion: in our canadian patients, we found a large majority of shrimp allergic patients to be sensitized to hdm. we found that patients with a large skin test to shrimp were more likely to have a large skin test to hdm compared to those patients with a small skin test to shrimp. we did not find a correlation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp reaction symptom severity. most of these patients had symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma that may have been caused by house dust mite allergy.
fungal_infection	sessile organisms such as octocorals cannot avoid threats such as predation, parasitism or fungal infections through evasive responses. instead, they rely on strategies that deter or reduce the impact of these threats. one such strategy is the development of hard structures such as sclerites, which are minute calcium carbonate skeletal elements located on top of the ectoderm and within the mesoglea and gastrodermal tube walls. sclerites have multiple roles, including structural support of the colony and protection from predators. the role of sclerites as a physical barrier that deters fungal infection, however, is unknown. this study examines the potential role of sea fan sclerites as protection from fungal infection. to accomplish this, four different fungi isolated from healthy sea fans were inoculated into 5 ml tubes filled with culture media and with sclerites from healthy and diseased fans placed on top. to determine whether chemical compounds in the sclerites impact infection, sclerites from healthy and diseased fans were extracted for several days with acetone prior to inoculation. results showed that the sclerite layer delayed fungal infection from reaching the agar when compared to controls (tubes with agar but no sclerites). there was no difference between tubes with healthy and diseased sclerites, but there were differences among sclerites extracted with acetone. this study suggests that, in addition to the roles in structural support and predator deterrence, sclerites play a role as physical and chemical barriers against to fungal infection.

weight_loss	despite substantial progress in our understanding of the complex bio-machinery involved in the regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis, few weight loss drugs are currently government-approved in the usa or europe. while acknowledging novel drug monotherapies (such as belviq (r) & saxenda (r)), this review focuses on the various drug polytherapies that are currently attracting so much research interest. unfortunately, however, the dependent variables in these new studies remain firmly rooted in outcome measures i.e. reduced food intake and bodyweight. such evidence is clearly essential, as are physiological data bearing upon potential 'off-target' effects of any new treatment. however, as emphasised by many authors, this profiling has to be matched by sophisticated behavioural analysis addressing fundamental 'process' questions such as how such reductions in intake and/or bodyweight have been achieved. the value of behavioural analysis is exemplified, and it is argued that such a process-led approach should optimise the translation from preclinical to clinical development of candidate drugs, and avoid yet further expensive blind alleys.

alzheimer's_disease	hyperphosphorylated tau has a critical role in tauopathies such as alzheimer 's disease and frontotemporal dementia, impairing neuronal function and eventually leading to neurodegeneration. a critical role for tau is supported by studies in transgenic mouse models that express the p301l tau mutation found in cases of familial frontotemporal dementia, with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus causing reductions in hippocampal long-term potentiation and impairments in spatial learning and memory. however, what has remained unexplored is the role of hyperphosphorylated tau in reducing neuronal excitability. here, we show in two complementary p301l tau transgenic mouse models that hyperphosphorylated tau induces a more depolarized threshold for action potential initiation and reduces firing in hippocampal ca1 neurons, which was rescued by the suppression of transgenic tau. furthermore, using mutagenesis and primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, we reveal that this reduction in neuronal excitability results from the relocation of the axon initial segment (ais) down the axon in a tau phosphorylation-dependent manner. we also demonstrate that this effect is microtubule-dependent. in addition, pharmacological stabilization was found to prevent both the structural and functional deficits caused by tau hyperphosphorylation. finally, we demonstrate that the ais of neurons from tau transgenic mice is further down the axon, which correlates with a reduction in excitability. we therefore propose that a reduction in hippocampal excitability due to a tau-mediated distal relocalization of the ais contributes to the hippocampal dysfunction observed in tauopathies.
alzheimer's_disease	while higher education is associated with healthy lifestyles and health literacy, it remains unclear whether education shapes reactions to varying levels of genetic risk for alzheimer 's disease (ad). in this study, participants (n = 701) in the national genetic risk survey experiment (ngrise) received a hypothetical genetic risk assessment for ad (ranging from 20 to 80% lifetime risk) and then completed items on their cognitive (perceived threat to health), emotional (general negative affect), and anticipated behavioral (seek information, improve health behaviors, engage in public or private civic action) reactions to this risk. individuals with a college education showed reactions to increasing genetic risk approximately twice or several times as strong relative to those of individuals with lower (high school, hs) education. in fact, behavioral reactions do not significantly increase with ad risk among those with hs education. some educational differences in risk response widen at older ages.

polycythemia_vera	backgroundanagrelide represents a treatment option for essential thrombocythemia, although its place in therapy remains controversial. aimto assess the impact of mutational status in response rates and development of adverse events during long-term use of anagrelide. methodswe retrospectively evaluated 67 patients with essential thrombocythemia treated with anagrelide during 68 (4-176) months. resultsmutational frequencies were 46.3%, 28.3%, and 1.5% for jak2v617f, calr and mpl mutations. anagrelide yielded a high rate of hematologic responses, which were complete in 49.25% and partial in 46.25%, without differences among molecular subsets. the rate of thrombosis during treatment was one per 100 patient-years, without excess bleeding. anemia was the major adverse event, 30.3% at 5-yr follow-up, being more frequent in calr (+) (p60months were at higher risk, or (95% ci) 9.32 (1.1-78.5), p<0.01, indicating the need for bone marrow monitoring during prolonged treatment. conclusionalthough calr (+) patients were at higher risk of developing anemia, anagrelide proved effective among all molecular subsets, indicating that mutational status does not seem to represent a major determinant of choice of cytoreductive treatment among essential thrombocythemia therapies.
sports_injuries	musculoskeletal ultrasound utilises high-frequency linear transducers to produce high-resolution images of soft tissue structures. it is an increasingly useful tool in the assessment of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries; it is relatively cheap, portable and can be used to facilitate targeted injections. in this review paper, we aimto provide a summary on the normal and abnormal appearances of skeletal tissue in the setting of acute and chronic lower limb sporting injuries.
skin_care	background: contact dermatitis can be defined as an inflammatory process affecting the skin surface and induced by contact with chemical, physical and/or biotic agents in the environment. it causes lesions to skin, mucosae and semimucosae by means of allergic and irritant pathogenic mechanisms. among the main triggers of contact dermatitis in the pediatric age are chemical or physical agents, which cause irritant contact dermatitis (icd), and sensitizers, which cause a tissue damage through an allergic mechanism (allergic contact dermatitis [acd]). methods: a prospective, multicenter, observational study was carried out in 204 children affected by contact dermatitis, aged up to 14 years, and enrolled by pediatricians from 7 different italian provinces. the diagnosis of contact dermatitis was based on the pediatrician 's clinical evaluation. the data were collected through a series of simple and multiple choice questions, anonymously filled out by pediatricians. results: in 90% of cases (184 of 204 patients), there was complete remission of contact dermatitis, with no cases of worsening. no adverse events were observed, either. the effectiveness of the therapy was rated as ""very effective"" by 84.4% of the parents and 86.8% of the pediatricians. in only 10 patients a new therapy had to be prescribed. conclusions: contact dermatitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory skin disease induced by contact with different kinds of environmental agents. cutaneous manifestations are highly variable and depend on the modality of contact, on the causative agent and on the pathogenesis. this italian experience of a clinical approach to contact dermatitis stresses the need of daily skin care through different therapeutic strategies, based on the diagnosis, the clinical severity and the parents and children compliance. the first therapeutic measure to be implemented is prevention, through the removal of the causative agent and the use of protective devices. indeed, preserving the skin 's barrier function is an important goal and a priority of treatment algorithms.
multiple_sclerosis	background: vitamin d deficiency has been associated with adverse health outcomes. we examined genetic and environmental determinants of serum 25(oh)d-3 and 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 in childhood. methods: the study sample consisted of 322 healthy australian children (predominantly caucasians) who provided a venous blood sample. a parental interview was conducted and skin phototype and anthropometry measures were assessed. concentrations of 25(oh)d-3 and 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 were measured by selective solid-phase extraction-capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. these concentrations were deseasonalised where relevant to remove the effect of month of sampling. results: deseasonalised log 25(oh)d-3 and 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 concentrations were only moderately correlated (r = 0.42, p < 0.001). the following predicted both 25(oh)d-3 and 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 : uvr 6 weeks before the interview, natural skin and eye colour, height and vitamin d allelic metabolism score. the following predicted 25(oh)d-3 only: lifetime sunburns and vitamin d allelic synthesis score. overall, 43.5% and 25.6% of variation in 25(oh)d-3 and 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 could be explained. after accounting for 25(oh)d-3 concentrations, higher uvr 6 weeks before the interview and vitamin d allelic metabolism score further predicted 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 concentrations. conclusions: environmental factors and genetic factors contributed to both vitamin d metabolite concentrations. the intriguing finding that the higher ambient uvr contributed to higher 1,25(oh)(2)d-3 after accounting for 25(oh)d-3 concentrations requires further evaluation.
birth_control	purpose: to evaluate a health systems intervention to increase adolescents' receipt of high-quality sexual and reproductive health care services. methods: quasi experimental design. twelve high schools in a large public school district were matched into pairs. within each pair, schools were assigned to condition so that no control school shared a geographic border with an intervention school. five yearly surveys (t1, t2,., t5) were administered from 2005 to 2009 (n = 29,823) to students in randomly selected classes in grades 9-12. community-based providers of high-quality sexual and reproductive health care services were listed on a referral guide for use by school nurses to connect adolescents to care. results: statistically significant effects were found for intervention school females on three outcomes, relative to controls. relative to t1, receipt of birth control in the past year was greater at t4 (adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 1.85; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.09-3.15) and t5 (aor = 2.22; 95% ci, 1.32-3.74). increases in sexually transmitted disease testing and/or treatment in the past year were greater in t1-t3 (aor = 1.78; 95% ci, 1.05-3.02), t1-t4 (aor = 1.73; 95% ci, 1.01-2.97), t1-t5 (aor = 1.97; 95% ci, 1.17-3.31), and t2-t5 (aor = 1.76; 95% ci, 1.06-2.91). increases in ever receiving an hiv test were greater in t1-t4 (aor = 2.14; 95% ci, 1.08-4.26). among males, no intervention effects were found. conclusions: a school-based structural intervention can improve female adolescents' receipt of services. published by elsevier inc. on behalf of society for adolescent health and medicine.
low_testosterone	our aim was to assess the impact of the association between elevated oestradiol (e-2) and low testosterone (t) levels on erectile dysfunction (ed) severity. a total of 614 male patients with ed and a normal or low t level in association with normal or elevated e-2 levels were enrolled. patients underwent routine laboratory investigations in addition to measurements of total t, total e-2, follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), luteinizing hormone (lh) and prolactin. we compared the responses to the erectile function domain, q3 (achieving erection) and q4 (maintaining erection) of the international index for erectile function (iief) score in patients with the following: normal t and e-2 levels; low t level; low t level and elevated e-2 level; and elevated e-2 level. of the patients included, 449 (73.1%) had normal t and e-2 levels, 110 (17.9%) had a low t level, 36 (5.9%) had a low t level and an elevated e-2 level, and 19 (3.1%) had an elevated e-2 level. increased ed severity was significantly associated with low t levels, elevated e-2 levels, and both a low t level and an elevated e-2 level. additionally, the mean values of the ef-domain, q3 and q4 were significantly lower in patients with both a low t level and an elevated e-2 level compared to patients with any condition alone. in conclusion, a low t level had the primary effect on erectile function; however, a concomitantly elevated e-2 level had an additive impairment effect.
weight_loss	recent cardiovascular outcome trials - the leader with liragutide and sustain-6 with semaglutide - have shown significant reductions of major cardiovascular (cv) events with these glucagon-like peptide (glp)-1 receptor agonists. progressive separation of the treatment and placebo curves, starting clearly between 12 and 18 months of the trial period, and significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, indicate that the beneficial cv effects observed with glp-1 receptor agonists could be due to an antiatherogenic effect. so far, the reasons for such an effect of glp-1 receptor agonists have not been entirely clear, although several hypotheses may be proposed. as the reductions in glycated haemoglobin and systolic blood pressure (sbp) in these trials were modest, and both trials lasted only a short period of time, reductions in hyperglycaemia and sbp are unlikely to be involved in the beneficial cv effects of glp-1 receptor agonists. on the other hand, their effect on lipids and, in particular, the dramatic decrease in postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia may explain their beneficial cv actions. reduction of body weight, including a significant decrease in visceral fat in patients using glp-1 receptor agonists, may also have beneficial cv effects by reducing chronic proatherogenic inflammation. in addition, there are in-vitro data showing a direct anti-inflammatory effect with these agents that could also be involved in their beneficial cv effects. moreover, studies in humans have shown significant beneficial effects on ischaemic myocardium after a very short treatment period, suggesting a direct effect of glp-1 receptor agonists on myocardium, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. finally, as a reduction in insulin resistance has been associated with a decrease in cv risk, it cannot be ruled out that the lowering of insulin resistance induced by glp-1 receptor agonists might also be involved in their beneficial cv actions.

menopause	objective: vasomotor symptoms (vms, ie, hot flashes or night sweats) are reported by many, but not all, women. the extent to which vms are genetically determined is unknown. we evaluated the relationship of genetic variation and vms. methods: in this observational study, we accessed data from three genome-wide association studies (gwas) (snp health association resource cohort [share], whi memory study cohort [whims+], and genome-wide association studies of treatment response in randomized clinical trials [garnet] studies, total n - 17,695) of european american, african american, and hispanic american postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years at baseline in the women 's health initiative study. we examined genetic variation in relation to vms (yes/no) in each study and using trans-ethnic inverse variance fixed-effects meta-analysis. a total of 11,078,977 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) met the quality criteria. results: after adjustment for covariates and population structure, three snps (on chromosomes 3 and 11) were associated with vms at the genome-wide threshold of 5 x 10(-8) in the african american share gwas, but were not associated in the other cohorts. in the meta-analysis, 14 snps, all located on chromosome 4 in the tachykinin receptor 3 (tacr3) locus, however, had p < 5 x 10(-8) . these snps' effect sizes were similar across studies/participants' ancestry (odds ratio similar to 1.5). conclusions: genetic variation in tacr3 may contribute to the risk of vms. to our knowledge, this is the first gwas to examine snps associated with vms. these results support the biological hypothesis of a role for tacr3 in vms, which was previously hypothesized from animal and human studies. further study of these variants may lead to new insights into the biological pathways involved in vms, which are poorly understood.
headache	background.-postural headaches are commonly associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leakage from the spine. a subarachnoid-pleural fistula (spf) is a very rare and serious type of csf fistula that has mostly been reported following traumatic causes. case report.-here, the case of a 36-year-old woman who suffered from postural headaches after chiropractic manipulation of her neck was reported. brain and spinal magnetic resonance (mr) imaging showed brain sagging, a c7-t1 dural defect, and overt csf leakage. heavy t2-weighted mr myelography revealed paravertebral fluid collections, communicating with pleural effusions through bilateral spfs. the postural headaches were relieved by 3 courses of epidural blood patches. discussions.-from the patient 's history, her severe spfs were attributed to rupture of the spinal leptomeninges during vigorous chiropractic manipulation of her neck. heavy t2-weighted mr myelography could delineate the route of spfs and csf leakages.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (nfts) are one of the pathological features of ad. recent studies have suggested long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play important roles in ad. competing endogenous rnas (cernas) is a mechanism that has recently been proposed, in which incrnas compete for common mirna-binding sites with mrnas. however, the roles of incrnas and cerna in ad nfts is limited. in this study, we constructed a global triple network based on cerna theory, then an ad nft lncrna mrna network (nftlmn) was generated. by analyzing the nftlmn, three incrnas (ap000265.1, kb-1460a1.5 and rp11-145m9.4), which are highly related with ad nfts were identified. to further explore the cross-talk between mrnas and incrnas, a clustering module analysis was performed on the nftlmn and two ad nft related modules were identified. our study provides a better understanding of the molecular basis of ad nfts and may offer novel treatment strategies for ad.

sports_injuries	the goal of this study was to compare the sex-specific prevalence rate of serious sports injuries in the past year among students ages 13-15 years from 25 low- and middle-income countries (lmics) globally. data from 46,922 nationally-representative students who participated in the global school-based student health survey (gshs) were analyzed using complex samples analysis. the gshs defines injuries as serious when they cause at least one full day of missed school or usual activities or require clinical treatment. students reporting more than one serious injury in the past year are asked about the single most serious injury. the proportion of students reporting at least one serious injury in the past year ranged from 15-71 % (median 44 %) among boys and 8-70 % (median 30 %) among girls. the proportion of most-serious injuries in the past year that were sports-related ranged from 25-60 % among injured boys (median 35 %) and 12-56 % among injured girls (median 24 %). the most common types of sports-related injuries were broken bones and dislocated joints, reported by 13-62 % (median 28 %) of boys with sports injuries and 10-86 % (median 25 %) of girls with sports injuries. although the annual injury rates among early adolescents vary widely between countries, the gshs shows that sports injuries are common globally among both male and female middle school students. understanding global trends in the health risks for various population groups, such as adolescents, allows community health partnerships to proactively address health needs in the communities they serve.
cancer	the british childhood cancer survivor study (bccss) provides the first detailed investigation of employment and occupation to be undertaken in a large population-based cohort. previous studies have been limited by design issues such as using small numbers of survivors with specific diagnoses, and involved limited assessment of employment status and occupational level. the bccss includes 17,981 5-year survivors of childhood cancer. employment status and occupational level were ascertained by questionnaire from eligible survivors (n=14,836). multivariate logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with employment and occupation, and to compare survivors to their demographic peers in the general population. employment status was available for 10,257 survivors. gender, current age, cancer type, radiotherapy, age at diagnosis and epilepsy were consistently associated with being: employed; unable to work; in managerial or non-manual occupations. overall, survivors were less likely to be working than expected (or (99% ci): 0.89 (0.81-0.98)), and this deficit was greatest for irradiated cns neoplasm survivors (0.34 (0.28-0.41)). compared to the general population, survivors were fivefold more likely to be unable to work due to illness/disability; the excess was 15-fold among cns neoplasm survivors treated with radiotherapy. overall survivors were less likely to be in managerial occupations than expected (0.85 (0.77-0.94)). however, bone sarcoma survivors were more likely to be in these occupations than expected (1.37 (1.01-1.85)) and also similarly for non-manual occupations (1.90 (1.37-2.62)). survivors of retinoblastoma (1.55 (1.20-2.01)) and other' neoplasm group (1.62 (1.30-2.03)) were also more likely to be in non-manual occupations than expected. what 's new? employment and job satisfaction contribute to individual wellbeing and performance in modern society. for survivors of childhood cancer, however, poor health can significantly hinder the ability to work, the present study suggests. using data from the british childhood cancer survivor study, the authors show that compared with the general population, survivors of childhood cancer were less likely to be working, with work activity limited particularly by illness and disability. impacts were greatest for survivors of central nervous system neoplasms treated by radiotherapy. the findings help identify factors that could be targeted to maximize survivors' employment potential.
skin_care	incontinence is a common problem among hospitalized patients and has been associated with multiple health complications, including incontinence-associated dermatitis (iad) and hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (hapus). a prospective, descriptive study was conducted in 2 acute care neurology units to 1) assess the prevalence of incontinence and incidence of iad and hapus among incontinent patients, and 2) evaluate the effect of caregiver education and use of a 1-step cleanser, moisturizer, barrier product on the development of iad and hapus among patients with incontinence. during a period of 1 month, the incontinence status of admitted patients was recorded and skin was assessed for the presence/absence of iad and hapus twice per day. after the 1-month data collection, all clinicians on the study units completed a facility-based online education program about iad, hapus, and skin care followed by the implementation of a 1-step cleanser/barrier product for skin care of all patients with incontinence. data collection procedures remained the same. data were collected using a paper/pencil instrument and entered into a spreadsheet for analysis. descriptive statistics were calculated and prevalence and incidence rates were compared between the pre-intervention and post-intervention phase using fisher 's exact analysis. during the first phase of the study, 17 of 40 admitted patients (42.5%) were incontinent. of those, 5 (29.4%) developed iad and all of these patients developed hapus (5 of 40 admitted, 29.4%) during an average length of stay of 7.3 (range: 2-14) days. in the intervention phase of the study, 25 of 46 (54.3%) patients were incontinent and none developed iad or a hapu during an average length of stay of 7.4 (range: 2-14) days. the average braden scale score was 14.14 in the pre-intervention group of patients with incontinence and 12.74 in the intervention group. the prevalence of incontinence among patients admitted to acute care neurology units and the rate of iad in these populations is high. after educating clinicians and implementing incontinence care procedures with a 1-step product, the rate of hapus decreased significantly but the rate of iads remained the same. clinicians should consider the results of this and other studies when developing incontinence-care protocols. controlled clinical studies utilizing more detailed iad assessments will help elucidate these observations.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objective: digestive symptoms are reported to result from a wide range of dietary components. dietary pattern analysis is a useful method when considering the entire diet, rather than individual foods or nutrients, providing an opportunity to take interactions into account. the aim of the present study was to investigate, using a dietary pattern approach, the relationship between diet, digestive symptoms, and health-related quality of life (hrqol) in women reporting minor digestive symptoms. methods: analysis was performed on dietary and digestive symptoms data collected in france. women (n = 308, ages 18-60 y) reporting a bowel movement frequency within the normal range (3-21 stools/wk) but with minor digestive symptoms in the previous month were studied. dietary data was collected using three 24-h recalls. k-means was used to divide the dietary data into clusters. the frequency of digestive symptoms (abdominal discomfort or pain, bloating, flatulence, borborygmi) and bowel movements were evaluated over a 2-wk period. hrqol was also assessed. results: four dietary clusters were identified and characterized as unhealthy, balance, healthy, and convenience. no differences were found in the frequency of digestive symptoms according to dietary cluster, except for flatulence (p = 0.030), which was more prevalent in the unhealthy and convenience clusters. no significant differences were observed in hrqol according to dietary clusters. conclusions: results from the present study demonstrated that even within a relatively homogeneous sample of french women, distinct dietary patterns can be identified but without significant differences in digestive symptoms (except for flatulence) or hrqol.

sprains_and_strains	objective: to assemble and synthesize the best evidence oil the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of musculoskeletal injuries and pain in dancers. data sources: medline, cinahl, psycinfo, embase, and other electronic databases were searched from 1966 to 2004 l]sin go key words such as dance, dancer, dancing, athletic injuries, occupational injuries, sprains and strains, and musculoskeletal diseases. in addition, the reference lists of relevant studies were examined, specialized journals were hand-searched, and the websites of major dance associations were scanned for relevant information. study selection: citations were screened for relevance using a priori criteria, and relevant studies were critically reviewed for scientific merit by the best evidence synthesis method. after 1865 abstracts were screened, 103 articles were reviewed, and 32 (31%) of these were accepted as scientifically admissible (representing 29 unique studies). data extraction: data from accepted studies were abstracted into evidence tables relating to the prevalence and associated factors, incidence and risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, economic costs, and prevention of musculoskeletal injuries and pain in dancers. data synthesis: the scientifically admissible studies consisted of 15 (52%) cohort studies, 13 (45%) cross-sectional studies, and 1 (3%) validation study of a diagnostic assessment tool. there is a high prevalence and incidence of lower extremity and back injuries, with soft tissue and overuse injuries predominating. for example, lifetime prevalence estimates for injury in professional ballet dancers ranged between 40% and 84%, while the point prevalence of minor injury in a diverse group of university and professional ballet and modern dancers was 74%. several potential risk factors for injury are suggested by the literature, but conclusive evidence for any of these is lacking. there is preliminary evidence that comprehensive injury prevention and management strategies may help decrease the incidence of future injury. conclusions: the dance medicine literature is young and heterogeneous, limiting our ability to draw consistent conclusions. nonetheless, the best available evidence suggests that musculoskeletal injury is an important health issue for dancers at all skill levels. better quality research is needed in this specialized area. future research would benefit from clear and relevant research questions being addressed with appropriate study designs, use of conceptually valid and clinically meaningful case definitions of injury and pain, and better reporting of studies in line with current scientific standards.
menopause	study question: does exposure to menopausal hormone therapy (mht) in mid-aged women alter their risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd) mortality and all-cause mortality? summary answer:mht soon after menopause is unlikely to increase the risk of cvd mortality or all-cause mortality and may have a protective effect for women with hysterectomy/oophorectomy. what is known already:the balance of benefits and risks of mht are currently unclear and may differ according to when treatment starts and whether women have an intact uterus. study design, size, duration:a total of 13 715 participants from the mid-aged population-based cohort (born 1946-1951) of the australian longitudinal study on women 's health (alswh) were followed from 1998 to 2013. participants/materials, setting, methods:the measures included cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, exposure to mht and menopausal status (based on 3-yearly self-reports). electronic prescriptions data on mht were also available from mid-2002 onwards. at each follow-up survey wave, participants were classified as: an existing user of mht, an initiator of mht or a non-initiator of mht. main results and the role of chance:after adjusting for confounding variables, existing users of mht had a reduced risk (hazard ratio 0.63; 95% ci, 0.43-0.92) of cvd mortality compared with non-initiators. insufficient evidence of an association was identified for initiators of mht (0.66; 0.35-1.24). for all-cause mortality, risks were reduced for both initiators (0.69; 0.55-0.87) and existing users (0.80; 0.70-0.91). in a subgroup analysis, women with hysterectomy/oophorectomy had lower risks of cvd mortality for both initiators (0.14; 0.02-0.98) and existing users (0.55; 0.34-0.90), but no evidence of an association was found for women whose mht commenced during or after menopause. similarly for all-cause mortality, only the women with hysterectomy/oophorectomy had lower risks for both initiators (0.47; 0.31-0.70) and existing users (0.69; 0.58-0.82). limitations, reasons for caution:limitations include the observational nature of the study, the small number of deaths, mht use being self-reported and the classification of menopausal status also being based on self-reported information. study funding/competing interest(s):women considering mht soon after menopause can be reassured that the treatment is unlikely to increase their risk of cvd mortality or all-cause mortality. study funding/competing interest(s):the australian longitudinal study on women 's health is funded by the australian department of health. g.d.m. is funded by the australian research council future fellowship. l.c. was funded by a china scholarship council (csc) graduate scholarship. all authors report no conflict of interest. trial registration number:n/a.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta as extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. tau pathology characterizes not only alzheimer 's disease, but also many other tauopathies, presenting tau as an attractive therapeutic target. passive tau immunotherapy has been previously explored; however, because only a small fraction of peripherally delivered antibodies crosses the blood-brain barrier, enters the brain and engages with tau that forms intracellular aggregates, more efficient ways of antibody delivery and neuronal uptake are warranted. in the brain, tau exists as multiple isoforms. here, we investigated the efficacy of a novel 2n tau isoform-specific single chain antibody fragment, rn2n, delivered by passive immunization in the p301l human tau transgenic pr5 mouse model. we demonstrate that, in treated mice, rn2n reduces anxiety-like behaviour and phosphorylation of tau at distinct sites. when administration of rn2n was combined with focused ultrasound in a scanning mode (scanning ultrasound), rn2n delivery into the brain and uptake by neurons were markedly increased, and efficacy was significantly enhanced. our study provides evidence that scanning ultrasound is a viable tool to enhance the delivery of biologics across the blood-brain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes and further presents single-chain antibodies as an alternative to full-length antibodies.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	osteoarthritis, as the major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain, impacts people aged 45 and above. the first line analgesic treatments have reported minimal short term effects. the use of essential oils as pain killer has increased, recently. mentha spicata, or spearmint essential oil is famous due to its anti flatulence effects, but one less known biological activity of spearmint is its analgesic activity. the aim of our study was to confirm the analgesic effects of m. spicata essential oil. in this review, we evaluated the articles on analgesic activities of m. spicata essential oil from different relevant databases (pubmed, science direct, wiley, taylor & francis, and springer) without limitation up to april 30, 2016. different animal studies have reported the analgesic effects of m. spicata essential oil and its main abundant compounds such as carvone, limonene and menthol, also, the efficacy and safety of spearmint oil in reducing of pain severity were confirmed in osteoarthritis patients. in spite of the beneficial effects of spearmint oil in reducing of pain, other large clinical trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of m. spicata oil.

hepatitis_c	hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) worldwide but the mechanistic basis as to how chronic hcv infection furthers the hcc process remains only poorly understood. accumulating evidence indicates that hcv core and nonstructural proteins provoke activation of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and the evidence supporting a role of wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the onset and progression of hcc is compelling. convincing molecular explanations as to how expression of viral effectors translates into increased activity of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling machinery are still largely lacking, hampering the design of rational strategies aimed at preventing hcc. furthermore, how such increased signaling is especially associated with hcc oncogenesis in the context of hcv infection remains obscure as well. here we review the body of contemporary biomedical knowledge on the role of the wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the progression from chronic hepatitis c to cirrhosis and hcc and explore potential hypotheses as to the mechanisms involved.
multiple_sclerosis	this study was aimed to describe changes of disease-modifying treatments (dmt) in an italian cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) and to identify predictors of therapeutic modifications. patients with ms and treated with the first-line injectable dmt (interferons-ifns or glatiramer) between 1/7/2009 and 31/10/2012 were selected from administrative databases of the ms center of cagliari (sardinia, italy). socio-demographic, therapeutic, and clinical information was collected in the 6 months preceding the index date. all patients were followed for 36 months to evaluate therapeutic changes in terms of non-adherence, switch, temporary discontinuation, and permanent interruption. predictors of changes were estimated by multivariable regression models. data on 1698 patients were collected: glatiramer was prescribed in 27% of cases, ifn beta-1b in 22%, ifn beta-1a-im in 20%, ifn beta-1a-sc-44mcg in 19%, and ifn beta-1a-sc-22mcg in 12%. non-adherence was observed in 25% of cases, therapeutic switch in 30%, discontinuation in 37%, and permanent interruption in 28%. the risk of non-adherence was higher for ifn beta-1b, compared with ifn beta-1a-im (adjor = 1.73). therapeutic switch occurred especially in patients recently diagnosed (each year from diagnosis causes a decrease of this risk adjhr = 0.97); the risk of discontinuation was higher with edss = 4-6 and 7-9 (adjhr = 1.52 and 4.42, respectively). the risk of permanent interruption increased with the augmentation of disability (adjhr = 1.67 and 5.43 for edss 4-6 and 7-9). this study mirrored a detailed framework of dmt prescription and identified factors related to changes in the ms therapy. these findings could support healthcare providers in the evaluation and maximization of benefits associated with a long-term dmt.
parkinson's_disease	paeoniflorin (pf) is a major bioactive ingredient in radix paeonia alba roots that has low toxicity and has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. our in vitro experiments suggested that pf affords a significant neuroprotective effect against mpp+-induced damage and apoptosis in pc12 cells through bcl-2/bax/caspase-3 pathway. the objectives of the present study were to explore the potential neuroprotective effect of pf in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp)-treated mouse model of parkinson 's disease (pd). our results demonstrated that pf treatment ameliorated the behavioral deficits of ""in spontaneous motor activity and latency to fall of the rotarod test"", and reduced dopaminergic cell loss that were induced by mptp in a dose-dependent manner in an in vivo model of pd. in addition, we found that treatment of pf protected dopaminergic neurons by preventing mptp-induced decreases in striatal and substantia nigra dopaminergic transporter (dat) and tyrosine hydroxylase (th) protein levels, and by changing dopamine catabolism and inhibiting dopamine turnover. furthermore, it was also associated with up-regulation of the bcl-2/bad ratio, and inhibition of the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. these results showed that pf promoted dopamine neuron survival in vivo due to the mao-b inhibition, and the pi3k/akt signaling pathway may have mediated the protection of pf against mptp, suggesting that pf treatment might represent a neuroprotective treatment for pd.

cancer	dna methylation is an epigenetic modification of dna, where a methyl group is added at the fifth carbon of the cytosine base to form 5 methyl cytosine (5mc) without altering the dna sequences. it plays important roles in regulating many cellular processes by modulating key genes expression. alteration in dna methylation patterns becomes particularly important in the aetiology of different diseases including cancers. abnormal methylation pattern could contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer either by silencing key tumor suppressor genes or by activating oncogenes. thus, dna methylation biosensing can help in the better understanding of cancer prognosis and diagnosis and aid the development of therapies. over the last few decades, a plethora of optical detection techniques have been developed for analyzing dna methylation using fluorescence, raman spectro-scopy, surface plasmon resonance (spr), electrochemiluminescence and colorimetric readouts. this paper aims to comprehensively review the optical strategies for dna methylation detection. we also present an overview of the remaining challenges of optical strategies that still need to be focused along with the lesson learnt while working with these techniques.
low_testosterone	background. immunoassays have been criticized for poor accuracy at low testosterone concentrations. mass spectrometry (ms) has been proposed as the only reliable method for testosterone determination. the aim of this study was to compare a sensitive testosterone radioimmunoassay (ria) with results from different ms. methods. we compared testosterone concentrations determined by a sensitive testosterone ria, lower limit of detection 0.03 nmol/l and limit of quantitation 0.1 nmol/l, with four tandem ms that were included in an international external quality assessment program for laboratory medicine. we also compared the morning concentrations of testosterone in girls and boys at different pubertal stages, using results from the ria, with reported values determined by lc-ms/ms, developed for androgen determination in children. results. the mean (sd), concentrations were similar between ria and ms: 1.5 (0.3) and 1.4 (0.4) in the child/women range (0.8-2.6 nmol/l) and 16.0 (3.7) and 17.8 (4.5) nmol/l for the adult male range (10.1-30.0 nmol/l), respectively. the ratio between ria and ms versus results from mean values of the four ms methods was 1.0 (0.18); 1.1 (0.18) for child/women concentrations and 0.9 (0.13) for male testosterone concentrations. furthermore, compared to the pediatric reference values determined by lc-ms/ms, the sensitive testosterone ria delivered similar testosterone values across the different pubertal stages. conclusions. the comparison between different tandem ms methods and a sensitive testosterone ria illustrates that there are immunoassays that deliver clinically useful information in prepubertal and pubertal children.
parkinson's_disease	circadian rhythms are daily rhythms that regulate many biological processes - from gene transcription to behavior - and a disruption of these rhythms can lead to a myriad of health risks. circadian rhythms are entrained by light, and their 24-h oscillation is maintained by a core molecular feedback loop composed of canonical circadian (""clock"") genes and proteins. different modulators help to maintain the proper rhythmicity of these genes and proteins, and one emerging modulator is dopamine. dopamine has been shown to have circadian-like activities in the retina, olfactory bulb, striatum, midbrain, and hypothalamus, where it regulates, and is regulated by, clock genes in some of these areas. thus, it is likely that dopamine is essential to mechanisms that maintain proper rhythmicity of these five brain areas. this review discusses studies that showcase different dopaminergic mechanisms that may be involved with the regulation of these brain areas' circadian rhythms. mechanisms include how dopamine and dopamine receptor activity directly and indirectly influence clock genes and proteins, how dopamine 's interactions with gap junctions influence daily neuronal excitability, and how dopamine 's release and effects are gated by low- and high-pass filters. because the dopamine neurons described in this review also release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba which influences clock protein expression in the retina, we discuss articles that explore how gaba may contribute to the actions of dopamine neurons on circadian rhythms. finally, to understand how the loss of function of dopamine neurons could influence circadian rhythms, we review studies linking the neurodegenerative disease parkinson 's disease to disruptions of circadian rhythms in these five brain areas. the purpose of this review is to summarize growing evidence that dopamine is involved in regulating circadian rhythms, either directly or indirectly, in the brain areas discussed here. an appreciation of the growing evidence of dopamine 's influence on circadian rhythms may lead to new treatments including pharmacological agents directed at alleviating the various symptoms of circadian rhythm disruption.
multiple_sclerosis	background: the mortality of septicaemia, meningitis and encephalitis caused by listeria monocytogenes is 20-40%. twenty-one cases of invasive listeriosis associated with alemtuzumab, including at least 16 in patients with multiple sclerosis, have been published or reported to the world health organization case safety reports database. three cases were fatal, including at least one patient treated for multiple sclerosis in 2016. case presentation: we report a patient with multiple sclerosis who developed pyrexia, nausea and abdominal discomfort few hours after the third and last infusion of her second alemtuzumab cycle. an infusion related reaction was suspected. the patient had however eaten soft cheese and raw sausage 3 days prior to treatment, and l. monocytogenes septicaemia was diagnosed based on positive blood cultures. conclusion: listeriosis associated with alemtuzumab is a potentially fatal condition that can mimic an infusion related reaction. as in most other previously reported cases symptoms started rapidly after the last infusion, suggesting that the patient already carried the bacteria prior to the alemtuzumab infusions. the summary of product characteristics recommends patients to avoid foods associated with listeria at least 1 month after treatment. this recommendation should include also the last weeks prior to treatment.
fungal_infection	objectives: invasive fungal infections (ifis) cause significant morbidity and mortality among recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). although fluconazole is used widely as an antifungal prophylactic agent in these patients, it is not reliably effective against mold infection including invasive aspergillosis. micafungin provides antifungal activity against candida and aspergillus species, and previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy when used as a prophylactic agent for fungal infection in neutropenic patients. here, we evaluated and compared the incidence of proven or probable ifis after antifungal prophylaxis using micafungin or fluconazole. methods: this was a prospective, single-center, phase ii study involving adult patients who received allogeneic or autologous hsct. patients were randomly assigned to micafungin or fluconazole arms in a ratio of 2: 1, and the treatment was initiated within 24 h of hsct and maintained for up to 21 days. the primary end point was the incidence of proven or probable ifis during the 100 days after hsct. the secondary end points were the incidence rates of possible, proven, or probable ifis, need to change the antifungal agent before engraftment, ifi-related mortality, and survival within 100 days after transplantation. results: between march 2010 and may 2015, a total of 257 patients were enrolled. after exclusion of seven patients who did not receive at least one dose of a study treatment, 250 patients (micafungin, n = 165; fluconazole, n = 85) were included in the analysis of clinical efficacy. the median age was 47 years (range, 20-64). allogeneic and autologous transplantations were performed in 56.0% (n = 140) and 44.0% (n = 110) of the patients, respectively. baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. overall, the incidence of proven and probable ifis within 100 days of hsct was 7.6% (n = 19). the percentages of patients who experienced proven or probable ifis did not differ significantly between the micafungin and fluconazole groups: 7.3% and 8.2%, respectively (p = 0.786). thirteen patients in the micafungin arm (7.9%) and eight patients in the fluconazole arm (9.4%) needed a change in antifungal agent before engraftment (p = 0.824). mortality within 100 days after hsct did not differ significantly between groups: 9.1% vs 12.9% in the micafungin and fluconazole arms, respectively (p = 0.345). conclusion: micafungin is comparable to fluconazole for the prevention of ifis in hsct recipients.

hepatitis_c	background & aimsthe 2015 baveno vi guidelines recommend against performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with compensated cirrhosis who have a liver stiffness150000/mm(3) because of a low prevalence of varices at risk of bleeding in this population. the aim was to synthesize the available evidence on the usefulness of the combined use of liver stiffness and platelet count to identify patients without oesophageal varices. methodsmeta-analysis of trials evaluating the usefulness of a given cut-off for liver stiffness and platelet count to rule out the presence of oesophageal varices. resultsfifteen studies were included. all studies excepting five used the baveno vi criteria. compared to patients with either high liver stiffness or low platelet count, those with low liver stiffness and normal platelet count had a lower risk of varices at risk of bleeding (or=0.22, 95% ci=0.13-0.39, p<.001) with low heterogeneity between studies (i-2=21%). they also had a lower risk of varices (or=0.23, 95% ci=0.17-0.32, p<.001) with moderate heterogeneity between studies (i-2=28%). in patients with low liver stiffness and normal platelet count, the pooled estimate rates for varices at risk of bleeding was 0.040 (95% ci=0.027-0.059) with low heterogeneity between studies (i-2=3%). conclusionspatients with low liver stiffness and normal platelet count have a lower risk of varices than those with either high liver stiffness or low platelet count. varices at risk of bleeding are found in no more than 4% of patients when liver stiffness is <20kpa and platelet count is normal.
headache	background sinusitis is a leading health care problem believed to be increasing in both incidence and prevalence. various articles have been published on sinusitis and its treatment. however, its importance is diminished by the fact that sinusitis is variously defined. the main objective of this study is to define the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic bacterial sinusitis and to grade the severity of presentation of each clinical feature correlating with radiological and endoscopic and microbiological features. materials and methods this prospective study was conducted in a tertiary health care centre over a three-month period; 80 patients were chosen, 40 with nasal symptoms as their main complaint with or without headache as experimental group and 40 patients with headache as their main complaint without nasal symptoms as the control group. they were subjected to detailed clinical examination, radiological, endoscopic and microbiological examinations. results nasal obstruction, discharge and headache form the major symptoms while hyperaemia, deviated septum with hypertrophied inferior turbinates form the major signs in the case group. diagnostic nasal endoscopy correlated well with clinical findings, while x-ray of the sinuses was found to be abnormal in all cases. conclusion a proper and detailed clinical evaluation with x-ray of the paranasal sinuses and endoscopy should form the mainstay in diagnosing chronic bacterial sinusitis. ct scan should be added if we are planning for surgery and for cases not responding to initial medical management due to radiological risk and cause factor.
allergies	many patients with atopic syndrome complain of symptoms related to irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) as well. symptoms caused by asthmatic condition or rhinitis are well known to the patients. there are well defined therapeutic strategies on how to handle the cases, well known to the patients. the cause of symptoms under ibs is unclear and many patients undergo many diagnostic procedures including invasive investigations. quality of life (qol) is reduced in such patients and they suffer a lot. psychic disorders like depression and anxiety may occur. at the ""end of the odyssey"", food allergies are tested. patients pay for laboratory tests for specific igg4 antibodies or alternatively basophile activation tests (bat) for food incompatibilities offered on online-platforms. in this article, causes of ibs through mast cell activation and not necessarily food allergies are discussed. how does mast cell activation lead to lactose, fructose and histamine intolerance? what are the similarities between asthma and ibs? is a similar therapeutic approach feasible?
multiple_sclerosis	myasthenia gravis (mg) is an autoimmune disease caused by production of antibodies against acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction (ab). the aim of this study was to ascertain if oxidative stress accompanies mg by estimation of the several independent parameters of oxidative damage, mainly the levels of oxidative modifications of blood serum proteins. the group studied consisted of 50 mg patients (28 females and 22 males), 24 with ocular mg (omg) and 26 with generalized mg (gmg), of mean age of 66.7 (30-81) years (y), mean disease duration of 9.5 (0.5-34) y, mean level of ab of 8.9 (0.1-85) nmol/ml, and 25 age-matched healthy controls. mg patients were stratified into groups according to disease duration (5 y), ab level (low,3 nmol/1) as well as symptoms (gmg or omg). glycophore fluorescence was increased in omg(a). dityrosine was increased in both types of mg(c), in patients ill5(c) y, with low(c) and high(c) levels of ab. n-formylkynurenine was increased in omg(a) and gmg(b), in both disease duration groups(a), in the group of low ab(a). kynurenine was increased in the group with high ab(a). tryptophan fluorescence was decreased in omg(b) and gmg(c), in patients ill for5(a) y, with iow(a) and high(c) ab. serum thiol group concentration were decreased in gmg(c), in patients ill for >5 y(b). aopp level was elevated in omg(a), in patients ill for >5 y(a) with high ab(a). protein carbonyls were increased in both omg(c) and gmg(c), in patients ill for >5(a) y, with low(b) and high(b) ab. frap and abts scavenging by fast antioxidants were unchanged, but abts scavenging by slow antioxidants was lower in omg(b) and gmg(c), in patients ill for >5(c) y, in patients with low(c) and high(b) ab ((a)p < 0.05, (b)p < 0.01, (c)p < 0.001). these results demonstrate systemic oxidative stress in mg, suggesting therapeutic use of antioxidants.

overactive_bladder	objectives: to compare the role of alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) monotherapy, anticholinergic (tolterodine) monotherapy or combination of both drugs versus analgesics in improving post-ureteroscopy (urs) lower urinary tract symptoms related to double-j ureteral stent. patients and methods: between january 2009 and june 2013, 160 consecutive patients with ureteric stones were included in this study at 2 tertiary care centers'. patients were randomized into 4 groups; group a (n = 40) received 0.4 mg tamsulosin once a day, group b (n = 40) received 4 mg tolterodine once a day, group c (n = 40) received tamsulosin 0.4 mg and tolterodine 4 mg once a day and group d (n = 40) as a control group, received placebo once a day. all patients received analgesics on demand. pre-treatment evaluation was done followed by among-groups comparison after 14 days including ureteral stent symptom questionnaire (ussq) [urinary symptom index (usi), pain symptom index (psi), general health index (ghi), work perform index (wpi), need for pain killer (pk), need for analgesia, visual analogue scale (vas) for pain and quality of life (qol)]. side effects were recorded and compared.
diabetes	the amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), a complicated heterotrimer, can sense cellular energy status and maintain energy homeostasis via switching catabolic and anabolic pathways. ampk also participates in the regulation of many other life activities, including the cell cycle, cell polarity, autophagy, and life span. therefore, ampk is widely studied as a potential drug target for treatment of type 2 diabetes and some other metabolic diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. similar to other kinases, the phosphorylation of -thr172 in the activation loop by upstream kinases is crucial for the activation of ampk. in addition, the binding of amp and its analogues to the subunit causes further allosteric activation, which makes ampk distinctive from other kinases. here, we give a brief introduction to the domain constitutions of mammalian ampk and then systematically review its allosteric activation mechanism from a structural and biochemical view.
multiple_sclerosis	multiple sclerosis (ms) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. the primary symptoms of ms include the loss of sensory and motor function. exercise has been shown to modulate disease parameters in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), a mouse model of ms, by reducing immune cell infiltration and oxidative stress. however, these initial studies were carried out exclusively in female mice. the present study compared the effects of daily voluntary wheel running on several disease parameters in male and female mice with eae. male and female mice were given access to a running wheel for 1 h a day for 30 consecutive days. daily wheel running significantly improved clinical scores in males with eae but had little effect on clinical signs in females with the disease. direct comparison of inflammation, axonal injury, and oxidative stress in male and female mice with eae revealed significant differences in the amount of t-cell infiltration, microglia reactivity, demyelination and axon integrity. male mice with eae given daily access to running wheels also had significantly less ongoing oxidative stress compared to all other groups. taken together, our results indicate that the inflammatory response generated in eae is distinct between the sexes and its modulation by daily exercise can have sex specific effects on disease-related outcomes.

sports_injuries	exploring the relationship between genetic factors and outcome following brain injury has received increased attention in recent years. however, few studies have evaluated the influence of genes on specific sequelae of concussion. the purpose of this study was to determine how the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein e (apoe) gene influences symptom expression following sports-related concussion. participants included 42 collegiate athletes who underwent neuropsychological testing, including completion of the post-concussion symptom scale (pcss), within 3 months after sustaining a concussion (73.8% were evaluated within 1 week). athletes provided buccal samples that were analyzed to determine the make-up of their apoe genotype. dependent variables included a total symptom score and four symptom clusters derived from the pcss. mann-whitney u tests showed higher scores reported by athletes with the e4 allele compared to those without it on the total symptom score and the physical and cognitive symptom clusters. furthermore, logistic regression showed that the e4 allele independently predicted those athletes who reported physical and cognitive symptoms following concussion. these findings illustrate that e4+ athletes report greater symptomatology post-concussion than e4- athletes, suggesting that the e4 genotype may confer risk for poorer post-concussion outcome.

polycythemia_vera	an 82-year-old woman who had a history of essential thrombocythemia presented with ocular pain, bleeding, and decreased visual acuity of the left eye. orbital computed tomography revealed a relatively well-defined homogenous mass-like lesion in the left subconjunctival and intraconal space. conjunctival biopsy showed acute inflammation with necrosis, vascular ectasia with thrombosis and hemorrhage. after the treatment with hydroxyurea and anagrelide, her symptom and lesion were markedly improved. hematologic disorders like essential thrombocythemia should be considered in patients with severe spontaneous bleeding around the eye.
cancer	since the discovery of antitumor activity of cisplatin in the late 60 's, the development of metal-based drugs has had an enormous burst with the aim of to increase the anti-cancer activity, lower side effects and promote specific accumulation to the target cells or organs. indeed, a new discipline, called medicinal inorganic chemistry, has born where metal ions play a fundamental role. this review provides a comprehensive overview of various metal complexes targeting the translocator protein (tspo), an 18 kda high affinity cholesterol-and drug-binding protein found mostly in the outer mitochondrial membrane and formerly known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. tspo distribution in healthy tissues varies considerably; in contrast, aberrant expression of tspo has been noted in several pathological specimens including neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. these findings suggest that tspo-targeted therapy and imaging may have utility in the treatment and visualization of diseases expressing high density of tspo. in this review, potential applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy will be discussed.

parenting	intensive parenting debates reflect the critical importance of a child 's early years, and parents' roles in determining later developmental outcomes. mothers are usually assigned primary responsibility for facilitating their infants' cognitive development through adequate and appropriate sensory stimulation. drawing on foucault 's technologies of the self, this article explores how new mothers shape their mothering practices in order to provide appropriately stimulating interactions. using findings from 64 interviews (31 women were interviewed twice, 2 women were interviewed only once) three main positions are identified of how mothers function in relation to their infants' development: mother as committed facilitator, creative provider and careful/caring monitor. the study considers the perceived normative nature of these positions and the impact they can have on middle-class women 's subjectivities as new mothers. this analysis of parental agendas and infant cognitive development suggests that a continued focus on the mother 's role within early infant development reflects and upholds ideologies of child-centred, intensive mothering, which risks precluding 'alternative' maternal subjectivities and promotes conservative feminine identities.
emergency_contraception	background: providing correct and complete counseling on the use of oral contraceptives (ocs) is central to securing the autonomy of women in child-bearing age and is a powerful, proven tool of social change. pharmacists in many developing countries such as egypt are involved in dispensing and at times prescribing pharmaceuticals, including oral contraceptives that are readily available without a prescription. objectives: to predict egyptian community pharmacists' counseling on oral contraceptives while utilizing a theoretical framework guided by the theory of planned behavior (tpb). methods: a cross-sectional, self-administered survey was completed by a random sample of community pharmacists in alexandria, egypt to determine their attitudes and behaviors regarding counseling on ocs. multiple regression was used to predict self-reported counseling on oral contraceptives as a function of the tpb-related constructs and six other factors - ""perceived importance of profit from dispensing ocs on pharmacy revenue,"" ""number of hours worked,"" ""age,"" ""gender,"" ""pharmacy practice degree"" and ""marital status"" of the pharmacist. results: of the 181 pharmacists invited to complete the survey, 168 (93%) participated. pharmacists indicated they talked to a slightly higher proportion of women about the importance of taking ocs at the same time daily than about topics such as which day to start taking ocs, side effects and what to do when a dose of ocs was missed. pharmacists' reported counseling on oral contraceptives was positively associated with their perception that women welcomed pharmacist initiated oc counseling (beta = 0.315, p < 0.001), perceived adequacy of time available to counsel women on ocs (beta = 0.290, p = 0.003) and the perceived number of women who asked for their help in selecting an oc without providing a prescription in the past week (beta = 0.160, p = 0.018). pharmacists reported that women 's welcoming pharmacists initiating oc counseling was associated with the pharmacists' reported percent who asked pharmacists for oc advice out of the last 5 women seeking oc (r = 0.45; p < 0.0001). male pharmacists were less likely than female pharmacists to report that women welcomed pharmacist initiated oc counseling (r = -0.27; p = 0.0005). conclusions: the tpb appears to help predict pharmacists' oc counseling. there is a need to prepare pharmacists who are frequently requested to assist women with the selection of an oral contraceptive. interventions that would facilitate women 's requests for information may be valuable to increase pharmacists' counseling on oral contraceptives. future qualitative and observational studies are needed to assess complexities in counseling on oral contraceptives in developing countries.

fungal_infection	dermatophytosis is superficial cutaneous fungal infection of skin, hair, and nails. trichophyton tonsurans is an anthropophilic cosmopolitan dermatophyte most frequently associated with tinea capitis. a 58-year-old female presented with non-healing ulcers of 6-month duration on left leg, mimicking squamous cell carcinoma and atypical mycobacterial infection. skin biopsy was taken and preparation of 10% koh revealed plenty of thin hyaline septate hyphae. fungal culture on sda with and without antibiotics showed whitish suede like fungal growth with central furrows. the fungus was identified as trichophyton tonsurans. antifungal treatment was started and patient improved drastically after 3-4 weeks of treatment. we conclude that for all cases of non-healing ulcers, a suspicion of fungal infection must be kept and skin biopsy should be sent for fungal culture.
parenting	the present paper reports on longitudinal associations between parenting stress and sexual satisfaction among 169 heterosexual couples in the first year after the birth of a first child. actor partner interdependence modeling (apim) was used to model the effects of the mother 's and father 's parenting stress at 6 months after birth on sexual satisfaction at 1 year after birth. based on social constructivist theory and scarcity theory, two hypotheses were posed: (a) mothers' parenting stress will predict their own later sexual satisfaction whereas fathers' parenting stress will not predict their own later sexual satisfaction (actor effects) and (b) mothers' parenting stress will predict fathers' later sexual satisfaction but fathers' parenting stress will not predict mothers' later sexual satisfaction (partner effects). on average, parents were only somewhat satisfied with their sex life. the first hypothesis was supported as greater parenting stress significantly predicted lower sexual satisfaction for mothers but not for fathers. the second hypothesis was also supported as mothers' greater parenting stress significantly predicted less sexual satisfaction in fathers, whereas fathers' parenting stress did not significantly predict mothers' sexual satisfaction. we discuss how our results may be interpreted considering the social construction of gendered family roles.
allergies	food allergies have become a global challenge to food safety in industrialized countries in recent years. with governmental monitoring and legislation moving towards the establishment of threshold allergen doses, there is a need for sensitive and quantitative analytical methods for the determination of allergenic food contaminants. targeted proteomics employing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) has emerged as a promising technique that offers increased specificity and reproducibility compared to antibody and dna-based technologies. as the detection of trace levels of allergenic food contaminants also demands excellent sensitivity, we aimed to significantly increase the analytical performance of lc-ms by utilizing multiple reaction monitoring cubed (mrm3) technology. following a bottom-up proteomics approach, including a straightforward sample preparation process, 38 mrm3 experiments specific to 18 proteotypic peptides were developed and optimized. this permitted the highly specific identification of peanut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, pistachio, and walnut. the analytical performance of the method was assessed for three relevant food matrices with different chemical compositions. limits of detection were around 1 mu g/g or below in fortified matrix samples, not accounting for the effects of food processing. compared to an mrm-based approach, the mrm3-based method showed an increase in sensitivity of up to 30-fold. regression analysis demonstrated high linearity of the mrm3 signal in spiked matrix samples together with robust intersample reproducibility, confirming that the method is highly applicable for quantitative purposes. to the best of our knowledge, we describe here the most sensitive lc-ms multi-method for food allergen detection thus far. in addition, this is the first study that systematically compares mrm3 with mrm for the analysis of complex foods.
menopause	serotonin plays a key role in mood or affect, and dysfunction of the serotonin system has been linked to depression in humans and animal models. depression appears prior to or coincident with overt symptoms of alzheimer 's disease (ad) in about 50% of patients, and some experts consider it a risk factor for the development of ad. in addition, ad is more prevalent in women, who also show increased incidence of depression. indeed, it has been proposed that mechanisms underlying depression overlap the mechanisms thought to hasten ad. women undergo ovarian failure and cessation of ovarian steroid production in middle age and the postmenopausal period correlates with an increase in the onset of depression and ad. this laboratory has examined the many actions of ovarian steroids in the serotonin system of non-human primates using a rhesus macaque model of surgical menopause with short or long-term estradiol (e) or estradiol plus progesterone (e+p) replacement therapy. in this mini-review, we present a brief synopsis of the relevant literature concerning ad, depression, and serotonin. we also present some of our data on serotonin neuron viability, the involvement of the caspase-independent pathway, and apoptosis-inducing factor in serotonin-neuron viability, as well as gene expression related to neurodegeneration and neuron viability in serotonin neurons from adult and aged surgical menopausal macaques. we show that ovarian steroids, particularly e, are crucial for serotonin neuron function and health. in the absence of e, serotonin neurons are endangered and deteriorating toward apoptosis. the possibility that this scenario may proceed or accompany ad in postmenopausal women seems likely.
parenting	to examine child factors and parental characteristics as predictors of discrepancies between parents' ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in a sample of preschool children with adhd and behavior problems and in a nonclinical sample. we investigated correspondence and discrepancies between parents' ratings on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems broadband scales of the child behavior checklist version for preschool children (cbcl/1.5-5). parents of 152 preschool children, with adhd and behavior problems (n = 72) and nonclinical children (n = 80), aged between 28 and 72 months (m = 47.26, sd = 12.7), completed the cbcl/1.5-5. candidate predictors of discrepancy included the child 's age and sex, and parents' levels of parenting stress, depressive mood, attention-deficit and disruptive behavior. hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. correspondence between parents, both for ratings on internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, was high (r = .63-.77). in the clinical sample, mothers rated the severity of externalizing behavior problems significantly higher than did fathers (p = < .001). discrepancy between fathers and mothers on externalizing behavior problems was not predicted by child factors or interparental differences in psychopathology, but it was predicted by interparental differences in parenting stress (r (2) = .25, p < .001). this effect was significantly larger in the nonclinical sample (delta r (2) = .06, p < .001). when parents disagree on the severity level of preschool children 's externalizing behavior problems, the clinician should take into consideration that differences in parenting stress might be involved.
fungal_infection	backgroundinvasive fungal infections (ifis) are an infrequent but major complication of heart transplantation (ht). we sought to describe the epidemiology at our institution. methodsa prospective cohort study of 159 heart transplant recipients was performed from june 2005 to december 2012. ifis were defined by european organization for research and treatment of cancer/mycoses study group criteria. resultsby univariate analysis, hispanic ethnicity was associated with ifi (p=.01, odds ratio [or] 7.0, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.7-27.9). subsequently, a multivariate logistic regression was performed adjusting for hispanic ethnicity, age, and gender. seventeen ifis were identified, occurring at a median 110days post ht (interquartile range: 32-411days). five ifis (29% of ifis and 3.1% of all ht) occurred during the ht hospitalization, with 13 ifis during the first year (incidence 8.2%). conclusionsthe cumulative incidence was 10.7%. ifis were associated with pre- and post-ht vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonization and/or infection, post-ht renal replacement therapy, anti-thymocyte globulin induction, and antibody-mediated rejection. there were no associations with diabetes mellitus, desensitization, 2r/3r cellular rejection, treatments for rejection, re-operation, neutropenia, or cytomegalovirus infection. ifis were associated with death (p=.02, or 3.9, 95% ci 1.3-12.1) and 1-year mortality (p<.001, or 9.0, 95% ci 2.3-35.7), but not 3-year mortality. associations with hispanic ethnicity must be validated. optimal strategies for risk reduction and prophylaxis remain undefined.
diabetes	background: sixty years ago diabetes was almost non-existent in greenland and until the beginning of this century awareness of diabetes was quite minimal. a high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes has been reported in repeated population surveys. increased focus on diabetes has been made a priority within the health care system since 2008, and in 2010 glycated haemoglobin was introduced as a diagnostic tool to further facilitate the diagnosis of diabetes. objective: the aim of this study was to estimate the age and gender specific use of glycated haemoglobin in 2014 and 2015, as an indicator of diagnostic activity and awareness of diabetes, and to estimate the prevalence of diagnosed pre-diabetes and diabetes among adults in greenland aged 20-79 years of age. methods: the study was performed as an observational, cross sectional register study based on information gleaned from the electronically laboratory system used in greenland including all patients tested with glycated haemoglobin at least once in 2014 or 2015. results: a total of 10,127 patients were tested with glycated haemoglobin in 2014 or 2015 corresponding to 18.1% of the whole population. among adults aged 20- 79 years 9506 patients were tested corresponding to 24.0% of the total adult population. more females (32.5%) than males (16.5%) aged 20-79 years old were tested (p < 0.001). the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and high risk pre-diabetes among adults aged 20-79 years was 4.3 and 6.8% respectively. conclusion: in conclusion use of glycated haemoglobin is widely used in the health care system in greenland indicating a high awareness of diabetes in the population and by the health care system. still, awareness of undiagnosed diabetes remains an important issue and additional strategies targeting males under 70 years old must be considered.
fungal_infection	purpose infection and malignancy represent two common complications after solid organ transplantation, which are often characterized by poorly specific clinical symptomatology. herein, we have evaluated the role of f-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (fdg) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (pet/ct) in this clinical setting. methods fifty-eight consecutive patients who underwent fdg pet/ct after kidney, lung or heart transplantation were included in this retrospective analysis. twelve patients underwent fdg pet/ct to strengthen or confirm a diagnostic suspicion of malignancies. the remaining 46 patients presented with unexplained inflammatory syndrome, fever of unknown origin (fuo), cmv or ebv seroconversion during post-transplant follow-up without conclusive conventional imaging. fdg pet/ct results were compared to histology or to the finding obtained during a clinical/imaging follow-up period of at least 6 months after pet/ct study. results positive fdg pet/ct results were obtained in 18 (31 %) patients. in the remaining 40 (69 %) cases, fdg pet/ct was negative, showing exclusively a physiological radiotracer distribution. on the basis of a patient-based analysis, fdg pet/ct 's sensitivity, specificity, ppv and npv were respectively 78 %, 90 %, 78 % and 90 %, with a global accuracy of 86 %. fdg pet/ct was true positive in 14 patients with bacterial pneumonias (n = 4), pulmonary fungal infection (n = 1), histoplasmosis (n = 1), cutaneous abscess (n = 1), inflammatory disorder (sacroiliitis) (n = 1), lymphoma (n = 3) and nsclc (n = 3). on the other hand, fdg pet/ct failed to detect lung bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma, septicemia, endocarditis and graft-versus-host disease (gvhd), respectively, in four patients. fdg pet/ct contributed to adjusting the patient therapeutic strategy in 40 % of cases. conclusions fdg pet/ct emerges as a valuable technique to manage complications in the post-transplantation period. fdg pet/ct should be considered in patients with severe unexplained inflammatory syndrome or fuo and inconclusive conventional imaging or to discriminate active from silent lesions previously detected by conventional imaging particularly when malignancy is suspected.
hypothyroidism	background: subclinical hypothyroidism (sch) is defined as high tsh and normal thyroxine. data on the effects of early substitution by levothyroxine on psychophysical health in sch are still not consistent enough to support its introduction. methods: clinical parameters, biochemical data and quality of life (short form 36 questionnaire) were measured before the intervention and 3 months after the euthyroid state had been achieved in sch patients. results: significant reduction in body weight (p = 0.030), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.024, p = 0.019), homocysteine (p< 0.001), leukocytes and neutrophils (p = 0.011, p = 0.001), inr (p = 0.049), k levels (p = 0.040, p= 0.013), hba1c (p= 0.001), fasting insulin (p< 0.001) and insulin resistance measured by homa index (p< 0.001), lipid parameters (total cholesterol (p< 0.001), ldl-cholesterol (p< 0.001), triglycerides (p = 0.007), apob (p = 0.022), lp(a) (p< 0.001), ldl/hdl (p = 0.008), lap (p = 0.04) and apob/apoa1 ratios (p< 0.023)), tsh (p< 0.001) and tabs p< 0.001) was recorded. frequency of fatty liver (20% to 2.9%, p = 0.016), hyperlipidemia (85% to 65.7%, p = 0.001) and metabolic syndrome (34.3% to 2.9%, p = 0.070) significantly decreased. a statistically significant positive association was found between the average dose of levothyroxine and changes in physical functioning (r= 0.391, p = 0.020), vitality (r= 0.393, p = 0.020), mental health (r= 0.374, p = 0.027) and overall dimensions of mental health (r= 0.376, p = 0.026). with increasing doses of levothyroxine, the previously listed scores of sf 36 grew (r= 0.296, p = 0.084). conclusions: early substitution of sch improved the many clinical and biochemical parameters related to cardiovascular risk. quality of life was also improved, and correlated only with thyroxine doses suggesting an indirect relationship between the degree of hypothyroidism and quality of life.
alzheimer's_disease	aimsaxonal degeneration is a pathological symbol in the early stage of alzheimer 's disease (ad), which can be triggered by amyloid- (a) peptide deposition. growing evidence indicates that deficit of autophagy eventually leads to the axonal degeneration. our previous studies have shown that dendrobium nobile lindl alkaloid (dnla) had protective effect on neuron impairment in vivo and in vitro; however, the underlying mechanisms is still unclear. methodswe exposed cultured hippocampus neurons to a(25-35) to investigate the effect of dnla in vitro. axonal degeneration was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and mtt assay. neurons overexpressing gfp-lc3b were used to measure the formation of autophagosome. autophagosome-lysosome fusion, the lysosomal ph, and cathepsin activity were assessed to reflect autophagy process. proteins of interest were analyzed by western blot. resultsdnla pretreatment significantly inhibited axonal degeneration induced by a(25-35) peptide in vitro. further studies revealed dnla treatment increased autophagic flux through promoting formation and degradation of autophagosome in hippocampus neurons. moreover, enhancement of autophagic flux was responsible for the protective effects of dnla on axonal degeneration. conclusionsdnla prevents a(25-35)-induced axonal degeneration via activation of autophagy process and could be a novel therapeutic target.
fungal_infection	background: invasive fungal infection (ifi) has increased in recent years due to there being a greater number of risk factors. ifi caused by candida is the most frequent, and although candida albicans is the most isolated species, there is currently a decrease of c albicans and an increase of other species of the genus. aims: to analyse the epidemiology, risk factors, and antifungal susceptibility of blood culture isolates of non-c albicans candida species in our hospital in the last 12 years. methods: a retrospective study was conducted on 107 patients with candidaemia admitted to our hospital. candida isolates susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin b, 5-fluorocytosine, caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin was determined by means of a micro dilution technique (sensititre yeast one; izasa, spain). results: from a total of 109 strains, 59 belonged to non-c. albicans candida species: 25 candida parapsilosis complex, 14 candida glabrata complex, 13 candida tropicalis, 4 candidci krusei, 1 candida lipolytica, 1 candida membranaefaciens, and 1 candida pulcherrima. the most common risk factor in adults and children was catheter use. it was observed that 8.5% of those non-c. albicans strains were resistant to fiuconazole. conclusions: the results of this work confirm that it is necessary in know the epidemiology of non c. albicans candida species, the in vitro susceptibility of the species involved, and the main risk factors, especially in patients with predisposing conditions. 2016 asociacion espanola de micologia. published by elsevier espana, s.l.u. all rights reserved.
hypothyroidism	tyrosine kinase inhibitor-related toxicities have been reported to be predictive and/or prognostic factors in patients affected by metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc). we aim to investigate the incidence of cumulative toxicity and its prognostic role in mrcc patients treated with sunitinib or pazopanib. mrcc patients treated with sunitinib or pazopanib at the european institute of oncology in milan were reviewed for the incidence of adverse events. cumulative toxicity was defined as the presence of more than one selected adverse event of any grade. prognoses were evaluated by the international mrcc database consortium criteria. progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) were estimated using the kaplan-meier method and cox analysis. a total of 104 patients were included in the final analysis. only 18.3% did not experience any of the selected toxicities: 26.9% had one, 35.6% had two and 19.2% all three toxicities. accordingly, 54.8% of patients experienced cumulative toxicity. in those with or without cumulative toxicity, the median pfs was 27.6 versus 7.2 months and the median os was 61.2 versus 18.7 months, respectively. when cumulative toxicity was adjusted for international mrcc database consortium prognostic groups, it maintained its prognostic role for both pfs (hazard ratio: 0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.49; p < 0.001) and os (hazard ratio: 0.27, 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.48; p < 0.001). a major limitation was the retrospective and monocentric nature of the analysis. we reported the prognostic role of cumulative toxicity because of hypertension, hypothyroidism and hand-foot syndrome in patients affected by mrcc and treated with sunitinib or pazopanib. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: nonanesthetic colonoscopy is popular in clinical practice in china. however, intestinal spasms often result in a prolonged examination time, increased operating difficulties, decreased polyp detection rate, and failure to complete the procedure clinically. therefore, exploring alternative approaches that can reduce the pain in patients during colonoscopy is of utmost importance, and finding the optimal preoperative administration to improve the quality of nonanesthetic colonoscopy is also necessary. this study aimed to investigate the effects of the prophylactic administration of pinaverium bromide before colonoscopy and the effects of pinaverium bromide alone at different time points or combined with scopolamine butylbromide. methods: a randomized controlled trial was performed on a cohort of 1000 patients who underwent colonoscopy in outpatient clinic of wuhan union hospital. the patients were randomly assigned to the following groups: group a, given oral pinaverium bromide (100 mg, three times a day) one day before examination combined with intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide (20 mg) 10 min before colonoscopy; group b-0, given pinaverium bromide alone on the day of colonoscopy (100 mg, three times a day); group b-1, given pinaverium bromide alone (100 mg, three times a day) one day before colonoscopy; group b-2, given pinaverium bromide alone (100 mg, three times a day) two days before colonoscopy; and group c, given scopolamine butylbromide alone (20 mg) before colonoscopy. the successful rate of colonoscopy, procedure time, degree of abdominal pain, and polyp detection rate were recorded and compared among all groups. results: the successful rate of colonoscopy in group b-1 (82.0%) and group b-2 (83.0%) was significantly higher than that in group b-0 (62.0%, all p0.05). the successful rate of colonoscopy in group a (92.0%) was significantly higher than that in group b-1 (82.0%) and group c (80.0%; both p < 0.05). moreover, the time for the colonoscope to reach the ileocecal region in group a were markedly shorter as compared to those in group b-1 and group c (p < 0.05). the polyp detection rate in group a was 32.0%, significantly higher than that in group b-1 (24.0%, p < 0.05) and group c (24.2%, p < 0.05). conclusion: administration of pinaverium bromide alone one day before examination was beneficial to relieve symptoms of abdominal pain during nonanesthetic colonoscopy. in addition, therapeutic effects were improved when pinaverium bromide administration was combined with intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide. therefore, the combined use of pinaverium bromide with scopolamine butylbromide might have great application value to improve the quality of nonanesthetic colonoscopy in the preoperative preparation.
hypothyroidism	background thyroid function tests are one of the commonly undertaken investigations in any paediatric outpatient department. based on the existing literature, there are no standard guidelines in respect of the sampling procedure to be followed in infants and children. every paediatrician is aware of the logistic problems in taking a fasting sample in infants and younger children unlike adults. in this context, it was planned to undertake a pilot study to identify if the timing of sampling, fasting or postprandial status, makes any difference with respect to the thyroid function tests in children materials and methods this was a descriptive study undertaken at the paediatric unit of chengalpattu medical college to evaluate if there is any difference between fasting and postprandial blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and free t4 in children. the study was approved by the institutional ethical committee and informed written consent and assent obtained prior to study. fifty one children between 1 and 12 years of age were recruited based on their willingness, from the endocrine clinic and the paediatric outpatient clinic. fasting and postprandial blood samples were collected by venepuncture at 8 a.m. and 10.15 a.m. respectively. blood samples were analysed using electrochemiluminescence method. data analysis was done using epi info software. results 51 children underwent fasting and postprandial sampling for thyroid evaluation. the results did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the fasting and postprandial samples for both tsh and free t4. the same was true for both hypothyroid and euthyroid children. subclinical hypothyroidism was encountered in one child in the fasting sample. conclusion this pilot study revealed that postprandial tsh and free t4 can be used as reliable test for thyroid evaluation as is a fasting sample in children.
hypothyroidism	objective - to study the relationship between the level of thyroid hormones and clinical, autonomic, structural and functional characteristics of heart affections, activity of immune inflammation markers, endothelial dysfunction by means of cognitive modeling. methods. 60 patients with coronary heart disease with concomitant hypothyroidism were examined (the average level of tsh 13.05 +/- 3.30 mu/ml, the average level of ft4 11.45 +/- 0.72 pmol l, the average age of patients -60.5 (54.0; 64.5) years, among them 16 (27 %) were men and 44 (73 %) women. the complex clinical examination including clinical, biochemical, immune-enzyme and instrumental methods of examination, correlation and regression analysis of the data was carried out. results. the correlation analysis showed that in patients with coronary heart disease, comorbid with hypothyroidism, the reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction was mostly associated with the increasing levels of neopterin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = -0.37 and r = -0.38 respectively; p < 0.05); condition of myocardial stiffness correlated with the concentration of c-reactive protein (r = +0,56; p < 0,05); level of total cholesterol (tc) - with concentration of neopterin (r = + 0.39; p < 0.05) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) (r= +0.50; p < 0.05); heart rate variability parameters and indicators of myocardial ischemic changes correlated with the level of neopterin and endothelin-1. the value of ft4 had a correlation with the concentration of neopterin (r = -0.34; p < 0.05) and pai-1 (r = -0.52; p < 0.05), left ventricular myocardium mass index (lvmi) (r =-0.44; p < 0.05), early and late diastolic filling velocities of the left ventricle and their ratio (r = + 0.50, r = -0,42 and r = -0.41, respectively, p < 0.05), standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (sdnn) in the active (r = + 0.45; p < 0.05) and passive (r = + 0.36; p < 0.05) periods, tc (r = -0.33; p < 0.05). the performed regression analysis confirmed the direction of relations, also allowed to build the cognitive model of the clinical course of ischemic heart disease in patients with hypothyroidism, where the ft4 acts as a connecting link. conclusions. the cognitive model developed on the basis of correlation and regression analyzes demonstrates clinical and pathogenetic role of immune inflammation markers and endothelial dysfunction in the progression of structural and functional heart disorders, ischemic and autonomic changes in chd patients with concomitant hypothyroidism, where ft4 level acts as a connecting link.
weight_loss	introduction. lesbian and bisexual (lb) women have higher body weight than heterosexual women. interventions focused on health and well-being versus weight loss may be more likely to succeed among lb women. this article describes effects of women 's health and mindfulness, a 12-week pilot intervention addressing mindfulness, healthy eating, and physical activity, on outcomes associated with chronic disease risk among overweight and obese lb women older than 40 years. method. eighty women were randomized, using a stepped-wedge design, to either an immediate- or a delayed-start intervention group; the delayed-start group served as the control. eligible participants were aged 40 years or older, identified as lb, and had a body mass index of 27 or greater. we compared differences in biological markers of chronic disease, mindfulness, nutrition, and physical activity between immediate- and delayed-start intervention groups. results. we observed clinically significant improvements in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but no change in hemoglobin a1c. we found evidence of intervention effects on improved mindfulness and mindful eating scores and on nutrition (improved vegetable intake). conclusions. the women 's health and mindfulness pilot intervention appears to have initiated positive behavioral and physical health changes in this population. refinements to the intervention model, such as extended intervention duration, and longer term follow-up are warranted to determine sustained effects.
fungal_infection	the co-occurrence of different antagonists on a plant can greatly affect infochemicals with ecological consequences for higher trophic levels. here we investigated how the presence of a plant pathogen, the powdery mildew erysiphe cruciferarum, on brassica rapa affects (1) plant volatiles emitted in response to damage by a specialist herbivore, pieris brassicae; (2) the attraction of the parasitic wasp cotesia glomerata and (3) the performance of p. brassicae and c. glomerata. plant volatiles were significantly induced by herbivory in both healthy and mildew-infected plants, but were quantitatively 41% lower for mildew-infected plants compared to healthy plants. parasitoids strongly preferred pieris-infested plants to dually-infested (pieris+mildew) plants, and preferred dually infested plants over only mildew-infected plants. the performance of p. brassicae was unaffected by powdery mildew, but c. glomerata cocoon mass was reduced when parasitized caterpillars developed on mildew-infected plants. thus, avoidance of mildew-infested plants may be adaptive for c. glomerata parasitoids, whereas p. brassicae caterpillars may suffer less parasitism on mildew-infected plants in nature. from a pest management standpoint, the concurrent presence of multiple plant antagonists can affect the efficiency of specific natural enemies, which may in turn have a negative impact on the regulation of pest populations. the co-occurrence of different antagonists on a plant can have multitrophic consequences at the community level. here we show that infection by a fungal pathogen, the powdery mildew erysiphe cruciferarum, on brassica rapa strongly reduces plant volatiles emitted in response to damage by the insect herbivore pieris brassicae, and reduces plant attractiveness to the main natural enemy of p. brassicae, the parasitic wasp cotesia glomerata. herbivore performance was unaffected by the presence of powdery mildew, but parasitoid performance was negatively affected (decreased cocoon mass). from a pest management standpoint, the presence of powdery mildew on brassica plants may affect the foraging efficiency of natural enemies, which may in turn have a negative impact on the regulation of pest populations.
menopause	under physiological conditions, the endothelium generates vasodilator signals [prostacyclin, nitric oxide no and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (edh)], for the regulation of vascular tone. the relative importance of these two signals depends on the diameter of the blood vessels: as the diameter of the arteries decreases, the contribution of edh to the regulation of vascular tone increases. the mechanism involved in edh varies with species and blood vessel types; nevertheless, activation of endothelial intermediate-and small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (ikca and skca, respectively) is characteristic of the edh pathway. ikca-and skca-mediated edh are reduced with endothelial dysfunction, which develops with ageing and hypertension, and is less pronounced in female than in age-matched male until after menopause. impaired edh-mediated relaxation is related to a reduced involvement of skca, so that the response becomes more dependent on ikca. the latter depends on the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (ampk) and silent information regulator t1 (sirt1), proteins associated with the process of cellular senescence and vascular signalling in response to the female hormone. an understanding of the role of ampk and/or sirt1 in edh-like responses may help identifying effective pharmacological strategies to prevent the development of vascular complications of different aetiologies.
heart_disease	the aim of this study was to reduce the level of homocysteine (hcy) by high-methionine dietary supplementation of folic acid and to evaluate changes in lipid parameters in blood serum of experimental rats. the animals were randomly divided into seven groups (n=6, male), and were fed seven different diets for 52 days. the rodents were fed with the ain-93g semi-synthetic diet (group i), supplemented with 32 g of methionine/kg diet (group ii), whereas groups iii-vii were fed with ain-93g semi-synthetic diet supplemented with 32 g of methionine/kg diet and 2, 4, 8, 18 and 28 g of folic acid/kg diet, respectively. contents of of homocysteine, total cholesterol level, hdl fraction and triacylglycerols were assessed enzymatically in rats serum. in addition, the ldl+vldl cholesterol content was calculated. folic acid content in the diet was found to be highly negatively correlated with homocysteine content (r=-0.95) and negatively correlated with triacylglycerols content (r=-0.94) in the serum of rats. in the serum of rats which were fed the methionine diet with the highest-folic acid supplementation (28 mg folic acid/kg diet), homocysteine and triglyceride contents were significantly lower, compared to animals fed other types of experimental diets.
birth_control	using a nationally representative data set (n = 3,000), the public religion research institute 's american values survey, we conduct multivariate regression analysis to determine the empirical impact of attitudes regarding the birth control mandate and abortion on presidential vote choice. we also conduct factor analysis to determine whether voters conceptualized the birth control mandate and abortion similarly. we find that support for the obama administration 's birth control mandate was significantly related to voting for obama for both women and men voters, although the impact was stronger for women. however, the impact of the war on women rhetoric on voters' choices was limited to the issue of insurance coverage for birth control rather than extending to the issue of abortion. unlike attitudes about abortion, we find that voters conceptualized the birth control mandate less as a culture war issue and more as a role of government issue. given this conceptualization of the mandate by voters, our findings reaffirm previous research that suggests that the gender gap in voting is largely driven by attitudinal differences regarding the role of government in providing social welfare benefits and equal opportunity for women.
sports_injuries	background: hamstring injury is the most common muscular lesion in athletes. the conservative treatment is well described, and surgical management is often indicated for proximal tendinous avulsions. to our knowledge, no surgical treatment has been proposed for failure of conservative treatment in musculotendinous hamstring lesions. purpose: to describe the surgical management of proximal and distal hamstring musculotendinous junction lesions in professional athletes after failure of conservative treatment. study design: case series; level of evidence, 4. methods: a consecutive series of 10 professional athletes, including 4 soccer players, 4 rugby players, and 2 handball players, underwent surgical intervention between october 2010 and june 2014 for the treatment of recurrent musculotendinous hamstring injuries. all athletes had failed at least 3 months of conservative treatment for a recurrent musculotendinous hamstring injury. surgical resection of the musculotendinous scar tissue was performed using a longitudinal muscular suture. lower extremity functional scale (lefs) and marx scores were obtained at the 3-month follow-up, and a final phone interview was completed to determine recurrence of hamstring injury and return to previous level of play. results: the mean age at surgery was 25.2 years (range, 19-35 years). the musculotendinous hamstring lesions involved 8 semitendinosus and 2 biceps femoris, with 6 injuries located proximally and 4 distally. conservative treatment lasted a mean 5.1 months (range, 3-9 months) after last recurrence, and the patients had an average of 2.7 (range, 2-5) separate incidents of injury recurrence before surgical intervention was decided upon. at the 3-month follow-up, all patients had marx activity scores of 16 and lefs scores of 80. all 10 patients returned to the same level of play at a mean 3.4 months (range, 2-5 months). at a mean follow-up of 28.7 months, none of the athletes had suffered a recurrence. no surgical complication was encountered. conclusion: in cases of failed conservative treatment of musculotendinous hamstring lesions, surgical intervention may be a viable treatment option in professional athletes and allows the patient to return to the same level of play.
weight_loss	parkinson 's disease (pd) patients are at a higher risk of malnutrition. the prevalence has been estimated to 0-24%, while 3%-60% of pd patients are reported to be at risk of malnutrition. to date, there is no clear explanation for malnutrition in these patients. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and to analyze factors that influence its appearance. the mini nutritional assessment (mna) was used to determine normal nutritional status; at risk of malnutrition; and already malnourished status. the unified parkinson 's disease rating scale (updrs) parts iii and iv, hoehn and yahr scale (h&y scale), beck depression inventory (bdi), mini mental state examination (mmse), questionnaire for impulsive-compulsive disorders in parkinson 's disease-rating scale - eating part (quip-rs) and mini nutritional assessment (mna) were used to evaluate the factors affecting patient nutritional status. out of 96 patients, 55,2% were at risk of malnutrition, while 8,3% had already been malnourished. age, h&y scale, updrs part iii, 'off periods and depression influence negatively on mna. more patients with 'off periods were rigor dominant. thyroid gland hormone therapy was related to malnutrition, while patients with normal nutritional status used ropinirole more often than pramipexole. factors affecting nutritional status are age, motor symptoms and stage severity, 'off states, rigidity dominant type with 'off states, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy. ropinirole exhibited the possible 'protective' effect against malnutrition.

birth_control	there are several methods used for non-surgical sterilization in birth control including quinacrine, trichloroacetic acid (tca), erythromycin, tetracycline, silver nitrate and talcum powder. among these, talcum powder, tca and silver nitrate are the most commonly used. however, the toxic and carcinogenic activities of these chemicals in ovarian tissue have been poorly elucidated. this study demonstrates the expression levels of antioxidant, apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes after administration of talc powder, tca and silver nitrate for non-surgical sterilization in female rat models. the expression changes of some micrornas (mir-15b, mir-21, mir-34a and mir-98) that play key roles in the apoptosis pathway were also included. all expression analyses were evaluated with real-time pcr. the expression levels of all genes appeared to be upregulated in the talcum powder group, but the results were not statistically significant. increased expression of gsr and sod1 genes was statistically significant in the talcum powder group. in tca and silver nitrate group, expression of all genes was appeared to be elevated but only the gsr expression was statistically significant in the tca-administrated group; there were no statistically significant changes in the silver nitrate group. mirna expression levels were increased in talcum powder and tca-administrated groups, but these results were not significant. expression levels of mir-15b, mir-21 and mir-98 in the silver nitrate group were significantly increased. consequently, these chemicals appear to be non-carcinogenic agents for rat ovarian tissue which do not induce apoptosis. however, talcum powder and tca can be considered as agents that are toxic to ovarian tissue.
fungal_infection	since their introduction in the late 1990s, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)- inhibitors have proven effective in the treatment of several inflammatory disorders, and their use has become increasingly common. tumor necrosis factor- blockade is nonetheless associated with an increase in the risk of infection by intracellular, granuloma-forming pathogens, such as histoplasma capsulatum. we performed a query of our medical records for all cases of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients receiving tnf- inhibitors between the years 1999 and 2014 at university hospitals case medical center in cleveland, ohio, an area of moderate histoplasmosis endemicity. a total of 357 cases of disseminated histoplasmosis were identified, 8 (2.2%) of whom were receiving tnf- inhibitor therapy at the time of diagnosis. five patients were receiving infliximab, and 3 were receiving adalimumab. all patients had generalized, nonspecific presenting symptoms, and all but one had a complete response to antifungal treatment and the cessation of the inciting tnf- inhibitor. five of the patients eventually resumed tnf- inhibitor therapy a year after their initial diagnosis with disseminated histoplasmosis. the only patient who succumbed to the infection had a delayed diagnosis. the increasing use of tnf- inhibitors should come with an increased awareness of its association with opportunistic infections including disseminated histoplasmosis and by other endemic fungi. this case series highlights the importance of early diagnosis of such infections to achieve a favorable outcome. further research will need to focus on determining the best long-term treatment strategies in managing these patients after the resolution of the acute infection.
hepatitis_c	background: urine biomarkers have helped identify persons at risk for progressing to kidney disease in the setting of hiv infection. we explored factors associated with changes in 3 urine biomarkers over 10 years among women living with hiv. methods: prospective cohort of 294 hiv-infected women from the multicenter women 's interagency hiv study. predictors included hiv viral and immunological parameters, comorbid conditions, and health-related behaviors. outcomes were patterns of changes of urine interleukin-18 (il-18), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (acr), and alpha1-microglobulin (alpha 1m) over 10 years. we used quantile regression to examine patterns of change in each urine biomarker during follow-up and multivariable analysis of variance regression to identify predictors of biomarker changes. results: over 10 years, the median concentrations of il-18 declined from 120 to 64 pg/ml, alpha 1m rose from 0.7 to 1.5 ng/ml, and acr remained stable (9-8 mg/g). in multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors of increases in il-18 were higher baseline body mass index, increase in waist circumference, higher follow-up hiv viral load, lower follow-up cd4 cell count, hepatitis c virus (hcv) coinfection, and higher follow-up high density lipoprotein cholesterol. predictors of increasing concentration of a1m were lower cd4 cell counts, higher diastolic blood pressure, hcv coinfection, and smoking. finally, determinants of acr increases during follow-up were higher follow-up diastolic blood pressure, hcv coinfection, higher follow-up hiv viral load, and triglyceride concentration. conclusions: over 10 years, hiv disease status had different associations with each urine biomarker under study. overall, the associations with changes in each biomarker support research into their use for longitudinal monitoring of kidney health.
menopause	hypertension is associated with development of white matter hyperintensities (wmh) in the brain, which are risk factors for mild cognitive impairment. hormonal shifts at menopause alter vascular function putting women at risk for both hypertension and wmh. elevations in aortic hemodynamics precede the appearance of clinically defined hypertension but the relationship of aortic hemodynamics to development of wmh in women is not known. therefore, this study aimed to characterize aortic hemodynamics in relationship to wmh in postmenopausal women. aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure (bp), aortic augmentation index (alx) and aortic round trip travel time (aortic t (r)) by tonometry were examined in 53 postmenopausal women (age 60 +/- 2 years). wmh was calculated from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mri using a semi-automated segmentation algorithm. wmh as a fraction of total white matter volume positively associated with aortic systolic bp (regression coefficient = 0.018; p = 0.04) after adjusting for age. in addition, wmh fraction was positively associated with aix (0.025; p = 0.04), and inversely associated with aortic t (r) (-0.015; p = 0.04) after adjusting for age. our results suggest that assessing aortic hemodynamics may identify individuals at risk for accelerated development of wmh and guide early treatment to reduce wmh burden and cognitive impairment in the future.
hypothyroidism	radiofrequency (rf) parathyroid ablation is a noninvasive treatment for hyperparathyroidism in dogs. there are no published data assessing factors associated with rf parathyroid ablation success or failure in order to guide patient selection and improve outcome. the purpose of this retrospective analytical study was to determine whether imaging findings, biochemical data, or concurrent diseases were associated with rf heat ablation treatment failure. for inclusion in the study, dogs must have had a clinical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, undergone cervical ultrasound and rf ablation of abnormal parathyroid tissue, and must have had at least 3 months of follow-up information available following the date of ultrasound-guided parathyroid ablation. dogs were grouped based on those with recurrent or persistent hypercalcemia and those without recurrent or persistent hypercalcemia following therapy. parathyroid nodule size, thyroid lobe size, nodule location, and presence of concurrent disease were recorded. recurrence of hypercalcemia occurred in 9/32 dogs that had ablation of abnormal parathyroid tissue (28%) and one patient had persistent hypercalcemia (3%) following parathyroid ablation. nodule width (p = 0.036), height (p = 0.028), and largest cross-sectional area (p = 0.023) were larger in dogs that had recurrent or persistent hypercalcemia following ablation. hypothyroidism was more common in dogs with recurrent disease (p = 0.044). radiofrequency ablation was successful in 22/32 (69%) dogs. larger parathyroid nodule size and/or concurrent hypothyroidism were associated with treatment failure in dogs that underwent ultrasound-guided rf parathyroid nodule ablation.

sports_injuries	football players are more to violent impacts and injuries more than any athlete in any other sport. concussion or mild traumatic brain injuries were one of the lesser known sports injuries until the last decade. with the advent of modern technologies in medical and engineering disciplines, people are now more aware of concussion detection and prevention. these concussions are often overlooked by football players themselves. the cumulative effect of these mild traumatic brain injuries can cause long-term residual brain dysfunctions. the principle of concussion is based the movement of the brain in the neurocranium and viscerocranium. the brain is encapsulated by the cerebrospinal fluid which acts as a protective layer for the brain. this fluid can protect the brain against minor movements, however, any rapid movements of the brain may mitigate the protective capability of the cerebrospinal fluid. in this paper, we propose a wireless health monitoring helmet that addresses the concerns of the current monitoring methods - it is non-invasive for a football player as helmet is not an additional gear, it is efficient in performance as it is equipped with eeg nanosensors and 3d accelerometer, it does not restrict the movement of the user as it wirelessly communicates to the remote monitoring station, requirement of individual monitoring stations are not required for each player as the zigbee protocol can couple multiple transmitters with one receiver. a helmet was developed and validated according to the above mentioned parameters.
fungal_infection	cold exposure appears to activate aspects of the insect immune system; however, the functional significance of the relationship between cold and immunity is unclear. insect success at low temperatures is shaped in part by interactions with biotic stressors, such as pathogens, thus it is important to understand how and why immunity might be activated by cold. here we explore which components of the immune system are activated, and whether those components differ among different kinds of cold exposure. we exposed drosophila melanogaster to both acute (2 h, -2 degrees c) and sustained (10 h, -0.5 degrees c) cold, and measured potential (antimicrobial peptide expression, phenoloxidase activity, haemocyte counts) and realised (survival of fungal infection, wound-induced melanisation, bacterial clearance) immunity following recovery. acute cold increased circulating haemocyte concentration and the expression of turandot-a and diptericin, but elicited a short-term decrease in the clearance of gram-positive bacteria. sustained cold increased the expression of turandot-a, with no effect on other measures of potential or realised immunity. we show that measures of potential immunity were up-regulated by cold, whereas realised immunity was either unaffected or down-regulated. thus, we hypothesize that cold-activation of potential immunity in drosophila may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain stable immune function during or after low temperature exposure.

menopause	endometrial cancer is a major cancer in women and traditionally divided into type 1 and type 2. it is well known that type 2 endometrial cancer has a poor prognosis. studies have suggested that estrogen receptor (er) or progesterone receptor (pr) positive are positively associated with endometrial cancer survive. however whether the positivity of er or pr is different between cancer types has not been investigated yet. in this retrospective study, the positivity of er or pr was analysed in 1054 women with primary diagnosed endometrial cancer taking into account cancer types and menopausal status from the largest university teaching women 's hospital in china. the positivity of er or pr (over 90%) was significantly higher in type 1 compared to that in type 2 endometrial cancer (71% or 64%) in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. there was no different in positivity of er or pr in type 1 endometrial cancer between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. however, in type 2 endometrial cancer, the positivity of er or pr in premenopausal women was significantly higher compared to that in postmenopausal women. our data demonstrate that both er and pr positivity are significantly higher in type 1 endometrial cancer (92%) compared to type 2 (72% er positive, 65% pr positive). menopausal status is not associated with the positivity of er or pr in type 1 endometrial cancer. our data may provide some novel insights why asian women have better outcomes of endometrial cancer which was reported in the literature.
parenting	the main purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential for gender to moderate the relationships between facets of impulsivity and severity of problematic internet use (piu) among male and female university students in iran. in this study, 201 individuals (95 male, 106 female) completed the impulsive behavior scale-short form (lynam 2013) and the problematic and risky internet use screening scale (jelenchick et al. computers in human behavior, 35, 171-178, 2014) and multidimensional-structural equation modeling was used to investigate a moderating role for gender in the relationship between aspects of impulsivity and piu severity. in a general model including both genders and in models for males and females separately, the hypothesized relationship between impulsivity and piu severity demonstrated a good fit to the data. analyses also suggested that structural relations were equivalent for both groups. all regression weights in the general model and for each of the two groups were statistically significant. amongst males and females, the model predictor variable accounted for 25% and 16%, respectively, of the variance in piu severity. these findings suggest that impulsivity may predict piu severity similarly among iranian university students of both genders.
emergency_contraception	objectives when ulipristal acetate (upa) was introduced into the contraceptive and sexual health services service in june 2011 an algorithm was developed to guide method selection. the aim was to encourage clinicians to assess risk and to offer a copper intrauterine device (iud) as first-line choice with hormonal methods as second-line choice. methods upa was the second-line choice for presentations up to 120hours after high-risk episodes (i.e. around the time of ovulation). women at lower risk were also offered upa if presentation was between 72 and 120hours after unprotected intercourse unless the risk was very low, in which case levonorgestrel 1.5mg was the second-line choice. results prior to the protocol only 49% of women were offered an iud compared with 61.6% afterwards. this improved further in the subgroup of women at high risk where 93.3% were offered an iud compared with 59% initially. after the introduction of upa the percentage of women accepting the iud fell from 30% to 14.1%. overall 14.5% of women received upa compared to 7.8% receiving an iud. conclusions introduction of a standardised protocol for the provision of emergency contraception has significantly increased the proportion of women offered an iud as postcoital contraception, particularly in women at high risk of conception. introduction of upa has seen a halving of the number of women accepting the iud. this is cause for concern. further investigation into the reasons behind this decrease in iud uptake needs to be undertaken.
emergency_contraception	background: internet surveys that draw from traditionally generated samples provide the unique conditions to engage adolescents in exploration of sensitive health topics. methods: we examined awareness of unwanted pregnancy, abortion behaviour, methods, and attitudes toward specific legal indications for abortion via a school-based internet survey among 378 adolescents aged 12-21 years in three rio de janeiro public schools. results: forty-five percent knew peers who had undergone an abortion. most students (66.0%) did not disclose abortion method knowledge. however, girls (aor 4.2, 95% ci 2.4-7.2), those who had experienced their sexual debut (aor1.76, 95% ci 1.1-3.0), and those attending a prestigious magnet school (aor 2.7 95% ci 1.4-6.3) were more likely to report methods. most abortion methods (79.3%) reported were ineffective, obsolete, and/or unsafe. herbs (e. g. marijuana tea), over-the-counter medications, surgical procedures, foreign objects and blunt trauma were reported. most techniques (85.2%) were perceived to be dangerous, including methods recommended by the world health organization. a majority (61.4%) supported brazil 's existing law permitting abortion in the case of rape. there was no association between gender, age, sexual debut, parental education or socioeconomic status and attitudes toward legal abortion. however, students at the magnet school supported twice as many legal indications (2.7, se. 27) suggesting a likely role of peers and/or educators in shaping abortion views. conclusions: abortion knowledge and attitudes are not driven simply by age, religion or class, but rather a complex interplay that includes both social spaces and gender. prevention of abortion morbidity and mortality among adolescents requires comprehensive sexuality and reproductive health education that includes factual distinctions between safe and unsafe abortion methods.
alzheimer's_disease	introduction: neuropsychiatric symptoms (nps) in alzheimer 's disease (ad) are associated with significant negative outcomes for patients and their caregivers. agitation, one of the most distressing nps, lacks safe and effective long term interventions. nonpharmacological interventions are suggested as first-line treatment, but are n't effective for every patient, resulting in pharmacological interventions for some patients, consisting of off-label use of antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and antidepressants; where efficacy does n't necessarily outweigh associated risks.areas covered: gains in understanding neurobiological mechanisms underlying agitation have fueled several recent clinical trials. this article updates our review published in 2014. comprehensive literature search for published articles from january 2014 to december 2016 evaluating pharmacologic interventions for agitation in ad was done. a review of several clinical trials was completed: dextromethorphan/quinidine, scyllo-inositol, brexpiprazole, prazosin, cannabinoids, citalopram, escitalopram, pimavanserin, iti-007, orm-12741 show promise in treating agitation.expert opinion: neurobiological findings, innovative trials designs, statistical approaches, and preliminary paths for regulatory agency acceptance have re-ignited the area of pharmacological treatment of nps. though further research is needed to fully determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of these treatments, the mission to find effective treatments for neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation in patients with dementia is well underway.
cancer	basal marker expression in triple-negative breast cancers identifies basal-like tumours, and thus separates the tn group into two prognostic groups. however, the expression and prognostic significance of basal markers in luminal breast cancers are poorly described. the aim of this study was to investigate the expression and prognostic value of basal markers (ck5, ck14 and egfr) in luminal breast cancer. a total of 1423 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tumours from a well-characterized cohort of norwegian women, previously reclassified into molecular subtypes using ihc and ish, were included in the study. for the present study, tumours expressing at least one of the basal markers ck5, ck14 or egfr were defined as basal marker positive. cumulative incidence of death from breast cancer and hazard ratio analyses were used to assess prognosis according to basal marker expression. in total, 470 cases (33.0%) were basal marker positive. a higher proportion of the basal marker-positive tumours were of histopathological grade 3 compared to basal marker negative. for hormone receptor-positive, her2-negative cases, we found better prognosis for basal marker-positive breast cancer compared to basal marker negative. for all subtypes combined, poorer prognosis for basal marker-negative cases was found in histopathological grade 2 tumours but not among grade 1 and 3.
birth_control	unity in diversity. latin eugenic narratives in europe, c. 1910s-1930s. this article discusses the development of latin eugenics in europe between 1910s and 1930s, with a special focus on france, belgium, italy, spain and romania. during this period, latin eugenics offered a progressive programme of social and medical reform, alongside pronatalist campaigns to educate the population about the importance of large and healthy families. latin eugenics was premised on a number of theories and ideas developed since the early 1900s, particularly in france and italy, including puericulture and biotypology, and on its opposition to birth control, compulsory sterilization and nazi racism. considering the current revival in eugenic studies across europe and elsewhere it is important to engage with other eugenic traditions than the ones recurrently invoked in the scholarship. the history of latin eugenics in europe provides a much needed revision of conventional interpretations of eugenics that focused predominantly on anglo-american and german experiences.
alzheimer's_disease	oxidative stress is involved in many neurological diseases, including alzheimer 's disease. punicalagin (pc) is a hydrolysable polyphenol derived from punica granatum and a potent antioxidant. in this study, the neuroprotective effect of pc on glutamate-induced oxidative stress was evaluated in the mouse hippocampal cell line, ht22. pc treatment protected ht22 cells from glutamate-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, potentially attenuated glutamate-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) and restored the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. metabolic alterations after glutamate-induced oxidative stress and the protective effect of pc were evaluated with hplc and gc-ms profiling methods with multivariate statistical analyses. alterations in ten metabolites were identified, including amino acids, aspartic acid, asparagine, threonine, anserine, cysteine, tryptophan, lysine, as well as fatty acids palmitic acid, stearic acid, and palmitoleic acid. metabolic pathway analysis revealed the involvement of multiple affected pathways, such as cysteine and methionine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate and fatty acid oxidation. these results clearly demonstrate that pc is a promising therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-associated diseases.
overactive_bladder	purposeto determine mid-term durability of the advance sling for post-prostatectomy incontinence (ppi) and impact of prior radiotherapy and storage dysfunction. methodeighty men undergoing advance sling for ppi during 2008-2013 were reviewed. pre-op urodynamics, pre and post-op pad usage, prior radiotherapy, and pgi-i scores were recorded. resultmean follow-up was 36 months (range 14-72). twelve men had radiotherapy pre-op, 10 had detrusor overactivity (do), and 20 reduced compliance. pre-op mean 24-hr pad weight was 264g and mean pads-per-day (ppd) 2.600.29. in the early post-op period (3-6 months), mean ppd was 0.40 (sd 0.16); at mid-term follow-up mean ppd was 1.02 +/- 0.31. radiotherapy and do were independently predictive of poor mid-term outcome. men with do or radiotherapy were using 1.03 +/- 0.42 (p=0.019) and 1.17 +/- 0.41 (p=0.02) more ppd, respectively than men without these factors. at mid-term follow-up, men without radiotherapy or do were using 1.98 +/- 0.28 less ppd compared to pre-operatively (p<0.0001); with radiotherapy or do men were using 0.73 +/- 0.38 (p=0.057) and 0.72 +/- 0.43 (p=0.092) less ppd, respectively. pgi-i score for men without radiotherapy or do was 1.98 +/- 0.40 (much better); with radiotherapy or do pgi-i score was 3.80 +/- 0.49 (no difference). conclusionthe advance sling provides mid-term improvement in men with ppi. however, men with radiotherapy or do have significantly poorer outcomes with mid-term results indicating a return to baseline degree of incontinence. caution should be taken when considering the advance sling in these men. pre-op urodynamics in men with radiotherapy and/or overactive bladder may be important when considering men for advance sling. neurourol. urodynam. 36:1147-1150, 2017.

low_testosterone	objective: to assess from observational data if low testosterone in men is an independent risk factor for high fasting glucose (fg) and for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (t2d). methods: multivariate analysis of data from 991 male us air force veterans who completed six medical examinations over 20 years. results: low testosterone was moderately related to high fg, independent of age and obesity. low testosterone is a very weak predictor of a diagnosis of t2d. conclusions: in men, low testosterone is an independent risk factor for high fg, comparable to aging and obesity. low testosterone is a weak predictor of a diagnosis of t2d.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	various studies have shown that irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is highly associated with other pathologies, including fibromyalgia (fm). the objective of this study was to analyze the differences among risk factors associated with ibs following fm in a nationwide prospective cohort study. we propose that a relationship exists between fm and ibs. this article presents evidence obtained from a cohort study in which we used data from the taiwan national health insurance research database to clarify the relationship between fm and ibs. the follow-up period ran from the start of fm diagnosis to the date of the ibs event, censoring, or december 31, 2011. we analyzed the risk of ibs using cox proportional hazard regression models, including sex, age, and comorbidities. during the follow-up period, from 2000 to 2011, the overall incidence of ibs was higher in fm patients than in non-fm patients (7.47 vs 4.42 per 1000 person-years), with a crude hazard ratio=1.69 (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.59-1.79). after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, fm was associated with a 1.54-fold increased risk for ibs. mutually risk factors may influence the relationship between fm and ibs. we recommend that physiologists conduct annual examinations of fm patients to reduce the incidence of ibs progression.
overactive_bladder	objective: to examine the use of antimuscarinics for treating urinary incontinence (ui) in older adults with varying levels of cognition. design: cross-sectional. setting: national alzheimer 's coordinating center from 2005 through 2015. participants: community-dwelling men and women aged 65 and older (n = 24,106). measurements: clinicians and staff evaluated each participant 's dementia status during annual in-person assessments. participants or their informants reported all medications taken in the 2 weeks before each study visit. results: overall, 5.2% (95% confidence interval (ci) = 4.9-5.5%) of the cohort took a bladder antimuscarinic. participants with impaired cognition were more likely to be taking an antimuscarinic than those with normal cognition. rates of bladder antimuscarinic use were 4.0% (95% ci = 3.6-4.4%) for participants with normal cognition, 5.6% (95% ci = 4.9-6.3%) for those with mild cognitive impairment, and 6.0% (95% ci = 5.5-6.4%) for those with dementia (p <.001). of 624 participants with dementia who took antimuscarinics, 16% (95% ci = 1319%) were simultaneously taking other medicines with anticholinergic properties. conclusion: use of bladder antimuscarinics was more common in older adults with impaired cognition than in those with normal cognition. this use is despite guidelines advising clinicians to avoid prescribing antimuscarinics in individuals with dementia because of their vulnerability to anticholinergic-induced adverse cognitive and functional effects. a substantial proportion of cognitively impaired individuals who took antimuscarinics were simultaneously taking other anticholinergic medications. these findings suggest a need to improve the treatment of ui in individuals with impaired cognition.
sports_injuries	background: generalised joint hypermobility (gjh) is suggested as an aetiological factor for knee injuries in adolescents and adults. it is presumed that gjh causes decreased joint stability, thereby increasing the risk of knee injuries during challenging situations like jumping and landing. the aim was to study the extent and risk of knee injuries in children with gjh and knee hypermobility. methods: in total, 999 children (9-14 years) were tested twice during spring 2012 and 2013 with beighton 's tests (bt) for hypermobility, a 0-9 scoring system. gjh was classified with cut-point >= 5/9 on both test rounds. on basis of weekly cell phone surveys of knee pain, children requiring clinical examination were seen. traumatic and overuse knee injuries were registered by who icd-10 diagnoses. logistic regression and poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to examine the association between gjh and knee injuries, taking into account clustering on school class levels. results: totally, 36 children were classified gjh on both test rounds. overuse knee injuries were the most frequent injury type (86 %), mainly apophysitis for both groups (61 %), other than patella-femoral pain syndrome for the control group (13 %). for traumatic knee injuries, distortions and contusions were most frequent in both groups (51 % resp. 36 %), besides traumatic lesions of knee tendons and muscles for the control group (5 %). no significant association was found between overuse knee injuries and gjh with/without knee hypermobility (or 0.69, p = 0.407 resp. or 0.75, p = 0.576) or traumatic knee injuries and gjh with/without knee hypermobility (or 1.56, p = 0.495 resp. or 2.22, p = 0.231). conclusions: apophysitis, distortions and contusions were the most frequent knee injuries. despite the relatively large study, the number of children with gjh and knee injuries was low, with no significant increased risk for knee injuries for this group. this questions whether gjh is a clinically relevant risk factor for knee injuries in school children aged 9-14 years. a fluctuation in the individual child 's status of gjh between test rounds was observed, suggesting that inter-and intra-tester reproducibility of bt as well as growth may be considered important confounders to future studies of children with gjh.
birth_control	purpose to clarify the mechanism mediating the effect of hyperthyroidism on cardiac function during the second month of life in rats. methods male and female sprague-dawley rats were assigned to a control or to a triiodothyronine (t-3)-treated group. treatment of each group was started on the third day after birth. control rats (eut) received 0.9 nacl [0.1 ml/100 g body weight (bw)] every second day during 60 days and t-3-treated rats (hyper) received subcutaneous (sc) t-3 injections every second day during 60 days. results hyperthyroidism decreased left ventricle volume only in male rats. female euthyroid rats presented higher atrial nitric oxide synthase (nos) activity than male rats and hormonal treatment decreased this enzyme 's activity in both sexes. euthyroid male and female rats had similar atrial nos protein levels, but females had higher caveolin (cav) 3 protein levels. t-3 treatment increased this protein only in males. female rats had lower ventricular nos activity than male rats; hyperthyroidism increased nos activity in both sexes but this effect was associated with lower cav 3 protein levels. hyperthyroidism did not change cav 1 protein levels in both male and female rats. conclusions the results of this study demonstrating clinically relevant sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of the hyperthyroid heart have raised new questions regarding the mechanisms responsible for the observed differences. this study suggests that sex-related intrinsic factors such as nitric oxide may modulate the response to hyperthyroidism that leads to cardiovascular dysfunction.
menopause	although some understanding of post-reproductive life dates back to ancient greece, the term 'menopause' was only introduced in the early 1800s by a french physician. notwithstanding familiarity with the condition at that time, treatments were largely ineffective, often harmful and never evidence-based, and it was not until 100 years later with the identification and description of estrogen and progesterone that effective treatments became available. so efficacious were hormone therapies for menopausal symptoms that their prescription was often recommended for all postmenopausal women regardless of their needs, wishes or health status. for many there was benefit but for some there was harm. it was in this environment that a small group of clinicians determined to form an international menopause society (ims) to conduct research into the appropriate use of hormone therapy in treating menopause symptoms, to hold regular congresses to educate colleagues and discuss research results and thus to improve the health and well-being of women in midlife and beyond. formed in 1978, the ims is now recognized as the global leader in its field, working towards these goals in collaboration with colleagues and other national and regional societies concerned with women 's health. during that time, the ims has been led by 13 presidents and has conducted 15 world congresses on the menopause, all of which are reviewed in this paper.
sports_injuries	recently, golf has become a very popular sport, and most golfers focus on improving their skills and learning process. however, many researchers have studied and found that the hardness and vibration frequency of golf club, and the weight and angle of club head can result in unstable swing distance and accuracy. the golfers modify their swings attitude to adapt to the equipments, or even change the club set, and sometimes these situations cause sports injuries to golfers. therefore, this study discusses how to design an optimal club set for individual golfers by customization and decreases the cases of sports injuries. the taguchi method is applied to analyze and design the optimum club for shaft hardness, club head weight, spine and grip weight. the improved club is tested, and the result shows that the driving distance is increased by more than 10%, so that the maximum efficiency of hitting is increased. this study provides important reference for design of golf clubs.
diabetes	many bacteria regulate the expression of virulence factors via carbon catabolite responsive elements. in gram-positive bacteria, the predominant mediator of carbon catabolite repression is the catabolite control protein a (ccpa). hyperglycemia is a widespread disorder that predisposes individuals to an array of symptoms and an increased risk of infections. in hyperglycemic individuals, the bacterium staphylococcus aureus causes serious, life-threatening infections. the importance of ccpa in regulating carbon catabolite repression in s. aureus suggests it may be important for infections in hyperglycemic individuals. to test this suggestion, hyperglycemic non-obese diabetic (nod; blood glucose level >= 20 mm) mice were challenged with the mouse pathogenic s. aureus strain newman and the isogenic ccpa deletion mutant (mst14), and the effects on infectivity were determined. diabetic nod mice challenged with the ccpa deletion mutant enhanced the symptoms of infection in an acute murine pneumonia model relative to the parental strain. interestingly, when diabetic nod mice were used in footpad or catheter infection models, infectivity of the ccpa mutant decreased relative to the parental strain. these differences greatly diminished when normoglycemic nod mice (blood glucose level <= 10 mm) were used. these data suggest that ccpa is important for infectivity of s. aureus in hyperglycemic individuals.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is increasing in prevalence and has a significant impact on caregivers and the healthcare system. one of the many physiologic process affected by ad is the circadian system, with disruption reflected in abnormalities of the sleep-wake cycle. this interaction is bidirectional, with circadian and sleep disruption influencing disease progression. understanding the bidirectional relationship between ad and circadian disruption may allow for earlier recognition of the potential to develop dementia as well as improved targeted approaches for therapy. therapies including melatonin and bright light therapy may be advantageous in improving sleep and circadian rhythms and preventing the progression of disease. however, unfortunately, these modalities are not curative, and additional research is needed to improve treatment options for these individuals.
low_testosterone	objective: late-onset hypogonadism, or androgen deficiency in the aging male, is a significant cause of morbidity in older men. many men in the low normal or equivocal range for low testosterone level exhibit signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. serum testosterone is an imperfect maker for hypogonadism as symptoms vary greatly within the low to low normal range in addition to variations among testosterone assays. perineal ultrasound can be effectively used to examine the bulbocavernosus muscle (bcm), an androgenized tissue that may be impacted by androgen receptor activity. methods: this study was a retrospective analysis of men who underwent perineal ultrasound for hypogonadism. the ultrasound data were used to calculate the area of the bcm and correlate it with indices of hypogonadismin symptomatic men including free and total testosterone and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa). results: the results demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between total and free testosterone and bcm area in hypogonadal patients. comparison between bcm area and total testosterone showed r-2 = 0.061 and p = 0.0187 and comparison between bcm area and free testosterone showed r-2 = 0.0957 and p = 0.0034. in addition, low bcm was also correlated with dexa results showing osteoporosis and osteopenia (r-2 = 0.2239, p = 0.0027). conclusion: there has been recent controversy over the safety of testosterone replacement therapy. this might be particularly important in men with hypogonadal symptoms but a low normal testosterone level. our study investigated the use of perineal ultrasound to measure bcm as a surrogate marker for poor androgenized men presenting with hypogonadism.

parenting	parent child interaction therapy (pcit) is an evidence-based family intervention for young children with disruptive behavior. parents and children who complete pcit show greater immediate and long-term treatment gains than those who discontinue treatment prematurely. pcit is a time- and effort-intensive treatment, and parents ambivalent about its value for their child or their ability to master the treatment skills may discontinue treatment before engaging sufficiently to experience change. motivational interviewing (mi) is a client-centered therapeutic method of increasing motivation for change through the resolution of ambivalence. this paper describes how clinicians may incorporate nit strategies into pcit to enhance parental motivation when signs of ambivalence arise. vignettes and scripted therapy exchanges illustrate use of the strategies to decrease ambivalence in pcit, improve homework adherence, increase parenting self-efficacy, and reduce attrition, thereby improving outcomes for young children with disruptive behaviors and their families.
cancer	based on target-induced immuno-proximity binding and metal ion-dependent dnazyme recycling signal amplification, we describe the development of a homogeneous and sensitive fluorescent method for the detection of protein cancer biomarkers by using alpha-fetoprotein (afp) as the model target. two dna strands with short complementary regions are conjugated to the afp antibodies to prepare the recognition probes. the hybridization of the two dnas in the absence of the afp target molecules is inhibited due to the low melting temperature (t-m) of the complementary regions. the binding of the antibody-linked dnas to the afp target molecules can increase the local effective concentrations of the two dnas and facilitate their hybridization with significantly increased t-m to form the catalytic cores of the metal ion-dependent dnazymes. the fluorescently quenched hairpin substrate sequences further bind the catalytic cores to form the dnazymes, in which the substrate sequences are cyclically cleaved by the corresponding metal ions to generate remarkably enhanced fluorescent signals for sensitive detection of afp in the dynamic range from 2 to 500 pm with the detection limit of 1.8 pm. the sensing approach also possesses high selectivity toward the target afp over other interfering proteins, and can be employed to detect afp in human serum samples. the significant signal amplification in our approach avoids the involvement of any enzyme or nanomaterial labels and sensitive protein detection can be realized in homogeneous solution, which makes the developed method holds great potential for convenient and sensitive detection of various protein biomarkers for early disease diagnosis.
allergies	this article is based on a qualitative study on diet education among student preschool teachers. the problem under discussion is: what does a student preschool teacher learn in his education about food, meals, and nutrition? the material used in the article comprises interviews with student preschool teachers at one university and one college in norway. preschool teacher education is a three years university college study with bachelor degree. the survey results show that student preschool teachers do not receive even the most element training, when it comes to food and meals, including nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, although education must prepare them for a job outside the kindergarten. practical cooking was almost completely absent in their education, including hygiene. most student preschool teachers did not know what fat they were to use in cooking. food and senses, allergies, and food and culture were not discussed in their education. there was little correlation between the formal curricula in connection with food and meals and the training the preschool teacher students received in their education.
menopause	aim: patients with gynecologic cancer frequently experience bone loss due to cancer treatments, including bilateral oophorectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. this study evaluated treatment-associated changes in bone mineral density (bmd) in women with gynecologic cancer and compared changes among patients with different types of gynecologic cancer. methods: bmd of the lumbar spine and femur was retrospectively analyzed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 118 women who underwent treatment for gynecological cancers and 132 women without gynecologic cancers. the cohort included 55 women with cervical cancer who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, 33 with endometrial cancer (ec) who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and 30 with ovarian cancer who underwent bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. lumbar spine and femoral neck bmd were assessed at baseline and 12 months after treatment. areal bmd, expressed as grams of mineral/cm2 scanned, was compared with that in young healthy women (t-score). results: demographic characteristics and pretreatment bmds, including t-scores, did not differ among cancer types. after adjustment for factors that can affect t-score, cancer type affected change in t-score 12 months after treatment. after adjustment for pretreatment age, parity, bmi and t-score, t-score 12 months after treatment was significantly lower in the ec than in the other groups. conclusions: women treated for gynecological cancer, particularly those with ec who undergo bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy, should be managed in a timely manner to prevent or minimize bone loss.
myelofibrosis	tissue microarray (tma) technique is an established high-throughput method to analyze multiple tissue specimens in parallel. however, in order to obtain reliable results from immunohistochemical analyses of tma blocks, cell composition of tma spots must correspond to whole tissue sections (wts) particularly in tissues with a heterogeneous cell composition as it is the case in myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn). the aim of this study was to validate tma of bone marrow biopsies from mpn patients. tmas of mpn bone marrow biopsies (et: n = 26, pv: n = 26, and pmf: n = 29) were compiled in triplicates and mpn-specific histological parameters were assessed. results of tma spots were compared with wts' results using the intra-class correlation coefficient (icc). immunohistochemical nfe2 and calreticulin stainings of the tma with quantitative evaluation were performed. tma construction was technically successful with a loss of 10 % of all spots. icc calculation revealed high to moderate correlations of tma with wts, especially the parameters that are typically affected in mpn tissue, e.g. cellularity of hematopoiesis (icc 0.62-0.89), number of megakaryocytes (icc 0.50-0.71), micro-vessel density (icc 0.56-0.91), or grade of myelofibrosis (icc 0.56-0.89). results of nfe2 and calreticulin immunohistochemistry of mpn tmas are consistent with previously published data. overall, our results show moderate to good correlation between histological data of wts and tma spots illustrating that the tma technique is applicable to bone marrow biopsies of mpn patients. however, tma construction in triplicates is necessary to reach sufficient correlation. mpn tmas can be applied for serial immunohistochemical surveys of archived tissues to assess the mutation status or to further sub-classify mpn cases.
parenting	the present study assessed negative emotions associated with the traumas of infertility and child rearing (child 's disability or death) and the correlates of duration of trauma. the widely used chinese mental health scale was used to assess negative emotions in 294 individuals who experienced the aforementioned traumas and 124 who did not (control group). results showed that individuals with infertility exhibited greater anxiety, depression, and solitude than the controlgroup; bereaved parents and had greater solitude and fear than control group; and parents of children with disabilities had greater solitude than the control group. parents who experienced the death of a child had more fear and physiological maladjustment than parents of a child with disabilities. in addition, individuals without parenting experience had higher scores on solitude, fear, and physiological disease than those with parenting experience. after controlling for demographic variables, the duration of trauma significantly negatively predicted depression in the infertile group and for bereaved parents. the results suggest that in order to prevent psychological and physiological health problems among infertile couples, parents of a disabled child, and parents who experience the death of child, family and community -based strategies should be developed and implemented.

sprains_and_strains	objective: little information exists that examines the epidemiology of injuries among adults who engage in sports and recreational activities. the purpose of this study is to examine basketball-related injuries among adults presenting to ambulatory settings in the united states. design: retrospective review of medical records. setting: emergency departments, outpatient departments, and physicians' offices in the united states. patients: nationally representative sample-of adults presenting to ambulatory care settings in the united states for treatment of injuries incurred while playing basketball. main outcome measures: body site injured, type of injury, ambulatory treatment site, and utilization of diagnostic testing. results: an annual average of 507,000 adults were treated in an ambulatory care setting for injuries related to playing basketball. the majority of these patients sought treatment in physicians' offices. females had a much lower rate of visits (0.8/1000) for basketball-related injuries than males (5.7/1000); african american males had a rate 2.7 times higher than white males. the most common injuries were sprains and strains to the lower leg and/or ankle region and fractures of the hand, wrist, or fingers. specific analyses of patients presenting to the emergency department diagnosed with sprain/strain injuries to the lower leg/ankle region revealed that 93% of these patients received an x-ray procedure. conclusions: basketball injuries constitute a significant portion of ambulatory medical care use in the united states each year, particularly among young adult males and african american males. better surveillance of adult participation in sports and recreational activities is needed to better identify risk and protective factors for injuries.
allergies	despite their nutritional value, population-level nut consumption remains low. studies suggest that individuals would eat more nuts on their doctor 's advice, making health professionals potentially important for promoting nut consumption. this cross-sectional study aimed to examine the perceptions and knowledge of nuts and the predictors of nut promotion among health professionals in new zealand. dietitians, general practitioners (gps), and practice nurses were identified from the electoral roll and invited to complete a questionnaire (n = 318, 292, and 149 respondents respectively). over one-fifth of gps and practice nurses believed that eating nuts could increase blood cholesterol concentrations and cause weight gain. the most common perceptions overall were that nuts are healthy; high in protein, fat, and calories; and are satiating. nut consumption was recommended for reasons relating to these perceptions and because of nuts' selenium content. conversely, reasons for suggesting the consumption of fewer nuts included that they were high in calories and fat, would cause weight gain, and concerns regarding allergies and cost. all groups of health professionals were more likely to promote nut consumption if they perceived nuts to reduce the risk of diabetes (all p <= 0.034). education could improve health professionals' knowledge regarding the effects of nut consumption on blood cholesterol and body weight, alongside other health benefits, which should improve the advice given to patients and may thereby increase nut consumption.
alzheimer's_disease	objective: amyloid beta (a) positron emission tomography (pet) imaging helps estimate a neuritic plaque density in patients with cognitive impairment who are under evaluation for alzheimer 's disease (ad). this study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the a-pet scan as an adjunct to standard diagnostic assessment for diagnosis of ad in france, using florbetapir as an example. methods: a state-transition probability analysis was developed adopting the french health technology assessment (hta) perspective per guidance. parameters included test characteristics, rate of cognitive decline, treatment effect, costs, and quality of life. additional scenarios assessed the validity of the analytical framework, including: (1) earlier evaluation/treatment; (2) cerebrospinal fluid (csf) as a comparator; and (3) use of other diagnostic procedures. outputs included differences in quality-adjusted life years (qalys), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icers). all benefits and costs were discounted for time preferences. sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings and key influencers of outcomes. results: a-pet used as an adjunct to standard diagnostic assessment increased qalys by 0.021 years and 10 year costs by euro470 per patient. the icer was euro21,888 per qaly gained compared to standard diagnostic assessment alone. when compared with csf, a-pet costs euro24,084 per qaly gained. in other scenarios, a-pet was consistently cost-effective relative to the commonly used affordability threshold (euro40,000 per qaly). over 95% of simulations in the sensitivity analysis were cost-effective. conclusion: a-pet is projected to affordably increase qalys from the french hta perspective per guidance over a range of clinical scenarios, comparators, and input parameters.
myelofibrosis	ruxolitinib is a novel therapeutic agent which is being used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. in the literature, there are reports of opportunistic infections along with tuberculosis during ruxolitinib treatment. herein, we aimed to report a post-polycythemic myelofibrosis case that developed mycobacterial infection after ruxolitinib treatment. 64 years old man was diagnosed as polycythemia vera 27 years ago. he was diagnosed as post-polycythemic myelofibrosis in 2002. he was given hydroxycarbamide and interferon treatments, however ruxolitinib treatment was started in july 2015 because of spleen enlargement and constitutional symptoms. ruxolitinib was started with a dose of 2x5 mg and the dose gradually increased to 2x20 mg by september 2015. his constitutional symptoms decreased and cachexia improved by january 2016. however he started to have fever attacks. investigations revealed no origin for fever. the quantiferon test was resulted positive in may 2016. tuberculosis pcr test was negative. however, ada level was found to be increased in cerebrospinal fluid. general condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly and he was lost in june 2016. afterwards ""mycobacterium tuberculosis complex"" was detected in our patient 's culture sample. ruxolitinib has serious effects on immune system. to conclude, patients who are given ruxolitinib should be closely followed-up especially in the first months of treatment and benefits and prophylactic use of antivirals and antibiotics should be investigated in future studies.
myelofibrosis	thrombocytopenia (t), anasarca (a), myelofibrosis (f), renal dysfunction (r), and organomegaly (o) (tafro) syndrome is a variant of multicentric castleman 's disease. we describe here a 57-year-old man who presented with persistent fever, pleural effusion, and ascites. he was negative for human immunodeficiency virus and human herpes virus-8. a computed tomography scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass and small inguinal lymphadenopathy. although a biopsy of the anterior mediastinum showed fatty tissue infiltrated with cd20(+) and cd45ro(+) lymphocytes, a biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node revealed a hyaline vascular type of castleman 's disease. he subsequently developed severe thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction. in addition, his bone marrow biopsy showed myelofibrosis. tafro syndrome was diagnosed based on the lymph node pathology and the characteristic manifestations of the syndrome. tocilizumab and glucocorticoid therapy achieved complete remission and regression of the mediastinal mass. to our knowledge, this is the first report of tafro syndrome accompanied by an anterior mediastinal mass, which responded very well to therapy.
birth_control	we hypothesised that belief in conspiracy theories would be predicted by the general tendency to attribute agency and intentionality where it is unlikely to exist. we further hypothesised that this tendency would explain the relationship between education level and belief in conspiracy theories, where lower levels of education have been found to be associated with higher conspiracy belief. in study 1 (n = 202) participants were more likely to agree with a range of conspiracy theories if they also tended to attribute intentionality and agency to inanimate objects. as predicted, this relationship accounted for the link between education level and belief in conspiracy theories. we replicated this finding in study 2 (n = 330), whilst taking into account beliefs in paranormal phenomena. these results suggest that education may undermine the reasoning processes and assumptions that are reflected in conspiracy belief.
emergency_contraception	this review summarises the development of emergency contraception (ec) methods, and provides an overview on the currently available options of ec which are effective and safe back-up methods in case of non-use or failure of the regular contraception. the copper intrauterine contraceptive device is currently the most effective method. in most countries, a single dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg is the first-line hormonal ec given within 72 h of unprotected intercourse. the oral anti-progestogens such as mifepristone and ulipristal acetate are promising alternatives with better efficacies and a wider treatment window of up to 120 h post coitus, probably resulting from more diverse ancillary mechanisms of actions. education on ec should be part of any contraceptive counselling. improving access to ec by providing it over the counter or in advance would not promote its abuse nor encourage risky sexual behaviours, but may further facilitate the timely use so as to achieve the best efficacy.

headache	prior studies have demonstrated how price transparency lowers the test-ordering rates of trainees in hospitals, and physician-targeted price transparency efforts have been viewed as a promising cost-controlling strategy. to examine the effect of displaying paid-price information on test-ordering rates for common imaging studies and procedures within an accountable care organization (aco). block randomized controlled trial for 1 year. a total of 1205 fully licensed clinicians (728 primary care, 477 specialists). starting january 2014, clinicians in the control arm received no price display; those in the intervention arms received single or paired internal/external median prices in the test-ordering screen of their electronic health record. internal prices were the amounts paid by insurers for the aco 's services; external paid prices were the amounts paid by insurers for the same services when delivered by unaffiliated providers. ordering rates (orders per 100 face-to-face encounters with adult patients): overall, designated to be completed internally within the aco, considered ""inappropriate"" (e.g., mri for simple headache), and thought to be ""appropriate"" (e.g., screening colonoscopy). we found no significant difference in overall ordering rates across the control, single median price, or paired internal/external median prices study arms. for every 100 encounters, clinicians in the control arm ordered 15.0 (sd 31.1) tests, those in the single median price arm ordered 15.0 (sd 16.2) tests, and those in the paired prices arms ordered 15.7 (sd 20.5) tests (one-way anova p-value 0.88). there was no difference in ordering rates for tests designated to be completed internally or considered to be inappropriate or appropriate. displaying paid-price information did not alter how frequently primary care and specialist clinicians ordered imaging studies and procedures within an aco. those with a particular interest in removing waste from the health care system may want to consider a variety of contextual factors that can affect physician-targeted price transparency.
overactive_bladder	the impact of the incontilase(tm) procedure on lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) remains unclear. our aim was to evaluate the effects of the incontilase(tm) procedure for urodynamic stress incontinence (usi). all consecutive women with usi prospectively underwent the incontilase(tm) procedure. urodynamic studies, pad testing, luts, and sexual function questionnaires were assessed before and after treatment. thirty-five women underwent the incontilase(tm) procedure. among the 28 women with baseline pad weights >1 g, 11 (39.3 %) were objectively cured and 11 (39.3 %) improved. among the 18 women with mild usi (i.e., baseline pad weight 1-10 g), nine (50 %) were cured and five (27.8 %) improved. among ten women with baseline pad weight >10 g, two (20 %) were cured and six (60 %) improved. among the 32 women with complete questionnaire data at 6 months, seven (21.9 %) were subjectively cured, and four (12.5 %) improved. regarding luts, the majority of domains on the king 's health questionnaire and female sexual desire and function exhibited significant improvements. forty percent (12/30) of the partners of these patients felt their sexual function had improved at 6 months. nonetheless, urodynamic values did not differ across the timeline. the effect of the incontilase(tm) procedure for mild usi was moderate at 6-month follow-up but was not effective for pad weight >10 g. moreover, it improved luts, quality of life, qol, and sexual function of both partners. further studies should be performed to assess long-term sustained efficacy.
myelofibrosis	myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) are rare diseases that include classic entities; polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis. in this short report, minor allele frequencies of common mpn mutations are compared between the irish blood donor population and other populations of european descent using data from the haplotype map project. the affymetrix array 6.0 platform was utilised identifying nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and six proxy snps. the variability of allele frequencies for mpn mutations could account for the different incidence rates seen between populations of european ancestry, giving a better understanding of the genetic predisposition to mpns. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
overactive_bladder	the proximal urethra and urinary bladder trigone play important roles in continence. we have previously shown that pgd(2) is released from guinea pig bladder urothelium/suburothelium and can inhibit detrusor contractile responses. we presently wished to investigate pgd(2) actions in guinea pig out-flow region and the distribution of dp1/dp2 receptors. the effects of pgd(2) on urothelium-intact trigone and proximal urethra contractility were studied in organ bath experiments. expression of dp1/dp2 receptor proteins was analysed by western blot. immunohistochemistry was used to identify distribution of dp1/dp2 receptors. pgd(2) in a dose-dependent manner inhibited trigone contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (efs) and inhibited spontaneous contractions of the proximal urethra. pgd(2) was equally (trigone) or slightly less potent (urethra) compared with pge(2). expression of dp1 and dp2 receptors was found in male guinea pig bladder trigone, neck and proximal urethra. in the trigone and proximal urethra, dp1 receptors were found on the membrane of smooth muscle cells and weak immunoreactivty was observed in the urothelium. dp2 receptors were distributed more widespread, weakly and evenly in the urothelium and smooth muscles. inhibitory effects by pgd(2) on motor activity of guinea pig trigone and proximal urethra are consistent with finding dp1 and dp2 receptors located in the urothelium and smooth muscle cells of the trigone and proximal urethra, and pgd(2) may therefore be a modulator of the bladder out-flow region, possibly having a function in regulation of micturition and a role in overactive bladder syndrome.
alzheimer's_disease	purpose the activity of the glymphatic system is impaired in animal models of alzheimer 's disease (ad). we evaluated the activity of the human glymphatic system in cases of ad with a diffusion-based technique called diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (dti-alps). materials and methods diffusion tensor images were acquired to calculate diffusivities in the x, y, and z axes of the plane of the lateral ventricle body in 31 patients. we evaluated the diffusivity along the perivascular spaces as well as projection fibers and association fibers separately, to acquire an index for diffusivity along the perivascular space (alps-index) and correlated them with the mini mental state examinations (mmse) score. results we found a significant negative correlation between diffusivity along the projection fibers and association fibers. we also observed a significant positive correlation between diffusivity along perivascular spaces shown as alps-index and the mmse score, indicating lower water diffusivity along the perivascular space in relation to ad severity. conclusion activity of the glymphatic system may be evaluated with diffusion images. lower diffusivity along the perivascular space on dti-apls seems to reflect impairment of the glymphatic system. this method may be useful for evaluating the activity of the glymphatic system.
emergency_contraception	background: thyroid hormones are essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and a deficiency in maternal thyroid hormones has been associated with early pregnancy losses. the aim of this study was a systematic investigation of the influence of mifepristone (ru 486) on the expression of the thyroid hormone receptor (thr) isoforms thr alpha 1, thr alpha 2, thr beta 1 and thr beta 2 on protein and mrna-level. methods: samples of placental tissue were obtained from patients with mifepristone induced termination of pregnancy (n = 13) or mechanical induced termination of normal pregnancy (n = 20), each from the 4th to 13th week of pregnancy. expression of thr alpha 1, thr alpha 2, thr beta 1 and thr beta 2 was analysed on protein level by immunohistochemistry and on mrna level by real time rt-pcr (tagman). the influence of progesterone on thr gene expression was analysed in the trophoblast tumour cell line bewo by real time rt-pcr (tagman). results: nuclear expression of thr alpha 1, thr alpha 2 and thr beta 1 is downregulated on protein level in mifepristone (ru 486) treated villous trophoblast tissue. in decidual tissue, we found a significant downregulation only for thr alpha 1 in mifepristone treated tissue. on mrna level, we also found a significantly reduced expression of thra but no significant downregulation for thrb in placental tissue. the gene thra encodes the isoform thr alpha and the gene thrb encodes the isoform thrp. the majority of cells expressing the thyroid hormone receptors in the decidua are decidual stromal cells. in addition, in vitro experiments with trophoblast tumour cells showed that progesterone significantly induced thra but not thrb expression. conclusions: termination of pregnancy with mifepristone (ru 486) leads to a downregulation of thr alpha 1, thr alpha 2 and thr beta 1 in villous trophoblasts and in addition to a decreased expression of thra in placental tissue. decreased expression of thr alpha 1 induced by ru486 could also be found in the decidua. therefore inhibition of the progesterone receptor may be responsible for this downregulation. this assumption is supported by the finding, that stimulation of the progesterone receptor by progesterone itself upregulated thra in trophoblast cells in vitro.

senior_health	background: employers can purchase high quality depression products that provide the type, intensity and duration of depression care management shown to improve work outcomes sufficiently for many employers to achieve a return on investment. the purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test an intervention to encourage employers to purchase a high quality depression product for their workforce. methods: twenty nine organizations recruited senior health benefit professional members representing public or private employers who had not yet purchased a depression product for all 100+ workers in their company. the research team used randomization blocked by company size to assign eligible employers to: (1) a presentation encouraging employers to purchase a high quality depression product accompanied by a scientifically-derived return on investment estimate, or (2) a presentation encouraging employers to work with their most subscribed health plan to improve depression treatment quality indicators. two hundred ninety three employers (82.3% of 356) completed baseline data immediately before learning that 140 employers had been randomized to the evidence-based (eb) depression product presentation and 153 had been randomized to the usual care (uc) depression treatment quality indicator presentation. analysis of 250 (85.3% of 293) employers who completed web-based interviews at 12 and/or 24 months was conducted to determine presentation impact on depression product appraisal and purchasing behavior. results: the intervention had no impact on depression product appraisal in 232 subjects (f = 2.36, p = .07) or depression product purchasing (chisquare = 1.82, p = .44) in 250 subjects. depression product appraisal increased in companies with greater health benefit generosity whose benefit professionals were male. depression product purchasing behavior increased in small companies compared to large companies, companies who knew a vendor that sold depression products at baseline, companies with greater health benefit risk taking, and companies with less politicalization of health care benefit decision making. conclusions: policy makers need to build innovative bridges to the employer community to convince them to purchase evidence-based benefits, even when benefits offer potential financial savings.
headache	intracranial abscess has serious mortality. therefore, early diagnosis and treatment is important. intracranial abscess is rarely seen as a complication of sinusitis. specially in children it has been reported rarely. fever and headache can indicate complications in children.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	high rates of persistent symptoms are found following cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones. the aim of this population based cohort study was to determine which symptoms were associated with the development of clinical gallstone events in a population unaware of their gallstones. three random population samples from copenhagen (n = 6037) were examined with ultrasound during 1982-1994. participants were not informed about gallstone status. abdominal symptoms were assessed at baseline through a questionnaire. follow-up for clinical events was performed through central registers until 2011. multivariable cox regression analyses were performed. participants unaware of their gallstones (n = 595) were followed for median 17.5 years. a total of 16.6% participants developed clinical events. both uncomplicated and complicated events were associated with high pain intensity at baseline. complicated events were also associated with pain at night. uncomplicated events were associated with pain localized in the epigastrium, of longer duration, and in need of pain medication. no associations were identified for dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome. in a population of unaware gallstone carriers, it was possible to identify abdominal symptoms associated with later clinical detection of the gallstones. these finding may contribute to a better selection of patients for surgery.
alzheimer's_disease	the primary features of alzheimer 's disease (ad) are extracellular amyloid plaques consisting mainly of deposits of amyloid beta (a beta) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (nfts). sets of evidence suggest that interleukin-5 (il-5) is involved in the pathogenesis of ad. herein, we investigated the protective role of il-5 in pc12 cells, to provide new insights into understanding this disease. western blot was employed to assess the protein levels of bax and phospho-tau as well as phospho-jak2; mtt assay was performed to decipher cell viability. treatment of il-5 decreased a beta(25-35)-induced tau phosphorylation and apoptosis, effects blunted by jak2 inhibition. il-5 prevents a beta(25-35)-evoked tau protein hyperphosphorylation and apoptosis through jak2 signaling.
menopause	background: sexual dysfunction is common among us women of reproductive age, many of whom use contraception. various contraceptive methods have been associated with changes in sexual function. methods: in this narrative review, we selected key articles based on our collective clinical experience. we summarized findings and best practice recommendations for addressing a woman 's contraception and its potential relationship to sexual function. results: although some hormonal contraception is associated with sexual dysfunction, studies show mixed results based on route of administration and progestin component. interestingly, nonuse of contraception also appears to be associated with sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction. low-dose vaginal estrogen, lubricants, and moisturizers may be used for treating vaginal dryness in the setting of hypoestrogenic states in reproductive-age women. conclusion: a review of current contraception is appropriate for women presenting with sexual health concerns. sexual dysfunction chronologically associated with a contraceptive may be addressed by trial of an alternative method. a multidisciplinary approach to treatment is recommended, including sex therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, and consultation with a women 's health specialist as needed.
headache	introduction: meta-analyses are useful to increase knowledge and strengthen evidence about antidepressant treatment supplementary to individual studies. methods: a pooled analysis of four multicenter, open-label, prospective, non-interventional studies (2009-2013) was performed to provide further evidence about the antidepressant effectiveness and tolerability of agomelatine (25-50 mg/day) in a large number of non-selected german outpatients with major depressive disorder. the main analysis was performed after 12 weeks (n = 9601) and in subpopulations after 24 and 52 weeks by descriptive statistical methods. results: overall, 60.1% of patients were pre-treated with antidepressants. concomitant psychiatric diseases (71.9%), co-medication with antidepressants (18.9%) and/or psychotropic medication (31.9%) were observed. depressive symptoms improved according to the clinical global impression (cgi) in 81% after 12 weeks, a response was observed in 78.7% (cgi-i3 times upper normal value), with 19 patients (0.2%) showing preexisting elevations at the study start. one patient (0.03%) developed hepatitis with reversible symptoms after treatment discontinuation. adr predominantly occurred within the first weeks of treatment. mean weight and body mass index (bmi) remained unchanged over 24 weeks. conclusion: in this pooled data analysis, 9601 depressed patients of clinical practice were evaluated over 12 weeks and subpopulations were also analyzed over 24 and 52 weeks. agomelatine effectively reduced depressive symptoms (cgi-response and remission) with good general tolerability.
parkinson's_disease	various neurodegenerative disorders share some clinical features that sometimes renders differential diagnosis challenging. genetic-based classification also has limitations as mutations in the same gene are sometimes associated with different clinically based diagnoses. in this light, we screened the c19orf12 neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (nbia) causing gene and the c9orf72 intronic expansion mutation that is cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 186 iranian parkinson 's disease (pd) patients. c19orf12 has previously been screened in pd patients in only one study, and to the best of our knowledge neither gene has ever been screened in a pd cohort from a middle east population. the study was justified because mutations in c19orf12 had previously been shown to be common in iranian neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation patients and all the patients with mutations in this gene had exhibited parkinsonism features. the c9orf72 intronic expansion mutation was screened because the mother of an iranian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient with the expansion who had been diagnosed with pd also harbored the expansion. the screenings did not identify disease causing variations in either of the genes among the pd patients screened.

headache	background.-minorities have historically been underrepresented in clinical research trials despite having comparatively poor health indicators. recognizing the dual inequalities of increased disease burden and decreased research participation, the national institute of health (nih) revitalization act of 1993 mandated the inclusion and reporting of women and minorities in nih-funded research. while progress has been made in the subsequent decades, this underrepresentation of minorities in research trials persists and has been documented in multiple disciplines. however, the extent of adequate representation and reporting of minority inclusion in clinical trials for migraine remains unknown. objectives.-in this systematic review and study, we review the literature examining the representation of women and minorities in migraine clinical research trials methods.-first we searched pubmed for pertinent articles examining the inclusion of women and minorities in migraine clinical research trials. second, we identified controlled-trials for migraine published since 2011 in major neurology, headache, and general medicine journals using the terms ""migraine randomized controlled trial."" we then reviewed the results manually and excluded pilot studies and those with fewer than 50 participants. we next determined (a) how frequently representation of minorities and women were reported in these major trials; (b) what factors correlated with reporting; and (c) whether women and minority inclusion comprised their ratios in the general population. results.-we identified 128 relevant clinical trials, of which 36 met our inclusion criteria. all 36 trials (100%) reported gender frequency, and 25 of 36 (69.4%) reported ethnicity or race. among all studies, women and whites represented 84.2 and 82.9% of participants (mean), respectively. studies conducted in the united states and funded by a private company were more likely to report race than studies conducted exclusively outside of the u.s. or with a public sponsor. no studies stratified efficacy or safety by ethnicity or gender. men and non-whites in the u.s. were statistically underrepresented. conclusions.-most recent headache studies comply with the nih mandate to include women and minorities in research trials, particularly u.s.-based and industry-funded studies. whites are overrepresented compared to both the general population and the population of migraineurs. future studies should strive to increase minority participation and investigate race-based differences in migraine expression, treatment response, and medication toxicity.
polycythemia_vera	common germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) at jak2 locus have been associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn). and, the germline sequence variant rs2736100 c in tert is related to risk of mpn, suggesting a complex association between snps and the pathogenesis of mpn. our previous study (unpublished data) showed that there was a high frequency distribution in rs3733609 c/t genotype at ten-eleven translocation 2 (tet2) locus in one chinese familial primary myelofibrosis. in the present study, we evaluate the role and clinical significance of rs3733609 c/t genotype in jak2v617f-positive sporadic mpn (n = 181). tet2 rs3733609 c/t genotype had a higher incidence (13.81%; 25/181) in jak2v617f-positive sporadic mpn patients than that in normal controls (n = 236) (6.35%; 15/236), which was predisposing to mpn (odds ratio(or) = 2.361; p = 0.01). mpn patients with rs3733609 c/t genotype had increased leukocyte and platelets counts, elevated hemoglobin concentration in comparison with t/t genotype. thrombotic events were more common in mpn patients with rs3733609 c/t than those with t/t genotype (p < 0.01). we confirmed that rs3733609 c/t genotype downregulated tet2 mrna transcription, and the mechanism may be involved in a disruption of the interaction between ccaat/enhancer binding protein alpha (c/ebpa) and tet2 rs3733609 c/t locus. tet2 rs3733609 c/t genotype stimulated the erythroid hematopoiesis in mpn patients. altogether, we found a novel hereditary susceptible factor-tet2 rs3733609 c/t variant for the development of mpn, suggesting the variant may be partially responsible for the pathogenesis and accumulation of mpn.
sprains_and_strains	the 1996, 1997, and 1998 connecticut nutmeg state games is a 26-sport athletic event that takes place over 6 to 10 days in july or august in new haven, middlesex, and hartford counties. during the course of 3 years, an average of 8330 athletes have competed each year. each year the sports-medical coverage at the nutmeg state games was coordinated by chiropractors. this article reviews the medical contacts involved in four games. art average of 86.33 total medical contacts produced an injury incidence rate of 1.04%. most of the injuries were minor: sprains and strains (31.50%), contusions (40.33%), and abrasions (11.33%). most injuries occurred in the lower extremities (51.55%). most iri juries were treated adequately with ice, compression bandages, adhesive bandages, and basic first-aid supplies. incidence of injury was higher in contact sports. soccer (38.20%), basketball (14.45%), and lacrosse (10.39%) reported the most injuries per participant. coverage of these events requires a proficiency in basic first aid cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and treatment of soft tissue injuries, with an emphasis on lower extremity injuries.
diabetes	backgroundcarbohydrate is accepted as the principal nutrient affecting blood glucose in diabetes; however, current guidelines are unable to specify the optimal quantity of carbohydrate for glycaemic control. no studies exist that describe current practice amongst healthcare professionals giving carbohydrate advice in type 2 diabetes. the present study aims to improve understanding of the degree of variation in the current practice of uk registered dietitians (rds) by describing how rds advise patients. methodsuk rds were contacted through national networks and asked to complete an online survey, which was analysed using stata, version 12 (statacorp, college station, tx, usa). three consultations between dietitians and patients with type 2 diabetes were observed, followed by semi-structured interviews with the dietitians. resultsin total, 320 complete survey responses were received. dietitians' advice varied according to expertise, training and confidence, and the complexity of the patient 's blood glucose treatment. some 48% (n = 154) of respondents advised patients to restrict carbohydrate intake either occasionally or frequently, with 35.6% (n = 114) considering 30-39% of total energy from carbohydrate to be a realistic expectation. the overall theme from the interviews was conflicting priorities', with three sub-themes: (i) how treatment decisions are made; (ii) the difference between empowerment and advice; and (iii) contradictory advice. a disparity existed between what was observed and interview data on how dietitians rationalise the type of carbohydrate advice provided. conclusionsdietitians' advice varies for a number of reasons. consensus exists in some areas (e.g. carbohydrate awareness advice); however, clear definitions of such terms are lacking. clarification of interventions may improve the consistency of approach and improve patient outcomes.
hypothyroidism	thyroid function is known to influence glucose metabolism, and thyroid-stimulating hormone is the most useful parameter in screening for thyroid dysfunction. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of type 2 diabetes according to baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone level and thyroid-stimulating hormone change in euthyroid subjects. we identified and enrolled 17,061 euthyroid subjects without diabetes among participants who had undergone consecutive thyroid function tests between 2006 and 2012 as a part of yearly health check-up program. thyroid-stimulating hormone changes were determined by subtracting baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone level from thyroid-stimulating hormone level at 1 year before diagnosis of diabetes or at the end of follow-up in subjects who did not develope diabetes. during 84,595 person-years of follow-up, there were 956 new cases of type 2 diabetes. cox proportional hazards models showed the risk of incident type 2 diabetes was significantly increased with each 1 mu iu/ml increment in tsh after adjustment for multiple confounding factors (hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.20, p < 0.001). compared with individuals in the lowest tertile (-4.08 to 0.34 mu iu/ml), those in the highest thyroid-stimulating hormone change tertile (0.41-10.84 mu iu/ml) were at greater risk for incident type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.48, p for trend = 0.011). however, baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone level and tertile were not associated with the risk for diabetes. prominent increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration can be an additional risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes in euthyroid subjects.
parenting	there is a growing recognition that parental socialization influences interact with young children 's emerging capacity for physiological regulation and shape children 's developmental trajectories. nevertheless, the transactional processes linking parental socialization and physiological regulatory processes remain not well understood, particularly for fear-prone toddlers. to address this gap in the literature, the present study investigated the biopsychosocial processes that underlie toddlers' fear regulation by examining the relations among toddler parasympathetic regulation, maternal appraisal, and parenting behaviors. participants included 124 mothers and their toddlers (m-age = 24.43 months), who participated in a longitudinal study of temperament and socio-emotional development. toddlers' parasympathetic reactivity was found to moderate the links between maternal anticipatory appraisal of child fearfulness and ( a) maternal provision of physical comfort and (b) preschool-age child inhibition. additionally, maternal comforting behaviors during the low-threat task predicted preschool-age separation distress, specifically for toddlers demonstrating a low baseline rsa.
parkinson's_disease	higher plasma cholesterol levels are associated with lower parkinson 's disease (pd) risk. apolipoprotein a-1 (apoa-1) is a surface marker of brain hdl-like particles associated with the time of pd onset. clinical correlates of serum apolipoprotein a1 levels with structural brain connectivity in pd-related disorders remains unclear. here, we applied a novel diffusion-weighted imaging approach [diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (mri) connectometry] to explore the association between apoa-1 and structural brain connectivity in pd. participants involved in this research were recruited from parkinson 's progression markers initiative (ppmi). diffusion mri connectometry was conducted using a multiple regression against apoa-1 for 36 patients with dti measurements available in the baseline visit. fiber results of the connectometry were then reconstructed for each patient, and diffusion parameters were extracted and regressed against apoa-1 levels. connectometry results revealed the subgenual cingulum to be associated with apoa-1, with different fdr yields. this result was further supported by significant negative correlation of quantitative anisotropic (qa) of left subgenual cingulum (pearson 's coefficient = -0.398, p = 0.020) and generalized fractional anisotropic (gfa) of right subgenual cingulum (pearson 's coefficient -0.457, p = 0.007) with plasma apoa-1 levels, in a multiple regression model with age and sex. the subgenual cingulum encompasses fibers from the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior thalamus. these structures are involved in pd-associated psychosis and executive cognitive decline. we demonstrated for the first time that apoa-1, as a blood marker, can predict microstructural changes in white matter regions in pd patients with undisturbed cognition and mild motor disability.
skin_care	background: hand dermatitis can be a serious health problem in healthcare workers. while a range of skin care strategies and policy directives have been developed in recent years to minimise the risk, their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness remain unclear. evidence now suggests that psychological theory can facilitate behaviour change with respect to improved hand care practices. therefore, we will test the hypothesis that a behavioural change intervention to improve hand care, based on the theory of planned behaviour and implementation intentions, coupled with provision of hand moisturisers, can produce a clinically useful reduction in the occurrence of hand dermatitis, when compared to standard care, among nurses working in the uk national health service (nhs) who are particularly at risk. secondary aims will be to assess impacts on participants' beliefs and behaviour regarding hand care. in addition, we will assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in comparison with normal care. methods/design: we will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial at 35 nhs hospital trusts/health boards/universities, focussing on student nurses with a previous history of atopic disease or hand eczema and on nurses in intensive care units. nurses at 'intervention-light' sites will be managed according to what would currently be regarded as best practice, with provision of an advice leaflet about optimal hand care to prevent hand dermatitis and encouragement to contact their occupational health (oh) department early if hand dermatitis occurs. nurses at 'intervention-plus' sites will additionally receive a behavioural change programme (bcp) with on-going active reinforcement of its messages, and enhanced provision of moisturising cream. the impact of the interventions will be compared using information collected by questionnaires and through standardised photographs of the hands and wrists, collected at baseline and after 12 months follow-up. in addition, we will assemble relevant economic data for an analysis of costs and benefits, and collect information from various sources to evaluate processes. statistical analysis will be by multi-level regression modelling to allow for clustering by site, and will compare the prevalence of outcome measures at follow-up after adjustment for values at baseline. the principal outcome measure will be the prevalence of visible hand dermatitis as assessed by the study dermatologists. in addition, several secondary outcome measures will be assessed. discussion: this trial will assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of an intervention to prevent hand dermatitis in nurses in the united kigdom.
parkinson's_disease	pedunculopontine nucleus (ppn) has been considered a critically important region in the regulation of some of the physiological functions that fail during the progression of parkinson 's disease (pd). in this paper, the effects of unilateral neurotoxic lesion of the ppn [through the injection of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) solution (con - centration: 0.1 m; volume: 0.5 mu l.)] in motor execution and gait disorders and the changes in cellular and molecular indicators in rat nigral tissue were evaluated. the motor execution was assessed using the beam test (bt) and the gait disorders by footprint test. glutathione (gsh) concentrations, acetyl cholinesterase enzymatic activity (ache ea), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) mrna expression in nigral tissue were analyzed. nmda-lesioned rats showed fine motor dysfunction with a significant increase in the slow (p <= 0.01) and fast movement (p <= 0.01) time and in path deviation (p <= 0.01) on the smaller diameter beams. moreover, nmda-lesioned rats exhibited an imprecise path with moments of advances and setbacks, alternating with left and right deviations, suspensions, and inverted positions. footprint test revealed slight gait disorders, which were manifested by a reduction in the left and right stride lengths, the intra-step distance, and the support area (p <= 0.01). biochemical studies showed that 48 h after the ppn neurotoxic injury, the gsh concentrations and bdnf expression were significantly increased (p <= 0.01). these variables returned to normal values 7 days after the ppn lesion; the ache ea showed a significant increase at this time. these functional changes in nigral tissue could be a plastic responses associated with early pd.

headache	background: the aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and efficacy of a novel myrliq (r), ginkgo biloba, q10, and vitamin b2 based nutraceutical product (np) in migraine headache without aura (mhwa) and tension-type headache (tth). methods: an open-label, prospective trial was conducted. adult subjects of both genders were assigned to two groups according to the diagnosis (ihs guideline criteria): mhwa n.= 28 or tth n.= 21. subjects were to take np for 7 days in the event of a headache attack over a period of 6 months. the severity of pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (vas), blood was drawn to determine interleukin il-6, il-8 and tnf-a plasma levels, and quality of life was assessed by asking the subject to fill in the sf-36 questionnaire (simplified version) at baseline and after 7 days of treatment. subjects were asked to report any recurrences. results: np reduced vas score on average by two-thirds in both groups (mhwa p< 0.03 and tth p< 0.01). the improvement in pain was associated with an important improvement in quality of life. np reduced all three cytokines significantly by 40-60.7%. the highest reductions were recorded for il-8 and tnf-a (54.4-60.5%) and were consistently more pronounced in tth subjects. the recurrence rate was 12% in mhwa subjects 10% in tth subjects. no adverse events were reported. conclusions: np, thanks to the presence of myrliq (r), which possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anesthetic properties, should be considered an alternative therapeutic option for the two most common types of headache, namely mhwa and tth.
menopause	objective: to assess the differential features of marrow adiposity between osteoarthritis (oa) and osteoporosis (op) in postmenopausal women using water/fat mri. methods: this cross-sectional study included 97 postmenopausal women (oa [n = 25], oa + osteopenia [n = 27], oa + op [n = 23], and op groups [n = 22]). water/fat mri, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and biochemical analysis were performed to assess vertebral marrow fat fraction, bone mineral density, and bone biomarkers, respectively. harris hip score was recorded to evaluate hip function. results: there were significant differences in marrow fat content among the oa, oa + osteopenia, and oa + op groups, between op and oa participants with normal bone mass or osteopenia (all p < 0.05); no significant difference was observed between oa + op and op groups. serum levels of leptin and beta-crosslaps in oa with normal bone mass and osteopenic oa groups were higher than in op group. marrow fat fraction was inversely correlated with harris hip score (r = -0.371, p = 0.013), bone mineral density (r = -0.554, p = 0.009) and leptin levels (r = -0.610, p < 0.001). in multivariate regression analysis, marrow fat fraction was found to have a consistent and unchanged inverse association with leptin levels (s beta = -0.311, p = 0.002) and bone mineral density (s beta = -0.265, p = 0.006) after adjusting for age, years since menopause, and body mass index. conclusions: postmenopausal oa with op have a phenotype with higher marrow adiposity. oa and op could coexist, for the presence of a specific subgroup of oa with increased marrow fat accumulation and high risk of developing op.
allergies	background: chronic otitis media (com) is one of the most common childhood diseases. its pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. the role of specific mucin glycoprotein subtypes in om is only recently being elucidated. objective: to determine the relationship between middle ear fluid mucins and clinical variables of patients needing tympanostomy tubes (tt). methods: middle ear effusions (mee) from children receiving tt were collected over a 2-year period. western blot characterization of mucins muc5b and muc5ac along with chart review of age, gender, effusion viscosity, hearing loss >30 db, history of allergies, and/or respiratory disease were performed. results: mee samples from 58 patients were available for analysis. overall, muc5b was significantly more often detected in middle ear fluid relative to muc5ac (90% vs. 51%, p = 0.005). muc5b presence was statistically associated with mucoid effusions relative to serous effusions (100% vs. 57%, p = 0.0064), muc5ac presence was not significantly different in mucoid and serous fluid (55.1% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.447). patients younger than 48 months were more likely to present with mucoid effusion, compared to those older than 48 months of age (p = 0.038). finally, patients with effusions positive for muc5b were younger than those with effusions negative for muc5b (35.1 vs. 76 months, p = 0.045). no other variables correlated to either effusion viscosity or specific mucin content. conclusion: patients younger in age needing tt placement are more likely to present with mucoid effusions, predominantly containing muc5b mucin. as such, we postulate a distinct pathophysiology for mucoid and serous effusions across ages in children with com.

cancer	schiff bases from the thiosemicarbazones family with variable n4 substituents are known to show enhanced growth inhibitory properties. in view of these facts and as a part of our continuous interest in cationic schiff bases, we have developed several schiff base ligands from (3-formyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) methyltriphenylphosphonium (t) in present study. the compounds were characterized by various spectroscopic methods (infrared spectra, h-1 nmr, c-13 nmr, hresims and x-ray crystallography). three of the n4 substituents, namely p(tsc)t, fp(tsc)t and ep(tsc)t exerted strong growth inhibitory properties by inhibiting the highly metastasis prostate cancer growth (pc-3). the thiosemicarbazone with ethyl-phenyl (ep) moiety displayed most potent activity against all cell lines tested. the mit data obtained from analysis establishes that phenyl substituent enhances the growth inhibitory properties of the compound. the result affirms that ep(tsc)t would serve as a lead scaffold for rational anticancer agent development.

parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in humans. the hormone alpha-melanocytestimulating hormone (alpha-msh) has been reported to be neuroprotective in previous studies. the aim of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effects of alpha-msh against the neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp+). our results indicated that treatment with alpha-msh in m17 cells attenuated mpp+-induced oxidative stress, embodied by exacerbated reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyls. in addition, we found that alpha-msh could improve mitochondrial function in m17 cells through increasing the level of adeno-sine triphosphate and mitochondrial membrane potential. furthermore, treatment with alpha-msh restored the reduction of cell viability and the induction of lactate dehydrogenase release induced by alpha-msh. importantly, hoechst staining results indicated that alpha-msh treatment significantly reduces the number of apoptotic cells after treatment with mpp+. mechanically, we found that alpha-msh prevented apoptosis signals through reducing the level of cleaved caspase-3 and attenuating cytochrome c release. all these data imply that alpha-msh produces a protective effect in pd.

skin_care	a high standard of newborn care, especially at a primary level, is needed to address the neonatal mortality rate in south africa. the current approach to continuing training of health-care workers uses traditional methods of centralised teaching by formal tutors away from the place of work. this is no longer affordable, achievable or desirable, particularly in rural areas. an innovative system of self-directed learning by groups of nurses caring for mothers and their newborn infants uses specially prepared course books without the need for trainers. using self-study supported by peer discussion groups, nurses can take responsibility for their own professional growth. this builds competence, confidence and a sense of pride. since 1993, the perinatal education programme has provided continuing learning opportunities for thousands of nurses in southern africa. a number of prospective trials have demonstrated that study groups can significantly improve knowledge and understanding, attitudes, clinical skills and quality of care provided to mothers and infants. a recent review of 10,000 successful participants across a wide range of provinces, ages and home languages documented the success of the project. using a question-and-answer format to promote problem-solving, case studies, simple skills workshops and multiple choice tests, each module addresses common conditions with appropriate care practices such as thorough drying at birth, delayed cord-clamping, skin-to-skin care, breast feeding, basic resuscitation, correct use of oxygen therapy, hand-washing, blood glucose monitoring and promotion of parental bonding. the training material is now also available free of charge on an on-line website as well as being presented as e-books which can be downloaded onto personal computers, tablet readers and smart phones. this is supplemented by regular sms text messages providing nurses with relevant 'knowledge bites'. all nurses caring for newborn infants now have easy, affordable access to continuing education which promises nationwide improvements in newborn care.
headache	background a number of different viral, bacterial, fungal and protozoan organisms can cause atypical pneumonia; the three most common are chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. atypical pneumonias are by far the most underdiagnosed and underreported clinical entities, and very few studies have been reported in india. this study was conducted from march 2015 to september 2015 to determine the seroprevalence of m. pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila antibodies in patients with lower respiratory tract infections, and to compare igm elisa with that of the sanger sequencing. sequencing proved to be one of the rapid, sensitive and specific method of diagnosis in these cases. materials and methods this cross sectional hospital based study was done at government general and chest hospital, erragadda, hyderabad. the study population included 90 patients attending outpatient department and admitted as inpatients between march 2015 to september 2015 with a high probability of atypical pneumonia based on clinical symptoms and signs like fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache. crepitations and presence of new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, in cases like copd with acute exacerbation, bronchial asthma with acute exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia cases. sputum and serum samples collected from each patient. 90 blood samples collected were subjected to elisa to detect igm antibody (euroimmun) for chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. the sputum samples showing no pathogenic organisms (npo) were subjected to pcr for amplification of v3 region of 16 sma followed by sanger sequencing. results 17 cases were positive for igm antibodies for atypical bacteria and 8 cases were positive by sanger sequencing. the common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, chest pain, dyspnoea and headache. more number of cases were detected in community-acquired pneumonia patients followed by copd and bronchial asthma with acute exacerbation. conclusion igm elisa having correlated clinically with reasonable sensitivity could be a useful tool in diagnosing atypical pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila, m. pneumoniae and c pneumoniae. sanger sequencing in comparisons of low sensitivity although highly specific can be recommended for application in discriminating species and not for diagnosis from sputum samples.
allergies	background: influenza infection can result in severe disease with debilitating complications. young children have the highest rate of influenza hospitalisations with various factors influencing influenza susceptibility and severity. objectives: this study aimed to determine the disease burden and assess risk factors for severe hospitalised influenza in south australian children under 5 years of age. methods: influenza admissions to the tertiary paediatric hospital in south australia from 2008 to 2012 were identified. data from laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were collected, including infecting influenza strain, co-infections, prematurity, pre-existing medical comorbidities and other potential risk factors. predictors of high-level care were assessed using logistic regression. results: a total of 267 children with laboratory-confirmed influenza were hospitalised. of these, 147 admissions (53%) occurred in children without underlying medical risk factors. eighteen children (7%) required high-level care, of which 11 (61%) had no underlying medical risk factors. no deaths were reported. the majority of children were unimmunised against influenza. co-infections were identified in 40% of children (n = 107). influenza b was associated with a requirement for higher care (or 3.7, ci 1.3-10.9, p = .02) as was a history of food allergies (or 9.7, ci 1.5-61.4, p = .02) and iron deficiency anaemia (or 4.8, ci 1.4-16.1, p = .01). conclusions: influenza can be a severe illness, even in children without underlying medical conditions. the identification of influenza b strain, history of food allergies and iron deficiency anaemia as predictors of severity in hospitalised cases warrants further investigation and may have important implications for preventative strategies to reduce the burden of childhood influenza.
myelofibrosis	hydroxyurea (hu) is widely used as first-line cytoreductive therapy for patients with high-risk philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (ph-neg mpn), but a small proportion of patients have refractory disease or experience adverse effects. studies have demonstrated busulfan (bu) to be an active first-line agent, but data on its role as second-line or later therapy are minimal. to evaluate its efficacy and safety in this context, we undertook a multicenter audit of ph-neg mpn patients who had received bu as therapy for hu intolerance or failure. of 51 patients identified, 38 (75%) achieved either complete or partial hematological response following at least one bu cycle. bu was generally well tolerated, with only 21/135 (15%) cycles complicated by adverse effects, predominantly cytopenia; only 6% of cycles were ceased due to treatment complications. bu is an effective and well-tolerated agent in patients with ph-neg mpn in the setting of hu intolerance or unresponsiveness.
hypothyroidism	aim: the study aim was to evaluate progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma on sunitinib (su) and su-everolimus treatment. patients & methods: after 7 years of enrollment and 9 years of follow-up, 193 consecutively presenting patients (151 men and 42 women) were treated. results: a total of 157 patients (81.3%) died and 36 patients (18.7%) survived. median pfs in 193 su-treated patients was 14.7 months and os was 28.8 months. median pfs was 13.98 months and median os was 26.67 months in 175 patients treated with su only or on su-everolimus. conclusion: the development of su-induced hypothyroidism, hypertension, neutropenia and edema was a significant predictive and prognostic factor.
menopause	objective: as endometrioma frequently recurs after conservative surgery, long-term postoperative medical treatment for the prevention of recurrence is necessary. however, it has not been elucidated whether long-term postoperative medical treatment is crucial to all patients until menopause. thereupon, this study was conducted to evaluate the age-related recurrence patterns after conservative surgery for endometrioma. study design: a retrospective cohort study was performed on a total of 420 reproductive-aged women who underwent conservative surgery for endometrioma between january 2000 and december 2010. ultrasonography was used during the follow-up period to detect endometrioma recurrence. patients were classified into two groups according to the use of postoperative medications. the first group was observation only, while the second received gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists followed by cyclic oral contraceptives. the cumulative recurrence rate of endometrioma was compared according to the age at surgery (20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-45 years) within each group. subgroup analysis was performed according to the age between the two groups. results: the median follow-up duration after surgery was 29.0 months (range 6-159 months) for all patients. after adjusting for parity, size and bilaterality of cyst, and stage with american society for reproductive medicine classification of endometriosis which was statistically different, within the group of no treatment, the cumulative recurrence rate in 40-45 years (10.2%) was significantly lower compared with those in 20-29 years (43.3%; hazard ratio (hr) = 0.04; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.01-0.52) and 30-39 years (22.5%; hr = 0.19; 95% ci = 0.04-0.92). however, there were no differences within the group of postoperative medical treatment. when we compared between the two groups, the cumulative recurrence rate was significantly different in 20-29 years (8.1 vs 43.3%; p < 0.001) and 30-39 years (5.4 vs 22.5%; p = 0.007), but there was no difference in 40-45 years (4.5 vs 10.2%; p = 0.901). conclusions: our preliminary results demonstrate that the risk of endometrioma recurrence decreases with age. after the age of forty, the recurrence rate does not differ according to the use of postoperative medication. based on our results, postoperative medical treatment may be individualized according to the patient 's age at the time of surgery. further studies are needed to identify patients who may benefit from postoperative medication.

birth_control	to investigate the potential involvement of fertility treatments and other conditions of becoming pregnant (infertility, getting pregnant on birth control, maternal history of fetal loss) and folic acid supplements in the etiology of childhood leukemia (cl). the estelle study included 747 cases of cl [636 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) and 100 of acute myeloblastic leukemia (aml)] diagnosed in france in 2010-2011 and 1,421 population controls frequency-matched with the cases on age and gender. data were obtained from structured telephone questionnaires administered to mothers. the odds ratios (or) and their 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. cl was not associated with difficulty in becoming pregnant [or 0.9 (0.7-1.2)], in vitro fertilisation [or 0.6 (0.3-1.5)] or the use of any fertility treatment [or 0.8 (0.5-1.1)] for the index pregnancy. cl was not significantly associated with becoming pregnant on contraception [or 1.2 (0.8-1.8)], but a positive association was observed for third generation oral contraception [or 4.3 (1.2-16.2)]; however, the result is based on small numbers. folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with cl, but an inverse borderline association was observed for supplementation initiated in the 3 months preceding pregnancy [or 0.7 (0.5-1.0)]. in addition, maternal histories of stillbirth and miscarriage were associated with all [or 2.6 (1.1-5.9)] and aml [or 1.8 (1.1-2.8)], respectively. the findings do not suggest that infertility and fertility treatments are risk factors for cl. they suggest that maternal histories of stillbirth and miscarriage may be more frequent among mothers of cl cases and that folic acid supplementation during preconception may reduce the risk of cl.
hypothyroidism	measurement of total thyroxine (t4) is the first testing step in the work-up of thyroid disease in small animals. we evaluated an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (elfa) as an in-house method to measure t4 in cats and dogs. we compared the t4 concentration in sera of 122 cats and 176 dogs measured by the elfa with an enzyme immunoassay (eia) to assess the concordance of the 2 methods. bias of the elfa in cats was -11.4% and in dogs 1.4%. using bland-altman plots, limits of agreement were -81.5 to 58.7% in cats and -71.4 to 74.4% in dogs. imprecision was calculated for both methods. intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (cvs) of the elfa in feline sera were 0.7 and 3.4% and of the eia 7.6 and 15.7%, respectively. intra- and interassay cvs of both elfa and eia in canine sera were <9.5%. reference intervals for the elfa method were established and were 13.3-49.5 nmol/l for cats and 10.1-42.9 nmol/l for dogs. accuracy of the eia and elfa was scored by assessing if the measured t4 value would identify the expected t4 range (low, normal, or elevated) of patients, based on history, clinical presentation, other diagnostic means, and response to therapy. this was possible for 75 cats and 50 dogs. both methods yielded acceptable results, but the eia was more accurate compared to the elfa (percentage of true-positives in cats and dogs: eia: 97% and 100%; elfa: 92% and 94%).
low_testosterone	late-onset hypogonadism is defined as a combination of low testosterone (t) levels and typical symptoms and signs. a major area of uncertainty is whether t concentrations are always really sufficient to fully reflect leydig cell (dys)function. mild testicular alteration could be diagnosed only by additional biochemical markers, such as luteinizing hormone (lh) and 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels. these markers help in identifying the so-called ""subclinical"" hypogonadism (normal t, high lh levels). patients with hypogonadism have frequently low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin d due to impairment of the hydroxylating enzyme cyp2r1 in the testis. however, no data have been published dealing with the best treatment option (cholecalciferol - the vitamin d precursor, or calcidiol - 25-hydroxylated form of vitamin d) in these patients. we studied 66 patients with classic hypogonadism (total t [tt]= 8 iu l(1) ) (n = 26) and subclinical hypogonadism (tt >= 12 nmol l(1) , lh >= 8 iu l(1) ) (n = 40) and low 25-hydroxyvitamin d (< 50 nmol l(1) ). subjects received cholecalciferol (5000 iu per week) (n = 20) or calcidiol (4000 iu per week) (n = 46), and 25-hydroxyvitamin d and parathyroid hormone (pth) were evaluated after 3 months of therapy. supplementation with calcidiol significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin d and significantly decreased pth levels in both groups of men with hypogonadism (primary, n = 16 and subclinical, n = 30), whereas supplementation with cholecalciferol did not modify their levels. this study shows for the first time that the administration of the 25-hydroxylated form of vitamin d (calcidiol), and not the administration of the precursor cholecalciferol, restores 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels in subjects with hypogonadism.
overactive_bladder	background/purpose: few studies have investigated the feasibility of using pudendal neuromodulation to regulate bladder function in spinal cord-injured (sci) animals. the present study aimed to determine the effects of electrical activation of the pudendal sensory branch on improving voiding functions in rats 6 weeks after a spinal cord injury and to explore the underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms. methods: two urodynamic measurements were used to assess the effects of electrical stimulation (es) on bladder and urethral functions: simultaneous recordings of the intravesical pressure (ivp) during continuous isotonic transvesical infusion (i.e., isotonic ivp) and external urethral sphincter (eus) electromyography (eus-emg), and simultaneous recordings of transvesical pressure under isovolumetric conditions (i.e., isovolumetric ivp) and urethral perfusion pressure (upp). results: six weeks after the sci, the rats showed voiding dysfunction, as indicated by abnormal cystometric measurements (e.g., increased volume threshold, increased contraction amplitude, and increased residual volume, and decreased voided volume). the voiding efficiency (ve) decreased to 13% after the sci, but increased to 22-34% after applying pudendal afferent stimulation. in addition, pudendal stimulation significantly increased the eus burst period and increased the difference between the upp and the high-frequency oscillation (hfo) baselines, and changed the time offset between bladder and eus activities. these findings suggest that pudendal afferent stimulation improved the ve by prolonging the micturition interval, decreased the urethral resistance, and recovered detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia during the voiding phase. conclusion: this study demonstrates the feasibility of using pudendal neuromodulation in chronic sci rats. these results could aid in developing an advanced neural prosthesis to restore bladder function in clinical settings. copyright (c) 2015, formosan medical association. published by elsevier taiwan llc. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license.
menopause	because estrogens and the trigeminal system are inherently linked, prescribers who are treating a woman with a hormonally related mood disorder and migraine headaches should consider hormonal options to optimize the patient 's treatment. this article discusses the interrelationships of estrogen, serotonin, and the trigeminal system as they relate to menstrual migraine occurrence and hormone-related mood symptoms. in addition, clinical examples are provided to facilitate the prescribers treating women during reproductive transitions in which declining estrogens are related to their suffering.
menopause	4-vinilcyclohexene diepoxide (4-vcd) causes premature ovarian failure and may result in estrogen deficiency, characterizing the transition to estropause in rodents (equivalent to menopause in women). estropause/menopause is associated with metabolic derangements such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. glucocorticoids (gcs) are known to exert diabetogenic effects. thus, we aimed to investigate whether rats with premature ovarian failure are more prone to the diabetogenic effects of gc. for this, immature female rats received daily injections of 4-vcd [160 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), intraperitoneally (i.p.)] for 15 consecutive days, whereas control rats received vehicle. after 168 days of the completion of 4-vcd administration, rats were divided into 4 groups: ctl-received daily injections of saline (1 ml/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5 days; dex-received daily injections of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5 days; vcd-treated as ctl group; vcd + dex-treated as dex group. experiments and euthanasia occurred one day after the last dexamethasone injection. 4-vcd-treated rats exhibited ovary hypotrophy and reduced number of preantral follicles (p < 0.05). premature ovarian failure had no impact on the body weight gain or food intake, but both were reduced by the effects of dexamethasone. the increase in blood glucose, plasma insulin and triacylglycerol levels as well as the reduction in insulin sensitivity caused by dexamethasone treatment was not exacerbated in the vcd + dex group of rats. premature ovarian failure did change neither the hepatic content of glycogen and triacylglycerol nor the glycerol release from perigonadal adipose tissue. glucose intolerance was observed in the vcd group after an ipgit (p < 0.05), but not after an oral glucose challenge. glucose intolerance and compensatory pancreatic beta-cell mass caused by gc were not modified by ovarian failure in the vcd + dex group. we conclude that reduced ovarian function has no major implications on the diabetogenic effects promoted by gc treatment, indicating that other factors related to aging may make rats more vulnerable to gc side effects on glucose metabolism.

headache	chronic craniofacial pain involves the head, face and oral cavity and is associated with significant morbidity and high levels of health care utilization. a bidirectional relationship is suggested in the literature for poor sleep and pain, and craniofacial pain and sleep are reciprocally related. we review this relationship and discuss management options. part i reviews the relationship between pain and sleep disorders in the context of four diagnostic categories of chronic craniofacial pain: 1) primary headaches: migraines, tension-type headache (tth), trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (tacs) and hypnic headache, 2) secondary headaches: sleep apnea headache, 3) temporomandibular joint disorders (tmd) and 4) painful cranial neuropathies: trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpetic trigeminal neuropathy, painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (pttn) and burning mouth syndrome (bms). part ii discusses the management of patients with chronic craniofacial pain and sleep disorders addressing the factors that modulate the pain experience as well as sleep disorders and including both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities.

parkinson's_disease	the identification of ocular tremor in a small cohort of patients with parkinson 's disease (pd) had lay somewhat dormant until the recent report of a pervasive ocular tremor as a universal finding in a large pd cohort that was, however, generally absent from a cohort of age-matched healthy subjects. the reported tremor had frequency characteristics similar to those of pd limb tremor, but the amplitude and frequency of the tremor did not correlate with clinical tremor ratings. much controversy ensued as to the origin of such a tremor, and specifically as to whether a pervasive ocular tremor was a fundamental feature of pd, or rather a compensatory eye oscillation secondary to a transmitted head tremor, and thus a measure of a normal vestibulo-ocular reflex. in this mini review, we summarize some of the evidence for and against the case for a pervasive ocular tremor in pd and suggest future experiments that may help resolve these conflicting opinions.
skin_care	objectives. we investigate the impact of occupational skin disease consultations among outpatients at the dermatological department, university hospital, northern norway. study design. from 1997 until 2004, 386 patients with occupational skin disease were examined and given advice on skin care, skin disease treatment, skin protection in further work, and on the legal rights of patients with this disease. ten to fifteen years later, we wanted to look at these patients in terms of their work situation, the current status of their disease, the help they received from the labour offices, and their subjective quality of life. material and methods. in the autumn of 2011 until the spring of 2012, a number of the patients examined in the period from 1997 to 2004 were selected and sent a questionnaire, which they were asked to answer and return, regarding their work situation and the progress and current status of their occupational disease. results. a total of 153 (77%) patients answered the questionnaire; 71% of these patients were still in work, and further 15% had old-age retired, 13% were working until then; 16% had retired early because of disability; 54% had changed jobs because of their occupational skin disease; 86% of the patients indicated that the skin disease had improved since our previous investigation. conclusions. our investigation into patients with occupational skin disease documented that the majority of patients who had received professional dermatological consultation and intervention offers were still in the labour market and had good control of their skin disease 10-15 years later. we discovered that 71% of the patients were still employed. 13% had remained in work until they became old age pensioners. only 16% dropped out of work because of disability. these high percentages may indicate that our intervention has contributed positively to patients' work conditions and the course of their skin disease.
overactive_bladder	background: to date, the association between obesity and lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) is controversial. objective: to overcome the current inconsistent results regarding the association between obesity and luts and to investigate the association between obesity and luts using propensity score matching analysis. setting: bariatric center of excellence and health promotion center at university hospital. methods: from august 2012 to december 2014, a total of 260 obese patients (77 men and 180 women) visited to our bariatric center to undergo bariatric surgery. patients' international prostate symptom score (lpss) and overactive bladder symptom score were compared with those of 844 healthy controls who had visited our health center during the same period. to control for the effects of age, 1:1 propensity score matching was used. results: after matching propensity score forage, 73 male patients and 176 female patients were included in our study. in men, all lpss items except ""frequency"" were significantly different between obese patients and controls; median scores were higher in the obese group. in women, all ipss items except ""feeling of incomplete emptying"" were significantly different between the 2 groups. both voiding and storage subscores also had marked differences in both genders (p < .001). total rpss, quality of life, and total overactive bladder symptom score were significantly different in both genders (p < .001). conclusion: there were marked differences in luts between obese and nonobese patients, including in voiding and storage symptoms. considering the relatively young age of both groups, this case-control study supports the hypothesis of a relationship between obesity and bladder pathophysiology.

diabetes	diabetes is one of high risk factors for cardio-and cerebra-vascular diseases, including stroke, atherosclerosis and hypertension. this study was conducted to elucidate whether and how thromboxane receptor (tpr) activation contributes to blood-brain barrier (bbb) dysfunction in diabetes. human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmecs) were cultured. the levels of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) at ser1177 (p-enos) and akt at ser473 (p-akt) were assayed by western blot. exposure of hbmecs to either high glucose (hg) or thromboxane a2 (txa2) mimetic u46619, significantly reduced p-enos and p-akt. these effects were abolished by pharmacological or genetic inhibitors of tpr. hg/u46619-induced suppressions of enos and akt phosphorylation were accompanied by upregulation of pten and ser380/thr382/383 pten phosphorylation. pten-specific sirna restored akt-enos signaling in the face of tpr activation or hg. the small gtpase, rho, was also activated by hg stimulation, and pretreatment of hbmecs with y27632, a rho-associated kinase (rock) inhibitor, rescued hg-impaired akt-enos signaling. in stz-injected rats, we found that hyperglycemia dramatically increased the levels of pten and pten-ser380/thr382/383 phosphorylation, reduced both levels of p-enos and p-akt, and disrupted bbb function assayed by evans blue staining, which were abolished by sq29548 treatment. we conclude that hyperglycemia activates thromboxane a2 receptor to impair the integrity and function of blood-brain barrier via the rock-pten-akt-enos pathway.
low_testosterone	alpha-protein kinase 1, also known as alpha-kinase 1 (alpk1), is associated with chronic kidney disease (ckd), myocardial infarction, gout and type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm). in addition to having an inductive effect on the proinflammatory cytokines in monocytic thp1 cells, alpk1 is expressed abundantly in the mouse testes. low testosterone levels are commonly associated with arthritis, ckd, type 2 dm, cardiovascular disease and inflammation. the testosterone 's anti-inflammatory effect has been demonstrated to reduce proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. in this study, we found that alpk1 transgenic mice showed lower levels of testosterone in both the testes and the serum. decreasing endogenous alpk1 enhanced testosterone levels and transcripts of testosterone-regulated genes (p450scc, 3beta-hsd, p450c17, 17beta-hsd, star, and insl3) in tm3 leydig cells. in contrast, increasing testosterone decreased alpk1 in both tm3 and monocytic thp1 cells. this decrease was accompanied by a reduction of the proinflammatory cytokines. increased alpk1 levels attenuated the testosterone effects in thp1 cells. finally, we also found that alpk1 increased the release of tnf-alpha and tgf-beta1 in the human embryonic kidney 293 cells, while testosterone inhibited alpk1 in the primary kidney cells. taken together, this data suggests that the balance between alpk1 and testosterone plays a critical role in the testosterone-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines.

hepatitis_c	hepatitis c is a great burden to the health systems in all the countries. it accounts for over 170 million infected people worldwide. only in 2015 there were approximately 700.000 people worldwide that died due to c hepatitis. in some other countries in africa or asia hepatitis c accounts for approximately 10% of the population. hepatitis c is accompanied in most cases by neuropsychological diseases, mainly depression. depression can be seen in hcv patients before and during the ifn treatment. it can also be developed by the treatment itself. patients should be screen for depression pre-treatment and during treatment. support from family and relatives are also important as it helps the patients to better cope with the disease and increase their successful treatment chances. treatment abandon is also greatly reduced when patients are assisted by a therapist during the treatment and have full support of family and relatives. there is a large spectrum of causes for depression and these causes are influenced by gender, social stigma, education, local culture, etc. on rare occasions depression can lead to suicidal ideation and attempts. suicide attempts per se do not represent a high percentage in hepatitis c infected patients. mortality due to hepatitis c virus is about 4% per year, with death from hepatocellular carcinoma accounting for almost half of the total deaths number. in co-morbidity cases the hcv virus together with hiv mainly hepatitis is responsible for 11% of total deaths. this is considered a high number and establishes hepatitis c as an important priority.
hepatitis_c	objectivesclinical trials of all-oral direct-acting antivirals (daas) for chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection reported high response rates in hcv/hiv coinfection, similar to those obtained in hcv monoinfection. we evaluated the safety and efficacy of these regimens in a clinical practice setting. methodsin this prospective observational study, all the hcv-monoinfected and hcv/hiv-coinfected patients undergoing hcv treatment with all-oral daa regimens in a routine clinical setting from december 2014 to december 2015 were included in the analysis. sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of therapy (svr12) and reported adverse events (aes) were evaluated. resistance-associated variants (ravs) were analysed in a subgroup of patients at baseline and at the time of viral rebound in those with virological failure. resultsone-hundred and nine patients (51 hcv-infected and 58 hcv/hiv-coinfected) were enrolled in the study. sixty per cent had cirrhosis and 52% were pegylated interferon and ribavirin (pegifn/rbv)-experienced. thirty-six per cent received ombitasvir + paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir, 25% sofosbuvir + daclatasvir, 16% sofosbuvir + simeprevir, 17% sofosbuvir + ribavirin and 6% sofosbuvir + ledipasvir; ribavirin was used in 57% of subjects. the svr12 rate was 91% and 96% in hiv-infected and uninfected patients, respectively (p = 0.44). the 4-week hcv viral decline was similar in the two groups. ravs were found at baseline in 23 of 49 patients and did not affect svr12. no predictors of svr12 were identified in our cohort. conclusionstreatment with all-oral daa combinations of patients infected with hcv and with hcv/hiv under real-life conditions led to high and similar rates of svr12. moreover, the historical factors associated with a sustained virological response to pegifn/rbv were not predictive of the response to all-oral daas.
senior_health	purpose this study nas undertaken to determine if a community screening program designed to overcome key barriers (lack of awareness, cost of program, ease of access to care) could successfully impact on african-american males knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding prostate cancer screening. the focus of this report is knowledge. to date, there are no reported studies that examine differences in knowledge from a prescreening baseline to a postintervention level for minority participants. patients and methods a total of 944 men were enrolled in the study in a 20-month period. prostate screening and education were offered as a new service at an existing senior health clinic. in addition, mass screenings were offered approximately monthly at various locations in the community (including senior community centers, senior apartment complexes, and some public housing projects), screening included both the digital rectal examination and the prostate specific antigen test. a brief questionnaire was administered during client intake (the pretest) and repeated after the education and screening participation (the posttest). test items targeted three constructs: (1) etiology, (2) risk status, and (3) clinical factors. results the largest difference on pretest scores between the racial groups resulted from clinical factor knowledge. african-american men were significantly less likely than caucasian men to correctly identify early symptoms of prostate cancer acid the basic components of a prostate checkup. although scores were initially significantly lower for african-american participants, these differences were not evident after program involvement, there was a significant increase in knowledge level for all men when comparing pretest and posttest scores. significant improvement was noted for each test item, with the exception of one key item, even after participation in the program, african-american men were still more likely to believe that ""pain"" was the first symptom of prostate cancer. discussion an item-by-item analysis revealed that there was only one test item in which program participation did not ""correct"" knowledge. african-american men were still more likely to believe that pain was the first symptom that would alert them to the presence of cancer. the screening program included information (both printed and oral content) that emphasized the importance of routine screening to detect cancer at an early stage, because most men would experience no symptoms, the only other reported study that examined knowledge documented similar findings with respect to an understanding of symptomology, these findings can be used to direct or guide the educational component of future screening programs that hope to target african-american men.
overactive_bladder	background and aim: the impact of nocturia (getting up at night to void) on health-related quality-of-life (hrqol) is often under-estimated. this study investigated the relative burden in terms of hrqol and utilities of nocturia in a real-world setting. methods: patient data were collected from two surveys: a nocturia-specific, cross-sectional survey of physicians and their patients (dsp), and a general uk population health survey (hsfe). utilities (eq-5d-5l), productivity (work productivity and activity index), and the impact of nocturia symptoms (nocturia impact diary and overactive bladder questionnaires) were assessed against the number of voids. a robust linear regression model with propensity score weights was used to control for confounding factors in estimating utilities. results: physician-recorded data were available from 8,738 patients across the us, germany, spain, france, and the uk; of these, 5,335 (61%) included patient-reported outcomes. in total, 6,302 controls were drawn from the two surveys and compared to 1,104 nocturia patients. deterioration of hrqol was associated with increasing number of night-time voids (p<0.0001). in particular, significant differences were observed between 0-1 and 2 voids (p= 2 per night) is associated with a modest but significant deterioration in utility of 0.0134 (p<0.05). limitations: the cause of nocturia is multifactorial and the mostly elderly patients may have several concomitant diseases. the authors tried to adjust for the most common ones, but there may be diseases or unknown relationships not included. conclusions: nocturia negatively affected hrqol and patient utility. a clear effect is seen already at two voids per night. every effort should, therefore, be made to reduce nocturia below the bother threshold of two voids per night.
hepatitis_c	persons who inject drugs, most of whom are opioid dependent, comprise the majority of the hcv infected in the united states. as the national opioid epidemic unfolds,""increasing numbers of people are entering the medical system to access treatment for opioid use disorder, specifically with buprenorphine. yet little is known about hcv care in patients accessing buprenorphine-based opioid treatment. we sought to determine the hcv prevalence, cascade of care, and the association between patient characteristics and completion of hcv cascade of care milestones for patients initiating buprenorphine treatment we reviewed electronic health records of all patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment at a primary-care clinic in the bronx, ny between january 2009 and january 2014. of the 390 patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment, 123 were confirmed to have chronic hcv infection. the only patient characteristic associated with achieving hcv care milestones was retention in opioid treatment. patients retained (vs. not retained) in buprenorphine treatment were more likely to be referred for hcv specialty care (63.1% vs. 34.0%, p < 0.01), achieve an hcv-specific evaluation (40.8% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.05), be offered hcv treatment (22.4% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.05), and initiate hcv treatment (9.2% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.6). given the current opioid epidemic in the us and the growing number of people receiving buprenorphine treatment, there is an unprecedented opportunity to access and treat persons with hcv, reducing hcv transmission, morbidity and mortality. retention in opioid treatment may improve linkage and retention in hcv care; innovative models of care that integrate opioid drug treatment with hcv treatment are essential.

allergies	cockroach (cr) allergies caused by the american cockroach hyave been recognized to be repsonsible for ige-mediated type i hypersensitivity worldwide. per a 10 is one of the recognized main allergens of the american cr. in a previous study, we examined another american cr allergen, per a 9 in patients with cr allergies and examined epitope sequences in this allergen. in the present study, we aimed to examine epitope sequences in the per a 10 allergen. for this purpose, the per a 10 gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli (e. coli) systems. our results revealed that 9 out of 16 (56.3%) sera from patients with american cr allergies reacted to per a10, as assessed by elisa, confirming that per a 10 is a major allergen of the american cr. our results also revealed that the expression of cd63 and ccr3 on passively sensitized basophils (obtained sera of patients with american cr allergies) was increased by approximately 2.3-fold, indicating that recombinant per a 10 is functionally active. in addition, 3 immunoinformatics tools, namely the dnastar protean system, the bioinformatics predicted antigenic peptides (bpap) system and the bepipred 1.0 server were used to predict the peptides and the results revealed 8 peptides (2-12, 55-67, 98-120, 125-133, 149-160, 170-182, 201-208 and 223-227) as potential b cell epitopes of the per a 10 allergen. moreover, per a 10 was predicted to have 3 t cell epitope sequences, namely 83-92, 139-147 and 162-170. the findings of our study on the cr allergen may prove to be useful in the development of peptide-based vaccine for the prevention and/or treatment of cr allergies.
menopause	to evaluate the association between sleep duration, snoring and diabetes according to gender and menopausal status in rural china. the data were part of the baseline survey of china kadoorie biobank, from a rural county in the south-east costal zhejiang province. participants including 24,027 men and 33,677 women aged 30-79 years were enrolled during 2004-2008. multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ors) and 95 % confidence intervals (cis) for diabetes. sleep duration was shown to have a u-shaped association with diabetes in women, in particular in postmenopausal women after adjustment for potential confounders. compared with 7-h sleepers, ors (95 % cis) of sleep duration ae5 and ae10 h for diabetes were 1.32 (1.02-1.69) and 1.30 (1.03-1.65), respectively, in postmenopausal women (p for quadratic trend = 0.016). however, this u-shaped association was not obvious in men and premenopausal women. frequently snoring was positively associated with diabetes in all participants. however, this association was not independent of socioeconomic status, health behaviors, obesity and chronic diseases. with increasing sleep duration, the proportion of frequently snoring increased in all participants (p trend < 0.05). postmenopausal women had 23 % (95 % ci 6-44 %) higher odds of diabetes compared with premenopausal women, and the duration of menopause had cumulative effects on diabetes. short and long sleep durations were significantly associated with diabetes in postmenopausal women, independent of potential confounders. the proportion of frequently snoring had linear trend with sleep duration. postmenopausal status and the duration of menopause increased the odds of diabetes.
heart_disease	large artery atherosclerotic stroke (las) shows substantial heritability not explained by previous genome-wide association studies. here, we explore the role of coding variation in las by analyzing variants on the humanexome beadchip in a total of 3,127 cases and 9,778 controls from europe, australia, and south asia. we report on a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant in serpin family a member 1 (serpina1) encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin [aat; p.v213a; p = 5.99e-9, odds ratio (or) = 1.22] and confirm histone deacetylase 9 (hdac9) as a major risk gene for las with an association in the 3'-utr (rs2023938; p = 7.76e-7, or = 1.28). using quantitative microscale thermophoresis, we show that m1 (a213) exhibits an almost twofold lower dissociation constant with its primary target human neutrophil elastase (ne) in lipoprotein-containing plasma, but not in lipid-free plasma. hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry further revealed a significant difference in the global flexibility of the two variants. the observed stronger interaction with lipoproteins in plasma and reduced global flexibility of the val-213 variant most likely improve its local availability and reduce the extent of proteolytic inactivation by other proteases in atherosclerotic plaques. our results indicate that the interplay between aat, ne, and lipoprotein particles is modulated by the gate region around position 213 in aat, far away from the unaltered reactive center loop (357-360). collectively, our findings point to a functionally relevant balance between lipoproteins, proteases, and aat in atherosclerosis.
heart_disease	background: maternal education influences skeletal growth and offspring adult blood pressure (bp). height components are negatively associated with bp in high-income countries. aim: to evaluate the association between maternal education and offspring adult systolic and diastolic bp (sbp/dbp), assessing whether different height components might mediate such an association. subjects and methods: simple mediation modelling was used to evaluate the maternal education-offspring sbp/dbp association, estimating the contribution of offspring height components, in a cross-sectional sample of 13 571 brazilians aged 34-75 from the elsa-brasil study. results: after full adjustment for confounders, and compared to participants whose mothers received low education, those whose mothers received high education had, on average, 0.2 mm hg lower sbp (95% ci = -0.274, -0.132), as result of the link between maternal education and offspring adult height which, in turn, influenced sbp. thus, 18-26% of the maternal education-sbp association occurred indirectly, through height, trunk and leg length, alternatively. conclusions: better maternal education might influence higher leg and trunk lengths in offspring, which, in turn, might contribute to prevent higher bp in adults. the negative height-bp association reported in high-income countries is also present in a middle-income country with more recent economic development.
diabetes	objective: examine relationships of healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns with bmi, sex, age and acculturation among mexican americans. design: cross-sectional. participants completed culturally tailored healthy and unhealthy eating indices. multivariable mixed-effect poisson regression models compared food pattern index scores and dietary intake of specific foods by bmi, sex, age and acculturation defined by language preference and generational status. setting: participants recruited from the cameron county hispanic cohort study, texas-mexico border region, between 2008 and 2011. subjects: mexican-american males and females aged 18-97 years (n 1250). results: participants were primarily female (55(.)3 %), overweight or obese (85(.)7 %), preferred spanish language (68(.)0%) and first-generation status (60(.)3 %). among first-generation participants, bilingual participants were less likely to have a healthy eating pattern than preferred spanish-speaking participants (rate ratio (rr)= 0(.)79, p = 0(.)0218). this association was also found in males (rr = 0(.)81, p= 0(.)0098). preferred english-speaking females were less likely to consume healthy foods than preferred spanish-speaking females (rr= 0(.)84, p = 0(.)0293). among second-generation participants, preferred english-speaking participants were more likely to report a higher unhealthy eating pattern than preferred spanish-speaking participants (rr= 1(.)23, p = 0(.)0114). higher unhealthy eating patterns were also found in females who preferred english v. females who preferred spanish (rr= 1(.)23, p= 0(.)0107) or were bilingual (rr= 1(.)26, p = 0(.)0159). younger, male participants were more likely to have a higher unhealthy eating pattern. bmi and diabetes status were not significantly associated with healthy or unhealthy eating patterns. conclusions: acculturation, age, sex and education are associated with healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns. nutrition interventions for mexican americans should tailor approaches by these characteristics.
fungal_infection	a 41-year-old male with heterotaxy (left isomerism) and dextrocardia composed by single ventricle, absent inferior vena cava, bilateral superior vena cava (svc), common atrioventricular valve has received orthotopic heart transplantation (htx) after long waiting period as status-1. reconstructions of bilateral svc and hepatic vein route were successful without use of prosthetic material, and the donor heart was placed in the left mediastinum. in spite of satisfactory early recovery, the patient expired 4 months after transplantation mainly from fungal infection which developed following humoral rejection. htx for adult patients with complex congenital heart disease is demanding in technical as well as pre- and post-transplant management, and indication should be critically determined.
multiple_sclerosis	identification of treatment responders is a challenge in comparative studies where treatment efficacy is measured by multiple longitudinally collected continuous and count outcomes. existing procedures often identify responders on the basis of only a single outcome. we propose a novel multiple longitudinal outcome mixture model that assumes that, conditionally on a cluster label, each longitudinal outcome is from a generalized linear mixed effect model. we utilize a monte carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of our high-dimensional model and classify patients according to their estimated posterior probability of being a responder. we demonstrate the flexibility of our novel procedure on two multiple sclerosis clinical trial datasets with distinct data structures. our simulation study shows that incorporating multiple outcomes improves the responder identification performance; this can occur even if some of the outcomes are ineffective. our general procedure facilitates the identification of responders who are comprehensively defined by multiple outcomes from various distributions. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
skin_care	cosmetic development is not exclusively guided by notions of rational effectiveness but also by notions of sensoriality. thus, the sensorial properties of a cosmetic product are studied using internationally recognized discriminating or descriptive methods. descriptive sensory profiling is an essential tool in this process as it allows an experienced panel to assess the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of a product. the results obtained with this method enable to get a more accurate image of the product. however, given the new demands of the industrial world and the new innovation paths (shorter development times, complex products or willingness to include the consumers in the process) a need to access new methods has arisen. these alternative' methods that offer product positioning, ratings and attribute citation frequency, can be implemented with either a panel of experts or with consumers. the flash profile, the pivot (r) profile or the check all that apply (cata) are just a few of the methods that the cosmetic professionals have started to test. this article reviews the methods used in the sensory assessment of cosmetic products. the analysis carried out shows that the complementarity application of sensory assessment is essential in the upstream innovation phase of a product.
fungal_infection	neonatal cutaneous mucormycosis (ncm) is a rare, opportunistic, angioinvasive fungal infection with high mortality. here, we discuss the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a case of ncm where the neonate survived after 3 weeks of rigorous treatment with no need of local surgical debridement of the necrotic skin patch and systemic antifungals. this case highlights how early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are essential to manage this otherwise highly morbid disease.
menopause	hysterectomy is the most frequently performed major gynecologic surgery in women in the united states. this procedure is often accompanied by unilateral or bilateral removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries. although the overall incidence of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy has been shown to be in a decreasing trend in recent years, it is possibly 1 of the most common scenarios that the gynecologic surgeon will encounter. as the field of minimally invasive surgery continues to expand, it is expected that most of these surgeries will be performed using a laparoscopic approach. in fact, data support that adnexal surgery is more likely to take place during a laparoscopic hysterectomy when compared with abdominal or vaginal routes. this article reviews the basic surgical principles and relevant anatomic relations that every pelvic surgeon should know and aims to serve as a guide for effectively and proficiently performing a salpingo-oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy.

birth_control	objective: to describe the degree of perceived fertility control and associated likelihood of unintended pregnancy and poor pregnancy outcomes among women who report intimate partner violence. design: cross-sectional cohort study design. setting: five domestic violence shelters and one district attorney 's office in a large urban metropolis in the united states. participants: a total of 282 women who reported intimate partner violence and reached out for the first time to a shelter or district attorney 's office for assistance. methods: this 7-year prospective longitudinal study began in 2011. participants in the overarching study are being interviewed every 4 months. during the 32-month interview period, participants responded to a one-time, investigator-developed, fertility control questionnaire in addition to the ongoing repeated measures. results: almost one third (29%) of the participants reported at least one unintended pregnancy attributed to their abusers' refusal to use birth control, and 14.3% of the participants reported at least one unintended pregnancy as a result of their abusers' refusal to allow them to use birth control. participants were 28 times more likely to have abuse-induced miscarriages if their pregnancies resulted because their abusers did not use birth control (or = 28.70, p < .05). finally, participants were 8 times more likely to report premature births if they were abused because of their use of birth control (or = 8.340, p < .05). conclusion: women in abusive relationships reported compromised fertility control associated with abuse and increased risk for unintended pregnancy as well as the adverse pregnancy outcomes of premature birth and miscarriage.
allergies	the clinical importance of peanut (arachis hypogaea) allergies demands standardized allergen extraction protocols. we determined the effectiveness of common extraction conditions (20 buffers, defatting reagents, extraction time/temperatures, processing, extraction repeats) on crude protein and ara h 1 and 2 yields. despite similar 1d-gel profiles, defatting with n-hexane resulted in significantly higher yields of crude protein, ara h 1, and ara h 2 than with diethyl ether. the yields were affected by the composition and ph of the extraction buffers and other conditions, but crude protein yield did not always correlate with ara h 1 and 2 yields. denaturants, reducing agents, acidic buffers, and thermal processing of peanuts perturbed allergen quantification in elisas, probably via exposure of additional epitopes. allergen detection in 2d-western blots with pbs resulted in greater sensitivity than with tbs or tris. we recommend that allergen extraction conditions be selected based on the research question being investigated.

alzheimer's_disease	the treatment of ad is a topic that has puzzled researchers for many years. current mainstream theories still consider a beta to be the most important target for the cure of ad. in this study, we attempted to explore multiple targets for ad treatments with the aim of identifying a qualified compound that could both inhibit the aggregation of a beta and block the rage/a beta axis. we believed that a compound that targets both a beta and rage may be a feasible strategy for ad treatment. a novel and small natural compound, matrine (mat), was identified by high-throughput screening of the main components of traditional chinese herbs used to treat dementia. various experimental techniques were used to evaluate the effect of mat on these two targets both in vitro and in ad mouse model. mat could inhibit a beta 42-induced cytotoxicity and suppress the a beta/rage signaling pathway in vitro. additionally, the results of in vivo evaluations of the effects of mat on the two targets were consistent with the results of our in vitro studies. furthermore, mat reduced proinflammatory cytokines and a beta deposition and attenuated the memory deficits of ad transgenic mice. we believe that this novel, multi-target strategy to inhibit both a beta and rage, is worthy of further exploration. therefore, our future studies will focus on identifying even more effective multi-target compounds for the treatment of ad based on the molecular structure of mat.
birth_control	india is the second most populous country in the world with over 12108 million people, more than a sixth of the world 's population containing 17.5% of the world 's population. in spite of cafeteria choice of a various contraceptives and all types of media campaigns, population control remains a distant dream to achieve. early pregnancies, too many and too frequent pregnancies are the most important risk factors for maternal and child mortality. therefore, knowledge about contraception and its use is of utmost importance for birth control, proper spacing and thereby reducing the maternal mortality. objectives the objectives of this study are to assess the awareness and practices of contraception among married women and identify barriers for use of contraception. materials and methods a cross-sectional study design was used to interview one hundred married women in the reproductive age (15-45 years). the study was conducted in santa cruz, which is a field practice area of goa medical college, bambolim. a predesigned questionnaire comprised of various questions on awareness, practices and barriers of contraception use was utilized for data collection. data was compiled and analysed with spss 15 software. results the overall contraception use was 52%, while 48% never used contraceptives in the past. the 95% of the subjects were aware of condoms, 59% about oral pills, 53% about both cut and sterilization and 22% about the injectable contraceptives. around 43.7% of the subjects gathered information from the health professional regarding contraception. around 32% of the subjects were using barrier methods to prevent conception. preference of male child, religious beliefs, family objections, ignorance and uncooperative husband are some of the reasons for not practicing contraceptive methods. conclusions the study highlights the underutilization of contraceptive methods available to the modern women. in spite of contraceptives being freely available in the market, there remains a small section of women who are still ignorant about their availability. the male predominance in decision making is clearly demonstrated, which is the major determinant of use of contraceptive methods.
skin_care	recently there has been a growth of interest in the novel skin care formulations containing active ingredients such as low molecular weight peptides. in this paper we present new skincare formulations such as hydrogels, oil-in-water emulsions and water-in-oil emulsion containing a tetrapeptide (n-acetyl-pro-pro-tyr-leu). these formulations were characterized in terms of physicochemical parameters (ph, viscosity), stability and particle size distribution. additionally, the diffusion parameters of the peptide in the obtained formulations were calculated based on the einstein-smoluchowski equation. furthermore, in order to determine the penetration of the tetrapeptide through membranes its release kinetics were investigated. on the basis of release curves, the release rate constants were determined. the results proved that the properties of the formulations strongly determined the release rate of the tetrapeptide. the higher viscosity of the semisolid, the slower was the permeation through the membrane.

parkinson's_disease	two centuries ago in 1817, james parkinson provided the first medical description of parkinson 's disease, later refined by jean-martin charcot in the mid-to-late 19th century to include the atypical parkinsonian variants (also termed, parkinson-plus syndromes). today, parkinson 's disease represents the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with an estimated global prevalence of over 10 million. conversely, atypical parkinsonian syndromes encompass a group of relatively heterogeneous disorders that may share some clinical features with parkinson 's disease, but are uncommon distinct clinicopathological diseases. decades of scientific advancements have vastly improved our understanding of these disorders, including improvements in in vivo imaging for biomarker identification. multimodal imaging for the visualization of structural and functional brain changes is especially important, as it allows a 'window' into the underlying pathophysiological abnormalities. in this article, we first present an overview of the cardinal clinical and neuropathological features of, 1) synucleinopathies: parkinson 's disease and other lewy body spectrum disorders, as well as multiple system atrophy, and 2) tauopathies: progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. a comprehensive presentation of wellestablished and emerging imaging biomarkers for each disorder are then discussed. biomarkers for the following imaging modalities are reviewed: 1) structural magnetic resonance imaging (mri) using t1, t2, and susceptibilityweighted sequences for volumetric and voxel-based morphometric analyses, as well as mri derived visual signatures, 2) diffusion tensor mri for the assessment of white matter tract injury and microstructural integrity, 3) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for quantifying proton-containing brain metabolites, 4) single photon emission computed tomography for the evaluation of nigrostriatal integrity (as assessed by presynaptic dopamine transporters and postsynaptic dopamine d2 receptors), and cerebral perfusion, 5) positron emission tomography for gauging nigrostriatal functions, glucose metabolism, amyloid and tau molecular imaging, as well as neuroinflammation, 6) myocardial scintigraphy for dysautonomia, and 7) transcranial sonography for measuring substantia nigra and lentiform nucleus echogenicity. imaging biomarkers, using the 'multimodal approach', may aid in making early, accurate and objective diagnostic decisions, highlight neuroanatomical and pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as assist in evaluating disease progression and therapeutic responses to drugs in clinical trials.
hypothyroidism	background: there is substantial evidence both in humans and in animals that a prolonged reduction in plasma thyroid hormone concentration leads to reproductive problems, including disturbed folliculogenesis, impaired ovulation and fertilization rates, miscarriage and pregnancy complications. the objective of the present study is to examine the consequences of chronic hypothyroidism, induced in adulthood, for the size of the ovarian follicle pool. in order to investigate this, adult female rats were provided either a control or an iodide deficient diet in combination with perchlorate supplementation to inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid. sixteen weeks later animals were sacrificed. blood was collected for hormone analyses and ovaries were evaluated histologically. results: at the time of sacrifice, plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were 20-to 40-fold increased, thyroxine concentrations were negligible while tri-iothyronin concentrations were decreased by 40% in the hypothyroid group, confirming that the animals were hypothyroid. primordial, primary and preantral follicle numbers were significantly lower in the hypothyroid ovaries compared to the euthyroid controls, while a downward trend in antral follicle and corpora lutea numbers was observed. surprisingly the percentage of atretic follicles was not significantly different between the two groups, suggesting that the reduced preantral and antral follicle numbers were presumably not the consequence of increased degeneration of these follicle types in the hypothyroid group. plasma anti-mullerian hormone (amh) levels showed a significant correlation with the growing follicle population represented by the total ovarian number of primary, preantral and antral follicles, suggesting that also under hypothyroid conditions amh can serve as a surrogate marker to assess the growing ovarian follicle population. conclusions: the induction of a chronic hypothyroid condition in adult female rats negatively affects the ovarian follicular reserve and the size of the growing follicle population, which may impact fertility.
hypothyroidism	thyroid disorders have been associated with recurrent miscarriage. little evidence is available on the influence of subclinical hypothyroidism on live birth rates. in this cohort study, women who had experienced miscarriage and subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone >97.5th percentile mu/l with a normal thyroxine level) were investigated; the control group included women who had experienced recurrent miscarriage and normal thyroid function. multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association of subclinical hypothyroidism. data were available for 848 women; 20 (2.4%) had subclinical hypothyroidism; 818 women (96%) had euthyroidism; and 10 (1.2%) had overt hypothyroidism. the live birth rate was 45% in women with subclinical hypothyroidism and 52% in euthyroid women (or 0.69, 95% ci 0.28 to 1.71). the ongoing pregnancy rate was 65% versus 69% (or 0.82, 95% ci 0.32 to 2.10) and the miscarriage rate was 35% versus 28% (or 1.43, 95% ci 0.56 to 3.68), respectively. no differences were found when thyroid stimulating hormone 2.5 mu/l was used as cut-off level to define subclinical hypothyroidism. in women with unexplained miscarriage, no differences were found in live birth, ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage rates between women with subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroid women.

heart_disease	atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (cvd) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with coronary artery disease (cad) being the single leading cause of death. better control of risk factors, enhanced diagnostic techniques and improved medical therapies have all substantially decreased the mortality of cad in developed countries. however, cad and other forms of atherosclerotic cvd are projected to remain the leading cause of death by 2030 and we face a number of challenges if the outcomes of cad are to be further improved. the fact that a substantial fraction of high-risk subjects do not reach treatment goals for important risk factors is one of these challenges. at the same time, there is also a non-negotiable fraction of concealed' high-risk subjects who are not detected by current risk algorithms and diagnostic modalities. in recent years, we have started to rapidly increase our knowledge of the framework of common genetics underlying cad and atherosclerotic cvd in the population. in conjunction with modern diagnostic and therapeutic options, this new genetic knowledge may provide a valuable tool for further improvements in prevention. this review summarizes the recent findings from the search for common genetic risk factors for cad. furthermore, the author discusses how such recent findings could potentially be used in a number of clinical applications within cad prevention, including in clinical risk stratification, in prediction of drug treatment response and in the search for targets for novel preventive therapies.
menopause	animal experimental studies indicate that acute or chronic low-dose ionizing radiation (ldir) (<= 100 msv) or low-dose-rate ionizing radiation (ldrir) (< 6 msv/h) exposures may be harmful. it induces genetic and epigenetic changes and is associated with a range of physiological disturbances that includes altered immune system, abnormal brain development with resultant cognitive impairment, cataractogenesis, abnormal embryonic development, circulatory diseases, weight gain, premature menopause in female animals, tumorigenesis and shortened lifespan. paternal or prenatal ldir/ldrir exposure is associated with reduced fertility and number of live fetuses, and transgenerational genomic aberrations. on the other hand, in some experimental studies, ldir/ ldrir exposure has also been reported to bring about beneficial effects such as reduction in tumorigenesis, prolonged lifespan and enhanced fertility. the differences in reported effects of ldir/ldrir exposure are dependent on animal genetic background (susceptibility), age (prenatal or postnatal days), sex, nature of radiation exposure (i.e. acute, fractionated or chronic radiation exposure), type of radiation, combination of radiation with other toxic agents (such as smoking, pesticides or other chemical toxins) or animal experimental designs. in this review paper, we aimed to update radiation researchers and radiologists on the current progress achieved in understanding the ldir/ldrir-induced bionegative and biopositive effects reported in the various animal models. the roles played by a variety of molecules that are implicated in ldir/ldrir-induced health effects will be elaborated. the review will help in future investigations of ldir/ldrir-induced health effects by providing clues for designing improved animal research models in order to clarify the current controversial/ contradictory findings from existing studies.
alzheimer's_disease	the conventional clock drawing test (ccdt) is a rapid and inexpensive screening tool for detection of moderate and severe dementia. however, its usage is limited due to poor diagnostic accuracy especially in patients with mild cognitive impairment (mci). the diagnostic value of a newly developed digital clock drawing test (dcdt) was evaluated and compared with the ccdt in 20 patients with early dementia due to ad (edat), 30 patients with amnestic mci (amci) and 20 cognitively healthy controls (hcs). parameters assessed by dcdt were time while transitioning the stylus from one stroke to the next above the surface (i.e., time-in-air), time the stylus produced a visible stroke (i.e., time-on-surface) and total-time during clock drawing. receiver-operating characteristic (roc) curves were calculated and logistic regression analyses have been conducted for statistical analysis. using dcdt, time-in-air was significantly increased in edat (70965.8 ms) compared to amci (54073.7 ms; p = 0.027) and hc (32315.6 ms; p < 0.001). in addition, time-in-air was significantly longer in patients with amci compared to hc (p = 0.003), even in the amci group with normal ccdt score (54141.8 ms; p < 0.001). time-in-air using dcdt allowed discrimination of patients with amci from hcs with a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 72.2% while ccdt scoring revealed a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 83.3%. most interestingly, time-in-air allowed even discrimination of amci patients with normal ccdt scores (80% from all amci patients) from hcs with a clinically relevant sensitivity of 80.8% and a specificity of 77.8%. a combination of dcdt variables and ccdt scores did not improve the discrimination of patients with amci from hc. in conclusion, assessment of time-inair using dcdt yielded a higher diagnostic accuracy for discrimination of amci patients from hcs than the use of ccdt even in those amci patients with normal ccdt scores. modern digitizing devices offer the opportunity to measure subtle changes of visuoconstructive demands and executive functions that may be used as a fast and easy to perform screening instrument for the early detection of cognitive impairment in primary care.
parkinson's_disease	using molecular dynamics simulations, we have explored the effect of asymmetric lipids specifically those that contain one polyunsaturated (pufa) and one saturated fatty acid chain on phase separation in heterogeneous membranes. these lipids are prevalent in neuronal membranes, particularly in synaptic membranes, where the parkinson 's disease protein a-synuclein (alpha s) is found. we have therefore explored the relationship between asymmetric, pufa-containing lipids, and as. the simulations show that asymmetric lipids partition to the liquid disordered (ld) phase of canonical raft mixtures because of the highly disordered pufa chain. in the case of a membrane built to mimic the lipid composition of a synaptic vesicle, the pufa-containing asymmetric lipids completely disrupt phase separation. because as is positively charged, we show that it partitions with negatively charged lipids, regardless of the saturation state of the chains. additionally, as preferentially associates with the polyunsaturated fatty add tails of both charged and neutral lipids. this is a consequence of those chains' ability to accommodate the void beneath the amphipathic helix. this article is part of a special issue entitled: lipid order/ lipid defects and lipid-control of protein activity edited by dirk schneider.

cancer	raspberry waste, obtained from two cultivars, meeker (erm) and willamette (erw) was subjected to evaluation antioxidants and antitumour activities as a potential source of phenolics. some phenolic acids and flavonoids were identified and quantified by hplc. antioxidant activity was tested by measuring ability to scavenge dpph center dot and (oh)-o-center dot by esr spectroscopy. ic50dpph center dot varied from 0.67 for erm to 0.54 mg/ml for erw, while ic50 center dot oh values varied from 3.73 for erm to 1.23 mg/ml for erw. cytotoxic activity was investigated using in vivo model of ehrlich ascite carcinoma cells (eac) in mice. pretreatment with extracts exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against eac cells (up to 60%) and both extracts inhibited the tumour growth. activity of xanthine oxidase (xod) was extremely increased in pretreated animals, while the activity of enzyme complex glutathione reductase (gr) and glutathione peroxidase (gshpx) was significantly increased. this study suggests that raspberry pomace could be used as nutraceutic resource and functional food ingredient.
hypothyroidism	background: besides genetic factors, it is known that some trace elements, as selenium, copper, and zinc are essential for thyroid gland fuction and thyroid hormone metabolism. moreover, there were some metals effect that suggested patterns associated with overt thyroid disease. aim of study: hashimoto thyroiditis (ht), chronic autoimune inflamation of thyroid gland with cosequtive hipothyroidism, is common disease in serbia, and we thought it is worthwile to explore potential effects of essential and toxic metals and metalloides on thyroid function and ability to restore euthyroid status of them. results: this cross-sectional, case-control, study investigated the status of essential elements (selenium,copper,and zinc) and toxic metals and metalloides (al, cr, mn, co, as, cd, sb, ba, be, pb and ni) from the blood of 22 female, patients with hashimoto thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism, and compared it with those of 55 female healthy persons. we tried to establish the presence of any correlation between previous mentioned elements and thyroid function in hypothyroid patients and healthy participants. conclusions: the results of our study suggested that the blood concentration of essential trace elements, especially the ratio of copper, and selenium may influence directly thyroid function in patients with ht and overt hypothyroidism. thus, our findings may have implication to life-long substitution therapy in terms of l-thyroxine dose reduction. furthermore, for the first time, our study shown potential toxic effect of cadmium on thyroid function in ht patients, which may implicate the dose of l-thyroxine substitution.
heart_disease	the purpose of this study was to describe the level of integration of community health workers (chws) into missouri public healthcare systems using a cross-sectional survey research design. representatives of all missouri local public health agencies, rural health clinics, and federally qualified health centers were pre-contacted by telephone to provide the electronic mail of the most knowledgeable person in the facility/location to complete a brief electronic survey on their use of chws. 103 representatives of the 273 (37.7% response rate) contacted from the health systems completed the profile of community health workers in missouri health systems to assess role, professional development, and information needs of chws used in the key informants' agencies. an abridged survey was created for participants who responded to the survey but indicated that chws were not currently working for their organization. descriptive statistics and measures of central tendency were computed. only 16% (16/103) of participants noted that chws were employed in their organizations; and most chws connected people with services, served low-income and rural populations, and addressed heart disease issues. participants who did not currently employ chws indicated they did not anticipate needing them in the near future. of those utilizing chws, most perceived chws have a vital role in healthcare (m = 4.27/5.0, sd = 0.64) but securing sustainable funding for chws was challenging (m = 4.18/5.0, sd = 0.87). utilization of chws in missouri healthcare systems is limited. if their role in missouri healthcare systems is to expand, a campaign to educate on their role and value is needed.
low_testosterone	background. low serum testosterone (low t) has been repeatedly linked to worse outcomes in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (pc). how low t contributes to these outcomes is unknown. here we demonstrate that exposure to low t causes significant changes in the mouse prostate and prostate stem cells. methods. mice were castrated and implanted with capsules to achieve castrate, normal, or sub-physiological levels of t. after 6 weeks of treatment, lc-ms/ms was used to quantify the levels of t and dihydrotestosterone (dht) in serum and prostate tissue. facs was used to quantify the percentages of purported prostate stem and transit amplifying (ta) cells in mouse prostates. prostate tissues were also stained for the presence of cd68+ cells and rna was extracted from prostate tissue or specific cell populations to measure changes in transcript levels with low t treatment. results. despite having significantly different levels of t and dht in the serum, t and dht concentrations in prostate tissue from different t treatment groups were similar. low t treatment resulted in significant alterations in the expression of androgen biosynthesis genes, which may be related to maintaining prostate androgen levels. furthermore, the expression of androgen-regulated genes in the prostate was similar among all t treatment groups, demonstrating that the mouse prostate can maintain functional levels of androgens despite low serum t levels. low t increased the frequency of prostate stem and ta cells in adult prostate tissue and caused major transcriptional changes in those cells. gene ontology analysis suggested that low t caused inflammatory responses and immunofluorescent staining indicated that low t treatment led to the increased presence of cd68+ macrophages in prostate tissue. conclusions. low t alters the ar signaling axis which likely leads to maintenance of functional levels of prostate androgens. low t also induces quantitative and qualitative changes in prostate stem cells which appear to lead to inflammatory macrophage infiltration. these changes are proposed to lead to an aggressive phenotype once cancers develop and may contribute to the poor outcomes in men with low t.

sports_injuries	there are few detailed publications that allow performing associations between the technical aspects and the occurrence of injuries. the purpose of this study was to apply a methodology based in recording material to assess the injury risk factors. common nage-waza judo techniques during regular training of amateur judokas were used as a case study. novice students (n=193; 100 men and 93 women) from the university of vigo during five academic years (2003 to 2008) were filmed during the ordinary training period of the technical execution of ten nage-waza techniques. the obtained data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and t-patterns analysis. thus, it was possible to identify the presence of typical inaccuracies during execution of the technique uncovering the main temporal sequence of errors allowing us to link our findings with the injury occurrence. in order to narrow the unexpected causes of accidents regarding poor technique performance in regular training, this research provides the hidden temporal sequence of errors of common throw techniques, helping professionals to correct the key technical errors in order to prevent diverse type injuries. the methodology developed here could be easily extended to other martial sports.
hypothyroidism	studies suggest that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (sh) have sympathovagal imbalance, which could lead to a slower heart rate (hr) response in the transition from rest to exercise. thus the objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the hr kinetics in patients with sh during the transition from rest to exercise. the study included 18 sh women [thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) = 6.95 +/- 2.94 mu iu/ml and free thyroxine (ft4) = 0.96 +/- 0.15 ng/dl] and 17 euthyroid women (tsh = 2.28 +/- 0.84 mu iu/ml and ft4 = 0.98 +/- 0.07 ng/dl). both groups were matched for physical activity, menopausal status, and age. the hr kinetics was obtained during the course of a constant-load exercise (50 w), for 6 min, in a cycle ergometer, and quantified from the mean response time (mrt), which is equivalent to the time taken to reach 63% of the hr at steady state. sh patients showed slower hr kinetics than the control group (mrt = 48.5 +/- 17.6 vs. 36.0 +/- 10.3 s, p = 0.015). the mrt has been shown to correlate with the level of physical activity (r = -0.361; p = 0.033) and with the subjective perception of exertion at the end of the exercise (r = 0.365; p = 0.031). it is concluded that sh patients have slower hr kinetics in the transition from rest to exercise compared with euthyroid women, with this impairment being associated with lower levels of physical activity. new & noteworthy subclinical hypothyroidism patients have slower heart rate kinetics in the transition from rest to exercise when performing a constant-load exercise at 50 w.
myelofibrosis	a phase ii study (a2202) was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of jak inhibitor ruxolitinib in 63 chinese mf patients. ruxolitinib was given twice a day (bid) at a starting dose of 15 mg (n = 25) or 20 mg (n = 38) based on a baseline platelet count. about 94.7% of the patients achieved a reduction in spleen size, 27.0% of which exhibited significant reduction (>= 35%) at week 24. significant improvement in debilitating constitutional symptoms, as assessed by mfsaf v2.0, was observed in patients treated with ruxolitinib. ruxolitinib treatment was generally well tolerated by chinese patients. although the treatment was associated with an increase in certain adverse events (aes) that were established as identified risks (anemia and thrombocytopenia), these aes were considered manageable in this clinical setting. ruxolitinib provided substantial reductions in splenomegaly and improvements in symptoms, and was well-tolerated by chinese patients with mf.
skin_care	aim: this prospective study was designed to evaluate the tolerability and the efficacy of bi-weekly sox (s-1 and oxaliplatin)+cetaximab as first-line chemotherapy for wild-type k-ras metastatic colorectal cancer. patients and methods: we studied patients with previously untreated, unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer who were treated in our hospital between october 2010 and march 2013. their performance status (ps) was 0 to 1. cetuximab was combined with s-1 and oxaliplatin (sox+cetuximab). 51 was given orally at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) (40-60 mg, calculated according to body surface area) twice daily after meals for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest (course 1). oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) was given on days 1 and 15 of each course. cetuximab was administered on days 1 (400 mg/m(2)), 8 (250 mg/m2) and 15 (500 mg/m(2)) of course 1, followed by every 2 weeks (500 mg/m(2)) thereafter. results: the study group comprised of 18 patients. the mean age was 61 (range=32-72) years, the male:female ratio was 10:8 and the ps was 0 in 12 patients and 1 in 6 patients. the median number of administered courses was 6 (range=2-12). the treatment response was complete response (cr) in 2 and partial response (pr) in 10 (response rate=67% (12/18 patients)). the minimum number of treatment courses until a pr was 2, indicating an early response. liver resection was performed in 4 patients (22.2%). the incidence of any adverse events (grade 314) was 28% (5/18), including skin disorder (16.7%) as dry skin, cutaneous pruritus, contusion and pamnychia, as well as peripheral sensory neuropathy (11.1%). the any-grade events of skin disorders and peripheral sensory neuropathy were mostly observed in all patients. these events were controllable by preventive skin care and by withdrawal and close reduction, respectively. death due to adverse events was not observed. adverse events did not require the withdrawal of this regimen. conclusion: based on the 18 patients studied, combined therapy with sox+cetuximab was free of serious adverse events and could he safely administered by reducing the dose or temporarily suspending treatment, as required. these regimens seem to be promising for conversion therapy (4 out of 18 patients) because of good outcomes and an early response.
headache	background: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (rcvs) is a clinicoradiologic syndrome characterized by thunderclap headache and reversible multifocal arterial constrictions that resolves within 3 months. rcvs can be either spontaneous or related to a trigger; vasoactive drugs including over-the-counter medicine are common culprits. nevertheless, there are sparse data on the association of herbal supplements in the genesis of unexplained rcvs. methods: we describe a case of rcvs with a temporal association with the consumption of a diet pill composed of green tea, l-carnitine, and conjugated linoleic acid. we reviewed the literature describing rcvs cases associated with consumption of herbal supplements or plants. results: a 50-year-old black woman presented at the emergency room with a thunderclap headache less than 1 week after beginning a new herbal supplement with weight loss purpose. angiographic study revealed multiple arterial constriction of virtually all intracranial territories that were reversed 28 days later. the patient was discharged with minimal symptoms. from our review, we identified 5 previous reports of herbal product-related triggers. conclusions: different factors can trigger rcvs. besides our case, at least 5 other nutraceutical products were described to be associated with the disorders, 3 of them in patients without any other clear cause. clinicians should be aware of the possible role of herbal supplements in rcvs, and their use should be systematically assessed in large rcvs cohorts to clarify this association.
alzheimer's_disease	inhibition of ca2+ entry into the hippocampus and dorsal root ganglion (drg) through inhibition of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist drugs is the current standard of care in neuronal diseases such as alzheimer 's disease, dementia, and peripheral pain. oxidative stress activates ca2+-permeable trpm2 and trpv1, and recent studies indicate that selenium (se) is a potent trpm2 and trpv1 channel antagonist in the hippocampus and drg. in this study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of se in primary hippocampal and drg neuron cultures of aged rats when given alone or in combination with scopolamine (scop). thirty-two aged (18-24 months old) rats were divided into four groups. the first and second groups received a placebo and scop (1 mg/kg/day), respectively. the third and fourth groups received intraperitoneal se (1.5 mg/kg/ over day) and scop + se, respectively. the hippocampal and drg neurons also were stimulated in vitro with a trpv1 channel agonist (capsaicin) and a trpm2 channel agonist (cumene hydroperoxide). we found that se was fully effective in reversing scop-induced trpm2 and trpv1 current densities as well as errors in working memory and reference memory. in addition, se completely reduced scop-induced oxidative toxicity by modulating lipid peroxidation, reducing glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. the se and scop + se treatments also decreased poly (adp-ribose) polymerase activity, intracellular free ca2+ concentrations, apoptosis, and caspase 3, caspase 9, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization values in the hippocampus. in conclusion, the current study reports on the cellular level for scop and se on the different endocytotoxic cascades for the first time. notably, the research indicates that se can result in remarkable neuroprotective and memory impairment effects in the hippocampal neurons of rats.
parkinson's_disease	aims movement time analyzer (mta) is an objective instrument to evaluate the degree of motor impairment as well as to investigate the dopaminergic drug effect in parkinson 's disease patients. the aim of this study is to validate a new ecologic neuroimaging tool for quantifying mta-related hemodynamic response of the cortical motor system by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs). materials 11 right-handed healthy volunteers (six male and five female, age range 27-64 years) were studied with fnirs and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing mta task for each hand. results mta performance was better for the dominant hand and younger participants. both fnirs and fmri analyses revealed mta-related increase of haemoglobin levels in the primary motor and premotor cortices contralateral to the moving hand. this response progressively increased with aging. conclusion these findings supported the translation of fnirs-based mta behavioural tool in clinical practice.
heart_disease	background: our study was aimed to explore the clinical implication of chromosome microarray analysis (cma) in genetically etiological diagnosis of children with congenital heart disease (chd). methods: a total of 104 children with chd with or without multiple congenital anomalies (mca) or intellectual disabilities/developmental delay (id/dd) but normal karyotype were investigated using affymetrix cytoscan hd array. result: pathogenic copy number variations (pcnvs) were identified in 29 children (27.9%). the detection rates in children with simple chd and complex chd were 31.1% (19/61) and 23.2% (10/43), respectively. the detection rates of pcnvs were 17.9% (7/39), 20% (5/25), 63.2% (12/19) and 23.8% (5/21) in isolated chd, chd plus mca, chd plus id/dd, chd plus mca and id/dd, respectively. the pcnvs rate of chd plus id/dd was significantly higher than that of isolated chd. two genomic loci including 15q11.2 deletion and 1q43-q44 deletion were considered as chd locus. the dvl1, ski, stim1, ctnna3 and pln were identified as candidate genes associated with chd phenotypes. conclusion: cma can increase the diagnostic rate and improve the etiological diagnosis in children with chd. we suggest cma as a first-tier test in children with chd, especially in children with chd plus id/dd.
parkinson's_disease	an early and differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes still remains a challenge mainly due to the similarity of their symptoms during the onset of the disease. recently, f-18-desmethoxyfallypride (dmfp) has been suggested to increase the diagnostic precision as it is an effective radioligand that allows us to analyze post-synaptic dopamine d2/3 receptors. nevertheless, the analysis of these data is still poorly covered and its use limited. in order to address this challenge, this paper shows a novel model to automatically distinguish idiopathic parkinsonism from non-idiopathic variants using dmfp data. the proposed method is based on a multiple kernel support vector machine and uses the linear version of this classifier to identify some regions of interest: the olfactory bulb, thalamus, and supplementary motor area. we evaluated the proposed model for both, the binary separation of idiopathic and non-idiopathic parkinsonism and the multigroup separation of parkinsonian variants. these systems achieved accuracy rates higher than 70%, outperforming datscan neuroimages for this purpose. in addition, a system that combined datscan and dmfp data was assessed.
myelofibrosis	primary myelofibrosis (pmf) is rarely diagnosed in children, and in most cases in children younger than 3 years old. pediatric pmf generally follows a benign course and is usually managed supportively with blood transfusions and prophylactic antibiotics for infections. we present a case of a 17-year-old girl diagnosed with pmf at the age of 14 years. a computed tomography scan performed at the time of an appendectomy showed congenital asplenism. to our knowledge, this is only the third case of myelofibrosis and congenital asplenism to be reported in the literature. whether asplenism contributed to the development of myelofibrosis is not known.
alzheimer's_disease	cognitive training can allow patients with alzheimer 's disease (ad) to reinforce individual cognitive abilities. in the present case study, we investigated the generalizability of trained cognitive skills to novel tasks, and their stability over time.one ad patient underwent a structured cognitive training using the geo (geographical exercise for cognitive optimization) task, whereas eight ad patients underwent a control cognitive intervention. participants' performances on the geo task, on a similar untrained cognitive task, and on a different untrained cognitive task were recorded before and after the intervention, and at the follow-up. on both the trained and the similar untrained tasks patients' and controls' performance significantly differed from one another. our preliminary evidence shows that a cognitive training could allow patients to improve and maintain their performance not only on the trained task, but also on a similar task.
hepatitis_c	the conventional approach for designing vaccine against a particular disease involves stimulation of the immune system using the whole pathogen responsible for the disease. in the post-genomic era, a major challenge is to identify antigenic regions or epitopes that can stimulate different arms of the immune system. in the past two decades, numerous methods and databases have been developed for designing vaccine or immunotherapy against various pathogen-causing diseases. this review describes various computational resources important for designing subunit vaccines or epitope-based immunotherapy. first, different immunological databases are described that maintain epitopes, antigens and vaccine targets. this is followed by in silico tools used for predicting linear and conformational b-cell epitopes required for activating humoral immunity. finally, information on t-cell epitope prediction methods is provided that includes indirect methods like prediction of major histocompatibility complex and transporter-associated protein binders. different studies for validating the predicted epitopes are also examined critically. this review enlists novel in silico resources and tools available for predicting humoral and cell-mediated immune potential. these predicted epitopes could be used for designing epitope-based vaccines or immunotherapy as they may activate the adaptive immunity. authors emphasized the need to develop tools for the prediction of adjuvants to activate innate and adaptive immune system simultaneously. in addition, attention has also been given to novel prediction methods to predict general therapeutic properties of peptides like half-life, cytotoxicity and immune toxicity.
senior_health	context. prolonged use of benzodiazepines increases the risk of addiction. the impact of this disease on the use of health services by older adults is not known. objective. examine the association between benzodiazepine dependence and use of health services by older adults in quebec. methodology. the data comes from a survey conducted in quebec in 2005-2006 with a representative sample of 707 elderly benzodiazepine consumption in the community. benzodiazepine dependence was defined according to the criteria of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth revised edition. the use of health services as measured by the incidence of consultations with health professionals over a period of 12 months. results. seniors have consumed an average daily dose of 6.1 (+/- 7.6) mg diazepam equivalent to an average of 205 (+/- 130) days. the prevalence of benzodiazepine dependence has been estimated at 9.5%. this dependence increases the likelihood of consulting a specialist (odds ratio (or) = 3.42; confidence interval 95% (ci 95%) = 1.38 to 8.50). visits to other health professionals frontline were not significant. conclusion. the results of this study suggest that the proportion of seniors who become addicted to benzodiazepines and do not use health services for this condition is important. there is a need to develop programs to improve the quality of benzodiazepine use in this population.
parkinson's_disease	introduction: neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes have significant clinical and pathological overlap, making early diagnosis difficult. cerebrospinal fluid (csf) biomarkers may aid the differentiation of these disorders, but other than a-synuclein and neurofilament light chain protein, which have limited diagnostic power, specific protein biomarkers remain elusive. objectives: to study disease mechanisms and identify possible csf diagnostic biomarkers through discovery proteomics, which discriminate parkinsonian syndromes from healthy controls. methods: csf was collected consecutively from 134 participants; parkinson 's disease (n = 26), atypical parkinsonian syndromes (n = 78, including progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 36), multiple system atrophy (n = 28), corticobasal syndrome (n = 14)), and elderly healthy controls (n = 30). participants were divided into a discovery and a validation set for analysis. the samples were subjected to tryptic digestion, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for identification and relative quantification by isobaric labelling. candidate protein biomarkers were identified based on the relative abundances of the identified tryptic peptides. their predictive performance was evaluated by analysis of the validation set. results: 79 tryptic peptides, derived from 26 proteins were found to differ significantly between atypical parkinsonism patients and controls. they included acute phase/inflammatory markers and neuronal/synaptic markers, which were respectively increased or decreased in atypical parkinsonism, while their levels in pd subjects were intermediate between controls and atypical parkinsonism. conclusion: using an unbiased proteomic approach, proteins were identified that were able to differentiate atypical parkinsonian syndrome patients from healthy controls. our study indicates that markers that may reflect neuronal function and/or plasticity, such as the amyloid precursor protein, and inflammatory markers may hold future promise as candidate biomarkers in parkinsonism.

birth_control	background: oral misoprostol, administered by trained health-workers is effective and safe for preventing postpartum haemorrhage (pph). there is interest in expanding administration of misoprostol by non-health workers, including task-shifting to pregnant women themselves. however, the use of misoprostol for preventing pph in home-births remains controversial, due to the limited evidence to support self-administration or leaving it in the hands of non-health workers. this study aimed to determine if antenatally distributing misoprostol to pregnant women to self-administer at home birth reduces pph. methods: between february 2013 and march 2014, we conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in six health facilities in central uganda. women at 28+ weeks of gestation attending antenatal care were eligible. women in the control-arm received the standard-of-care; while the intervention-arm were offered 600mcg of misoprostol to swallow immediately after birth of baby, when oxytocin was not available. the primary outcome (pph) was a drop in postpartum maternal haemoglobin (hb) by >= 2g/dl, lower than the prenatal hb. analysis was by intention-to-treat at the cluster level and we used a paired t-tests to assess whether the mean difference between the control and intervention groups was statistically significant. results: 97% (2466/2545) of eligible women consented to participate; 1430 and 1036 in the control and intervention arms respectively. two thousand fifty-seven of the participants were successfully followed up and 271 (13.2 %) delivered outside a health facility. there was no significant difference between the study group in number of women who received a uterotonic at birth (control 80.4 % vs intervention 91.4 %, mean difference = -11.0 %, 95 % confidence interval [ci] -25.7 % to 3.6 %, p = 0.11). no woman took misoprostol before their baby 's birth. shivering and fever were 14.9 % in the control arm compared to 22.2 % in the intervention arm (mean difference = -7.2 %, 95 % ci -11.1 % to -3.7 %), p = 0.005). there was a slight, but non-significant, reduction in the percentage of women with hb drop >= 2g/dl from 18.5% in the control arm to 11.4 % in the intervention arm (mean difference = 7.1 %, 95% ci -3.1 % to 17.3 %, p = 0.14). similarly, there was no significant difference between the groups in the primary outcome in the women who delivered at home (control 9.6 % vs intervention 14.5 %, mean difference -4.9; 95 % ci -12.7 to 2.9), p = 0.17). conclusion: this study was unable to detect a significant reduction in pph following the antenatal distribution of misoprostol.
alzheimer's_disease	amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (nfts) in the brain are the neuropathological hallmarks of alzheimer 's disease (ad). amyloid plaques are composed of beta-amyloid peptides (a beta), while nfts contain hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. patients with familial ad who have mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (app) gene have either increased production of a beta or generate more aggregation-prone forms of a beta. the findings of familial ad mutations in the app gene suggest that a beta plays a central role in the pathophysiology of ad. a beta 42, composed of 42 amino acid residues, aggregates readily and is considered to form amyloid plaque. however, the processes of plaque formation are still not well known. it is generally thought that a beta is secreted into the extracellular space and aggregates to form amyloid plaques. a beta as extracellular aggregates and amyloid plaques are thought to be toxic to the surrounding neurons. the intraneuronal accumulation of a beta has more recently been demonstrated and is reported to be involved in synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and the formation of amyloid plaques in ad. we herein provide an overview of the process of the intraneuronal accumulation of a beta and plaque formation, and discuss its implications for the pathology, early diagnosis, and therapy of ad.
menopause	objective. epidemiological studies suggest that women with loss of ovarian function at early ages may be especially burdened by cardiovascular disease (cvd). in this study, we aimed to evaluate pulse wave velocity (pwv) and myocardial performance index (mpi) in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency (poi). design. we enrolled 51 female patients (mean age 38.9 +/- 6.7 years) with poi and 49 healthy subjects (mean age 36.8 +/- 5.2 years). all participants underwent a detailed echocardiographic examination and pwv measurement, which is basically the velocity of pulse wave travelling from carotid to femoral artery. results. both groups were similar with regard to age, body mass index (bmi) and left ventricular ejection fraction. when diastolic functions were assessed, patients with poi had higher mean e/e'ratio (9.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.6, p<0.001). poi patients have impaired mpi (0.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.2, p< 0.001) comparing to healthy controls but pwv measurements did not differ between two groups (5.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.6 m/s, p=0.48). conclusions. this study showed poi patients might have impaired global left ventricular functions comparing to age matched healthy controls and this might reflect the effects of premature lack of estrogen (e) on women 's cardiovascular (cv) system.
menopause	the objective of this studywas to explore the relationship between menopausal status and attitudes toward menopause and aging. we identified 1,400 bengali hindu women aged 40-55 years (early perimenopausal n = 445; late perimenopausal n = 240; early postmenopausal n = 285; late postmenopausal n = 430) from west bengal, india. information on attitudes toward menopause and aging was collected from march 2009 to july 2012 using ten agree/ disagree statements, of which three were positive, four were negative, and the restwere neutral. we used only the positive and negative statements in the analyses. the participants were given three response options for each statement: (1) agreed, (2) disagreed, and (3) felt neutral. agreement with positive statements and disagreement with negative statements were scored as 3. the converse responses were scored as 1. neutral responses were not scored. thus, the total attitude score for each participant ranged from 7 to 21. additionally, data on sociodemographic and reproductive variables, menopausal symptoms, and perceptions toward menopause were also collected. multivariable analyses (ancova) showed that postmenopausal women had more positive attitudes toward menopause and aging than perimenopausal women. providing balanced information about menopause and aging might help to foster positive attitudes toward menopause.
skin_care	the wound/burn guidelines committee consists of members commissioned by the board of directors of the japanese dermatological association (jda). it held several meetings and evaluations in writing since october 2008, and drafted five guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment including commentaries on wounds in general and the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment for pressure ulcers by taking opinions of the scientific committee and board of directors of jda into consideration.
cancer	objective: thrombocytosis is commonly observed in patients with solid tumors. this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of circulating pretreatment platelet count in a large series of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). methods: we retrospectively studied 824 patients with hnscc treated at a single institution from 2000 to 2012. disease-specific survival and local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survival were analyzed according to the distribution of the platelet count. results: by defining the platelet count 250.05 x 10(9)/l as a cut-off point with the best predictive capacity, we classified the patients into two groups: those with a high platelet count (n = 378, 45.9%), and those with a low platelet count (n = 446, 54.1%). on univariate analysis, there were significant differences in disease-specific survival depending on pretreatment platelet count (p = 0.001). the 5-year specific survival rates were 74.1% (ci 95%: 69.8-78.4%) and 61.6% (ci 95%: 56.4-66.8%) for patients with a low and high platelet count, respectively. according to the results of a multivariate analysis, patients with a high count of platelets had a tendency to a lower disease-specific survival, but the hazard ratio did not reach statistically significant differences (hr 1.24, ci 95%: 0.97-1.61, p = 0.085). conclusion: platelet count was significantly associated with survival in univariate analysis. however, in a multivariate analysis it lost its prognostic capacity, limiting its utility as a prognostic marker in patients with hnscc. considering separately each primary tumor location, patients with hypopharyngeal cancer and a high platelet count had a significant decrease of disease-specific survival.

cancer	the risk of scalp metastases in patients using scalp cooling for preservation of hair during chemotherapy has been a concern but is poorly described. a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies was undertaken to evaluate the effect of scalp cooling versus no scalp cooling on the risk of scalp metastasis in patients treated for breast cancer with chemotherapy. electronic databases, journal specific, and hand searches of articles identified were searched. patients were matched based on disease, treatment, lack of metastatic disease, and sex. a total of 24 full-text articles were identified for review. of these articles, ten quantified the incidence of scalp metastasis with scalp cooling over time. for scalp cooling, 1959 patients were evaluated over an estimated mean time frame of 43.1 months. for no scalp cooling, 1238 patients were evaluated over an estimated mean time frame of 87.4 months. the incidence rate of scalp metastasis in the scalp cooling group versus the no scalp cooling group was 0.61% (95% ci 0.32-1.1%) versus 0.41% (95% ci 0.13-0.94%); p = 0.43. the incidence of scalp metastases was low regardless of scalp cooling. this analysis suggests that scalp cooling does not increase the incidence of scalp metastases.
polycythemia_vera	myelofibrosis (mf) and polycythemia vera (pv) are bcr-abl1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with somatic hematopoietic stem cell mutations leading to over activation of jak-stat signaling. mf and pv are pathogenically related and share specific clinical features such as splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. the mf phenotype is dominated by the effects of progressive bone marrow fibrosis resulting in shortened survival. in contrast, elevated thrombosis risk due to erythrocytosis is the primary clinical concern in pv. ruxolitinib, an oral jak1/jak2 inhibitor, is approved in the usa for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk mf and patients with pv who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. for mf, results of two phase iii studies demonstrated that ruxolitinib therapy reduced spleen volume and mf-related symptom burden, improved quality-of-life measures, and was associated with prolonged overall survival. treatment benefits were generally sustained with continued therapy. dose-dependent cytopenias were common but generally manageable with transfusions (for anemia), dose reduction, or treatment interruption. optimal dosing management is critical to maintain long-term treatment benefit, because cessation of therapy resulted in rapid return of symptoms to baseline levels. results of the phase iii pv trial showed that ruxolitinib was significantly more effective than standard therapy in controlling hematocrit levels and improving splenomegaly and pv-related symptoms. only 1 of 110 patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared with 6 of 112 patients in the control arm experienced a thromboembolic event through week 32. grade a parts per thousand yen3 cytopenias were uncommon.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundstigma is associated with many negative health outcomes. research has examined perceived and internalized stigma in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), but less has been done to evaluate levels of enacted stigma associated with these conditions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of enacted stigma toward ibs and ibd in the general population compared to an adult-onset asthma (aoa) control group. methodsparticipants were recruited via social media and a research-dedicated website and completed all measures online. participants were randomized to one of six clinical vignettes: (i) ibd male, (ii) ibd female, (iii) ibs male, (iv) ibs female, (v) aoa male, or (vi) aoa female. participants read the assigned vignette and then completed measures of emotional empathy, level of familiarity, and enacted stigma. key resultsparticipants reported higher levels of enacted stigma toward ibs compared to both ibd and aoa. no differences in stigma were found between ibd and aoa. higher levels of familiarity were most strongly correlated with reduced ibd-related stigma, with weaker but still significant correlations between level of familiarity and ibs and aoa. higher levels of emotional empathy were associated with reduced stigma for ibd, ibs, and aoa. conclusions & inferencesindividuals with ibs experience greater levels of enacted stigma compared to ibd and aoa. this finding is consistent with previous research that has shown greater levels of perceived and internalized stigma in ibs compared to ibd.
allergies	secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) is one important line of defense in the intestinal mucosal surface to protect the intestinal epithelium from enteric toxins and pathogenic microorganisms. multiple factors, such as intestinal microbiota, intestinal cytokines, and nutrients are highly involved in production of siga in the intestine. recently, glutamine has been shown to affect intestinal siga production; however, the underlying mechanism by which glutamine stimulates secretion of intestinal siga is unknown. here, we review current knowledge regarding glutamine in intestinal immunity and show that glutamine-enhanced secretion of siga in the intestine may involve intestinal microbiota, intestinal antigen sampling and presentation, induction pathways for siga production by plasma cells (both t-dependent and t-independent pathway), and even transport of siga. altogether, the glutamine-intestinal siga axis has broad therapeutic implications for intestinal siga-associated diseases, such as celiac disease, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease.
skin_care	cos-g-pvcl copolymer was synthesized and infiltrated into caco3 particles to prepare thermosensitive porous microgels which exhibited phase transition behavior at the temperature that was similar to the lower critical solution temperature(lcst) of copolymer. the incorporation of microgel to cotton was done by pad-dry-cure method from aqueous microparticle dispersion that contained citric acid as a crosslinking agent. in vitro drug release experiments were performed at two different temperatures (25 and 37 degrees c) in pbs of ph 7.4 to study its drug release behavior with response to temperature. due to the shrinkage of microgels, drug release profiles obtained were found to have enhanced release for aloin when the temperature was above lcst than other release conditions. microgel-loaded fabrics proved to be in vivo biocompatible by skin irritation studies and displayed an obviously high water vapor permeability at 40 degrees c. the mtt assay showed no obvious cytotoxicity of microgel-loaded cotton against mouse fibroblast cells within 5 days. the results obtained demonstrated the potential use of the thermos-responsive microgel-loaded cotton fabrics as a textile-based drug delivery system for treating sunburn or skin care.

skin_care	background/purposewashing the face with a mild cleanser is generally recommended for acne care. occasionally, the general public has the misconception that acne is exacerbated by cleansers and furthermore it has concerns about inducing skin irritation and xerosis by intensive washing. recently, we developed a new cleanser based on sodium laureth carboxylate and alkyl carboxylates (aec/soap) that cleans sebum well without penetrating the stratum corneum. methodswe designed a controlled clinical trial conducted on adult japanese males with moderate or less acne. twenty subjects washed their faces with aec/soap base cleanser twice a day for 4weeks. assessment of the efficacy was conducted prior to the start of the study, and at the end of weeks 2 and 4. resultssignificant improvement of the acne was observed within 2weeks, and acne lesions were not detectable in 25% of the subjects at week 4. sebum secretion levels on the skin significantly increased on the forehead, but significantly decreased on the cheek which correlated with the improvement. no complaints of dryness or irritation occurred during the study. conclusionwashing the face twice a day with facial cleanser based on aec/soap is an effective care for moderate or less grade facial acne.
weight_loss	obesity and chronic kidney disease (ckd) are public health priorities that share core pathophysiological mechanisms. however, whether high body mass index (bmi) increases risk of ckd de novo remains ill-defined. to evaluate the role of bmi in predicting ckd onset in the general adult population, we performed a systematic review and meta analysis of pubmed and isi web of science databases articles published between january 2000 and august 2016 without language restriction. we selected studies in adult individuals from a general population with normal renal function at baseline that reported the risk of low estimated glomerular filtration (egfr) (under 60 ml/min/1.73m(2)) and/or albuminuria (1 + at dipstick or an albumin creatinine ratio of 3.4 mg/mmol or more) as hazard ratio, odds ratio or relative risk related to obesity, overweight, or bmi as continuous value. a total of 39 cohorts covering 630, 677 participants with a mean follow-up of 6.8 years were selected. obesity increased the relative risk, 95% confidence interval and heterogeneity (i-2) of developing low egfr (1.28, 1.07-1.54, [i-2: 95.0%]) and albuminuria (1.51, 1.36-1.67, [i-2: 62.7%]). increase of bmi unit was also associated with higher risk of low egfr (1.02, 1.01-1.03, [i-2: 24.3%]) and albuminuria (1.02, 1.00-1.04, [i-2: 0%]). conversely, overweight did not predict onset of either low egfr (1.06, 0.94-1.21, [i-2: 50.0%]) or albuminuria (1.24, 0.98-1.58, [i-2: 49.4%]). thus, a high bmi predicts onset of albuminuria without kidney failure (ckd stages 1-2) as well as ckd stages 3 and higher, the effect being significant only in obese individuals. hence, our findings may have implications to improve risk stratification and recommendations on body weight control in the general population.
heart_disease	environmental enteropathy (ee) is a syndrome of altered small intestine structure and function hypothesized to be common among individuals lacking access to improved water and sanitation. there are plausible biological mechanisms, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory, by which ee may alter the cardiometabolic profile. here, we test the hypothesis that ee is associated with the cardiometabolic profile among young children living in an environment of intense enteropathogen exposure. in total, 156 children participating in the peruvian cohort of a multicenter study on childhood infectious diseases, growth and development were contacted at 3-5 years of age. the urinary lactulose:mannitol ratio, and plasma antibody to endotoxin core were determined in order to assess intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation. blood pressure, anthropometry, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and cholesterol and apolipoprotein profiles were also assessed. extant cohort data were also used to relate biomarkers of ee during the first 18 months of life to early child cardiometabolic profile. lower intestinal surface area, as assessed by percent mannitol excretion, was associated with lower apolipoprotein-ai and lower high-density lipoprotein concentrations. lower intestinal surface area was also associated with greater blood pressure. inflammation at 7 months of age was associated with higher blood pressure in later childhood. this study supports the potential for a relationship between ee and the cardiometabolic profile.
diabetes	background: the development of disturbances in skin microcirculation in type 1 diabetes is not well characterised. we assessed skin microcirculation longitudinally from the onset of diabetes up to 29 years of duration to investigate when such disturbances start. material and methods: seventeen adult patients with type 1 diabetes participated. skin microvascular function in digit iv of the left hand was investigated by laser doppler fluxmetry (ldf, arbitrary units [au]). ldf was carried out at rest and following one-min arterial occlusion. time to peak ldf (s) and percentage increase of ldf (post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia, prh%) were determined. retinopathy was assessed from fundus photographs or ophthalmoscopic recordings. results: skin microvascular function remained normal during the first five years. compared with baseline and a non-diabetic reference group, time to peak ldf was prolonged after 7-9 years of diabetes (p < 0.01). prh% was lower than in the reference group after 7-9 years (p < 0.01), and lower than baseline after 24-29 years of diabetes (p < 0.05). all but one patient developed retinopathy and the first signs were found after 10 years of diabetes. conclusions: functional disturbances in total skin microcirculation were observed after seven years in patients with type 1 diabetes and preceded diabetic complications such as retinopathy.
weight_loss	tubercular dactylitis is a rare manifestation of skeletal tuberculosis in the paediatric population. its clinical diagnosis is often delayed as local symptoms may easily be missed in children and constitutional features such as loss of weight, loss of appetite, night sweats, evening rise of temperature and history of close contact with a patient of tuberculosis may not always be present. parents seek treatment only when they notice significant swelling or tenderness of fingers or hand in their children. radiology and fine-needle aspiration cytology may help in establishing an early diagnosis. astute multidrug antitubercular therapy is curative.
sprains_and_strains	the aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of different types of injury on the risk for disability retirement among economically active people in denmark. material and methods: in this prospective study, all people in the danish labour force aged 21-54 years 1 january 1997 (n = 2 211 057) were followed for disability retirement during 1997-2001. age and gender standardised incidence ratios (sir) were calculated to compare retirement rates among those who received treatment for an injury during 1996 (n = 252 468, including both work-related and non-work related types) with the rates in the total labour force. life-table methodology was used to calculate years of lost economically active life (yleal) by injury type. results: among the injured people we observed a total number of 5580 cases of subsequent disability retirement and 45% of these could be statistically attributed to the injury. the sir for disability retirement by injury type ranged from 1.38 to 7.00. the least severe types, superficial injuries and dislocations, sprains, and strains, were most prevalent and generated the highest numbers of yleals. conclusion: the high frequency of injuries and their influence on retirement rates suggest that injury prevention is a highly relevant approach to reduce future costs from disability retirement. yleal calculations can be used to set priorities.
low_testosterone	background: testosterone deficiency in patients with heart failure (hf) is associated with decreased exercise capacity and mortality; however, its impact on hospital readmission rate is uncertain. furthermore, the relationship between testosterone deficiency and sympathetic activation is unknown. objective: we investigated the role of testosterone level on hospital readmission and mortality rates as well as sympathetic nerve activity in patients with hf. methods: total testosterone (tt) and free testosterone (ft) were measured in 110 hospitalized male patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 45% and new york heart association classification iv. the patients were placed into low testosterone (lt; n = 66) and normal testosterone (nt; n = 44) groups. hypogonadism was defined as tt < 300 ng/dl and ft < 131 pmol/l. muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) was recorded by microneurography in a subpopulation of 27 patients. results: length of hospital stay was longer in the lt group compared to in the nt group (37 +/- 4 vs. 25 +/- 4 days; p = 0.008). similarly, the cumulative hazard of readmission within 1 year was greater in the lt group compared to in the nt group (44% vs. 22%, p = 0.001). in the single-predictor analysis, tt (hazard ratio [hr], 2.77; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.58-4.85; p = 0.02) predicted hospital readmission within 90 days. in addition, tt (hr, 4.65; 95% ci, 2.67-8.10; p = 0.009) and readmission within 90 days (hr, 3.27; 95% ci, 1.23-8.69; p = 0.02) predicted increased mortality. neurohumoral activation, as estimated by msna, was significantly higher in the lt group compared to in the nt group (65 +/- 3 vs. 51 +/- 4 bursts/100 heart beats; p < 0.001). conclusion: these results support the concept that lt is an independent risk factor for hospital readmission within 90 days and increased mortality in patients with hf. furthermore, increased msna was observed in patients with lt.
hypothyroidism	hypo- and hyperthyroidism have effects on brain structure and function, as well as cognitive processes, including memory. however, little is known about the influence of thyroid hormones on brain perfusion and the relationship of such perfusion changes with cognition. the present study aimed to demonstrate the effect of short-term experimental hyperthyroidism on brain perfusion in healthy volunteers and to assess whether perfusion changes, if present, are related to cognitive performance. it is known that an interaction exists between brain perfusion and cerebral oxygen consumption rate and it is considered that neural activation increases cerebral regional perfusion rate in brain areas associated with memory. measuring cerebral blood flow may therefore represent a proxy for neural activity. therefore, arterial spin labelling (asl) measurements were conducted and later analysed to evaluate brain perfusion in 29 healthy men before and after ingesting thyroid hormones for 8 weeks. psychological tests concerning memory were performed at the same time-points and the results were correlated with the imaging results. in the hyperthyroid condition, perfusion was increased in the posterior cerebellum in regions connected with cerebral networks associated with cognitive control and the visual cortex compared to the euthyroid condition. in addition, these perfusion changes were positively correlated with changes of performance in the german version of the auditory verbal learning task [avlt, verbaler lern-und-merkfahigkeits-test (vlmt)]. cerebellar perfusion and function therefore appears to be modulated by thyroid hormones, likely because the cerebellum hosts a high number of thyroid hormone receptors.
weight_loss	data in the literature regarding the care pathway of pancreatic cancer patients are limited. the objective of the repere survey was to identify and describe the initial stages of the care pathway of pancreatic patients in the metastatic phase. from may to october 2015, 62 oncologists (on) or gastroenterologists specialized in digestive oncology (gesdo) and 300 general practitioners (gp) completed an electronic questionnaire on the pathway of 728 patients recently diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. of these patients, 200 completed a questionnaire given by a specialized physician (on/gesdo). weight loss (65%), fatigue (53%) or anorexia (49%) were the main signs/symptoms that motivated the patients to seek medical advice. for 87% of patients, the general practitioner was the first medicine doctor they consulted. according to the respondents (patient, general practitioner or specialist), the median delay between the onset of the first symptoms and the final diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was between 41 and 65 days. this time lapse tended to decrease with associated jaundice (-15 days on average, standard deviation = 8, p < 0.1 ns) or with patient concerns triggered by the first symptoms (-11 days on average, standard deviation = 6, p < 0.05). on the contrary, the time lapse was longer (+14 days on average, standard deviation = 6, p < 0.05) when the general practitioner prescribed symptomatic treatment. in conclusion, diagnostic management of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer should be accelerated with efforts to raise practitioners' awareness.
hepatitis_c	since the establishment of people 's republic of china in 1949, the chinese government has encountered several catastrophes related to transfusion transmitted diseases. the government 's increasing attention to blood safety has prompted the initiation of a series of policies and measures that have enhanced the level of safety for the blood supply and met the basic clinical demands of blood for 1.3 billion people in the country. blood donation screening strategies in china predominantly comprise donor screening and donor testing. donor screening includes selection of low-risk blood donors by the use of a donor history questionnaire, predonation physical examination, and initial rapid donor testing. donor testing includes direct pathogen detection and serology tests. the year 1998 marked the most transformative change in blood donor selection and screening policies in china. before 1998, paid donation was the predominant mode of blood donation. donor screening and donor testing were conducted before donation, and only those who were eligible were allowed to donate. to ensure the safety of blood, donor testing was performed again after donation. after the implementation of the blood donation law in 1998, to promote voluntary and unpaid donation, predonation donor testing was eliminated to reduce the amount of waiting time and to provide a more convenient donation experience for blood donors. however, it is the national requirement that donated blood should undergo 2 rounds of testing using different equipment or reagents, conducted by different personnel. donor selection has transitioned from paid donation and obligatory donation to voluntary donation with fixed volunteer groups, as the latter mode of donation provides the lowest risks. donations are currently screened for syphilis, hepatitis c virus, hiv, and hepatitis b virus (hbv). units, previously typed only for abo, are now routinely tested for both abo and rh(d). innovations in testing technologies and methods have also brought changes to screening parameters. for instance, screening for hbv pathogens evolved from the early use of hemagglutination method to the later use of radioimmunoassay, independent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and now the widespread application of nucleic acid test (nat). since 2010, the chinese government has established nat capacity in several blood centers; and in 2015, the government invested 900 million rmb on the nationwide expansion of nat. although the chinese government has worked to enhance blood safety, many challenges remain. concern exists for rising rates of hiv infection. the existence of occult hbv infection and the transmission of emerging blood-borne diseases continue to challenge the safety of the blood supply.

cancer	this is the first study to assess global methylation, oxidative dna damage, and lipid peroxidation in workers with occupational exposure to metal oxide nanomaterials (nms). urinary and white blood cell (wbc) 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg), and exhaled breath condensate (ebc) 8-isoprostane were measured as oxidative stress biomarkers. wbc global methylation was measured as an epigenetic alteration. exposure to tio2, sio2, and indium tin oxide (ito) resulted in significantly higher oxidative biomarkers such as urinary 8-ohdg and ebc 8-isoprostane. however, significantly higher wbc 8-ohdg and lower global methylation were only observed in ito handling workers. significant positive correlations were noted between wbc and urinary 8-ohdg (spearman correlation r = 0.256, p = 0.003). furthermore, a significant negative correlation was found between wbc 8-ohdg and global methylation (r=-0.272, p = 0.002). these results suggest that exposure to metal oxide nms may lead to global methylation, dna oxidative damage, and lipid peroxidation.

parkinson's_disease	objectivesthe mini-bestest consists of items relevant to balance deficiencies among people with parkinson 's disease (pwpd). however, the mini-bestest 's construct validity has been sparsely evaluated in this population. we therefore aimed to investigate the hypotheses that the mini-bestest results would be worse among: (i) pwpd compared to healthy controls; (ii) pwpd with moderate compared to mild motor severity; (iii) pwpd with a history of recurrent compared to non-recurrent falls. moreover, the relationship between the mini-bestest and tests of similar and different constructs was expected to be moderate to strong and poor, respectively. materials and methodsone hundred and five pwpd with mild-to-moderate motor severity and 47 healthy controls were included. pwpd were divided into subgroups based on motor severity and fall history. main outcome measures were the mini-bestest, the timed up and go (tug), and the original unified parkinson 's disease rating scale, part ii (activities of daily living). independent t-tests and spearman 's rho were used for the analyses. resultsthe mini-bestest results were worse among pwpd compared to controls (p<.001), and among people with moderate motor severity compared to those with mild severity (p<.001). however, no differences were found between recurrent and non-recurrent fallers (p=.096). spearman 's rho showed moderate (=-.470) and poor correlations (=-.211) for convergent (tug) and divergent validity (updrs, part ii), respectively. conclusionsoverall, the mini-bestest appears to adequately measure dynamic balance among pwpd with mild-to-moderate severity, although it was unable to distinguish between recurrent and non-recurrent fallers.
diabetes	background: as of 2013, 65% of the world 's population lived in countries where overweight/obesity kills more people than being underweight. evolutionary perspectives provide a holistic understanding of both how and why obesity develops and its long-term implications. aim: to test whether the maternal capital hypothesis, an evolutionary perspective, is viable for explaining the development of obesity in adulthood. subjects and methods: restricted-use data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent health (add health; n=11403) was analysed using logistic regressions. the sample included adolescents and their biological mothers. results: the odds of obesity in adulthood increased by 22% for every standard deviation increase in lack of maternal capital (exp (b) = 1.22, p < .001). that is, individuals whose mothers were young, of an ethnic minority and had short breastfeeding durations were more likely to be obese in adulthood, even after controlling for other factors in infancy, adolescence and adulthood. the results showed that those whose mothers had lower capital were more prone to later life disease (specifically, obesity). conclusion: the maternal capital perspective is useful for explaining how and why early life characteristics (including maternal resources) predict obesity in adulthood. implications of the findings are discussed.
fungal_infection	endosomal sensing represents a key strategy by which mammalian cells detect parasitization by invading pathogens. this is critical for the control of fungal pathogens, which are for the most part phagocytosed by effector cells of the innate immune system. despite rapid overall progress in our understanding of endosomal responses in recent times, relatively little is known about how the endosomal sensing system detects fungi and the ensuing immunological consequences. considering that many fungal pathogens must overcome and evade endosomal killing in order to survive in the host, understanding this key area of the early innate response is crucial for our understanding of fungal infection. in this review we present a summary of our current knowledge of endosomal sensing within the context of fungal pathogens, with a focus on the myeloid compartment.
heart_disease	purpose: to investigate alterations of mitochondria in irradiated endothelial cells to further elucidate the mechanism underlying radiation-induced heart disease.materials and methods: experiments were performed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs). huvecs were irradiated with single gamma ray dose of 0, 5, 10 and 20gy, respectively. apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry at 24, 48 and 72h post-irradiation, respectively. the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) was measured with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (dcfh-da) at 24h post-irradiation. mitochondrial membrane potential (m) by jc-1 and the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp) by a calcein-cobalt quenching method were detected at 24h post-irradiation in order to measure changes of mitochondria induced by gamma ray irradiation.results: gamma ray irradiation increased huvecs apoptosis in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. irradiation also promoted ros production in huvecs in a dose-dependent manner. at 24h post-irradiation, the results showed that irradiation decreases m, however, paradoxically, flow cytometry showed green fluorescence instensity higher in irradiated huvecs than in control huvecs in an irradiation dose-dependent manner which indicated gamma ray irradiation inhibited mptp opening in huvecs.conclusions: gamma ray irradiation induces apoptosis and ros production of endothelial cells, and decreases m meanwhile contradictorily inhibiting the opening of mptp.
hepatitis_c	introduction growing evidence suggests that multiple factors, such as insulin resistance, nutritional factors, gut microbiota, and hormones released from the adipose tissue, act together on genetically predisposed individuals. we aimed to investigate whether various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) play a role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) and severity of liver damage in the anatolian population. methods two hundred and sixteen patients with biopsy-proven nafld and 150 control participants, aged 18-70 years, were consecutively enrolled in this multicenter study. blood samples were genotyped for the pnpla3 (rs738409), il28b (rs12979860, rs12980275, rs8099917), ppar- 227 ala, ppar- pro 12 ala, sod2 c47t, and lox-1 ivs4-14 polymorphisms using the custom-made lightsnip assays on a lightcycler 480 ii instrument. results genotypic distributions of pnpla3 rs738409 snps were different between nafld and control participants, but not for other snps. the pnpla3 rs738409 gg polymorphism was associated with a 27-fold increased risk of development of nafld (odds ratio=27.8, 95% confidence interval: 3.5-218.4; p=0.002). patients with the pnpla3 gg genotype had higher nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score levels compared with patients with the pnpla3 cc genotype (p<0.005). nafld patients without fibrosis had a higher frequency of il28b rs12979860 tt and rs12980275 gg genotypes compared with nafld patients with fibrosis (p<0.005). conclusion the present study proposes that polymorphisms in the pnpla3 gene have highly predictive value in the development of nafld and are independently associated with the severity of liver histology in patients with nafld. the results of this study suggest that il28b rs12979860 tt or rs12980275 gg may play an important protective role against the development of advanced fibrosis and even cirrhosis. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
hypothyroidism	to compare thyroid hormone levels between septicemic preterm neonates with and without shock. preterm septicemic infants with shock constituted group a (n=36) and those without shock constituted group b, with groups matched (1:1) for gestation and postnatal age. those with maternal thyroid disorders, thyrotropic medication and life expectancy < 12 hours were excluded. we compared serum tri-iodothyronine (t3), thyroxine (t4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) between the groups by univariate and multivariate (adjusting for snappe-ii) analysis. median (iqr) tsh was significantly lower in group a [1.39 (0.83,3.48)] vs group b [5.1 (2.32,7.19)] mmol/dl (p < 0.001). serum t3 and t4 were also lower in group a (p < 0.001). on multivariate analysis, none of these measures were independently associated with septic shock. thyroid hormone levels do not independently predict presence of shock among septic preterms.
multiple_sclerosis	multiple sclerosis (ms), a leading neurological disorder of young adults, is characterized by the loss of oligodendrocytes (ols), demyelination, inflammation and neuronal degeneration. here we show that dynamin-related protein 1 (drpl), a mitochondrial fission protein, is activated in primary ol cells exposed to tnf-alpha induced inflammation or oxidative stress, as well as in eae-immunized and cuprizone toxicity-induced demyelinating mouse models. inhibition of drp1 hyper-activation by the selective inhibitor p110 abolishes drpl translocation to the mitochondria, reduces mitochondrial fragmentation and stems necrosis in primary ols exposed to tnf-a and h2o2. notably, in both types of mouse models, treatment with p110 significantly reduces the loss of mature ols and demyelination, attenuates the number of active microglial cells and astrocytes, yet has no effect on the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. drpl activation appears to be mediated through the ripk1/ripic3/mlkl/pgam5 pathway during tnf-alpha-induced oligodendroglia necroptosis. our results demonstrate a critical role of drp1 hyper-activation in ol cell death and suggest that an inhibitor of drpl hyper-activation such as p110 is worth exploring for its ability to halt or slow the progression of ms.

skin_care	background/purpose: to examine psoriasis or atopic eczema, analyzing skin roughness by palpation is essential to precisely diagnose skin diseases. however, optical sensor based skin imaging systems do not allow dermatologists to touch skin images. to solve the problem, a new haptic rendering technology that can accurately display skin roughness must be developed. in addition, the rendering algorithm must be able to filter spatial noises created during 2d to 3d image conversion without losing the original roughness on the skin image. in this study, a perceptual way to design a noise filter that will remove spatial noises and in the meantime recover maximized roughness is introduced by understanding human sensitivity on surface roughness. methods: a visuohaptic rendering system that can provide a user with seeing and touching digital skin surface roughness has been developed including a geometric roughness estimation method from a meshed surface. in following, a psychophysical experiment was designed and conducted with 12 human subjects to measure human perception with the developed visual and haptic interfaces to examine surface roughness. results: from the psychophysical experiment, it was found that touch is more sensitive at lower surface roughness, and vice versa. human perception with both senses, vision and touch, becomes less sensitive to surface distortions as roughness increases. when interact with both channels, visual and haptic interfaces, the performance to detect abnormalities on roughness is greatly improved by sensory integration with the developed visuohaptic rendering system. conclusion: the result can be used as a guideline to design a noise filter that can perceptually remove spatial noises while recover maximized roughness values from a digital skin image obtained by optical sensors. in addition, the result also confirms that the developed visuohaptic rendering system can help dermatologists or skin care professionals examine skin conditions by using vision and touch at the same time.
low_testosterone	objective: the aim of this study was to determine the sociodemographic parameters and hormonal profile of infertile man. patients and methods: we included in our study, all patients presenting with infertility dating back at least two years, with abnormal semen analysis. these patients came to radio immunological laboratory assays for determination of fsh, lh, prl and testosterone in the assessment of infertility. results: the age of the patients ranged from 25 years to 64 years with an average age of 44.5 years. employees are the most represented with a frequency of 63.93%, with 54.41% had consulted a primary infertility, followed by traders in 15.63% and 70% for primary infertility. the hormonal assessment was abnormal in 86% of cases (55/64). a rise in fsh was observed in 36% of patients, the lh was elevated in 31.25% of patients, 48.44% in prl. 12 patients (18.75%) had low testosterone among the endocrinopathies suspected, the hypogonadism hypergonadotrophic is the most represented with a frequency of 32.8%, testicular deficiencies are found in 12.5% of cases, hypogonadism hypogonadotrophic in 10.93% of cases, hyperprolactinemia isolated in 18.75% of cases and obstructive causes in 14 04% of cases. conclusion: there are many endocrinopathies that can induce male infertility. they can be congenital or acquired and can concern several stages, hypothalamus, pituitary and testis. it 's important to diagnose thoses endocrinopathies, because some of them are accessible to treatment.

multiple_sclerosis	objective: to investigate the influence of vestibular function on dynamic postural stability assessed by the functional reach test (frt) and the timed up and go test (tug). study design: retrospective study. setting: tertiary referral center. subjects and methods: the frt and tug were performed in 399 patients with dizziness. the effects of peripheral vestibular dysfunction assessed by the caloric test and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cvemps) to airconducted sound (500 hz, tone burst) on the results of frt and tug were analyzed. results: neither frt nor tug scores showed significant differences in relation to the results of the caloric test (p >.3). the frt scores in patients who showed abnormal cvemp responses on both sides were significantly smaller than those in patients who showed normal cvemp responses (p <.01). the tug scores in patients who showed abnormal cvemp responses on both sides were significantly greater than those in patients who showed normal cvemp responses (p <.05). conclusion: the vestibulo-spinal reflex mediated by the saccule and its afferents is one of the factors that influence the maintenance of dynamic postural stability as measured by frt and tug.
cancer	in mexico, childhood cancer incidence and mortality have increased in the last decade. through government actions since 2005, the popular medical insurance (pmi) program for childhood cancer was created. the objective of pmi was to offer early cancer diagnosis, standardized treatment regimens, and numerous pediatric oncology residency programs. it has also accredited 55 national hospitals for the care of these children. current problems still present under the pmi include shortage of pediatric oncologists and nurses and high rate of abandonment of treatment. our aim is to describe the current scenario of childhood cancer care in mexico, especially from the perspective of the pmi and how it has impacted human resources, infrastructure, and medical education.
sports_injuries	the lower jaw is frequently exposed to fracture, by accidents, violence, accidental falls, sports injuries, pathological fracture, etc. we have investigated the behaviour of mandibular bone in a particular clinical case of fracture, in which we experimentally applied two osteosynthesis plates and analyzed the effects of occlusal loading on the fracture line by finite element method. we observed that in this case, maximum deformations occur in the mandibular condyles and the maximum and minimum normal stresses occur in the osteosynthesis plates. even if bite and mastication determine important efforts on osteosynthesis plates, titanium alloy supports well these loads, and, as an important aspect, the bone parts during healing are not the object of excessive mechanical loads.
headache	objective.-to evaluate the relationships among modifiable psychological factors and chronic migraine and severe migraine-related disability in a clinic-based sample of persons with migraine. background.-evidence evaluating relationships between modifiable psychological factors and chronic migraine and severe migraine-related disability is lacking in people with migraine presenting for routine clinical care. methods.-adults with migraine completed surveys during routinely scheduled visits to a tertiary headache center. participants completed surveys assessing chronic migraine (meeting criteria for migraine with >= 15 headache days in the past month), severe migraine disability (migraine disability assessment scale score >= 21), and modifiable psychological factors (depressive symptoms [patient health questionnaire-9], anxious symptoms [generalized anxiety disorder-7], pain catastrophizing scale and headache specific locus of control). logistic regression evaluated relationships between modifiable psychological factors and chronic migraine and severe migraine disability. results.-among 90 eligible participants the mean age was 45.0 (sd = 12.4); 84.8% were women. one-third (36.0%) met study criteria for chronic migraine; half of participants (51.5%) reported severe migraine-related disability. higher depressive symptoms (or = 1.99, 95% ci = 1.11, 3.55) and chance hslc (or = 1.85, 95% ci = 1.13, 1.43) were associated with chronic migraine. higher depressive symptoms (or = 3.54, 95% ci = 1.49, 8.41), anxiety symptoms (or = 3.65, 95% ci = 1.65, 8.06), and pain catastrophizing (or = 1.95, 95% ci = 1.14, 3.35), were associated with severe migraine-related disability. conclusions.-psychiatric symptoms and pain catastrophizing were strongly associated with severe migraine-related disability. depression and chance locus of control were associated with chronic migraine. this study supports the need for longitudinal observational studies to evaluate the relationships among naturalistic variation in psychological factors, migraine-related disability, and migraine chronification.
weight_loss	a series of multiarm star hydroxyl-terminated polyesters (mhps) were synthesized through a ""one-pot"" method with di-trimethylolpropane as the core molecule, 2,2-dimethylolpropionic acid as the ab(2)-type monomer, epsilon-caprolactone, and monocarboxylic acids as modifiers. the influence of different monocarboxylic acids on the viscosities of polyesters and their 2k-pu films hardness was studied and it was found that mhps prepared from lauric acid displayed the higher films hardness and lower viscosities. ir spectra of mhps disclosed the ring-opening reaction between epsilon-caprolactone and hydroxyl groups occurred. h-1 nmr spectra demonstrated that the molecular structures of mhps were irregular due to the multiplicity of reaction processes. the measured number-average molecular weights (m (n)) of mhps were around 715-1854 g/mol with the pdi of 1.45-2.05. mhps exhibited lower viscosities in the range of 3304-9060 mpa s at 100% solid contents and possessed lower intrinsic viscosities compared with linear polymers of similar molecular weight. the cured films of mhps exhibited excellent impact resistance, adhesion, flexibility, and high hardness and displayed good thermal stability with 5% weight loss at 280a degrees c. the solution viscosities of mhps were less than 450 mpa s at 80% solid contents, and the voc contents of 2k-pu coatings obtained from mhps were low to 300 g/l.
overactive_bladder	purpose: we investigated improvements in overactive bladder symptoms and depressive symptoms after solifenacin treatment in overactive bladder patients with or without depressive symptoms. methods: we performed a prospective study of patients who had been diagnosed with overactive bladder from july 2013 to june 2014. based on the beck depression inventory questionnaire, the test subjects were divided into group 1, without depressive symptoms (0-9 points), and group 2, with depressive symptoms (10 or more points). the patients were administered 5 mg of solifenacin for 3 months. the following outcomes were analyzed at the first visit, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks: the overactive bladder symptom score (oabss), international prostate symptom score (ipss), patients' perceptions of their bladder conchtion, and the beck depression inventory. results: a total of 72 patients participated, and 52 patients completed the study. most outcome measures showed improvements in both groups at weeks 4 and 12. especially in group 2, the questionnaires showed significant improvements from baseline to week 12, indicating that solifenacin was effective at treating overactive bladder symptoms (group 1 vs. group 2: oabss, -2.67 +/- 0.80 vs. -3.00 +/- 0.77; p<0.01; ipss-total, -2.14 +/- 2.15 vs. -4.94 +/- 1.70; p < 0.01). statistically significant decreases in the beck depression inventory score from baseline to weeks 4 and 12 were observed in group 2 (group 1 vs. group 2: -1.43 +/- 0.74 vs. -2.68 +/- 4.05 at week 4, p <0.001; 0.10 +/- 3.37 vs. -5.52 +/- 5.82 at week 12, p <0.001). conclusions: in overactive bladder patients with depressive symptoms, solifenacin can help improve quality of life and depressive symptoms at the same time.
multiple_sclerosis	multiple sclerosis (ms) is a putative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (cns) in which autoreactive immune cells recognizing myelin antigens lead to demyelination and axonal injury. mechanisms relevant to the pathogenesis of ms have not been fully elucidated, particularly those underlying initiation of immune system dysfunction. for example, it is not known how reactivity against cns components is generated within the peripheral immune system. in this review, we propose that a significant contribution to the immunoregulatory events may derive from a cell-to-cell communication system involving the production, secretion and transfer of extracellular vesicles known as exosomes. herein, we discuss in detail the biogenesis and roles of these cell surface-generated vesicles from the standpoint of receptors and their cargo, microrna. it is well known that exosomes can cross the blood brain barrier and thus may contribute to the spread of brain antigens to the periphery. further understanding of exosome-dependent mechanisms in ms should provide a novel angle to the analysis of the pathogenesis of this disease. finally, we launch the idea that exosomes and their contents may serve as biomarkers in ms.

weight_loss	aims: to investigate the relationship between volition, physical activity and weight loss maintenance. methods: we recruited 84 sedentary (maximal oxygen uptake: 25 +/- 5 ml/min), overweight and obese (body mass index (bmi) 38 +/- 7 m/h(2), fat 44 +/- 7 %) women (n = 55) and men (n = 29) for an interdisciplinary prospective study with follow-up. the change in lifestyle and weight loss is promoted via a 3-month intensive lifestyle intervention at a private health school. the intervention consists of supervised training (1-3 hours/day), a healthy hypo-caloric diet (-500 to -700 kcal/day) and education in healthy lifestyle in classes/groups. the participants' body weight and composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), volitional skills (questionnaire), physical activity level (heart rate accelerometer/questionnaire) and maximal oxygen uptake (indirect calorimetry) are to be monitored before, after, and 3 and 12 months after the intervention. results: at the 12-month follow-up, three different groups will be established: clinical weight loss maintenance (>10% weight loss from baseline), moderate weight loss maintenance (1-10% weight loss) and no weight loss (or weight regain). a linear mixed model analysis will be used to compare levels of volitional skills, physical activity and maximal oxygen uptake over time, between the three groups. correlational analyses will be used to investigate possible associations between volition, maximal oxygen uptake, physical activity level and weight loss maintenance. conclusions: if specific volitional skills are identified as predictors of adherence to physical activity and success in clinical weight loss maintenance, these can be trained in future intensive lifestyle interventions in order to optimize the success rate.
hepatitis_c	aimpast hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection is considered a risk factor for hepatocarcinogenesis, but the clinicopathological characteristics of non-b non-c hepatocellular carcinoma (nbnc-hcc) excluding past hbv infection have not been investigated. this study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological features of strictly defined nbnc-hcc. methodsamong hcc patients who underwent surgical resection at our affiliated hospitals in nagano prefecture, japan, between 1996 and 2012, 77 were negative for serum anti-hbv core/surface antibodies in addition to hbv surface antigen and anti-hepatitis c virus antibody without signs of autoimmune liver disease, wilson disease, or hemochromatosis. these patients were divided into the alcohol intake-positive group (ethanol intake >20g/day, n=31), non-alcoholic fatty liver group (steatosis >5% and ethanol intake <20g/day, n=30), and cryptogenic group (no ethanol intake or steatosis, n=16). preoperative clinical parameters, tumor and background liver pathology, and prognosis were analyzed. resultsadvanced fibrosis and steatosis were detected in 64% and 60% of all patients, respectively. approximately 85% of the alcohol intake-positive patients had advanced fibrosis. non-alcoholic fatty liver hcc subjects had the highest body mass index and prevalence of diabetes, but 30-40% had none to mild fibrosis. the cryptogenic group of hcc patients had the lowest incidence of accompanying hepatic inflammation/fibrosis but the largest tumor size. recurrence/survival rates were comparable among the groups. conclusionsliver fibrosis and steatosis are risk factors of hcc regardless of past hbv infection and ethanol consumption. the present results also indicate the possibility of hepatocarcinogenesis independent of hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, ethanol intake, and past hbv infection.
diabetes	objectivecurrent standard of care in the united states uses a two-step screening and diagnosis approach for gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). we aimed to assess the impact of the interval between screening and diagnosis on maternal and perinatal outcomes. materials and methodsthis is a retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies complicated by gdm at a single tertiary center from 2007 to 2013. women were divided into three groups based on the interval between their screening and diagnostic tests:7, 8 to 14, and>14 days. maternal outcomes were mode of delivery, white class a2gdm, and preeclampsia. perinatal outcomes included preterm birth, birth weight, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and birth injury. resultschart review revealed 1,212 women with diagnosis of gdm and 565 were included in the analysis with 310 (55%) women7 days, 149 (26%) women within 8 to 14 days, and 106 (19%) women>14 days group. all maternal and perinatal outcomes were similar between groups including risk of cesarean delivery, a2gdm, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth, hypoglycemia, and birth injury. conclusionincreasing time interval between screening and diagnosis may not negatively affect maternal or perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gdm.
parenting	background: depression is common in low-income pregnant women, and treatments need to be fitted to meet their needs. we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing brief interpersonal psychotherapy (briefipt) to enhanced treatment as usual (etau) for perinatal depression in low-income women. the brief-ipt model is designed to better engage low-income women by utilizing an engagement session, providing flexible delivery of sessions, and pragmatic case management. methods: pregnant women, aged >= 18, between 12 and 30 weeks gestation were recruited from an urban prenatal clinic. women scoring >= 10 on the edinburgh depression scale and meeting depressive disorder criteria were randomized to either brief-ipt (n=21) or etau (n=21). we assessed treatment outcomes, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention (measured by session attendance). results: depression scores significantly decreased in both brief-ipt and etau. brief-ipt participants reported significant improvements in social support satisfaction as compared to etau participants, even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. brief-ipt participants reported high satisfaction with the program. however, many participants did not participate in the full 9 -session course of treatment (average sessions attended =6, range 0-17). limitations: small sample size, use of self -report measures, and lack of an active psychotherapy control group limits interpretation of study results. conclusions: brief-ipt for perinatal depression is acceptable to low-income women and is helpful for improving depressive symptoms and social support. however, feasibility of the treatment was limited by relatively low session attendance in spite of efforts to maximize treatment engagement. additional modifications to meet the needs of low-income women are discussed.
hypothyroidism	rationale, aims and objectivesbaseline thyroid function testing and regular follow-up of thyroid function under amiodarone usage was recommended by guidelines. little is known about the status of amiodarone monitoring in real-world clinical care in taiwan. the objective was to determine the rate of thyroid monitoring and to assess the clinical and physicians' characteristics associated with adequate monitoring in a tertiary referral centre for arrhythmia. methodswe reviewed the medical records of patients receiving amiodarone during the period 2008-2009 at taipei veterans general hospital. the rate of baseline and follow-up thyroid function monitoring during amiodarone therapy were calculated. factors associated with guideline adherence to monitoring were analysed. resultsamong the 1319 enrolled cases, 36.4% (n=480) underwent baseline thyroid function testing and 1.1% (n=15) received measurement of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody before amiodarone initiation. regular follow up of thyroid function under amiodarone usage occurred in only 8.6% (n=114) of cases. baseline thyroid function was more likely to be present in patients of younger age (p<0.001), female sex (p=0.01), and in those who received amiodarone therapy from cardiologists (p<0.001) or electrophysiologists (p<0.001) with fewer years of service (p<0.001). upon multivariate analysis, only physicians' expertise (cardiologist versus non-cardiologist, or=5.67, 95% ci: 2.44-13.16) and years of service (or=0.97, 95% ci: 0.95-0.998) were significantly associated with adequate thyroid monitoring. conclusionsthe rate of thyroid monitoring with amiodarone therapy had been suboptimal. strategies to enhance guideline adherence are needed.
polycythemia_vera	long-term therapy with ifn-alpha 2 is associated with sustained major molecular remissions in jak2-positive et and pv. the efficacy of ifn-alpha 2 may be partly mediated by modulation of immune cells, which was investigated in twenty patients with et (n = 6) and pv (n = 14). the frequency of cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) t cells was significantly increased during ifn-alpha 2 treatment in all patients (p < 0.0001). a significant expansion of the cd56(bright) nk cells (p = 0.0002) and a concomitant decrease in the frequency of cd56(dim) nk cells (p < 0.0001) were also detected. myeloid dcs (mdcs) and plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs) were studied in nine patients, and decreased frequencies of both cell types were observed during the course of treatment. on both mdcs and pdcs, hla-abc expression was upregulated (p = 0.003), but decreasing expression levels of hla-dr was detected on mdcs. the expression of cd40 (p = 0.002), cd83 (p = 0.03), and cd86 (p = 0.01) increased, but was confined to pdcs. furthermore, pd-l1 expression was reduced on mdc (p = 0.003) and increased on pdcs (p = 0.02). no significant correlations were found between the changes in immune cells and hematological or molecular responses achieved in our cohort of patients. so forth, it remains to be revealed whether the profound changes in circulating immune cells contribute to the beneficial effects of long-term ifn-alpha 2 treatment in some patients.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is associated with procedural learning deficits. nonetheless, studies have demonstrated that reward-related learning is comparable between patients with pd and controls (bdi et al., brain, 132(9), 2385-2395, 2009; frank, seeberger, & o'reilly, science, 306(5703), 1940-1943, 2004; palminteri et al., proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america, 106(45), 19179-19184, 2009). however, because these studies do not separate the effect of reward from the effect of practice, it is difficult to determine whether the effect of reward on learning is distinct from the effect of corrective feedback on learning. thus, it is unknown whether these group differences in learning are due to reward processing or learning in general. here, we compared the performance of medicated pd patients to demographically matched healthy controls (hcs) on a task where the effect of reward can be examined separately from the effect of practice. we found that patients with pd showed significantly less reward-related learning improvements compared to hcs. in addition, stronger learning of rewarded associations over unrewarded associations was significantly correlated with smaller skin-conductance responses for hcs but not pd patients. these results demonstrate that when separating the effect of reward from the effect of corrective feedback, pd patients do not benefit from reward.
fungal_infection	fusarium infection is a severe fungal infection caused by fungi of the genus fusarium. it most commonly occurs in immunocompromised patients with malignant hematological comorbidities or secondary to hematopoietic stem cell transplant. the classical route of contamination is through inhalation but infection may also occur through contiguity with a skin lesion. this report describes the case of a 24-year-old woman who developed graft-vs.-host disease (gvhd) at 220 days after receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor for hodgkin disease. on day 330 after transplant the patient presented with fever and several painful subcutaneous, tender, red nodules with ulcerative and necrotic features on the pelvic region and right leg, extensive glass infiltrative lesions in the lungs and pansinusitis; however, the patient did not have onychomycosis. following skin biopsy, culture of cutaneous lesions, computed tomography (ct) scanning of the lungs and ct scanning and magnetic resonance imaging of facial sinuses the patient was diagnosed with disseminated fusarium species infection. despite intensive treatment with voriconazole, the patient succumbed with respiratory insufficiency on day 400 after transplant. this case is noteworthy because the patient did not have any additional risk associated with the allogeneic transplant; there was no transplant mismatch, no severe neutropenia and no prior clinical signs of onychomycosis. the association of skin lesions with gvhd lesions increased the initial immunosuppression and delayed diagnosis.
hepatitis_c	genotype 1 of the hepatitis c virus (hcv) is themost prevalent of the variants of this virus. its twomain subtypes, hcv-1a and hcv-1b, are associated to differences in epidemic features and risk groups, despite sharing similar features in most biological properties. we have analyzed the impact of positive selection on the evolution of these variants using complete genome coding regions, and compared the levels of genetic variability and the distribution of positively selected sites. we have also compared the distributions of positively selected and conserved sites considering different factors such as rna secondary structure, the presence of different epitopes (antibody, cd4 and cd8), and secondary protein structure. <10% of the genome was found to be under positive selection, and purifying selection was the main evolutionary process acting in both subtypes. we found differences in the number of positively selected sites between subtypes in several genes (core, hvr2 in e2, p7, helicase in ns3 and ns4a). heterozygosity values in positively selected sites and the rate of non-synonymous substitutions were significantly higher in subtypehcv-1b. logistic regression analyses revealed that similar selective forces act at the genome level in both subtypes: rna secondary structure and cd4 t-cell epitopes are associatedwith conserved sites, while cd8 t-cell epitopes are associatedwith positive selection in both subtypes. these results indicate that similar selective constraints are acting along hcv-1a and hcv-1 b genomes, despite some differences in the distribution of positively selected sites at independent genes.

menopause	background: bushen tianjing recipe (btr) is a traditional chinese herbal medicine that has been prescribed for premature ovarian failure (pof) for decades in china. nevertheless, little is known regarding its underlying molecular mechanism. in the present study, we investigated the effects of btr in a tripterygium glycoside (tg)-induced-pof rat model. methods: three doses of btr were administered via intragastric gavage to adult female sprague-dawley (sd) rats with tg-induced pof. after 15 days of treatment, the estrous cycle was examined by vaginal smear analysis. serum levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone, and testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. histological analysis and assessment of apoptosis were performed after hematoxylin and eosin staining of ovarian tissue sections. the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (vegfr2), anti-apoptotic factor bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic factors bax and caspase 3 in ovaries of animals was examined by an immunohistochemistry process. results: btr not only reverted an abnormal estrous cycle and decreased the ovary index in pof rats but also improved the abnormal secretion of reproductive hormones associated with pof. in addition, treatment with btr can protect ovaries from tg-induced damage, induce intraovarian expression of vegf and vegfr2, and regulate intraovarian expression of apoptosis-related proteins. conclusions: our results show that btr is effective in the treatment of tg-induced pof rats. promotion of angiogenesis and anti-apoptosis are most likely to contribute to the effects of btr against pof.
hepatitis_c	in spain, there is a need to improve chronic hepatitis c care among people who inject drugs (pwid). injecting drug use is an important risk behaviour for hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. review of 28 sources of the relevant published literature mapped the size of the addiction-hcv population in spain. experts in opioid use disorder (oud) treatment in spain completed a consensus to define the population size, hcv prevalence and access or barriers to hepatitis c treatment for pwid populations. in spain, over 300 000 individuals have a lifetime history of injecting drugs. currently, 150 000 individuals in spain have oud; many have injected drugs. each year, 80 000 individuals engage with treatment services for oud. a proportion of this group continues to inject drugs. there is a high hcv prevalence in pwid -estimates of 60-80% in spain. uptake of hepatitis c therapy in pwid in spain is limited; barriers include awareness of treatment pathways, advocacy for regular screening and effective joint care. there is an urgent need to address barriers to effective hepatitis c care for pwid in spain. practical and specific strategies including peer-led solutions, patient buddy systems and joint working models at the local level can make important short-term differences. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
polycythemia_vera	philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (ph-negative mpn) comprise a heterogeneous group of chronic hematologic malignancies. the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of patients with mpn are primarily affected by disease-related symptoms, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications, and progression to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia. major bleeding represents a common and important complication in mpn, and the incidence of such bleeding events will become even more relevant in the future due to the increasing disease prevalence and survival of mpn patients. this review discusses the causes, differential diagnoses, prevention, and management of bleeding episodes in patients with mpn, aiming at defining updated standards of care in these often challenging situations.
senior_health	this paper identifies a number of the key elements that underpinned the success of australia 's public health response to minimizing the spread of hiv, it is argued that one major factor was the high level of collaboration between health care professionals and ''affected'' communities, such as injecting drug users, sex industry workers and gay men, this collaboration allowed for the negotiation, development and implementation of the range of innovative hiv initiatives that were ultimately responsible for keeping hiv in the injecting drug use and sex industry to low levels, despite the central role played by injecting drug users and their peer based organizations, the significance of their activities has gone largely unacknowledged by senior health bureaucrats and politicians, as a consequence, advice from injecting drug users and their peer-based organizations on the current hepatitis c epidemic has been largely ignored, instead of learning from australia 's hiv experience and involving these groups in consultation and advisory roles, the federal government has reverted to accepting advice from only established mainstream organizations. it is argued that the success of infection control outside mainstream communities, such as among injecting drug users, can most effectively be achieved through the involvement of these ''affected'' communities, there is a need at the local, national and international levels to ensure both the involvement of ''affected'' communities and that recognition is given to them for the significant and essential role they play in infection control.
hepatitis_c	around 170-200 million individuals have hepatitis c virus (hcv), which represents similar to 3% of the world population, including similar to 3-5 million people in the usa. according to the who regional office in the middle east, egypt has the highest prevalence in the world, with 7% prevalence in adults. there had been no effective vaccine for hcv; a combination of peg-interferon and ribavirin for at least 48 weeks was the standard therapy, but it failed in more than 40% of the patients and has a high cost and serious side effects. the recent introduction of direct-acting antivirals (daa) resulted in major advances toward the cure of hcv. however, relapse and reduced antiviral efficacy in fibrotic, cirrhotic hcv patients in addition to some undesired effects restrain the full potential of these combinations. there is a need for new approaches for the combinations of different daa and their targeted delivery using novel nanotechnology approaches. in this review, the role of nanoparticles as a carrier for hcv vaccines, anti-hcv combinations, and their targeted delivery are discussed.
alzheimer's_disease	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is the most common dementia and the trigger of its pathological cascade is widely believed to be the overproduction and accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (a beta) in the affected brain. however, effective ad remedies are still anxiously awaited. recent evidence suggests that curcumin may be a potential agent for ad treatment. in this study, we used 5xfad transgenic mice as an ad model to investigate the effects of curcumin on ad. our results showed that curcumin administration (150 or 300 mg/kg/day, intragastrically, for 60 days) dramatically reduced a beta production by downregulating bace1 expression, preventing synaptic degradation, and improving spatial learning and memory impairment of 5xfad mice. these findings suggest that curcumin is a potential candidate for ad treatment.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	the rome iii criteria classify patients complaining of constipation into two main groups: patients with functional constipation (fc) and patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (ibs-c). the purpose of this study was to identify differences in the intensity of symptoms and total and segmental colonic transit time in these two types of patients. we performed a prospective evaluation of 337 outpatients consecutively referred for chronic constipation and classified according to the rome iii criteria as fc or ibs-c. they were asked to report symptom intensity, on a 10-point likert scale, for diarrhea, constipation, bloating and abdominal pain. stool form was reported using the bristol scale, and colonic transit time was measured by using multiple-ingestion single-marker single-film technique. statistical analysis was completed by a discriminant analysis. female gender and obstructed defecation was more frequent in ibs-c patients than in fc patients. ibs-c patients reported greater symptom intensity than fc patients, but stool form, and total and segmental colonic transit time were not different between the two groups. multivariate logistic regression showed that only two parameters, bloating and abdominal pain, were related to the ibs-c or to the fc phenotype, and discriminant analysis showed that these two parameters were sufficient to give a correct classification of 71% of the patients. our study suggests that self-evaluation of abdominal pain and bloating is more helpful than colonic transit time in classifying patient as ibsaeuroc or fc.
multiple_sclerosis	several single gene disorders can potentially be overlooked in the differential diagnostic evaluation of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms). pelizaeus-merzbacher disease and spastic paraplegia type 2 are allelic x-linked disorders associated with defective myelination of the central nervous system and mutations in plp1. neurological symptoms are occasionally observed in female carriers of these mutations. two women - the proposita (pt1) and her mother (pt2) - reported walking difficulties since adolescence and showed progressive cognitive decline. their neurological examinations revealed spastic gait, pyramidal tract involvement and distal muscle atrophy in the legs. peripheral neuropathy and diffuse white matter (wm) changes on brain mri were also observed. both patients had a preliminary diagnosis of primary progressive ms. using a targeted method in next generation sequencing, the novel heterozygous c.210t>g/p.y70* in plp1 was identified in pt2. the same mutation was also found in pt1 but not in five healthy relatives. the mutation showed moderate to-severe skewed x inactivation in tissues, and western blotting revealed a significant reduction of plp1 and dm20 in the sural nerve of pt2. in conclusion a mother and daughter presented an x-linked dominant disorder with skewed x inactivation. the authors suggest that plp1 testing might be considered in the evaluation of women with spastic paraparesis, cognitive decline and wm changes.

skin_care	the development of personal care formulations incorporates the deliberation of the prerequisite product rheology and the right rheology modifier to deliver these effects. while the effectiveness of the finished product will hinge on the selection and level of active ingredients and excipients, the esthetics and even the penetration of these actives into the stratum corneum will be affected by the product rheology. rheology modifiers are frequently denoted as thickeners, and while increasing the apparent viscosity should enhance the perception of quality in a formulation, this is only one aspect of rheological control. the product itself can be newtonian or pseudoplastic, thixotropic, existing as a ringing gel or a stringy flowable liquid. this changes the way that the product appears in the bottle, the ease with which aliquots are poured or scooped from the packaging, the process of rubbing it into the skin or along the hair shaft, and upon using, the rinsing and removal of the product. it will also be vital to select the correct rheological characteristics to guarantee the stability of the finished formulation. by changing the structure of polymeric rheology modifiers, the impact on the sensorial properties and performance characteristics can be investigated. careful selection of monomers, structure and other co-ingredients will result in products optimized for use in skin care formulations. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
cancer	metabolomics has been shown to be an effective tool for disease diagnosis, biomarker screening and characterization of biological pathways. a total of 140 subjects were included in this study; urine metabolomes of patients with liver cirrhosis (lc, n=40), patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc; n=55) and healthy male subjects (n=45) as a control group were studied. gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based urine metabolomics profiles were investigated for all participants. diagnostic models were constructed with a combination of marker metabolites, using principal components analysis and receiver operator characteristic curves. a total of 57 peaks could be auto-identified of which 13 marker metabolites (glycine, serine, threonine, proline, urea, phosphate, pyrimidine, arabinose, xylitol, hippuric acid, citric acid, xylonic acid and glycerol) were responsible for the separation of hcc group from healthy subjects. also, eight markers metabolites (glycine, serine, threonine, proline, citric acid, urea, xylitol and arabinose) showed significant differences between the lc group and healthy subjects. no significant difference was detected between hcc and lc groups regarding all these metabolites. metabolomic profile using gc-ms established an optimized diagnostic model to discriminate between hcc patients and healthy subjects; also it could be useful for diagnosis of lc patients. however, it failed to differentiate between hcc and lc patients.
fungal_infection	posaconazole is the recommended prophylactic agent in patients at high risk of invasive fungal infection, since adequate drug levels seem to be reached in target sites despite the relatively low levels detected in blood. the objective of this study is to obtain pharmacokinetic (pk) information associated to blood and tissue distribution of posaconazole in an animal model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. the pk parameters in lung samples were systematically higher than in serum. after multiple-dose administration of posaconazole, a significant accumulation of the drug was evident in lung tissue. the pk behavior of posaconazole in this particular experimental model is similar to that observed in humans. thus, we believe this model could be a valid tool to evaluate posaconazole exposure-response relationship.

allergies	purposethe inappropriate immune response to harmless foreign and self-antigens is a common feature of allergy, atopy and autoimmune disease. the influence of environmental factors in the initiation of autoimmunity is not well understood. it is conceivable that immune responses to allergens may also serve as a trigger of bystander immune reactions, including autoimmunity such as uveitis. therefore, we wanted to investigate the prevalence of allergies and atopy in patients with different types of uveitis in comparison to a control cohort. methodsin total, 530 consecutive patients with new-onset anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitis were compared to a non-uveitis control cohort consisting of 1.060 consecutive new-referral patients who attended our specialized outpatient clinics for other reasons than uveitis. allergy and atopy status as well as demographic data (age, gender and ethnicity) were obtained by standardized interviewer-assisted questionnaires. resultsuveitis case cohort and control cohort did not differ significantly in the allergy status (p=0.910), such as the history of pollen allergy (p=0.671), history of drug allergy (p=0.920), history of food allergy (p=0.941), history of house dust mite allergy (p=0.197) or history of other allergens (p=0.593), nor in the atopy status (p=0.802), such as the history of atopic dermatitis (p=0.365), history of asthma (p=0.430) or history of allergic rhinitis (p=0.115). conclusionsour results argue against a substantial influence of allergies and atopy on the onset of uveitis.
allergies	synadenium grantii is frequently used for the treatment of various diseases such as allergies, gastric disorders, and especially cancer. the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible antiproliferative potential of the methanol extract, fractions, and pure compounds from the stems of s grantii. phytochemical analysis was carried out by conventional chromatographic techniques, and the antiproliferative activity was analyzed using the sulforhodamine b assay and an mtt-based assay. nonpolar fraction and its subfractions from the stems of s grantii exhibited promising cytostatic effect against several human tumor cell lines (glioma, breast, kidney, and lung), with total grown inhibition values ranging from 0.37 to 2.9 g/ml. one of the active principles of this plant was identified as a rare phorbol diterpene ester, denoted as 3,4,12,13-tetraacetylphorbol-20-phenylacetate. this compound demonstrated antiproliferative activity against glioma, kidney, lung, and triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. these results demonstrate that s grantii stems produce active principles with relevant antiproliferative potential.
sports_injuries	tennis is very popular, but the incorrect action produces sports injuries. the knowledge of sports biomechanics is used in sports injury research on tennis. two mainly classical research methods on tennis sports biomechanics are theoretical research and experimental study. this paper introduces the technical features of two research methods, theoretical research is mainly based on the model. the experimental study is mainly based on three systems of the kinematics, dynamics and biological measurement. the differences among them are compared in order to provide the overall ideas for study on sports injury of tennis.
senior_health	objectives: our primary objective was to describe the prevalence of osteoporosis (op) diagnosis in nursing home residents (nhrs). secondary objectives included assessment of pharmacologic therapies and risk of fracture in nhrs with op, as well as differentiating clinical characteristics of treated versus untreated male and female nhr with op. finally, we sought to evaluate persistence and compliance rates in nhrs treated with op and determine the prevalence of severe renal impairment in nhrs with op treated with a bisphosphonate. design: retrospective cohort analysis. setting: us nh. participants: nhrs with a minimum data set (mds) 3.0 record in the omnicare senior health outcomes (osho) data repository during the time period of october 1, 2011, to september 30, 2012. measurements: a patient was considered to have an op diagnosis if mds item i3800 indicated the nhr had op or if the mds record contained icd-9-cm codes 733.0x. an expanded definition of op diagnosis was explored, in which an nhr with a previous fracture (mds items i3900, i4000, j1700c = 1) was also considered to have op. op pharmacologic therapies were extracted from the pharmacy claims data and included alendronate, calcitonin salmon, denosumab, ibandronate, raloxifene, risedronate, and teriparatide. using mds items, cognitive impairment (brief instrument for mental status, cognitive performance scale) and functional impairment (composite activities of daily living) were assessed. using mds and prescription claims data, high risk of fracture (at least 2 of the following: age >= 75 years, female gender, previous fracture, history of falls, and use of a bisphosphonate) was assessed. persistence was indicated by continuous use of therapy without a gap of more than 60 days, compliance was calculated using the medication possession ratio, and creatinine clearance (clcr) was calculated using a modified cockcroft-gault equation. results: the prevalence of op in nhrs was 13.5%. using the expanded op definition, the prevalence of op increased to 24.2%. among nhrs with op (n - 23,666), the mean age was 82.5 and 85.1% were female; 36.8% had gastroesophageal reflux disease or ulcer. per the definition of high risk for fracture based on older age, female gender, prior fracture, fall history, and use of bisphosphonates, 89.0% of nhrs with op met the criteria. additionally, 10.8% had hip fracture, and 15.8% had other fracture. overall, few nhrs with op received active treatment: one-third received pharmacologic therapy, of which 73.5% received an oral bisphosphonate. those with a history of hip fracture had similar treatment rates (31.7%) to those without (32.0%) (p = .804), whereas those with a history of other fracture were more likely to be treated (35.9%) than those without (31.2%) (p = .001). two-thirds of residents with op had moderate/severe cognitive impairment, and these residents were less likely to receive op therapy than those without (p = .001). persistence with pharmacologic therapy in nhr with a full year of pharmacy data (n = 1399) was higher for raloxifene (82.9%), with calcitonin salmon and bisphosphonates being similar, and the few nhrs who received teriparatide and denosumab were lower. of the nhrs who received bisphosphonates for whom there was creatinine clearance data, 57% had a clcr lower than 35 ml/min. conclusion: the recognized prevalence of op in nhrs using mds records was low, but consistent with previous reports. among those with a documented diagnosis of op, approximately 89% of nhrs with op were at high risk of fracture and only one-third were treated with active pharmacologic therapy. for those treated, persistence and compliance was suboptimal, but higher with oral therapies. more than half of nhrs with op treated with bisphosphonates had clcr of less than 35 ml/min, suggesting alternative forms of therapy should be considered. for all of these reasons, the opportunity exists to improve the care and medication use of residents with op who are at high risk of fracture.

headache	objective: to examine outcomes of clinical procedures for renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) based on us national health claims databases.methods: this retrospective cohort study selected two cohorts of tsc patients, who underwent either embolization or nephrectomy (either partial or complete) for renal angiomyolipoma in the years from 2000 through 2011. based on claims diagnosis codes, we estimated the prevalence rates of 10 angiomyolipoma-related conditions and 50 embolization- or nephrectomy-related conditions in the pre- and post-baseline periods respectively, and made cross-year and cross-period comparison of these rates with repeated measures analysis methods.results: the embolization cohort (n=4280) and the nephrectomy cohort (n=3842) had mean baseline ages of 50.7 and 51.7 years with 52.5% and 51.3% males, respectively. after the intervention, the embolization cohort had statistically significant reductions (all p<.05) in gross hematuria (-27.7%), retroperitoneal hemorrhage (-8.4%), and abdominal mass (-6.9%), and increases in hypertension (15.5%), renal mass or unspecified disorder of kidney and ureter (13.8%), anemia (5.1%), and renal insufficiency (3.3%). similarly, the nephrectomy cohort saw statistically significant reductions (all p<.05) in gross hematuria (-30.6%), flank pain (-7.5%), and abdominal mass (-6.4%), but increases in hypertension (11.9%), renal insufficiency (10.4%), and anemia (7.6%). embolization was associated with post-procedure increases in renal mass or unspecified kidney/ureter disorder (13.9%), other disorders of kidney and ureter (3.4%), non-acute renal insufficiency (3.1%), flank pain (3.7%), renal insufficiency (3.2%), etc. (all p<.05). nephrectomy was associated with post-procedure increases in postoperative ileus (5.3%), pain and headache (4.8%), paralytic ileus (3.6%), etc. (all p<.05).conclusions: both embolization and nephrectomy were effective, but associated with increases in certain angiomyolipoma-related conditions. further, the embolization effect on gross hematuria, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and abdominal mass might subside after the intervention year.
skin_care	herpes zoster (hz) infection is a common condition in the elderly. immunosuppression involving cellular immunity favors its occurrence. the pain is the most frequent complications of hz. it occurs in about 30% of people aged over 70 years. the virological diagnosis of typical hz is not useful, and the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical data. skin care is essential to limit cutaneous damage. antiviral drugs will reduce the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia, if they are early prescribed within 72 hours after the rash onset. analgesia is essential and should be conducted in relation evolution. vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the occurrence of hz complications in the elderly, in particular post-herpetic neuralgia.
weight_loss	the properties and changes of an o/w emulsion(mayonnaise) as affected by the replacement of long-chain fatty acid oil with medium-chain fatty acid oil were studied. different ratios of coconut oil (cno) and rice bran oil (rbo) (0:100, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70 and 40:60 (v/v)) were blended as the oil base for the study. the highest replacement of rbo with cno in an o/w emulsion that could be achieved with minimal change of sensory properties was 30%. the emulsion stability index and oil-phase crystallisation temperatures of mayonnaise with rbo alone and with 30% cno replacement did not change when stored at 30 +/- 2 degrees c for 4 weeks. the droplet size of the mayonnaise containing only rbo increased, possibly due to droplet coalescence. in contrast, the droplet size of the mayonnaise with cno:rbo=30:70 did not change during storage.
low_testosterone	objectives: findings from several experimental studies in animals have suggested a protective action of testosterone on kidney function, but hard evidence for such an association in humans is scarce. we examined the association between testosterone levels and kidney function among adult men living in super-aged communities. design, setting, participants, and measurements: we conducted cross-sectional study involving residents aged 40-80 years who participated in annual health check-ups in 2 communities. a total of 1031 men were recruited in 2010. main exposure was salivary testosterone (st) levels measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. main outcome was estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) determined by age, gender, and serum creatinine levels. results: for the 848 participants analyzed, median age and egfr were 69 years and 69.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. on comparison of 90th-percentile st levels with lower levels, our general linear model with restricted cubic splines showed that lower st levels were associated with decreased egfr after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and blood pressure. for example, fifth percentile st was associated with decreased egfr, with a difference in egfr [-3.43 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (95% confidence interval, ci -6.02 to -0.84)] comparable in magnitude to the reduction in egfr observed for a 6-year increase in age in our population. the association between low testosterone levels and decreased egfr remained similar even when analyses were restricted to participants aged over 60 years (734 participants, median age 71 years). conclusions: results from our study indicated that having low testosterone levels was independently associated with reduced egfr in adult men. our finding of this association between low testosterone levels and reduced kidney function needs to be corroborated among persons with chronic kidney disease or in a longitudinal study.

hepatitis_c	background & aims: ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination treatment in phase iii clinical trials resulted in sustained viral suppression in 94-99% of patients. this study characterized drug resistance in treatment failures, which may help to inform retreatment options. methods: we performed ns5a and ns5b deep sequencing of hepatitis c virus (hcv) from patients infected with genotype (gt) 1 who participated in ledipasvir/sofosbuvir phase ii and iii clinical trials. results: fifty-one of 2144 (2.4%) (42 gt1a and 9 gt1b) treated patients met the criteria for resistance analysis due to virologic failure following the end of treatment. the majority of patients with virologic failure (38 of 51; 74.5%) had detectable ledipasvir-specific resistance-associated substitutions (rass) at the time of virologic failure (1% deep sequencing cut-off). the percent of patients with ns5a rass at virologic failure were 37.5%, 66.7%, 94.7% and 100% in patients treated for 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. the common substitutions detected at failure were q30r/h, and/or y93h/n in gt1a and y93h in gt1b. at failure, 35.3% (18/51) of virologic failure patients' viruses had two or more ns5a rass and the majority of patients harbored ns5a rass conferring a 100-1000-fold (n = 10) or >1000-fold (n = 23) reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir. one patient in a phase ii study with a known ledipasvir ras at baseline (l31m) developed the s282t sofosbuvir (ns5b) ras at failure. conclusions: in gt1 hcv-infected patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir +/- ribavirin, virologic failure was rare. ledipasvir resistance in ns5a was selected or enhanced in most patients with virologic failure, one of whom also developed resistance to sofosbuvir. lay summary: clinical studies have shown that combination treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir efficiently cures most patients with genotype 1 hepatitis c infection. for the few patients failing treatment, we show that resistance to ledipasvir was observed in most patients, whereas resistance to sofosbuvir was less common. this has important implications for the selection of optimal retreatment strategies for these patients.

overactive_bladder	understanding barriers to seeking care for pelvic floor disorders is necessary. we sought to assess familiarity with pelvic floor disorders, as well as identify screening and referral patterns among primary care providers. this institutional review board approved study was distributed through a secure online server (surveymonkeya (r)). primary care providers within a large healthcare system were invited to participate in a 14-question survey regarding the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary incontinence (ui), overactive bladder (oab) syndrome, and pelvic organ prolapse (pop). demographic information was collected. descriptive statistics and associations were calculated. a total of 360 emails were delivered, 108 responded (response rate 30.0 %). respondents were evenly distributed with respect to age and years in practice. providers correctly estimated the prevalence of ui and oab, and most reported treating these conditions themselves (92.6 % and 88.9 %, respectively). if treatment failed, however, referral was most often (68.1 %) to urology. the majority reported not screening for pop, and 50.9 % believed the prevalence to be rare. referrals for pop were most often (61.1 %) to urogynecology. male providers were less likely to screen for pop than female providers (p < 0.001). only a minority (35.2 %) described being 'very familiar' with urogynecology, and 19.4 % were unaware of such providers within the system. primary care providers within a large healthcare system were more familiar with ui and oab than pop, often underestimating the prevalence of pop. nearly one-fifth were unaware of urogynecologists within their system. educational outreach regarding pelvic floor disorders and the urogynecology specialty would likely improve patient access to care.

hypothyroidism	background thyroid disorders are known to involve all organ systems of the body, the skin being no exception. the present study is aimed to study various cutaneous manifestations and see cutaneous manifestations in thyroid disorders and to know various dermatologic associations of thyroid disorders. materials and methods this is a prospective, observational study conducted over a period of 18 months in department of dvl in a tertiary care centre. all patients with thyroid abnormality and cutaneous manifestations are included in the study. detailed clinical examination is done and the findings are recorded. results thyroid disorders are more common in females. the most common age group affected by hypothyroidism was 31 - 40 years, hyperthyroidism is 21 - 30 yrs. weight gain and dry skin were the commonest symptoms among hypothyroid patients and heat intolerance and increased sweating were commonest among hyperthyroid patients. xerosis and dry, rough, coarse skin among hypothyroid patients; and warm, soft, velvety skin among hyperthyroid were commonest findings. urticaria was the most common autoimmune association noted among hypothyroid patients. conclusion with our study, it could be concluded that a better understanding complex interaction between skin and thyroid may help us not only to diagnose underlying thyroid abnormality, but also to monitor response of cutaneous features with treatment.
hypothyroidism	objective: the aim of this study was to investigate depression-like behaviors of juvenile rats with congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism. methods: twenty-seven newborn rat pups were used. first, 6-month-old wistar albino female rats were impregnated. methimazole (0.025% wt/vol) was given to dam rats from the first day of pregnancy until postnatal 21 days (p21) to generate pups with congenital hypothyroidism (n=8), whereas in the postnatal hypothyroidism group (n=10), methimazole was given from p0 to p21. in the control group (n=9), dam rats were fed ad libitum and normal tap water. offspring were fed with breast milk from their mothers. the behavioral parameters were measured with the juvenile forced swimming test (jfst). the procedure of jfst consisted of two sessions in two consecutive days: the 15-minute pre-test on day 1 and the 5-minute test on day 2. results: increased immobility and decreased climbing duration were observed in both congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism groups. decreased swimming duration was detected in the postnatal hypothyroidism group. both hypothyroidism groups had a lower body weight gain compared with the control group, while the congenital hypothyroidism group had the lowest body weight. conclusion: our results showed that hypothyroidism had negative effects on depression-like behavior as well as on growth and development. both congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism caused an increase in immobility time in jfst. new studies are required to understand the differing results on depression-like behavior between congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism.
parkinson's_disease	although tremor is the most common movement disorder, there exist few effective tremor-suppressing devices, in part because the characteristics of tremor throughout the upper limb are unknown. to clarify, optimally suppressing tremor requires a knowledge of the mechanical origin, propagation, and distribution of tremor throughout the upper limb. here we present the first systematic investigation of how tremor propagates between the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist. we simulated tremor propagation using a linear, time-invariant, lumped-parameter model relating joint torques and the resulting joint displacements. the model focused on the seven main degrees of freedom from the shoulder to the wrist and included coupled joint inertia, damping, and stiffness. we deliberately implemented a simple model to focus first on the most basic effects. simulating tremorogenic joint torque as a sinusoidal input, we used the model to establish fundamental principles describing how input parameters (torque location and frequency) and joint impedance (inertia, damping, and stiffness) affect tremor propagation. we expect that the methods and principles presented here will serve as the groundwork for future refining studies to understand the origin, propagation, and distribution of tremor throughout the upper limb in order to enable the future development of optimal tremor-suppressing devices.
alzheimer's_disease	we report a case of rapidly evolving neurological disease in a patient with neuropathological lesions of creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd), lewy body dementia (lbd), chronic subcortical vascular encephalopathy and meningothelial meningioma. the coexistence of severe multiple pathologies in a single patient strengthens the need to perform accurate clinical differential diagnoses in rapidly progressive dementias.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background/aims early adverse life events (eals) are relevant to irritable bowel syndrome in adulthood. maternal separation (ms), as one of the eals, has proved to induce visceral hypersensitivity in adult rats. however, the effect of ms on visceral hypersensitvity from the post-weaning period to adulthood remains unknown. methods one hundred and ten neonatal sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: rats in the ms group were exposed to 3 hours daily ms on postnatal day (pnd) 2-14; the normal control (nc) group remained undisturbed. visceral sensitivity was determined by measuring the visceromotor response to colorectal distention on pnd21, 35, and 56. anxiety-like behaviors were measured by the open field test. results compared with nc rats, ms rats showed significant visceral hypersensitivity from the post-weaning period to adult. the proportion of visceral hypersensitive rats decreased with age from 87.5% to 70.0% in the female ms group and from 90.0% to 66.7% in the male ms group. the relative vmr ratio of ms and nc on pnd21 was higher than pnd35 and pnd56. ms rats showed decreased ability of movement and exploration to the novel environment in the post-weaning period, obesity in the prepubertal period, and more anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood. conclusions ms can significantly affect visceral sensitivity and behaviors of rats in different age stages, especially in the post-weaning period. visceral hypersensitivity of ms rats is more pronounced in the post-weaning period and slightly restored in adults. thus, visceral hypersensitivity in the post-weaning period might play a more meaningful pathophysiologic role in the formation of adult irritable bowel syndrome.
hypothyroidism	background childhood obesity has become a global epidemic. in the recent studies has reported risk of thyroid dysfunction due to obesity. therefore, this study intends to compare the relative frequency of thyroid function disorders in obese and overweight children with non-obese children. materials and methods this case-control study during 2015 to 2016 in birjand-iran was done on 137 children and adolescents (6 to 18 years), with overweight and obesity as case group and 137 non-obese subjects as control group. body mass index (bmi), thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh), free triiodothyronine (ft3) and free thyroxine (ft4) were measured, and analyzed using spss software version19. results tsh level in obese children was significantly more (p<0.001), and ft4 (p<0.001) and ft3 levels (p=0.003), less than non-obese subjects. in the control group, 0.73% and in the case group, 2.92% of patients showed hypothyroidism disorder, that difference was not significant (p=0.177). in the control group, there was significant relationship between tsh with ft4 (p<0.001) and ft3 (p<0.001). moreover, in the case group, there was significant relationship between tsh with ft4 (p<0.001) and ft3 (p=0.001), and also, between ft4 with ft3 (p<0.001). conclusion overweight and obesity in children and adolescents can be effect on increase of tsh and decrease of ft4 and ft3. long-term studies with larger sample size is suggested.
weight_loss	influenza h7n9 virus infection causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory illness that triggers cell death of infected cells and airway epithelial destruction. rip3 is a key regulator of cell death responses to a growing number of viral and microbial agents. this study aimed to investigate the role of rip3 in inflammation of influenza h7n9 virus infection. here, rip3 knock out (rip3-/-) mice and littermate wild type mice were infected intranasally with influenza h7n9 virus (a/fujian/s03/2015) to determine the contribution of rip3 to the inflammatory response of influenza h7n9 virus infection. it was found that rip3-/- mice infected with h7n9 virus showed higher survival and less weight loss, compared with wild type littermate mice. in addition, rip3-/- mice had fewer regions of edema, infiltration with inflammatory cells, and alvelolar collapses, and the secretions of il-1 beta, il-6, rantes and mip-1 in balf were significantly decreased on days 3 and 7 p.i. when compared with wt mice. moreover, caspase 1/il1 beta signaling was found to be invovled in rip3 associated imflammation of influenza h7n9 virus, but not rip3/mlkl dependent necrosis. in the conclusion, our results indicated that rip3 deficiency can protect mice from the infection of influenza h7n9 virus by downregulating caspase 1/il1 beta signaling, which provided edivence of the rip3 invovled necroptosis independent manner.
overactive_bladder	objective: to estimate the prevalence and identify associated factors to urinary incontinence (ui) in climacteric women. method: in a cross-sectional study with a stratified random sample, 1,200 women aged between 35 and 72 years were studied, enrolled in the family health strategy in the city of pindamonhangaba, sao paulo. urinary incontinence was investigated using the international consultation of incontinence questionnaire-short form, while associated factors were assessed based on a self-reported questionnaire with socio-demographic, obstetric and gynecological history, morbidities and drug use. the prevalence of urinary incontinence was estimated with a 95% confidence interval (95ci) and the associated factors were identified through multiple logistic regression model performed using stata software, version 11.0. results: women had a mean age of 51.9 years, most were in menopause (59.4%), married (87.5%), catholic (48.9%), and declared themselves black or brown (47.2%). the mean age of menopause of women with ui was 47.3 years. the prevalence of ui was 20.4% (95ci: 17.8-23.1%). the factors associated with ui were urinary loss during pregnancy (p=0.000) and after delivery (p=0.000), genital prolapse (p=0.000), stress (p=0.001), depression (p=0.002), and obesity (p=0.006). conclusion: the prevalence of ui was lower but similar to that found in most similar studies. factors associated with the genesis of ui were urinary loss during pregnancy and after delivery, genital prolapse and obesity.
cancer	in the first part of this paper, docking method was employed in order to study the binding mechanism of breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) with a group of previously synthesized tps-a derivatives which known as potent inhibitors of this protein to get insight into drug binding site of bcrp and to explore structure activity relationship of these compounds. molecular docking results showed that most of these compounds bind in the binding site of bcrp at the interface between the membrane and outer environment. in the second part, a group of designed tps-a derivatives which showed good binding energies in the binding site of alpha beta-tubulin in the previous study were chosen to study their binding energies in the binding site of bcrp to investigate their simultaneous inhibitory effect on both alpha beta-tubulin and bcrp. the results showed that all of these compounds bind to the binding site of bcrp with relatively suitable binding energies and therefore could be potential inhibitors of both alpha beta-tubulin and bcrp proteins. finally, virtual consensus docking method was utilized with the aim of design of new 2,5-diketopiperazine derivatives with significant inhibitory effect on both alpha beta-tubulin and bcrp proteins. for this purpose binding energies of a library of 2,5-diketopiperazine derivatives in the binding sites of alpha beta-tubulin and bcrp was investigated by using autodock and autodock vina tools. molecular docking results revealed that a group of 36 compounds among them exhibit strong anti-tubulin and anti-bcrp activity.

hypothyroidism	background: maternal thyroid disease may complicate pregnancy. a high frequency of abnormal thyroid function test results in pregnant women with known thyroid disease has been reported, but the frequency of unidentified thyroid dysfunction in women first clinically diagnosed with thyroid disease after a pregnancy is not known. methods: this was a population-based study of pregnant women in the danish national birth cohort (dnbc) who had a blood sample drawn in early pregnancy and terminated the pregnancy with a singleton live-birth in the period between 1997 and 2003. participants were all women in the dnbc who had a registration of thyroid disease before and/or up to five years after the pregnancy in nationwide health registers (n = 2445) and a 12% random sample of all women in the cohort (n = 7624). thyrotropin and free thyroxine were measured with an immunoassay in sera stored in the danish national biobank. method-and pregnancy week-specific references ranges were used for classification of thyroid function test abnormalities. results: the frequency of abnormal thyroid function in early pregnancy was 12.5% in the random sample and 35.7% among women clinically diagnosed with thyroid disease before or after blood sampling (55.7% among women on current treatment). one third of women clinically diagnosed with thyroid disease after blood sampling had unidentified thyroid dysfunction in the early pregnancy blood sample (most frequently [52.0%] unidentified hypothyroidism in women with a later diagnosis of hypothyroidism). conclusions: more than 50% of danish pregnant women on current treatment for thyroid disease had thyrotropin and/or free thyroxine outside the week-specific reference ranges, and the frequency of unidentified early pregnancy thyroid dysfunction in women clinically diagnosed after the pregnancy was also high.
heart_disease	aimthe burden of chronic kidney disease (ckd) is growing rapidly around the world. however, there is limited information on the overall regional prevalence of ckd, as well as the prognostic implications and treatment patterns in asian region. we have established the asian renal collaboration (arc) with the goal of consolidating region-wide data regarding ckd. methodsthis collaborative project will synthesize data and perform meta-analyses of observational studies conducted in asia. studies will be identified through a systematic literature search including abstracts, proceedings of meetings, electronic databases such as medline and embase. personal enquiry among collaborators and experts in the region will identify additional studies, or other data sources such as registries. both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that describe the prevalence of ckd and its complications will be included, as will longitudinal studies that describe important clinical outcomes for people with ckd. individual participant data will be sought, where possible, from each of the studies included in the collaboration for baseline parameters and subsequent outcomes, in order to maximize flexibility and consistency of data analyses. conclusionsthis study is an initiative offering a unique opportunity to obtain information about the prevalence and manifestations of ckd in asia, as well as its risk factors. the arc will also provide insights into important outcomes including progression of ckd, ckd complications, cardiovascular disease and death. these findings will improve our understanding of kidney disease in asia, and thus help inform service provision, preventive care and further research across the region.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	migraine is a brain disorder characterized by a piercing headache which affects one side of the head, located mainly at the temples and in the area around the eye. migraine imparts substantial suffering to the family in addition to the sufferer, particularly as it affects three times more women than men and is most prevalent between the ages of 25 and 45, the years of child rearing. migraine typically occurs in individuals with a genetic predisposition and is aggravated by specific environmental triggers. attempts to study the biochemistry of migraine began as early as the 1960s and were primarily directed at serotonin metabolism after an increase of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa), the main metabolite of serotonin was observed in urine of migraineurs. genetic and biochemical studies have primarily focused on the neurotransmitter serotonin, considering receptor binding, transport and synthesis of serotonin and have investigated serotonergic mediators including enzymes, receptors as well as intermediary metabolites. these studies have been mainly assayed in blood, csf and urine as the most accessible fluids. more recently pet imaging technology integrated with a metabolomics and a systems biology platform are being applied to study serotonergic biology. the general trend observed is that migraine patients have alterations of neurotransmitter metabolism detected in biological fluids with different biochemistry from controls, however the interpretation of the biological significance of these peripheral changes is unresolved. in this review we present the biology of the serotonergic system and metabolic routes for serotonin and discuss results of biochemical studies with regard to alterations in serotonin in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, platelets, plasma and urine of migraine patients.
parkinson's_disease	background: parkinson 's disease (pd) presently is conceptualized as a protein aggregation disease in which pathology involves both the enteric and the central nervous system, possibly spreading from one to another via the vagus nerves. as gastrointestinal dysfunction often precedes or parallels motor symptoms, the enteric system with its vast diversity of microorganisms may be involved in pd pathogenesis. alterations in the enteric microbial taxonomic level of l-dopa-naive pd patients might also serve as a biomarker. methods: we performed metagenomic shotgun analyses and compared the fecal microbiomes of 31 early stage, l-dopa-naive pd patients to 28 age-matched controls. results: we found increased verrucomicrobiaceae (akkermansia muciniphila) and unclassified firmicutes, whereas prevotellaceae (prevotella copri) and erysipelotrichaceae (eubacterium biforme) were markedly lowered in pd samples. the observed differences could reliably separate pd from control with a roc-auc of 0.84. functional analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in microbiota metabolism in pd involving the beta-glucuronate and tryptophan metabolism. while the abundances of prophages and plasmids did not differ between pd and controls, total virus abundance was decreased in pd participants. based on our analyses, the intake of either a mao inhibitor, amantadine, or a dopamine agonist (which in summary relates to 90% of pd patients) had no overall influence on taxa abundance or microbial functions. conclusions: our data revealed differences of colonic microbiota and of microbiota metabolism between pd patients and controls at an unprecedented detail not achievable through 16s sequencing. the findings point to a yet unappreciated aspect of pd, possibly involving the intestinal barrier function and immune function in pd patients. the influence of the parkinsonian medication should be further investigated in the future in larger cohorts.
allergies	background: cow 's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies affecting young children. a subset of milk-allergic individuals can eat baked milk without allergic symptoms which is beneficial in terms of prognostication and liberalization of the diet. a retrospective study suggested that skin prick testing (spt) with a baked milk (muffin) slurry may provide a sensitive means of predicting the outcome of a medically supervised baked milk oral food challenge. we evaluated the predictive value of spt with baked milk to identify unheated milk-allergic children who are able to safely eat baked milk. methods: children aged 2-16 years with a prior history of reaction to milk and a milk extract spt of 8-14 mm were recruited. investigator-blinded spt to muffin slurry and powdered milk in triplicate and specific ige (sige) to casein and milk were performed. graded oral challenge to egg-free baked milk muffins (total 2.6 gm milk protein) was performed in the hospital. reliability of tests was analyzed for intraclass correlation. statistical significance for clinical characteristics of population and muffin testing versus baked milk reactivity was calculated with fisher exact test for dichotomous and t-test for continuous variables. wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare immunological characteristics between individuals who tolerated or reacted to baked milk. fitted predicted probability curves and roc curves were generated. results: thirty-eight children were consented and 30 met study criteria. the muffin spt and casein sige were significantly different in those who passed versus failed baked milk challenge. negative (< 3 mm) baked milk tests were found in 8/30 children (27 %) and were associated with non-reactivity to baked milk (p = 0.01) with a sensitivity of 1 (0.70-1.00). all children with negative spt for baked milk passed the oral challenge. specificity was 0.41 (0.19-0.67). the optimal decision point for the muffin spt was 4 mm and the casein sige was 6 ku/l. the powdered milk test was not helpful. conclusions: skin prick testing with a baked milk (muffin) slurry may have a role in clinical practice to identify baked milk tolerance in milk-allergic patients.
allergies	exposures to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (pm2.5) may influence the risk of birth defects and make you allergic, which causes serious harm to human health. bamboo charcoal can adsorb harmful substances, that was of benefitto people 's health. in order to figure out the optimal adsorbtion condition and the intrinsic change of bamboo charcoal, five chemicals were adsorbed by bamboo charcoal and were analyzed by ft-ir. the optimal blast time was 80 min of na2so3, 100 min of na2s2o8, 20 min of na2so4, 120 min of fe-2(so4)(3) and 60 min or 100 min of s. ft-ir spectra showed that bamboo charcoal had five characteristic peaks of sas stretch, h2o stretch, o-h stretch, c=o stretch or c=c stretch, and no2 stretch at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 3430 cm(-1), 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1), respectively. for na2so3, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 3430 cm(-1), 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 20 min. for na2s2o8, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 3430 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min. for na2so4, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min. for fe-2(so4)(3), the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 120 min. for s, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1) and 3740 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min, the peaks at 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min. it proved that bamboo charcoal could remove sulfur powder from air to restrain sulfur allergies.

heart_disease	background: chronic, low-grade inflammation is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. the inflammatory impact of diet can be reflected by concentrations of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream and the inflammatory potential of diet can be estimated by the dietary inflammatory index (dii (tm)), which has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk in some previous studies. we aimed to examine the association between the dii and the risk of first myocardial infarction (mi) in a population-based study with long follow-up. method: we conducted a prospective case-control study of 1389 verified cases of first mi and 5555 matched controls nested within the population-based cohorts of the northern sweden health and disease study (nshds), of which the largest is the ongoing vasterbotten intervention programme (vip) with nearly 100 000 participants during the study period. median follow-up from recruitment to mi diagnosis was 6.4 years (6.2 for men and 7.2 for women). dii scores were derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire (ffq) administered in 1986-2006. multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci), using quartile 1 (most anti-inflammatory diet) as the reference category. for validation, general linear models were used to estimate the association between the dii scores and two inflammatory markers, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) and interleukin 6 (il-6) in a subset (n = 605) of the study population. results: male participants with the most pro-inflammatory dii scores had an increased risk of mi [orq4vsq1 = 1.57 (95% ci 1.21-2.02) p-trend = 0.02], which was essentially unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders, including cardiovascular risk factors [orq4vsq1 = 1.50 (95% ci 1.14-1.99), p-trend = 0.10]. no association was found between dii and mi in women. an increase of one dii score unit was associated with 9% higher hscrp (95% ci 0. 03-0.14) and 6% higher il-6 (95% ci 0.02-0.11) in 605 controls with biomarker data available. conclusion: a pro-inflammatory diet was associated with an elevated risk of first myocardial infarction in men; whereas for women the relationship was null. consideration of the inflammatory impact of diet could improve prevention of cardiovascular disease.
diabetes	introduction: although the risk factors for lung cancer are well documented, whether previous radiation therapy (rt) to treat breast cancer (bc) increases the incidence of second primary lung cancer remains unclear. we determined the overall incidence of second primary lung cancer after previous rt for all clinical stages of bc. methods: after an analysis of the longitudinal health insurance database, 986,713 individuals were randomly enrolled from 2000 to 2010 for cohort analysis. all women with newly diagnosed invasive bc, aged 18 years or older, and without other types of malignancy before 2000 or in the follow-up periods were enrolled and allocated to the rt or non-rt groups. age, comorbidities, insurance premium, urbanization level, location, date of event, and hospital care level were analyzed. the hazard ratios of parameters were calculated by cox regression analysis. results: a total of 7408 individuals met the inclusion criteria, including 5695 patients with bc who underwent rt and 128 (2.25%) in whom lung cancer developed. in contrast, lung cancer was diagnosed in only four of 1713 individuals in the non-rt group (0.23%) during the followup period. cox regression analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratio was 10.078 times higher in the rt group than in the non-rt group for individuals with previous bc. conclusions: the incidence of second primary lung cancer was significantly higher in the rt group than in the non-rt group for individuals with previous bc. patients with bc treated by rt should be extensively surveyed to assess the incidence of subsequent lung cancer.

birth_control	china 's one-child policy, introduced in the late 1970s, has been in effect for over three decades. this article reviews china 's low fertility rate and the implementation of this stringent birth control policy in the context of low fertility. first, china 's fertility intention, behavior, and low fertility level trend are presented. then, the official response to the low fertility level and the consequent misguided policy-making are investigated. next, various obstacles to the abolishment of the strict birth control policy are discussed, including national leaders' authority, related family planning regulations and laws, the inertia of this basic state policy under the auspices of the common good, the displacement of the family planning systems, and the necessity for social maintenance fees to keep grassroots governments in operation. after discussing the recent reform of this birth control policy in 2013 and the subsequent results, the incentives for a universal two-child policy are elucidated. these include the official acknowledgment of low fertility, the effect of birth control policy on fertility decline, the reactions of the general public, the attitudes of grassroots family planning cadres, the appeal from scholars, international experiences, the merging of population and family planning commissions, and national leaders' attitudes. the paper concludes with an analysis of the cost of this birth control policy over the past decades.
low_testosterone	background crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor active against alk, met, and ros1. we previously reported that crizotinib decreases testosterone in male patients. the detailed etiology of the effect, its symptomatic significance, and the effectiveness of subsequent testosterone replacement have not been previously reported. methods male cancer patients treated with crizotinib had total testosterone levels measured and results compared with non-crizotinib-treated patients. albumin, sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg), follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), and/or luteinizing hormone (lh) were tracked longitudinally. a subset of patients had free testosterone levels measured and a hypogonadal screening questionnaire administered. patients receiving subsequent testosterone supplementation were assessed for symptomatic improvement. results mean total testosterone levels were -25% below the lower limit of normal (lln) in 32 crizotinib-treated patients (27 of 32 patients below lln, 84%) compared with +29% above lln in 19 non-crizotinib-treated patients (6 of 19 below lln, 32%), p=.0012. levels of albumin and shbg (which both bind testosterone) declined rapidly with crizotinib, but so did fsh, lh, and free testosterone, suggesting a centrally mediated, true hypogonadal effect. mean free testosterone levels were -17% below lln (19 of 25 patients below lln, 76%). eighty-four percent (16 of 19) with low free levels, and 79% (19/24) with low total levels had symptoms of androgen deficiency. five of 9 patients (55%) with low testosterone given testosterone supplementation had improvement in symptoms, coincident with increases in testosterone above lln. conclusions symptoms of androgen deficiency and free or total/free testosterone levels should be tracked in male patients on crizotinib with consideration of testosterone replacement as appropriate. cancer 2013;119:2383-2390.

fungal_infection	background: the most optimal antifungal agent for empiric treatment of invasive fungal diseases (ifds) in febrile neutropenia is controversial. our objective was evaluate the relative efficacy of antifungals for all-cause mortality, fungal infection-related mortality and treatment response in this population. methods: pubmed, embase and cochrane library were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (rcts). two reviewers performed the quality assessment and extracted data independently. pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were conducted to compare the antifungals. results: seventeen rcts involving 4583 patients were included. risk of bias of included studies was moderate. pairwise meta-analysis indicated the treatment response rate of itraconazole was significantly better than conventional amphotericin b (rr = 1.33, 95% ci 1.10-1.61). network meta-analysis showed that amphotericin b lipid complex, conventional amphotericin b, liposomal amphotericin b, itraconazole and voriconazole had a significantly lower rate of fungal infection-related mortality than no antifungal treatment. other differences in outcomes among antifungals were not statistically significant. from the rank probability plot, caspofungin appeared to be the most effective agent for all-cause mortality and fungal infection-related mortality, whereas micafungin tended to be superior for treatment response. the results were stable after excluding rcts with high risk of bias, whereas micafungin had the lowest fungal infection-related mortality. conclusions: our results highlighted the necessity of empiric antifungal treatment and indicates that echinocandins appeared to be the most effective agents for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients based on mortality and treatment response. however, more studies are needed to determine the best antifungal agent for empiric treatment. our systematic review has been prospectively registered in prospero and the registration number was crd42015026629.
alzheimer's_disease	tauopathies encompass a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases featuring extensive neuronal death and cognitive decline. however, research over the past 30 years has failed to significantly advance our understanding of how tau causes dementia, limiting the design of rational therapeutics. it has become evident that we need to expand our understanding of tau in physiology, in order to delineate how tau may contribute to pathology. this review discusses recent evidence that has uncovered a novel aspect of tau function, based on its previously uncharacterized localization to the synapse. here, multiple streams of evidence support a critical role for synaptic tau in the regulation of synapse physiology. in particular, long-term depression, a form of synaptic weakening, is dependent on the presence of tau in hippocampal neurons. the regulation of tau by specific phosphorylation events downstream of gsk-3 beta activation appears to be integral to this signaling role. we also describe how the regulation of synapse physiology by tau and its phosphorylation may inform our understanding of tauopathies and comorbid diseases. this work should provide a platform for future tau biology research in addition to therapeutic design.
overactive_bladder	background: ao-dake-humi is a traditional japanese bamboo foot stimulator consisting of a half-pipe-shaped step made of bamboo used to stimulate the foot by stepping on it, and is commonly used to promote general health among the elderly in japan. however, its efficacy has not been reported in the scientific literature. this study was performed to investigate the role of ao-dake-humi focusing on lower urinary tract symptoms (luts), constipation, and hypersensitivity to cold (hc). methods: participants with luts, constipation, or hc were enrolled in this study. ao-dake-humi was used twice a day for 28 days. before and 28 days after starting ao-dake-humi use, international prostate symptom score (ipss), quality-of-life (qol) score, and overactive bladder symptom score (oabss) were measured to evaluate the efficacy of ao-dake-humi on luts. to evaluate the objective efficacy of ao-dake-humi on luts, a frequency-volume chart (fvc) was plotted in luts patients for 3 days. a visual analogue scale (vas) was used to evaluate the efficacy of ao-dake-humi on constipation (vas-constipation) and hc (vas-hc) in the participants with constipation or hc. results: a total of 24 participants were enrolled in this study. twenty-one participants had luts, 11 had constipation, and 17 participants had hc. ipss, especially storage-subscore, qol score and oabss, decreased significantly after use of ao-dake-humi. the use of ao-dake-humi increased maximal bladder capacity, resulting in a significant decrease in urinary frequency as determined from the fvc. in accordance with the results of vas-constipation and vas-hc, both constipation and hc were significantly relieved after ao-dake-humi use. conclusion: the results of this prospective pilot study indicated that ao-dake-humi is safe and has therapeutic efficacy in cases of luts, constipation and hc. the possibility of using ao-dake-humi as physical neuromodulation therapy was shown in the management of luts, constipation and hc.
parenting	locus of control is one of the most widely studied concepts in the history of personality psychology. in spite of its popularity and its associations with numerous relevant outcomes, the ability of locus of control to predict future behaviors involving parenting effectiveness has been under researched. the few parent locus of control children 's outcome studies are characterized by cross-sectional methodologies that focus on mothers. the present study uses a prospective methodology to compare data on mothers' and fathers' locus of control with their child 's behavior outcomes from a large scale research project, the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac). based on rotter 's social learning theory published in 1954 and past empirical research, it was predicted and found that parent internality was associated with more positive child outcomes than parent externality. more specifically, when both parents were internal, their children had more positive outcomes in sleeping, eating, and tantrum behavior as compared to any other parent locus of control combination. however external parents had a less restrictive attitude which appeared to have a more beneficial effect on picky eating. results confirmed how important parent locus of control is in the lives of children. based on the findings, researchers are urged to develop interventions to change advice to parents and promote more internal locus of control among parents.
low_testosterone	purpose of reviewthe purpose of this study is to review recent studies that examined the association of endogenous and exogenous testosterone and mortality in older men.recent findingsover the past several years, there has been a steep rise in testosterone prescriptions. the increased use of testosterone occurred in the context of several studies that reported an association between low serum testosterone and increased cardiovascular events and mortality. in contrast, recent studies have reported an association between testosterone treatment and adverse events. a testosterone treatment trial of mobility-impaired elderly men with prevalent cardiovascular disease was stopped due to increased cardiovascular events in the t-treated men and a meta-analysis reported increased cardiovascular events in t-treated men. in two recent large observational studies, testosterone treatment was associated with an increased risk for serious adverse cardiovascular events.summarylow testosterone is associated with mortality in multiple cohort studies; however, it is unclear if this is a causal association or due to low testosterone being a biomarker of poor health. given recent reports of adverse outcomes associated with testosterone treatment, a conservative use of testosterone is warranted in men with cardiovascular disease who may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes.
menopause	background: sensitive skin is a widespread condition, which is most frequently reported by women. changing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle and menopause have been suggested among the stimuli triggering sensitive skin. objectives: to investigate the perceived influence of fluctuating hormone levels on self-assessed sensitive skin, including symptoms and stimuli linked to skin sensitivity, as well as potential changes in facial and body skin and sensitive body parts, depending on hormonal status. patients and methods: a digital questionnaire was distributed to a population of women aged 20-65 years old. results: a total of 278 women were included in the analysis. about 42% premenopausal women declared a perception of (increased) skin sensitivity just before and during the menstrual cycle, while this was reported by almost 32% of peri-and postmenopausal women following the menopause. the majority of reported symptoms included the presence of bumps/pimples, dryness, itching, and redness, and the majority of reported stimuli were shaving, weather, toiletries, and emotions. no differences emerged regarding characteristics of facial and body skin across different hormonal status. significant differences in sensitivity of body parts emerged for the face and feet, reported by a larger percentage of premenopausalwomen and peri-and postmenopausalwomen, respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of the perceived effects of fluctuating hormone levels on self-assessed sensitive skin in women is high. these effects should be taken into consideration in skin testing and dermatological practice, and support the need for selecting personal care routine or treatment during the menstrual cycle and menopause.
hepatitis_c	broadly neutralizing antibodies have been associated with spontaneous clearance of the hepatitis c infection as well as viral persistence by immune escape. further study of neutralizing antibody epitopes is needed to unravel pathways of resistance to virus neutralization, and to identify conserved regions for vaccine design. all reported broadly neutralizing antibody (bnab) epitopes in the hcv envelope (e2) glycoprotein were identified. the critical contact residues of these epitopes were mapped onto the linear e2 sequence. all publicly available e2 sequences were then downloaded and the contact residues within the bnab epitopes were assessed for the level of conservation, as well as the frequency of occurrence of experimentally-proven resistance mutations. epitopes were also compared between two sequence datasets obtained fromsamples collected atwell-defined time points from acute (180 days) infections, to identify any significant differences in residue usage. the contact residues for all bnabswere containedwithin 3 linear regions of the e2 protein sequence. an analysis of 1749 full length e2 sequences frompublic databases showed that only 10 out of 29 experimentally-proven resistance mutations were present at a frequency >5%. comparison of subtype 1a viral sequences obtained from samples collected during acute or chronic infection revealed significant differences at positions 610 and 655 with changes in residue (p < 0.05), and at position 422 (p < 0.001) with a significant difference in variability (entropy). the majority of experimentally-described escape variants do not occur frequently in nature. the observed differences between acute and chronically isolated sequences suggest constraints on residue usage early in infection.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	introduction: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder which represents a major cost to healthcare services. ibs-d patients represent about one-third of the ibs population and are currently treated with antispasmodics, loperamide, bile acid sequestrants and antidepressants. alosetron and rifaximin are also available in usa, ramosetron in japan, korea and thailand and ondansetron as an off-label treatment. areas covered: this article focuses on eluxadoline, a novel pharmacological agent that has recently been approved by both the fda and ema for treatment of patients with ibs-d. expert commentary: the efficacy and safety of eluxadoline in treating bowel habit alterations and pain, both in the short and long-term, make the drug a welcome addition to our therapeutic alternatives in ibs-d. its positioning in any ibs algorithm will depend on the 'real world' prevalence of the small risk of sphincter of oddi spasm and mild pancreatitis.
birth_control	the concept of family planning originated as birth control in 1912 to control the size of the family and prevent unplanned pregnancies transformed to family welfare and later on expanded its horizons to reproductive and child health (rch). a wide spectrum of choices both for male and female, temporary and permanent, have been developed and offered. developed world having stabilised population faces problem with teenage and adolescent pregnancies. developing nations are still struggling to stabilise population and traditionally depend on permanent female sterilisation as a major method of contraception. lot of unmet need is seen in young recently married women, post-delivery, post-abortal states. long-acting reversible contraception which includes intrauterine device, iud, and implants has re-emerged strongly as a first choice of contraception for women of all ages including unmarried teenage pregnancies. they are highly efficient with failure rates equivalent or better than permanent methods, cost-effective, reversible, and have the potential to replace permanent sterilisation.
menopause	background: due to the hormonal changes in postmenopausal women they are prone for many complications like increased cvd risk factors, osteoporosis, obesity, mood swings and urinary incontinence. physical inactivity in postmenopausal women leads to higher risk of developing cvd and osteoporosis. the objective was to find out the correlation of physical activity level with bmd, cardio-respiratory fitness and body composition in post-menopausal women methods: 42 postmenopausal women were included. a detailed clinical evaluation with physical activity level (ipaqmets-mins/ week),, bmd (t-scores), body composition (bmi, waist circumference, bia & skin fold calliper for fat %), cardio-respiratory fitness was measured by balke protocol and vo2peak (ml/kg/min) is estimated. correlation of physical activity level with bmd, cardio-respiratory fitness and body composition were analysed using ""pearson 's product moment correlation co-efficient and spearman 's rho."" results: spearman 's rank correlation rho for ipaq with vo2 peak was 0.420, bmi was -0.388 and visceral fat was -0.384 indicating moderate positive correlation between ipaq and cardio-respiratory fitness and weak negative correlation between ipaq and bmi and visceral fat. pearson 's product moment correlation coefficient of ipaq with bmd was 0.147, body fat was -0.234 and waist circumference was -0.256 indicating no correlation. p value was significant for correlation of ipaq with crf (0.006), bmi (0.011) and visceral fat (0.012). conclusion: there is moderate positive correlation between ipaq and cardio-respiratory fitness, weak negative correlation between ipaq and bmi and visceral fat and no correlation between ipaq and bmd, body fat and waist circumference.
birth_control	the interpretation of 1 cor. 7 in terms of an ideal of sexual asceticism has been widely critiqued and fallen out of favor. the majority of scholars explain paul 's preference for celibacy in terms of its expedience (1) for serving the lord (cf. 7.32-35) and (2) for avoiding 'affliction in earthly life' (cf. 7.28). against the latter reason to prefer celibacy, this article argues that paul associates procreation, not marriage, with affliction, and that he warns those who marry in order to procreate to expect affliction in the last days. marriage and sex are (now) simply to avoid 'burning' with sexual desire, leading to sexual immorality, not for having children. in support, paul abandons the traditional obligation of procreation and procreative sex and permits sexual abstinence 'by agreement, for a period [fit for something] in order to devote yourselves to prayer' (7.5b). the unstated purpose here is to spare the corinthians affliction as a result of having children in the coming days, as expected in some apocalyptic texts which also refer to the use of birth control and family planning to avoid suffering and death.
cancer	starting from 3 beta-acetoxy-17a-homo-17-oxa-androst-5-en-16-one (1) and in the reaction with n-bromoacetamide (nba) and perchloric acid, the 5 alpha-bromo-6 beta-hydroxy (2), 5 beta,6 beta-epoxy (3) and 5 alpha,6 beta-dibromo (4) derivatives were obtained. the structure of compounds 2-4, particularly stereochemistry at c5 and c6, is established by detailed nmr and x-ray analysis. the in vitro antiproliferative activity of newly synthesized compounds 2-4 against six human tumor cell lines was evaluated. all three compounds showed a significant toxicity toward hormone-independent breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 and cervical carcinoma cells hela, while dibromo derivative 4 was active toward five human cancer cell lines. these new 5,6-disubstituted-d-homolactone steroidal compounds have also displayed selectivity toward cancerous cell lines against inactivity found for noncancerous control cell line. this selectivity was not found for control compound, well-known chemotherapy drug cisplatin.
emergency_contraception	with minimal information on sexual health provision during mass-gathering events, our aim was to describe the use of sexual health, contraceptive, sex worker and sexual assault services during the london 2012 olympics. we analysed data from five sources. one contraceptive service provider reported a 10% increase in attendance during the main games, while emergency contraception prescriptions rose during the main olympics, compared to the week before, but were similar or lower than at the beginning and end of the summer period. a health telephone advice line reported a 16% fall in sexual health-related calls during the main olympics, but a 33% increase subsequently. london sexual assault referral centres reported that 1.8% of sexual assaults were olympics-linked. a service for sex workers reported that 16% started working in the sex industry and 7% moved to london to work during the olympics. fifty-eight per cent and 45% of sex workers reported fewer clients and an increase in police crack-downs, respectively. our results show a change in activity across these services during the 2012 summer, which may be associated with the olympics. our data are a guide to other services when anticipating changes in service activity and planning staffing for mass-gathering events.
multiple_sclerosis	we evaluated the brain volume and rate of atrophy in 85 japanese patients with multiple sclerosis (ms). the mean brain volume was smaller and the rate of atrophy appeared to be more rapid in ms patients than in normal subjects. the brain atrophy seemed to exist from the early stage of ms and was prominent in the grey matter. patients with progressive ms showed severer atrophy. we show the existence of pathological brain atrophy in japanese ms patients for the first time, although the rate of atrophy may be much slower than in caucasian patients.

hepatitis_c	background: screening large numbers of persons in a population with low prevalence of a disease leads to many false-positives. however, populations with low hcv prevalence may sometimes be recommended for hcv screening, for instance patients or healthcare workers after a possible healthcare-related exposure. objectives: we determined the percentage of true vs false-positive hcv antibody (anti-hcv) test results among 2007-2012 participants in the national health and nutrition examination study (nhanes), a nationally representative study with approximately 1% hcv infection prevalence, much lower than in groups typically recommended for hcv screening. study design: anti-hcv test confirmation was performed using a recombinant immunoblot assay (riba) test and follow-up hcv rna testing. results: overall, of 22,359 nhanes participants tested, 479 (2%) were anti-hcv screening reactive and 477 were tested for riba; of these 323 (68%) confirmed as true positive and 105 (22%) were false-positives. many others (49, 10%) were riba indeterminate and likely false-positive. because of these false positive tests, the overall prevalence of chronic infection among those testing anti-hcv screening reactive was much lower (218, 51%) than would be expected due to disease clearance alone (approximately 80%). conclusions: all screening anti-hcv positive tests should be followed by an hcv rna test, in order to confirm whether the patient has current infection so that infected persons can be referred to care and treatment to avoid the significant morbidity and mortality associated with chronic hcv infection. published by elsevier b.v.
myelofibrosis	purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between peripheral cd34(+) and bone marrow cd34(+) levels and the clinicopathologic characteristics and laboratory parameters of myeloproliferative disease (mpd) patients. patients and methods: a total of 103 mpd patients were enrolled in this study. we examined the relationship between bone marrow cd34(+) and peripheral cd34(+) levels and the patients' clinicopathologic and laboratory parameters. results: there were no significant correlations between the peripheral cd34(+) levels and the jak-2 v617f mutation, thrombosis, white blood cells (wbc), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), transferrin saturation (ts), ferritin, or bone marrow cellularity. in addition, there were no significant correlations between bone marrow cd34(+) levels and the jak-2 v617f mutation, thrombosis, wbc, ldh, ts, ferritin, or bone marrow cellularity (p >0.05). we did not identify any significant relationship between peripheral cd34(+) and bone marrow cd34(+) levels (p >0.05). however, there were significant correlations between peripheral cd34(+) levels and bone marrow fibrosis (p < 0.001), between bone marrow cd34(+) levels and constitutional symptoms (p < 0.05), and between bone marrow cd34(+) levels and bone marrow fibrosis (p < 0.001). conclusion: we did not find any significant relationship between the clinicopathologic and laboratory characteristics and peripheral and bone marrow cd34(+) cells from bone marrow fibrosis patients. there was also no significant relationship between bone marrow cd34(+) cells and peripheral cd34(+) cells. some peripheral cd34(+) cells may originate from the spleen rather than the bone marrow, which may given us different result of some parameters.
parkinson's_disease	background & aims: falls are a major threat for patients with parkinson 's disease, as they are associated with higher risk of morbidity, loss of functional ability, institutionalization, and mortality. metabolic syndrome (mets) is associated with poorer physical performance in middle age, but its impact in the older and frailer subjects is unclear. the present study aimed at assessing the association of mets with falls in patients with parkinson 's disease. methods: we analyzed data of 194 elderly with parkinson 's disease attending a geriatric day hospital. history of falls that occurred over the last year, as well as and the number of falls, were recorded. metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the national cholesterol education program 's atp-iii criteria. results: falls were reported by 91 participants (47%). logistic regression analysis showed that mets was associated with reduced occurrence of falls (or = .26; 95% ci = .10.69; p = .007). also, among participants who fell, poisson regression indicated that mets predicted a reduced number of falls (irr = .43; 95% ci = .20.89; p = .024). conclusions: in our population mets was associated with reduced probability of falls; among subjects who fell, mets was associated with a reduced number of falls. dedicated studies are needed to better understand the subsystems involved, as well as the therapeutic implications of such an association.

overactive_bladder	objectiveto evaluate the efficacy, safety, and optimum dose of once-daily oxybutynin patch for overactive bladder. methodsa randomized double-blind trial was conducted in patients with overactive bladder symptoms for 24weeks, who received an oxybutynin patch (73.5 or 105mg) or placebo once daily for 8weeks. the primary endpoint was the change in the daily frequency of micturition from baseline to the end of study. resultsa total of 579 patients were randomized to the placebo group (n=164), 73.5mg oxybutynin patch group (n=166), and 105mg oxybutynin patch group (n=165). the frequency of micturition (meanstandard deviation) decreased by 1.19 +/- 1.80 in the placebo group, 1.87 +/- 1.93 in the 73.5mg group, and 1.80 +/- 1.76 in the 105mg group. compared with the placebo group, micturition decreased significantly in the 73.5mg and 105mg groups (t-test: p=0.0025 and 0.0039, respectively), while the decrease was similar in both oxybutynin groups. the oxybutynin groups showed significant improvement of urgency, urge incontinence, incontinence, nocturia, mean voided volume, and five or six domains of the king 's health questionnaire. dry mouth was noted in 12.1% of the 73.5mg group and 13.3% of the 105mg group. constipation was comparable between the oxybutynin groups and the placebo group. application site reactions were less frequent in the 73.5mg group than the 105mg group. conclusion: the efficacy of oxybutynin patch was confirmed, and the optimum dose for japanese patients with overactive bladder was 73.5mg.
emergency_contraception	this paper is a response to dr. kathleen raviele 's recent article on her critical analysis of the use of levonorgestrel given to women postsexual assault and her suggestion that the use of meloxicam may be an ethical alternative.
allergies	food allergy is a common health problem worldwide, with increasing prevalence during recent decades. the only approved treatments for food allergy are food avoidance and administration of emergency medications in case of accidental exposure, which negatively affects patients' quality of life, so new treatments are highly desirable. different food immunotherapy modalities have recently been used, with variable success rates in the induction of desensitization and tolerance, and different numbers and types of adverse reactions. adverse reactions, especially intolerable gastrointestinal symptoms, are the most important causes of immunotherapy withdrawal. eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported as a complication of milk, egg, and peanut oral immunotherapies and sublingual immunotherapy for respiratory allergies, but not for food allergies. eosinophilic gastritis and eosinophilic colitis also rarely happened following egg and milk oral immunotherapies. the patients undergoing oral and sublingual immunotherapies should be closely followed up for a long time, and those with gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated by endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract. these complications are usually reversible after early diagnosis and stopping the immunotherapy protocol.

menopause	background: previous studies of mostly western women have reported inconsistent findings on the association between age at menarche and risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). little is known about the association in china where there has been a large intergenerational decrease in women 's mean age at menarche. methods: the china kadoorie biobank recruited 302,632 women aged 30-79 (mean 50.5) years in 2004-8 from 10 diverse regional sites across china. during 7 years follow-up, 14,111 incident cases of stroke, 14,093 of coronary heart disease (chd), and 3200 cvd deaths were reported among 281,491 women who had no prior history of cvd at baseline. cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) relating age at menarche to cvd risks. results: the mean (sd) age of menarche was 15.4 (1.9) years, decreasing from 16.2 (2.0) among women born before 1940 to 14.7 (1.6) for those born during the 1960s-1970s. the patterns of association between age at menarche and cvd risk appeared to differ between different birth cohorts, with null associations in older generations but u-shaped or weak positive associations in younger women, especially those born after the 1960s. after minimizing the potential confounding effects from major cvd risk factors, both early and late menarche, compared with menarche at age 13 years, were associated with increased risk of cvd morbidity and mortality, which was more pronounced in younger generations. conclusion: among chinese women the associations between age at menarche and risk of cvd differed by birth cohort, suggesting other factors may underpin the association.

fungal_infection	pythiosis is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the pathogenic oomycete pythium insidiosum. this study is the first to evaluate the p. insidiosum glucan content and its biological activities. the enzymatic quantification of the glucans in p. insidiosum mycelia showed that the beta-glucan content was 18.99%+/- 3.59. the cell wall polysaccharide extract consisted of similar to 81.7% carbohydrates (exclusively glucose) and similar to 18.3% residual amino acids and peptides. the results from monosaccharide composition, methylation and 1d/2d nmr spectroscopy analyses indicated the presence of a highly branched (1,3)(1,6)-beta-d-glucan, with (1,6)-beta-d-glucopyranosil side-branching unit on average every 1-2 repeat units. in vitro, the beta-d-glucan extract could significantly promote spleen lymphocyte proliferation in human, equine and mouse cell cultures. balb/c mice that were subcutaneously pre-immunized with three doses of 0.5, 2.5 and 5.0 mg of beta-glucan/mouse, showed a significant increase in il-2, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha and il-17a production compared to non-immunized mice. these results suggested that beta-d-glucan extract induces significant and specific th17 cellular immune response and provided the theoretical basis for further experiments.

fungal_infection	lung transplant recipients (ltr) are at high risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (scc). voriconazole exposure after lung transplant has recently been reported as a risk factor for scc. we sought to study the relationship between fungal prophylaxis with voriconazole and the risk of scc in sequential cohorts from a single center. we evaluated 400 adult ltr at ucla between 7/1/2005 and 12/22/2012. on 7/1/2009, our center instituted a protocol switch from targeted to universal antifungal prophylaxis for at least 6 months post-transplant. using cox proportional hazards models, time to scc was compared between targeted (n = 199) and universal (n = 201) prophylaxis cohorts. cox models were also used to assess scc risk as a function of time-dependent cumulative exposure to voriconazole and other antifungal agents. the risk of scc was greater in the universal prophylaxis cohort (hr 2.02, p < 0.01). voriconazole exposure was greater in the universal prophylaxis cohort, and the cumulative exposure to voriconazole was associated with scc (hr 1.75, p < 0.01), even after adjustment for other important scc risk factors. voriconazole did not increase the risk of advanced tumors. exposure to other antifungal agents was not associated with scc. voriconazole should be used cautiously in this population.
low_testosterone	androgens play a pivotal role in cardiovascular function and their effects differ between men and women' in postmenopausal women, testosterone replacement within physiological levels is associated with overall well-being. however, a definitive explanation as to how androgens have an impact on cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women and whether they may be used for cardiovascular treatment has yet to be established. with these aims, a systematic review of the existing studies on the link between androgens and cardiovascular disease and the effects of testosterone therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in postmenopausal women has been conducted. the few existing studies on cardiovascular outcomes in postmenopausal women indicate no effect or a deleterious effect of increasing androgens and increased cardiovascular risk. however, there is evidence of a favorable effect of androgens on surrogate cardiovascular markers in postmenopausal women, such as high density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, body fat mass and triglycerides. further studies are therefore needed to clarify the impact of therapy with androgens on cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women. the cardiovascular effect of testosterone or methyltestosterone with or without concomitant estrogens needs to be elucidated.
menopause	over the last few decades, reproductive medicine has observed an improvement in the management and outcome of pregnancy in connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). however, pregnancy and related issues remain a challenge in these patients. in routine clinical practice, health professionals dealing with sle and aps need to consider the numerous aspects of the reproductive life of their patients, such as pregnancy, family planning, fertility, contraception, cancer surveillance, and menopause. the new european league against rheumatism recommendations for women 's health and family planning reflect the need for a novel approach to communication in the patient-physician relationship. preconception counseling is essential to ensure optimal pregnancy outcomes through a careful risk stratification involving disease activity, organ involvement, autoantibody profile, use of drugs, and previous pregnancy outcomes, as well as to ensure better preventive and therapeutic strategies to limit complications. in patients with stable/inactive disease and low risk of thrombosis, adequate hormonal contraception and menopausal replacement therapy should be recommended. assisted reproductive techniques can be safely used in these patients, but anticoagulation or low-dose aspirin (or both) should be added in those with positive antiphospholipid antibody titers. all menstruating women should be counseled on the possibility to preserve fertility with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues if receiving alkylating agents. strict clinical, serological, laboratory, and multidisciplinary monitoring during pregnancy is mandatory to early recognize and effectively treat disease flares or obstetric complications. doppler ultrasonography and fetal biometry should be regularly performed, especially in the second and third trimesters. physicians should recommend screening for cervical dysplasia related to human papillomavirus (hpv) infection, especially during immunosuppressive therapy, and hpv immunization can be used in women with stable/inactive disease.
emergency_contraception	to describe the presentation and fertility sparing treatment of a young woman found to have a steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified (nos) and her spontaneous pregnancy and delivery shortly after surgery. a 20-year-old hispanic female presented with hirsuitism, virilization, and elevated androgen levels (testosterone 328 ng/dl) and was wrongly diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. four months later she sought a second opinion. her androgens were as follows: testosterone level 485 ng/dl, androstenedione 1,738 ng/dl and dhea 1,459 ng/dl. she had normal levels of progesterone, estradiol, and dhea-so4. on transvaginal ultrasound she had a solid-appearing right ovarian mass. she underwent fertility sparing surgery with a laparoscopic right oophorectomy. gross and histological pathology confirmed a benign steroid cell tumor nos. she had rapid normalization of all androgens 13 days after surgery. she had spontaneous resumption of menses 4 months later. she conceived despite using emergency contraception approximately 9 months following surgery and delivered a healthy boy at term without complication. prompt evaluation for an androgen producing tumor should be performed when testosterone levels are greater than 200 ng/dl. pregnancy following removal of this rare tumor has not previously been reported.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	understanding how intestinal enteropathogens cause acute and chronic alterations has direct animal and human health perspectives. significant advances have been made on this field by studies focusing on the dynamic crosstalk between the intestinal protozoan parasite model giardia duodenalis and the host intestinal mucosa. the concept of intestinal barrier function is of the highest importance in the context of many gastrointestinal diseases such as infectious enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and post-infectious gastrointestinal disorders. this crucial function relies on 3 biotic and abiotic components, first the commensal microbiota organized as a biofilm, then an overlaying mucus layer, and finally the tightly structured intestinal epithelium. herein we review multiple strategies used by giardia parasite to circumvent these 3 components. we will summarize what is known and discuss preliminary observations suggesting how such enteropathogen directly and/or indirectly impairs commensal microbiota biofilm architecture, disrupts mucus layer and damages host epithelium physiology and survival.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	loss of cell polarity impairs organ development and function; it can also serve as one of the first triggers for oncogenesis. in 2006-2007 two groups simultaneously reported the existence of a special pathway for maintaining epithelial polarity in the face of environmental stressors. in this pathway, ampk, a key sensor of metabolic stress stabilizes tight junctions, preserves cell polarity, and thereby, maintains epithelial barrier functions. accumulating evidence since has shown that pharmacologic activation of ampk by metformin protects the epithelial barrier against multiple environmental and pathological stressful states and suppresses tumorigenesis. how ampk protects the epithelium remained unknown until recently aznar et al. identified giv/girdin as a novel effector of ampk at the cell-cell junctions; phosphorylation of giv at a single site by ampk appears to be both necessary and sufficient for strengthening tight junctions and preserving cell polarity and epithelial barrier function in the face of energetic stress. here we review the fundamentals of this specialized signaling pathway that buttresses cell-cell junctions against stress-induced collapse and discuss its pathophysiologic relevance in the context of a variety of diseases, including cancers, diabetes, aging, and the growing list of beneficial effects of the ampk-activator, metformin.
hypothyroidism	congenital hypothyroidism (ch) is one of the most common causes of preventable mental retardation. thyroid hormone has an essential role in the brain development during the first 2-3 years of life. incidence of ch is 1:3000-1:4000 live births, but there is evidence that its incidence is increasing. majority of newborn babies do not exhibit obvious clinical signs and symptoms until the age of 3 months due to either some residual thyroid function or transplacental passage of maternal thyroid hormone. common clinical symptoms include lethargy, sleepiness, poor feeding, constipation, and prolonged jaundice. other common findings on clinical examination include macroglossia, large fontanels, umbilical hernia, and hypotonia. neonatal screening for ch is practiced in the developed countries for the last three decades, and various studies show that normal cognitive function is attainable with early detection and treatment. this review discusses different protocols being used for screening. it highlights recent recommendation of screening and retesting cutoffs. thyroid imaging can help in differentiating underlying etiology, either thyroid dysgenesis or dyshormonogenesis. treatment with levothyroxine (l-t4) 10-15 mcg/kg should be started immediately after diagnosis without delaying for imaging purposes. frequent and vigilant monitoring with l-t4 dose adjustment is mandatory in infancy and childhood to achieve normal physical growth and neurodevelopment. children with ch are followed by different pediatric specialties including general pediatricians, neonatologists, developmental pediatricians, and endocrinologists and in primary care; therefore, it is essential to increase the awareness of monitoring protocols among all physicians.
multiple_sclerosis	post exertion malaise is one of the most debilitating aspects of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, yet the neurobiological consequences are largely unexplored. the objective of the study was to determine the neural consequences of acute exercise using functional brain imaging. fifteen female myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients and 15 healthy female controls completed 30 min of submaximal exercise (70% of peak heart rate) on a cycle ergometer. symptom assessments (e.g. fatigue, pain, mood) and brain imaging data were collected one week prior to and 24 h following exercise. functional brain images were obtained during performance of: 1) a fatiguing cognitive task - the paced auditory serial addition task, 2) a non-fatiguing cognitive task - simple number recognition, and 3) a non fatiguing motor task - finger tapping. symptom and exercise data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests. cognitive performance data were analyzed using mixed-model analysis of variance with repeated measures. brain responses to fatiguing and non-fatiguing tasks were analyzed using linear mixed effects with cluster-wise (101-voxels) alpha of 0.05. myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients reported large symptom changes compared to controls (effect size >= 0.8, p0.05). however, patients exercised at significantly lower watts and reported greater exertion and leg muscle pain (p < 0.05). for cognitive performance, a significant group by time interaction (p < 0.05), demonstrated pre- to post-exercise improvements for controls and worsening for patients. brain responses to finger tapping did not differ between groups at either time point. during number recognition, controls exhibited greater brain activity (p < 0.05) in the posterior cingulate cortex, but only for the pre-exercise scan. for the paced serial auditory addition task, there was a significant group by time interaction (p < 0.05) with patients exhibiting increased brain activity from pre- to postexercise compared to controls bilaterally for inferior and superior parietal and cingulate cortices. changes in brain activity were significantly related to symptoms for patients (p < 0.05). acute exercise exacerbated symptoms, impaired cognitive performance and affected brain function in myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome patients. these converging results, linking symptom exacerbation with brain function, provide objective evidence of the detrimental neurophysiological effects of post-exertion malaise. published by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license.
diabetes	gut microbiota lps contributes to obesity-related chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, promoting insulin resistance. periodontal disease also represents a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and is associated with obesity. this study compared the effect of lps from p gingivalis periodontopathogen and e. coil enterobacteria on inflammatory adipokine secretion and redox status of 3t3-l1 adipocytes. we found that both lps activated tlr2- and tlr4-mediated signaling pathways involving myd88 adaptor and nfkb transcription factor, leading to an increased secretion of leptin, resistin, il-6 and mcp-1. these effects were partly blocked by inhibitors targeting p38 mapk, jnk and erk. moreover, p. gingivalis lps reduced adiponectin secretion. both lps also enhanced ros production and the expression of nox2, nox4 and inos genes. p gingivalis lps altered catalase gene expression. collectively, these results showed that lps of periodontal bacteria induced pro-inflammatory adipokine secretory profile and oxidative stress in adipocytes which may participate to obesity-related insulin resistance.

hypothyroidism	primary hypothyroidism usually leads to retardation of linear growth and delay or even arrest of puberty in juvenile patients. in rare cases, pediatric patients with hypothyroidism may present with signs of vanwyk-grumbach 's syndrome (vwgs), which includes juvenile hypothyroidism, delayed bone age and pseudoprecocious puberty. the present study reported on a rare case of vwgs and other complications, including obesity, short stature, hepatomegaly and pituitary hyperplasia. in addition, a comprehensive literature review was performed to illustrate the treatment and outcome of vwgs in pediatric patients. the present study contributed to the current knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment of vwgs in pediatric patients.
allergies	the objective is to examine the prevalence and health-care costs associated with asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, food allergies, and diabetes in children aged 0-18 years. prevalence was calculated using 2005-2012 medical expenditure panel survey (meps) data, a population-based, nationally representative sample. using meps, two-part models estimated the cost of each condition for all children while controlling for sociodemographic categories. prevalence rates varied by race and ethnicity across conditions. females had higher prevalence of all chronic conditions, except epilepsy. an additional us$1,377.60-us$9,059.49 annually were spent on medical expenses for children aged 0-18 years, with asthma, diabetes, or epilepsy compared to children without these conditions. this is the first study to examine the costs and prevalence of chronic health conditions in children and adolescents using a single data set. understanding the odds of having a condition by sociodemographic categories highlights disparities that can potentially inform school nurses on the best allocation of resources to serve students.
fungal_infection	c-type lectins (ctls) represent the most complex family of animal/human lectins that comprises 17 different groups. during evolution, ctls have developed by diversification to cover a broad range of glycan ligands. however, ligand binding by ctls is not necessarily restricted to glycans as some ctls also bind to proteins, lipids, inorganic molecules, or ice crystals. ctls share a common fold that harbors a ca2+ for contact to the sugar and about 18 invariant residues in a phylogenetically conserved pattern. in vertebrates, ctls have numerous functions, including serum glycoprotein homeostasis, pathogen sensing, and the initiation of immune responses. myeloid ctls in innate immunity are mainly expressed by antigen-presenting cells and play a prominent role in the recognition of a variety of pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. however, myeloid ctls such as the macrophage inducible ctl (mincle) or clec-9a may also bind to self-antigens and thus contribute to immune homeostasis. while some ctls induce pro-inflammatory responses and thereby lead to activation of adaptive immune responses, other ctls act as inhibitory receptors and dampen cellular functions. since ctls are key players in pathogen recognition and innate immunity, targeting ctls may be a promising strategy for cell-specific delivery of drugs or vaccine antigens and to modulate immune responses.
allergies	undeclared allergens in chocolate products have been responsible for numerous allergen-related recalls in the united states. a survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of undeclared milk and peanut in 88 and 78 dark chocolate bars, respectively. concentrations of milk (as nonfat dry milk) or peanut in three samples of each chocolate product were determined with two milk-or peanut-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. in 75% of the chocolate bar products with a milk advisory statement, milk concentrations were above the limit of quantitation (2.5 mu g/g [ppm]), with the majority having concentrations >1,000 ppm. an additional 67% of chocolate bars with a ""traces of milk"" statement contained 3 to 6,700 ppm of milk. fifteen percent of chocolates labeled dairy free or lactose free and 25% labeled vegan were positive for milk, all with concentrations >1,000 ppm. even for chocolates with no reference to milk on the label, 33% of these products contained 60 to 3,400 ppm of milk. the survey of chocolate products for peanuts revealed that 8% of products with an advisory statement contained peanut, with the highest concentration of 550 ppm. all nine chocolates bearing the peanut-free or allergen-free statement were negative for peanut, but 17% of chocolates with no label statement for peanut were positive for peanut at concentrations of 9 to 170 ppm. evaluation of multiple lots of four chocolate products revealed that milk was consistently present or absent for the products investigated, but mixed results were obtained when multiple lots were tested for peanut. this study indicates that a large proportion of dark chocolate bars contain undeclared milk. the type of advisory statement or the absence of a milk advisory statement on products did not predict the amount or absence of milk protein. in contrast, a lower proportion of chocolates containing undeclared peanut was found. consumers with food allergies should be cautious when purchasing dark chocolate products, particularly those that have an advisory label statement.
birth_control	this article provides an overview of the historical arguments surrounding reproductive health policy and current policy initiatives. because reproductive policy itself is a vast subject matter with sometimes blurry boundaries, the struggle concerning the advent of birth control is used to illustrate the historic complexities of policy affecting such a wide array of individuals. the battle over introduction of the birth control pill is pertinent because the very same arguments are used today in debates over reproductive health policy.
hypothyroidism	background: subclinical hypothyroidism (sch) and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (cat) are linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (chd). the aim of this study was to look for positive markers of chd and correlations with thyroid blood tests in patients with sch or cat, but no symptoms of chd, so as to identify chd risk conditions that otherwise would likely be missed. methods: we measured a series of thyroid, clinical-metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in 30 consecutive endocrinology patients enrolled in our ambulatory endocrinological referral center of ""sapienza"" university of rome. (19 with cat, 11 with sch) from january 2015 to march 2015. 13 asymptomatic subjects were enrolled as controls. in each patient, we measured a series of 34 thyroid, clinical-metabolic and cardiovascular parameters. results: in the statistical analysis of collected data, the oblique principal components clustering procedure (opc) revealed the presence of an interesting mixed cluster, composed of a thyroid parameter (tpo-ab), a metabolic parameter (homocysteine level) and a cardiovascular parameter (mapse), in which we assessed the relationships between the single components. our preliminary results indicate that in both groups of patients elevated tpo-ab, when accompanied by reduced mapse and increased imt and homocysteine values, may be taken to indicate the presence of clinically unrecognized chd. conclusions: confirmation of these results in larger series of patients could justify hormone therapy for prevention of chd in these thyroid patients versus placebo treatment.

hypothyroidism	the occurrence of thyroid disorders relies on i nutrition and monitoring of all populations is recommended. measuring i in urine is standard but thyroglobulin in serum is an alternative. this led us to assess the reliability of studies using serum thyroglobulin compared with urinary i to assess the i nutrition level and calculate the number of participants needed in a study with repeated data sampling in the same individuals for 1 year. diet, supplement use and life style factors were assessed by questionnaires. we measured thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin antibodies in serum and i in urine. participants were thirty-three caucasians and sixty-four inuit living in greenland aged 30-49 years. serum thyroglobulin decreased with rising i excretion (kendall 's tau -029, p = 0005) and did not differ with ethnicity. variation in individuals was lower for serum-thyroglobulin than for urinary i (mean individual cv: 151 v. 461 %; p < 001). it required 245 urine samples to be 95 % certain of having a urinary i excretion within 10 % of the true mean of the population. for serum-thyroglobulin the same precision required 206 samples. in an individual ten times more samples were needed to depict i deficiency when using urinary i excretion compared with serum-thyroglobulin. in conclusion, more participants are need to portray i deficiency in a population when using urinary i compared with serum-thyroglobulin,and about ten times more samples are needed in an individual. adding serum-thyroglobulin to urinary i may inform surveys of i nutrition by allowing subgroup analysis with similar reliability.
alzheimer's_disease	early-onset alzheimer 's disease (eoad) is characterized by greater nonmemory dysfunctions, more rapid progression, and greater hypometabolism and atrophy than late-onset ad (load). we sought to investigate the differences in tau accumulation patterns between early-and late-onset patients with ad and mild cognitive impairment (mci). in 90 patients who completed f-18-av-1451 and f-18-florbetaben positron emission tomography scans, only 59 amyloid-positive patients (11 eoad, 10 eomci, 21 load, and 17 lomci) were included in this study. we compared cortical f-18-av-1451 binding between each patient group and corresponding amyloid-negative age-matched controls. in contrast to no difference in cortical binding between the eomci and lomci groups, eoad showed greater binding in the parieto-occipital cortex than load. the parieto-occipital binding correlated with visuospatial dysfunction in the eoad spectrum, whereas binding in the temporal cortex correlated with verbal memory dysfunction in the load spectrum. our findings suggest that distinct topographic distribution of tau may influence the nature of cognitive impairment in eoad patients.

cancer	albumin-bound paclitaxel colloidal nanoparticle (abraxane((r))) is an fda approved anticancer formulation available in the market. it is a suspension which is currently used therapeutically for treating cancers of the breast, lung, and pancreas among others. cdf is a novel new and potent synthetic curcumin analogue that is widely used for breast and ovarian cancer. the aim of this study was to use biocompatible albumin as well as folate decorated albumin to formulate colloidal nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin difluorinated (cdf). cdf has demonstrated a 16-fold improvement in stability and remarkable anticancer potency compared to its natural derivative, curcumin. cdf showed marked inhibition of cancer cell growth through down-regulation of multiple mirnas, up-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten), and attenuation of histone methyl transferase ezh2. however, cdf is highly hydrophobic and photodegradable with sparing aqueous solubility. in this study, we have formulated albumin
headache	objective: in children, lateral sinus thrombosis (lst) following minor head injury (mhi) has occasionally been reported because of neuroimaging techniques. however, the condition is rare, and its pathophysiology remains unknown. we aimed to identify the factors associated with its etiology and severity to provide information to guide the diagnosis, management, and prognosis. methods: we retrospectively reviewed all patients aged 1-15 years with craniofacial trauma presenting to our emergency department between 2011 and 2015. in total, 4 patients with lst following mhi were identified. we also performed a comprehensive literature review to identify relevant cases in studies published between 1990 and 2015, and this yielded 17 studies with 24 patients. we analyzed the data for these 24 patients with our 4 cases (n = 28). results: the mean age of the 28 cases was 7.0 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1. nausea/vomiting and headache were the most common symptoms, but signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure were present in 5 patients. the sigmoid sinus was most commonly affected. a total of 20 patients were treated conservatively, and the remaining 8 patients received anticoagulation. all patients had good outcomes, with no major complications. radiological follow up showed complete recanalization in 14 patients and partial recanalization in 3 patients. conclusions: although lst following mhi is still rare in children, our findings indicate that it might be much more common than previously thought. thankfully, though, most patients appear to have an excellent prognosis. a high degree of suspicion should be maintained when assessing patients with mhi, because the non-specific symptoms make diagnosis difficult. neuroimaging by magnetic resonance venography or computed tomography venography is crucial for both diagnosis and follow up. hypercoagulation disorders should be excluded, and anticoagulation therapy should be given to patients with these disorders, or to those with persistent or progressive lst. conservative therapy is recommended, although anti-edema drugs or intermittent lumbar puncture may be beneficial.

weight_loss	background: neonatal hypernatremic dehydration (nhd) is a dangerous condition that can lead to severe weight loss, renal impairment, and central nervous system complications. we aimed to evaluate the consequences of nhd in infants in their second year of life. materials and methods: this was a prospective case-control study in ghaem hospital, mashhad, iran. sixty-five healthy breastfed neonates (serum sodium concentration <150mmol/l) and 65 hypernatremic (serum sodium concentration 150mmol/l) neonates were followed up from 2008 to 2011. maternal and neonatal factors were compared between the two groups together with their growth parameters, and developmental milestones (using denver ii developmental assessment scores) were assessed and compared in ages 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. results: the weight of infants at 6 months of age was significantly different between the two groups (7,2641,089g vs. 7,596957g, p=0.009). twenty-five percent of infants in the group who had developed nhd had a delay in development at 6 months of age, with corresponding values of 21% at 12 months, 19% at 18 months, and 12% at 24 months of age. developmental delay was approximate to 0.3% for the control group at similar ages. the severity of hypernatremia was strongly correlated with poor developmental outcome at 6 months (p=0.001). serum sodium concentration of neonates was 153-195mg/dl in the nhd group. median peak serum sodium was 158 +/- 16 in case group and 141 +/- 9 in control group. serious complications were cerebral edema (five cases), hemorrhage (five cases), and kidney stones (six cases). hypernatremic dehydration has an adverse effect on child development especially in the first year of life, their prevalence decreases with advanced age. growth problems are also present during their first year of life. the major signs and symptoms of infants with poor prognosis on admission were poor feeding (8 infants, 61.5%), seizure (3 infants, 23.1%), hyperthermia (1 infant, 7.7%), and lethargy (1 infant, 7.7%). conclusions: nhd affects growth parameters and developmental milestones of children. occasionally the child 's weight gain was normalized by the end of first year of life; although developmental delay continued, its severity was reduced, with age.
sports_injuries	the aim of this study was to examine upper respiratory tract infections (urti) and their associations with resting saliva and blood immune and endocrine parameters in ice hockey players. twenty-seven participants (age 16.5 +/- 0.5 years) completed the 24-week study period. the counts/concentrations of immune and endocrine markers were compared between healthy-prone athletes (= 3 episodes of urti) and between the urti state (when athletes had infections) and the healthy state (the time without urti). there were no differences in concentration/counts of saliva and blood immune and endocrine parameters between the illness-prone and illness-free athletes. athletes had significantly lower siga, siga1 and siga2 concentrations (siga: 119.88 +/- 66.88, 144.10 +/- 75.0 mu g/ml; siga1: 90.2 +/- 40.64, 108.44 +/- 29.8 u; siga2: 67.58 +/- 30.1, 80.3 +/- 25.61 u, respectively) and significantly higher wbc, neutrophil, monocyte and eosinophil count values and il-1ra concentration at the time when they had symptoms of urti than in the period without symptoms of infections. there were no differences in salivary cortisol concentration between the period of urti symptoms and the period without urti symptoms. in conclusion, we observed lower concentrations of salivary immunoglobulins and higher levels of blood immune parameters during urti in athletes, which may confirm the suppression of mucosal immunity and initiation responses to pathogenic infections by innate immunity.
allergies	background. contact allergy to rubber additives is common, particularly in patients with occupational dermatitis. objectives. to descriptively analyse and compare patch test reactions in patients patch tested both with the baseline series and with an additional 'rubber series' as used in the department. methods. patch test data from those members of the european surveillance system on contact allergies (essca) network (www.essca-dc.org) who also contributed data on rubber series patch test results were retrospectively analysed. results. among 29 522 patients patch tested, 2870 were eligible, that is, patch tested both with the baseline series and with a special rubber series. of these, 8.8% had positive reaction(s) to one of the baseline screening rubber allergens (as compared with 4.2% in all patients), most often to carba mix, 12.3% had positive reaction(s) to allergens from an additional rubber series, and 6.4% had positive reaction(s) to both. conclusions. additional testing with a dedicated rubber series, containing break-down single ingredients of mixes from the baseline series and additional rubber allergens, is warranted in patients with suspected contact allergy to rubber, to avoid false-negative results.
heart_disease	background and objectiveadiponectin is produced by adipose cells and is considered an anti-inflammatory molecule. in contrast, c-reactive protein (crp) has been identified as a hallmark of systemic inflammation and used as a risk marker of cardiovascular disease (cvd). of interest was the relationship of these two biomarkers to oral health and cvd risk. material and methodsthis investigation examined these two molecules in serum and unstimulated whole saliva of patients within 48 h of an acute myocardial infarction (ami) compared to control subjects. we hypothesized a differential response in these biomolecules resulting from the heart attack that would be affected by both the body mass index and oral health characteristics of the individuals. resultssignificantly lower adiponectin levels were observed in the serum of patients with ami. serum adiponectin in both groups and salivary adiponectin in patients with ami decreased with increasing body mass index. oral health was significantly worse in patients with ami, and both serum and salivary adiponectin were elevated with better oral health in control subjects. serum crp levels were increased in patients with ami regardless of their oral health, and both serum and salivary crp were significantly elevated in s-t wave elevated patients with mi. conclusionsthese initial data provide evidence relating obesity and oral health to salivary and serum analyte levels that occur in association with cardiac events. relationships have been described between cvd risk and periodontal disease. additionally, various systemic inflammatory biomarkers appear to reflect both the cvd risk and the extent/severity of periodontitis. our findings indicated that oral health and obesity contribute to altering levels of these salivary and serum analytes in association with cardiac events. the potential that serum and/or salivary biomarkers could aid in evaluating cvd risk requires knowledge regarding how the oral health of the individual would impact the effectiveness of these biological measures.
alzheimer's_disease	introduction: brain imaging with f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (f-18-fdg) positron emission tomography or tc-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (tc-99m-hmpao) spect is widely used for the evaluation of alzheimer 's dementia (ad); we aim to assess superiority of one method over the other. methods: twenty four patients with clinical diagnosis of alzheimer disease underwent f-18-fdg pet and tc-99m-hmpao spect in order to assess the zones of hypo metabolism & hypoperfusion specific for alzheimer 's disease. results: f-18-fdg pet showed specific zones of hypometabolism in 19 patients (79.1%) while spect was positive in 15 cases (62.5%) with statistically significant difference (p=0.027). conclusion: f-18-fdg pet was significantly superior to hmpao spect and f-18-fdg pet could replace the classic role of perfusion spect in diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease.
hypothyroidism	background: hypofractionation has become standard of care after breast conserving therapy (bct) in many european and few others western countries. though still debatable, tumor cavity boost is routinely practised in our centre. hypofractionation is not yet the current standard of practice in asian countries. employing hypofractionation and simultaneous integrated boost to lumpectomy cavity with conformal technique is not the current practice in this region. hence the study was performed to see whether accelerated hypofractionation and simultaneous boost can be combined using volumetric modulated arc therapy (vmat) in treating early breast cancer (ebc) patients. patients and methods: female patients with ebc treated by whole breast radiation and boost were treated simultaneously to a dose of 40.5 gy and 48 gy in fifteen fractions over three weeks to entire breast and tumor cavity respectively with vmat. dosimetry including target coverage, oar (organ at risk) sparing and acute radiation toxicity were evaluated. results: ten consecutive patients were treated. planning target volume (ptv) coverage and oar sparing were mostly satisfactory. mean volume of ptvwb and ptvboost were 786.18 cm(3) and 228.9 cm(3) respectively. mean dmean to ptvwb and ptvboost were 41.9 gy and 49.1 gy respectively. d-max to ptvwb and ptvboost were 127.56% and 110.67% respectively. ipsilateral lung mean dose and v20 were 13.92 gy and 21.53% respectively. v40 and v25 of heart were 0.17% and 2.25% respectively. all patients are disease free after a median follow up of two years. most acute toxicities were grade1. only two patients out of ten developed grade 2 skin reaction during radiation. early cosmesis using harvard cosmesis scale is good to excellent conclusions: accelerated hypofractionated rt using sib-vmat is a clinically feasible technique with acceptable initial result. initial results are encouraging. mini abstract: simultaneous integrated boost with accelerated hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy is a novel approach. patient selection and technical considerations are of paramount importance. the present study describes successful implementation of this approach.

hypothyroidism	introduction the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of breast cancer with thyroid diseases. many authors have already studied the possible relationship between these two diseases, but the results are nowadays conflicting. materials and methods our study examining 867 patients with breast cancer (862 women and 5 men, average age = 61 years old) of whom 141 also had thyroid disease evaluated the recurrence of thyroid diseases and their association with different types of breast cancer. statistical analyses were performed using spss software for windows; we used nonparametric tests (chi-square and mannwhitney), and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05. results we found a significant association between breast cancer diagnosed after menopause and thyroid disease (p < 0.003). moreover, we analyzed the role of thyroid autoimmunity identifying an association between chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and breast cancer diagnosed before menopause (p < 0.05). regarding receptor profile of breast carcinoma, we have found an increased expression of estrogen receptors in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis compared to patients with any other thyroid diseases (p < 0.03). contrariwise, we do not have found any difference between the group with every thyroid disease and the group without thyroid disease (p < 1.00). we did not find other statistically significant associations with breast cancer 's parameters like family history, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, cancer clinical and pathological stage, differentiation grade and expression of ki67, p53 and her2 in the two main groups with or without thyroid disease. likewise, we did not found other statistically significant association between hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and breast cancer.
parenting	fatherhood is a turning point in the life of many men, but for men who lacked a father figure while growing up, the birth of a child may be the catalyst for a fresh start. researchers have called for qualitative investigations into african american fathers' parenting beliefs and practices that consider their social contexts within the broader research discourse on parenthood. such investigations can inform the way we frame african american fathers in research, thereby improving theoretical suggestions for better supporting black men in their roles as caretakers. the present case study details the experiences of a young african american man, tron, who was participating in a larger church-based intervention program focused on strengthening father-child relationships among african american families. findings highlight how tron 's story serves as a positive counternarrative against the prevailing negative stereotype of african american men as absentee parents. thematic coding analysis revealed several major themes, and the current article focuses on tron 's decisions to transform his experience growing up without a father into a dedicated resolve to remain actively present in his son 's life, a process that the author refers to as intergenerational change. finally, this case study helps to mitigate the dearth of positive research on african american fathers by challenging deficit-based research narratives.
emergency_contraception	objectives the uk faculty of sexual & reproductive healthcare (fsrh) has recommended that for emergency contraception (ec) the health professional should discuss individual needs and inform women of the different methods, efficacy, adverse effects, interactions, eligibility and additional contraception. in our sexual and reproductive health care service (liverpool and knowsley, uk), revised guidance was issued in early 2012, reflecting faculty advice. we studied (1) how our use of ec changed, (2) which methods were offered and how this changed, (3) which method was chosen by women who were offered all three uk licensed methods of ec and (4) the appropriateness of the offer of only levonorgestrel (lng). methods we studied a total of 2989 case records in the 3months before and 3months following the adoption by our service of the 2011 fsrh guidance. this was a retrospective review of charts undertaken by interrogating our computerised excelicare((r)) system of clinical records. all ec episodes in the two 3-month periods were analysed, covering october-december 2011 and march-may 2012. additionally, three non-probabilistic, purposeful samples of representative practitioners' charts were examined in groups of women offered all methods [and choosing either ulipristal acetate (upa) or lng] or who were offered lng only. results the use of lng fell from 93.0% of ec issued to 76.0%; upa use rose from 3.0% to 18.7%. in the second 3-month period, of the women offered all three methods, 54.9% chose lng and 39.8% upa. lng-only offers in our judgement were clinically appropriate in 62.5% cases of such offers. conclusions comparing the second period with the first, more women were offered all three methods, the use of lng fell (93.0% to 76.0%) and that of upa increased (3.0% to 18.7%). women were encouraged to exercise choice. however, increasing choice in our service did not lead to a wholesale change from lng to upa.
headache	objectives: chronic migraine (cm) is a prevalent and devastating disorder with limited therapeutic options. this study explored the efficacy of 10mg/d flunarizine for cm prophylaxis as compared with 50 mg/d topiramate. methods: we conducted a prospective, randomized, open--label, blinded--endpoint trial. patients with cm were randomized to flunarizine and topiramate treatment. the primary outcomes assessed were the reductions in the total numbers of headache days and migraine days after 8 weeks of treatment. secondary outcomes were reductions in the numbers of days of acute abortive medication intake and acute abortive medication tablets taken, and the 50% responder rate. results: sixty--two subjects were randomized (n= 31/group). patients treated with flunarizine showed significant reductions in the numbers of total headache days (-4.9 vs -2.3, p=. 012) and migraine days (-4.3 vs -1.4, p=. 001) compared with those treated with topiramate. patients treated with flunarizine also showed significant reductions in the numbers of days of acute abortive medication intake (-2.3 vs -0.2, p=. 005) and acute abortive medication tablets taken (-4.6 vs - 0.5, p=. 005) and had a higher 50% responder rate in terms of total headache days (58.6% vs 25.9%, p=. 013) and migraine days (75.9% vs 29.6%, p=. 001), compared with topiramate--treated patients. flunarizine was generally well tolerated and had a safety profile comparable to that of topiramate. conclusions: our results suggest that, in an 8--week study, 10 mg/d flunarizine is more effective than 50 mg/d topiramate for cm prophylaxis.
alzheimer's_disease	introduction: alzheimer disease (ad) is the most common form of dementia and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate all over the world. the pathophysiology of ad is characterized by chronic, progressive neurodegeneration which involves early synaptotoxicity. one of the most obvious pathological feature of ad is the accumulation of amyloid- (a) in the brain. since current treatment options only provide symptomatic help and a is thought to underlie early synaptic pathology, a reduction or modulation in the brain may be a promising therapeutic strategy in preventing and /or reversing ad-related dysfunction.areas covered: this paper outlines and evaluates the current landscape of preclinical and clinical studies focusing on modulating a pathophysiology. data and analysis for this review were procured from pubmed, clinicaltrials.gov and alzforum.expert opinion: according to current knowledge, reducing a production offers numerous treatment options. however, targeting the initial steps by pharmacological interference with secretases is challenging due to the emergence of various side effects. the most promising approach seems to be the prevention of early a oligomerization. combination approaches targeting both a and tau would seem to be another promising strategy that could have beneficial effects through the course of the disease.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	autoimmune gastritis is often suspected for its hematologic findings, and rarely the diagnosis is made for the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. aims of this cross-sectional study were to assess in a large cohort of patients affected by autoimmune gastritis the occurrence and the pattern of gastrointestinal symptoms and to evaluate whether symptomatic patients are characterized by specific clinical features. gastrointestinal symptoms of 379 consecutive autoimmune gastritis patients were systematically assessed and classified following rome iii criteria. association between symptoms and anemia pattern, positivity to gastric autoantibodies, helicobacter pylori infection, and concomitant autoimmune disease were evaluated. in total, 70.2% of patients were female, median age 55 years (range 17-83). pernicious anemia (53.6%), iron deficiency anemia (34.8%), gastric autoantibodies (68.8%), and autoimmune disorders (41.7%) were present. however, 56.7% of patients complained of gastrointestinal symptoms, 69.8% of them had exclusively upper symptoms, 15.8% only lower and 14.4% concomitant upper and lower symptoms. dyspepsia, subtype postprandial distress syndrome was the most represented, being present in 60.2% of symptomatic patients. univariate and multivariate analyses showed that age<55 years (or 1.6 [ci: 1-2.5]), absence of smoking habit (or 2.2 [ci: 1.2-4]), and absence of anemia (or 3.1 [ci: 1.5-6.4]) were independent factors associated to dyspepsia. autoimmune gastritis is associated in almost 60% of cases with gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular dyspepsia. dyspepsia is strictly related to younger age, no smoking, and absence of anemia.
heart_disease	purpose of review the purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the clinical applications of pet-mr in the setting of cardiac imaging with emphasis on specific scenarios where both techniques together provided added information. recent findings synergy of cardiac pet and mr fusion may hold similar promise eliminating ionizing radiation and improving tissue contrast. future development of new hybrid scanners, use of new imaging tracers, and clinical applications are significant factors which will influence its use. summary both positron emission tomography (pet) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cmr) provide important anatomic and physiologic information with regard to the heart. being able to combine the data from these two examinations in a hybrid technique allows for a more complete evaluation of cardiac pathology. while hybrid pet-ct has already established the utility of a combined imaging approach, the use of cmr in lieu of ct allows for elimination of ionizing radiation and for improved tissue contrast.
fungal_infection	early detection of fungal infection in citrus fruit is one of the major problems in the postharvest phase. the automation of this task is still a challenge for the citrus industry. in this study, the potential application of hyperspectral imaging, which combines conventional imaging and spectroscopy to simultaneously acquire both spatial and spectral information from an object, was evaluated for automatic detection of the early symptoms of decay caused by penicillium digitatum fungus in citrus fruit. hyperspectral images of sound and decayed navel oranges were acquired in the wavelength range of 325-1100 nm. principal component analysis (pca) was applied to a dataset comparing of average spectra from decayed and sound tissue to reduce the dimensionality of data and to observe the ability of visible near infrared (vis-nir) hyper-spectra to discriminate data from two classes. and, a mean normalization step is applied prior to pca to reduce the effect of sample curvature on spectral profiles. in this case it was observed that sound and decayed spectra were separable along the resultant first principal component (pc1) axis, then, four wavelength images centered at 575, 698, 810 and 969 nm were selected as the characteristic wavelength images by analyzing the weight coefficients of pc1 in order to develop a fast classification method for establishing an on-line multispectral imaging system. subsequently, a combination image, which obtained by multiplying the characteristic weight coefficients by corresponding to mean-normalized characteristic wavelength images of each orange sample, was calculated for determination of decayed fruits. based on the obtained multispectral combination image, the technique of intensity slicing as one of the pseudo-color image processing methods is used to transform the combination image into a 2-d visual classification image that would enhance the contrast between sound and decayed classes. finally, an image segmentation algorithm for detection of decayed fruit was developed based on the pseudo-color image coupled with a simple thresholding method. for the investigated 210 naval orange samples including 80 sound fruits and 130 infected fruits, the total success rate is 100% for training set and 98.6% for test set with no false negatives, respectively, indicating that the proposed multispectral algorithm here is capable of detecting decay caused by penicillium digitatum in naval orange fruit using only four key wavelength images. the results from this study could be used for development of a non-destructive monitoring system for rapid detection of decayed citrus on the processing line. the idea behind the proposed algorithm can be extended to detect the non-visible damages of other fruit, such as slight bruise and chilling injury in apples.

fungal_infection	objectives: our objective was to analyze the incidence of pulmonary disorders in solid-organ transplant recipients and report on outcomes in these patients. materials and methods: seventy liver and kidney transplant patients, who underwent lung biopsy because of pulmonary symptoms between january 2000 and december 2015, were enrolled in the study. we examined and evaluated histopathologic findings of these patients based on clinical data recorded in patients' files. results: patients' mean age was 44.5 +/- 16.4 years. of 70 patients, 25 underwent liver transplant and 45 patients underwent kidney transplant. forty-six patients received organs from living donors and 24 from deceased donors. biopsy results of all patients included nonspecific findings (28), organized pneumonia (2), tuberculosis (6), fungal infections (11), tumors (5), amyloidosis (1), diffuse alveolar damage (4), mixed bacterial infection (1), and bronchopneumonia (12). forty-two patients (60%) died within 54.1 +/- 53.3 months after transplant and 24.6 +/- 41.9 months after lung biopsy. autopsies were performed on 14 patients. the causes of fatal lung diseases included fungal infections (8), malignant tumors (4), amyloidosis (1), diffuse alveolar damage (4), and mixed bacterial infection (1). aspergillosis was the most frequently implicated lung infection, occurring in 54.5% of patients with fungal infections. conclusions: pulmonary diseases remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in solid-organ transplant recipients. fungal infection, especially aspergillosis, was the leading cause of early death in these patients.
low_testosterone	late-onset hypogonadism (loh) is a relatively common conditions affecting the aging male. the aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence regarding loh and its interaction with general health. loh is often comorbid to obesity and several chronic diseases. for this reason lifestyle modifications should be strongly encouraged in loh subjects with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and metabolic syndrome (mets) and good treatment balance of chronic diseases. medical therapy of loh should be individualized depending on the etiology of the disease and the patient 's expectations. available evidence seems to suggest that testosterone replacement therapy is able to improve central obesity (subjects with mets) and glycometabolic control (patients with mets and t2dm), as well as to increase lean body mass (hiv, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), along with insulin resistance (mets) and peripheral oxygenation (chronic kidney diseases). however, it should be recognized that the number of studies on benefits of t supplementation is too limited to draw final conclusions. longer and larger studies are needed to better clarify the role of trt in such chronic conditions.

low_testosterone	objectives: to determine the incidence of hypogonadism in men with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)/acquired immunodeficiency virus (aids), the most useful serum testosterone measurement and threshold for diagnosing hypogonadism, and the comparative efficacy of 2 testosterone replacement therapy (trt) 1% gels (androgel (r) [abbott laboratories] and testim (r) [auxilium pharmaceuticals, inc.]). design and subjects: this was a 2-stage observational study. in stage 1, patient records from 2 medical practices specializing in hiv/aids were reviewed. eligible patients were aged >= 18 years; had hiv-seropositive status confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot test or hiv-1 viremia confirmed by hiv-1 rna polymerase chain reaction; and had prior baseline testosterone assessments for hypogonadism (ie, presence of signs/symptoms of hypogonadism as well as total testosterone [tt] and free testosterone [ft] level measurements). stage 2 included the evaluation of patients from stage 1 who were treated with 5 to 10 g/day of trt. the stage 2 inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of low testosterone (defined as tt level, 300 ng/dl and/or ft level, 50 pg/ml, as per the endocrine society guidelines and presence/absence of hypogonadal signs and symptoms); >= 12 months of evaluable sign and symptom assessments and tt/ft level measurements while on trt with either testim (r) or androgel (r); and >= 4 weeks on initial trt if the initial trt was switched or discontinued. results: four hundred one of 422 patients met the stage 1 inclusion criteria and 167 of 401 patients (androgel (r), n = 92; testim (r), n = 75) met the stage 2 inclusion criteria. total testosterone level < 300 ng/dl alone identified 24% (94 of 390) of patients as hypogonadal, but failed to diagnose an additional 111 patients (67.7%) with ft levels < 100 pg/ml and hypogonadal symptoms. through month 12, androgel (r) increased mean tt levels by +42.8% and ft levels by +66.9%, compared with +178.7% (p = 0.017) and +191% (p = 0.039), respectively, for testim (r). patients treated with testim (r) showed significantly greater improvements in libido, sexual performance, nighttime energy, focus/concentration, and abdominal girth, and trends for greater improvement in fatigue and erectile dysfunction than patients treated with androgel (r). no patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events. conclusion: the most useful serum testosterone measurement and threshold for diagnosing hypogonadism in men with hiv/aids was ft level= 1 hypogonadal symptom. this is above currently accepted thresholds. criteria using tt level < 300 ng/dl and ft level < 50 pg/ml only diagnosed 24% and 19% of patients, respectively, as having hypogonadism. testim (r) was more effective than androgel (r) in increasing tt and ft levels and improving hypogonadal symptoms.
emergency_contraception	many survivors of rape do not seek post-assault care. the recent change in status of emergency contraception (ec), such as plan b, to an over-the-counter (otc) product may be further changing post-assault care seeking. this descriptive study will quantify otc ec use in the post-assault period and elicit survivors' desires for care. data were collected from women purchasing otc ec at university pharmacies (n = 55) and students in an undergraduate university class (n = 165). quantitative results indicate annual prevalence rates of post-assault otc ec use as 5.4-7.3 %. qualitative analyses indicate that otc ec is an important but incomplete form of post-assault care. future work should focus on intervention development to provide all otc ec users with information about post-assault resources to prevent long-term sequelae.
allergies	emergency physicians are regularly confronted with ear nose and throat (ent) emergencies. the main symptoms are bleeding, dyspnea, dysphagia and swelling. the causes can be foreign body ingestion, injuries, infections, neoplasms and allergies. the origin, localization and the time interval for essential diagnostic and therapeutic measures have to be estimated in the emergency management of bleeding and dyspnea. the main triggers of acute respiratory distress are inflammation, abscesses, anaphylactic reactions and angioedema. croup and epiglottitis are typical causes of dyspnea in children. injuries of the larynx and trachea require specific considerations with respect to intubation or tracheotomy.
heart_disease	objective: the aim of this study was to investigate associations of serum zinc with incident metabolic syndrome and its components in middle-aged and older finnish men. methods: an 11-y prospective follow-up study conducted among 683 men from the kuopio ischaemic heart disease risk factor study who were 42 to 60 y old at baseline in 1984 to 1989. the main outcome was incident metabolic syndrome, defined by the national cholesterol education program (ncep) criteria. other outcomes were the individual components of the ncep metabolic syndrome: fasting blood glucose, serum triacylglycerols, serum high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol, hypertension, and waist circumference. results: during the average follow-up of 11 y, 139 men (20.4%) developed metabolic syndrome. those in the highest tertile of serum zinc had 84% higher risk (95% confidence interval 12 to 201%, p trend across tertiles = 0.015) to develop metabolic syndrome compared with those in the lowest tertile, after adjustment for several potential confounders. the association between serum zinc and incident metabolic syndrome was attenuated by adjustment for waist circumference, serum hdl cholesterol, or hypertension. serum zinc was also directly associated with higher waist circumference and hypertension and inversely associated with hdl cholesterol at the 11 y examinations. conclusions: we found a direct association between serum zinc and incidence of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and older eastern finnish men. further studies are warranted to explore the mechanisms.

multiple_sclerosis	the blood-brain barrier (bbb) plays an important role in the clinical expression of neuropsychiatric symptoms during systemic illness in health and neurological disease. evidence from in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies indicate that systemic inflammation impairs blood-brain barrier function. in order to investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the association between systemic inflammatory markers (leucocytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein) and bbb function (cerebrospinal fluid/ serum albumin ratio) in 1273 consecutive lumbar punctures. in the absence of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) abnormality, systemic inflammation did not affect the csf/serum albumin ratio. when csf abnormality was present, systemic inflammation significantly predicted the csf/serum albumin ratio. amongst the systemic inflammatory markers, c-reactive protein was the predominant driver of this effect. temporal analysis in this association study suggested causality. in conclusion, the diseased bbb has an increased susceptibility to systemic inflammation.

low_testosterone	purpose: androgens seems to play an important role in prostate cancer (pca) pathogenesis. some studies reveal that possible testosterone deficiency could be involved in pca development and progress. others indicate that men with high testosterone levels have increased risk in devel-oping more aggressive pca and poor response to therapy. the objective of the present study is to establish a possible correlation between serum total testosterone levels (tt), pros-tate specific antigen (psa) and clinical markers evaluating the aggressiveness of the tumor process in pca patients. material/methods: a total of eighty males, aged from 52 to 84 years (mean age 66.28 +/- 6.015 years), with histologically confirmed pca, entered the study. diagnosis of pca was established by systemic transrectal ultrasoundguided tru-cut prostate biopsies (10 cores at least). detected tumors were graded using the gleason grading system. se-rum tt and psa were analyzed immunochemically. pearson correlation statistics with a level of significance set at p < 0.05 was used for data analysis. results: strong significant positive correlation (pearson r= 0.90, p< 0.01) between psa and testosterone levels was found in lowest risk group. for the highest risk group there was a negative association between the same parameters (pearson r=-0.38, p< 0.05). a relatively weak positive relationship (pearson r = 0.29) was detected for patients with less aggressive tumors (gleason score7). conclusions: our results confirm the hypothesis that low testosterone levels are related to poor prognosis and increased severity of pca.
sports_injuries	sport injuries are common and costly for the professional athlete, the weekend warrior, and the community. acute injuries are treated according to current guidelines with the aim of bringing the athlete back into the arena. these guidelines have not taken into account new scientific results of the inflammatory process following a trauma. the 4 hallmarks of inflammation, namely, pain, swelling, redness, and heat, are results of an adequate inflammatory response with the aim of bringing the affected tissue back to restitution (latin: restitutio ad integrum). cooling of the affected limb and anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used but may deter healing. the healing process is governed by fatty acids of the omega-3 and omega-6 series. in order to facilitate healing, these fatty acids have to be present in significant amounts in the affected tissues before the trauma occurs. this is particularly relevant for marine omega-3 fatty acids, which are often running low due to insignificant intake of seafood, common in individuals practicing sports. high-energy sports often lead to head and brain trauma. continuous head traumata may even result in later mental defects. saturation of brain cells with omega-3 fatty acids, in particular docosahexaenoic acid (dha), may facilitate healing after brain trauma, thereby counteracting negative long-term results.the present understanding of a normal inflammatory process leading to restitution will be discussed along with data from recent scientific trials.
emergency_contraception	introduction: emergency contraception (ec) offers women an important strategy to prevent unintended pregnancy following intercourse. despite the constant improvement of availability of different molecules and techniques already existing (yuzpe regimen, levonorgestrel, intrauterine device) and the emergence of ulipristal acetate, the numbers of unintended pregnancies and unplanned births could still be reduced. areas covered: this review will evaluate all the information about the potential adverse effects and tolerability of each method of ec by putting them in balance with their safety and effectiveness. a literature search until december 2013 was performed to identify all trials studying the safety data available concerning ec. expert opinion: different means of ec have been demonstrated to be generally safe and well tolerated. these data support women information in order to improve use and efficacy of ec.
heart_disease	objective: to characterize the multiple dimensions and benefits of the mediterranean diet as a sustainable diet, in order to revitalize this intangible food heritage at the country level; and to develop a multidimensional framework - the med diet 4.0 - in which four sustainability benefits of the mediterranean diet are presented in parallel: major health and nutrition benefits, low environmental impacts and richness in biodiversity, high sociocultural food values, and positive local economic returns. design: a narrative review was applied at the country level to highlight the multiple sustainable benefits of the mediterranean diet into a single multidimensional framework: the med diet 4.0. setting/subjects: we included studies published in english in peer-reviewed journals that contained data on the characterization of sustainable diets and of the mediterranean diet. the methodological framework approach was finalized through a series of meetings, workshops and conferences where the framework was presented, discussed and ultimately refined. results: the med diet 4.0 provides a conceptual multidimensional framework to characterize the mediterranean diet as a sustainable diet model, by applying principles of sustainability to the mediterranean diet. conclusions: by providing a broader understanding of the many sustainable benefits of the mediterranean diet, the med diet 4.0 can contribute to the revitalization of the mediterranean diet by improving its current perception not only as a healthy diet but also a sustainable lifestyle model, with country-specific and culturally appropriate variations. it also takes into account the identity and diversity of food cultures and systems, expressed within the notion of the mediterranean diet, across the mediterranean region and in other parts of the world. further multidisciplinary studies are needed for the assessment of the sustainability of the mediterranean diet to include these new dimensions.
cancer	the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and its associated pathway is a critical key regulator of crc development and progression. the monoclonal antibodies (moabs) cetuximab and panitumumab, directed against egfr, represent a major step forward in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc), in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival in several clinical trials. however, the activity of anti-egfr moabs appears to be limited to a subset of patients with mcrc. studies have highlighted that acquired-resistance to anti-egfr moabs biochemically converge into ras/raf/mek/erk and pi3k/akt/mtor pathways. recent data also suggest that acquired-resistance to anti-egfr moabs is accompanied by inhibition of egfr internalization, ubiqutinization, degradation and prolonged down regulation. it is well established that autophagy, a self-cannibalization process, is considered to be associated with resistance to the anti-egfr moabs therapy. additionally, autophagy induced by anti-egfr moabs acts as a protective response in cancer cells. thus, inhibition of autophagy after treatment with egfr moabs can result in autophagic cell death. a combination therapy comprising of anti-egfr moabs and autophagy inhibitors would represent a multi-pronged approach that could be evolved into an active therapeutic strategy in mcrc patients.

parenting	online consultation is increasingly offered by parenting practitioners, but it is not clear if it is feasible to provide empowerment-oriented support in a single session email consultation. based on the empowerment theory, we developed the guiding the empowerment process model (gep model) to evaluate text-based consultation. by content analysis of the email advice (n = 129; 5997 sentences in total), we investigated the feasibility of the newly developed model (inter-observer agreement, internal consistency and factor structure) and its validity. concurrent validity was evaluated by comparing coding results using the gep model and a social support model that partially intersects with empowerment. results showed good inter-observer reliability and internal consistency of the gep model. the results provided evidence for its concurrent validity by a significant correlation of the coding results from the gep model with the social support model, although it was also distinctive. all described techniques which practitioners may employ to guide the parental process towards empowerment were observed in the sample. also, guidance was provided in all components of the empowerment process. feasibility of the gep model for content analysis of email consultation in parental support from a theoretical empowerment perspective has been demonstrated.
diabetes	aims: several alternative cellular approaches using biomaterials to host insulin-producing cells derived from stem cells have been developed to overcome the limitations of type 1 diabetes treatment (exogenous insulin injection). however, none seem to fulfill all requirements needed to induce pancreatic cells successful colonization of the scaffolds. here, we report a polymeric platform adherent to the native mice pancreas filled with human adipose stem cells (hascs) that was able to induce growth of pancreatic parenchyma. main methods: synthetic polyether-polyurethane discs were placed adjacent to pancreas of normoglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. at day 4 post implantation, 1 x 10(6) hascs were injected intra-implant in groups of normoglycemic and diabetic mice. immunohistochemistry analysis of the implants was performed to identify insulin positive cells in the newly formed tissue. in addition, metabolic, inflammatory and angiogenic parameters were carried out in those mice. key findings: this study provides evidence of the ability of a biohybrid device to induce the growth of differentiated pancreas parenchyma in both normoglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice as detected by histological analysis. glucose metabolism and body weight of hyperglycemic mice bearing hascs implants improved. significance: the synthetic porous scaffold bearing hasc cells placed adjacent to the native animal pancreas exhibits the potential to be exploited in future cell-based type 1 diabetes therapies.

headache	pathophysiological concepts of primary headache diseases have been developed significantly in the last decades. nevertheless pathophysiology of single diseases is unexplained. migraine headache arises from activation and sensibilization of trigeminal nociceptors, essential processes are located at the meninges and the meningeal vessels. calcitonin generelated peptide (cgrp) seems to have essential importance concerning migraine and cluster headache. mechanisms leading to peripheral and central sensitization are relevant in chronification of migraine and tension-type headache. as a higher-level centre the hypothalamus seems to have an essential meaning in the initiation of migraine attacks. dysbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic neural system causes cranial-autonomic symptoms in some headache diseases and can be affected therapeutically.
myelofibrosis	we investigated the association between arg399gln polymorphism in dna repair gene xrcc1 and chronic myeloproliferative diseases. 79 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), 91 patient with polycythemia vera (pv), 132 patients with essential thrombocythemia (et). 50 patients with myelofibrosis and 114 controls were included in the study. we genotyped the polymorphism in xrcc1 gene by using polymerase chain reaction in real-time with taqman assay. the detection and quantification of the jak2 gene v617f mutation allele burden was carried out by means of ""pyromark q24"" pyrosequencing. the presence of at least one xrcc1 399gln allele was found to be significantly different in patients with cml (or 1.53; 95% ci 0.67-3.51) and et (or 1.31; 95% ci 0.61-2.78) in comparison with controls. the presence of xrcc1 399gln allele was associated with the resistance to imatinib. we found no interactions between the xrcc1 genotype and the level jak2 allelic burden. these data suggest about a significance of the xrcc1 gene product in the control of precursor cells of the myeloid differentiation in cml and et cells. testing arg399gln polymorphism in xrcc1 gene may be useful for the assessment of the prognosis and treatment efficacy.
overactive_bladder	purpose: we systematically reviewed preclinical and clinical studies on bladder chemodenervation with onabotulinumtoxin a to highlight current limitations and future drug delivery approaches. materials and methods: we identified peer reviewed basic and clinical research studies of onabotulinumtoxin a in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and refractory idiopathic overactive bladder published between march 2000 and march 2016. paired investigators independently screened 125 english language articles to identify controlled studies on onabotulinumtoxin a administration in the medline(r) database and abstracts presented at annual american urological association meetings. the review yielded an evidence base of more than 50 articles relevant to the approach of injection-free onabotulinumtoxin a chemodenervation. results: the efficacy and safety of intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxin a for the treatment of overactive bladder are sensitive to injection volume and depth, and this issue has motivated researchers to study injection-free modes of drug delivery into the bladder. urothelial denudation with protamine sulfate or dimethyl sulfoxide, liposome encapsulated onabotulinumtoxin a and other physical approaches are being studied to increase toxin permeability and avoid intradetrusor injections. liposome encapsulated onabotulinumtoxin a enhances toxin activity while reducing its toxin degradation. the safety and efficacy of liposome encapsulated onabotulinumtoxin a were tested in a multicenter, placebo controlled study. although this treatment successfully reduced urinary frequency and urgency, it did not significantly reduce urgency urinary incontinence episodes. conclusions: intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxin a is a safe and effective treatment as reported in several large multicenter, randomized controlled trials. injection of the toxin into the bladder wall impairs afferent and efferent nerves, but injection-free drug delivery approaches only impair the bladder afferent nerves. further studies are needed to develop better drug delivery platforms that overcome the drawbacks of intradetrusor injection, increase patient acceptance and reduce treatment costs.
senior_health	this was a qualitative exploratory study with the objective of identifying perceptions and practices among health professionals in angola concerning intimate partner violence against women. semi-structured interviews were held with a senior health administrator, head nurses, medical directors, psychologists, and nurse technicians in three national hospitals in the capital city of luanda. the perceptions of angolan health professionals towards violence against women are marked by the cultural construction of woman 's social role in the family and the belief in male superiority and female weakness. despite their familiarity with the types of violence and the consequences for physical and mental health, the health professionals' practices in providing care for women in situations of violence focus on the treatment of physical injuries, overlooking the subjectivity and complexity of these situations. recent inclusion of the issue in public policies is reflected in health professionals' practices and raises challenges for the health sector in caring for women in situations of violence.
multiple_sclerosis	multiple system atrophy (msa) is a demyelinating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of aggregated a-synuclein (asyn) inside oligodendrocyte precursors, mature oligodendroglia, and neurons. msa dysfunction is associated with loss of trophic factor production by glial and neuronal cells. here, we report that recombinant wild type human asyn uptake by oln-93, an oligodendroglia cell-line, reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) expression. furthermore, oln-93 cells stably transfected with human wild type or an msa-associated mutant asyn, a53e that produces neuronal and glial inclusions, reduced bdnf mrna to nearly unmeasurable qpcr levels. curiously, another msa-associated asyn mutant, g51d that also produces neuronal and glial inclusions, caused only a trend toward bdnf mrna reduction in transfected oln-93 cells. this suggests that oligodendrocyte-associated bdnf loss occurs in response to specific asyn types. treating oln-93 cells with 160 nm fty720 (fingolimod, gilenya (r)), a food and drug administration (fda) approved therapeutic for multiple sclerosis, counteracted bdnf downregulation in all asyn oln-93 cells. fty720 also restored bdnf mrna in oln-93 cells treated with recombinant asyn, as measured by qpcr or semiquantitatively on agarose gels. immunoblots confirmed that fty720 increased histone 3 acetylation in oln-93, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed increased acetylated histone 3 at bdnf promoter 1 after fty720. moreover, oln-93 cells treated with valproic acid, a classic histone deacetylase inhibitor, confirmed that increasing acetylated histone 3 levels increases bdnf expression. cumulatively, the data suggest that fty720-associated histone deacetylase inhibition stimulates bdnf expression in oligodendroglial cells, raising the possibility that msa patients may also benefit by treatment with fty720.

alzheimer's_disease	selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) have been reported to increase cognitive performance in some clinical studies of alzheimer 's disease (ad). however, there is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of ssris as cognition enhancers in ad, and the role of ssris as a treatment for ad remains largely unclear. here, we characterized the impact of fluoxetine (flx), a well-known ssri, on neurons in the dentate gyrus (dg) and in ca1 and ca3 of the hippocampus of middle-aged (16 to 17 months old) appswe/psen1de9 (app/ps1) transgenic ad model mice. we found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of flx (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks effectively alleviated the impairment of spatial learning ability in middle-aged app/ps1 mice as evaluated using the morris water maze. more importantly, the number of neurons in the hippocampal dg was significantly increased by flx. additionally, flx reduced the deposition of beta amyloid, inhibited gsk-3 beta activity and increased the level of beta-catenin in middle-aged app/ps1 mice. collectively, the results of this study indicate that flx delayed the progression of neuronal loss in the hippocampal dg in middle-aged ad mice, and this effect may underlie the flx-induced improvement in learning ability. flx may therefore serve as a promising therapeutic drug for ad.
fungal_infection	glyceollins synthesized in soybeans that are exposed to biotic or abiotic stress have been reported to have health benefits. considering that glyceollins are de novo synthesized from daidzein via several enzymatic steps and that isoflavone concentration widely varies among soybean varieties, the abilities of 60 soybean cultivars to synthesize glyceollins were compared under different elicitation conditions. soybeans accumulated glyceollins differentially depending upon the cultivar when elicited with aspergillus sojae. contrary to our hypothesis that high isoflavone varieties may accumulate glyceollins more efficiently upon elicitation, glyceollin accumulation in response to fungal elicitation was not related with the concentration of either total isoflavones or daidzein in soybeans. rather the glyceollin levels were significantly affected by soybean cultivar and most effectively increased by fungal infection. the data suggest that the selection of a strong fungal elicitor and a soybean cultivar with genotype that highly expresses the genes involved in glyceollin biosynthesis is essential for efficient glyceollin production.
cancer	introduction: trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity has been a major concern in clinical practice, since observational studies have shown higher incidences than that reported in clinical trials. we aim to measure the incidence of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity in patients with early and metastatic breast cancer in the south of brazil. methods: multicenter prospective observational study, which included 109 patients with early or metastatic her-2+ breast cancer undergoing any trastuzumab-based regimen. cardiac events were measured by transthoracic echocardiography assessments and by signs and symptoms of heart failure. results: trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity was observed in 58 patients (53.2%). emergency and hospitalization admissions were necessary in seven and three patients, respectively, due to symptoms of heart failure. one patient died in consequence of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. in total, trastuzumab was discontinued in 31.2% of patients, of which almost a third could not return to treatment. in this study, no risk factors were significantly associated with the development of cardiotoxicity. discussion: the incidence of trc and trastuzumab 's early discontinuation observed was significantly higher in comparison with other studies. these findings endorse the fact that trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity is a relevant adverse reaction, and therefore, cardiac dysfunction 's monitoring must be highlighted in order to allow a safe use of trastuzumab in this population.
multiple_sclerosis	background and purpose the detection of aquaporin 4-igg (aqp4-igg) is now a critical diagnostic criterion for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd). to evaluate the serostatus of nmosd patients based on the 2015 new diagnostic criteria using a new in-house cell-based assay (cba). methods we generated a stable cell line using internal ribosome entry site-containing bidstronic vectors, which allow the simultaneous expression of two proteins (aqp4 and green fluorescent protein) separately from the same rna transcript. we performed in-house cba using serum from 386 patients: 178 nmosd patients diagnosed according to the new diagnostic criteria without aqp4-igg, 63 high risk nmosd patients presenting 1 of the 6 core clinical characteristics of nmosd but not fulfilling dissemination in space, and 145 patients with other neurological diseases, including 66 with multiple sclerosis. the serostatus of 111 definite and high risk nmosd patients were also tested using a commercial cba kit with identical serum to evaluate the correlation between the 2 methods. all assays were performed by two independent and blinded investigators. results our in-house assay yielded a specificity of 100% and sensitivities of 80% (142 of 178) and 76% (48 of 63) when detecting definite- and high risk nmosd patients, respectively. the comparison with the commercial cba kit revealed a correlation for 102 of the 111 patients: no correlation was present in 7 patients who were seronegative using the commercial method but seropositive using the in-house method, and in 2 patients who were seropositive using the commercial method but seronegative using the in-house method conclusions these results demonstrate that our in-house cba is a highly specific and sensitive method for detecting aqp4-igg in nmosd patients.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundrecurrent abdominal pain is a common and costly health-care problem attributed, in part, to visceral hypersensitivity. increasing evidence suggests that gut bacteria contribute to abdominal pain perception by modulating the microbiome-gut-brain axis. however, specific microbial signals remain poorly defined. -aminobutyric acid (gaba) is a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter and a key regulator of abdominal and central pain perception from peripheral afferent neurons. although gut bacteria are reported to produce gaba, it is not known whether the microbial-derived neurotransmitter modulates abdominal pain. methodsto investigate the potential analgesic effects of microbial gaba, we performed daily oral administration of a specific bifidobacterium strain (b.dentiumatcc 27678) in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity, and subsequently evaluated pain responses. key resultswe demonstrate that commensal bifidobacterium dentium produces gaba via enzymatic decarboxylation of glutamate by gadb. daily oral administration of this specific bifidobacterium (but not a gadb deficient) strain modulated sensory neuron activity in a rat fecal retention model of visceral hypersensitivity. conclusions & inferencesthe functional significance of microbial-derived gaba was demonstrated by gadb-dependent desensitization of colonic afferents in a murine model of visceral hypersensitivity. visceral pain modulation represents another potential health benefit attributed to bifidobacteria and other gaba-producing species of the intestinal microbiome. targeting gabaergic signals along this microbiome-gut-brain axis represents a new approach for the treatment of abdominal pain.
diabetes	background and aim: although it is known that metformin can reduce risk of colorectal cancer, it is unclear whether it protects against colorectal adenoma. methods: this study conducted a systematic literature search on medline, embase, and the cochrane library using the primary keywords ""colorectal,"" ""colon,"" ""rectal,"" ""rectum,"" ""adenoma,"" ""polyp,"" ""neoplasia,"" ""neoplasm,"" ""metformin,"" and ""diabetes."" studies were included if they evaluated the association between metformin use and colorectal adenoma and reported odds ratios (ors) or provided data from which these could be estimated. results: ten studies and a total of 8726 patients were evaluated. across all studies, a median of 32.1% (range: 15.2-53.0%) of patients taking metformin also had adenoma; a median of 43.5% (range: 20.5-59.6%) of those not taking metformin had adenoma. in our meta-analysis, metformin use reduced the risk of adenoma (pooled or = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.63-0.92, i-2 = 60%). upon subgroup analyses, metformin use tended to reduce risk of adenoma in a high-risk population consisting of patients with a history of colorectal neoplasia (crn) (pooled or = 0.61, 95% ci = 0.34-1.10, i-2 = 79%). in addition, metformin reduced the risk of adenoma in a high-risk population consisting of patients with diabetes mellitus (pooled or = 0.75, 95% ci = 0.62-0.91, i-2 = 57%). conclusion: metformin use seemed to be associated with a reduced risk of colorectal adenoma, especially in high-risk populations consisting of patients with diabetes mellitus or a history of crn, although statistical power was not achieved in patients with a history of crn.
cancer	background aspirin use is effective in the prevention of cardiovascular disease; however, not all patients are equally responsive to aspirin. oxidative stress reflected by f-2-isoprostane [8-iso-prostaglandin-f2 alpha (8-isopgf2 alpha)] is a potential mechanism of failure of aspirin to adequately inhibit cyclooxygenase-1. the objective was to examine the relation between all-cause mortality and the concentrations of urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane b-2 (11dhtxb(2)) and 8-isopgf2 alpha in patients with stable coronary artery disease (cad). methods the data for this analysis are from a prospective study in which patients were categorized into four groups based on the median values of 11dhtxb(2) and 8-isopgf2 alpha. results there were 447 patients included in this analysis with a median (range) age of 66 (37-91) years. the median (range) values of 11dhtxb(2) and 8-isopgf2 alpha were 1404.1 (344.2-68296.1) and 1477.9 (356.7-19256.3), respectively. a total of 67 (14.9%) patients died over a median follow-up of 1149 days. the reference group for the cox proportional hazards survival analysis was patients with values of 11dhtxb(2) and 8-isopgf2 alpha below their corresponding medians. adjusting for the age and sex, patients with values of 11dhtxb(2) greater than the median had a significantly higher risk of mortality when compared with the reference group (high 11dhtxb2 and low 8-isopgf2 alpha(adj): hazard ratio: 3.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.6-6.6, p=0.002; high 11dhtxb(2) and 8-isopgf(2)alpha(adj): hazard ratio: 3.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-7.3, p<0.001). the findings were similar when we adjusted for the comorbidities of cancer, kidney function, and ejection fraction. conclusion we found that 11dhtxb(2) appears to be a better prognostic marker for mortality as compared with 8-isopgf2 alpha, suggesting aspirin resistance itself is a stronger independent determinant of death in cad patients treated with aspirin. coron artery dis 28: 287-293 copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
sports_injuries	the purpose of the present review was to: 1) provide an overview of the current understanding on the epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, and prevention methods for anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injury in alpine ski racing; and 2) provide an overview of what is known pertaining to acl reinjury and return to sport after acl injury in alpine ski racing. given that most of the scientific studies on acl injuries in alpine ski racing have been descriptive, and that very few studies contributed higher level scientific evidence, a nonsystematic narrative review was employed. three scholarly databases were searched for articles on acl injury or knee injury in alpine ski racing. studies were classified according to their relevance in relation to epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, and return to sport/reinjury prevention. alpine ski racers (skiers) were found to be at high risk for knee injuries, and acl tears were the most frequent diagnosis. three primary acl injury mechanism were identified that involved tibial internal rotation and anteriorly directed shear forces from ski equipment and the environment. while trunk muscle strength imbalance and genetics were found to be predictive of acl injuries in development-level skiers, there was limited scientific data on acl injury risk factors among elite skiers. based on expert opinion, research on injury risk factors should focus on equipment design, course settings/speed, and athlete factors (eg, fitness). while skiers seem to make a successful recovery following acl injury, there may be persistent neuromuscular deficits. future research efforts should be directed toward prospective studies on acl injury/reinjury prevention in both male and female skiers and toward the effects of knee injury on long-term health outcomes, such as the early development of osteoarthritis. international collaborations may be necessary to generate sufficient statistical power for acl injury/reinjury prevention research in alpine ski racing.
diabetes	background: the degree of liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is a critical predictive factor for patient prognosis. this study was intended to perform external validation of the various fibrosis prediction models for assessing advanced fibrosis in korean nafld patients. methods: a retrospective study of 412 patients with nafld confirmed by liver biopsy in hospitals affiliated with the koran nafld study group was conducted and the predictive ability of existing liver fibrosis prediction models including nafld fibrosis score (nfs), bard, and fibrosis-4 were compared. results: among 412 samples, 328 liver slides were suitable for evaluation. advanced fibrosis was present in 60 (18.3%) of the patient samples. univariate analysis found that the group with advanced fibrosis showed low alanine aminotransferase values and high aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratios as well as a high incidence of diabetes. however, multivariate analysis showed that only the presence of diabetes and triglycerides was independent risk factors. the receiver operating characteristic was 0.64 in nfs, 0.58 in fibrosis-4, and 0.594 in the bard model. the nfs was found to be the best at predicting advanced fibrosis among the three prediction models. the negative predictive value which predicts advanced fibrosis using the low cutoff (0.676) was 50.0% when we applied the nfs. conclusion: negative predictive value using the low cutoff value was high, but positive predictive value using the high cutoff value was low in a korean nafld cohort using nfs.
low_testosterone	the objective of this study was to determine femoral cartilage thickness (fct) in patients with klinefelter syndrome (ks), which is the most common sex chromosome disorder in men with varying degrees of androgen deficiency. this cross-sectional controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care center. participants were 33 male patients (mean age = 36.2 years) with ks and 35 aged-matched healthy male controls (mean age = 32.9 years). femoral condyle cartilage was measured by ultrasonography at three locations in each knee. total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin, free androgen index, bioavailable testosterone, and albumin levels were measured. femoral cartilage of patients at right and left knee lateral (3.03 and 2.99 mm), mid (3.81 and 3.74 mm), and medial (3.01 and 3.20 mm) were statistically thicker than in controls (right and left knee lateral 2.29 and 2.36 mm, mid 2.64 and 2.53 mm, medial 2.39 and 2.32 mm, respectively, p < .001). there was no significant correlation between fct and sex hormones. in conclusion, patients with ks had thicker femoral cartilage. relatively low testosterone levels in these patients and altered estrogen metabolism may hypothetically explain increased cartilage thickness in these patients.
fungal_infection	the silkworm infection model has the potential to replace conventional animal models for evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of investigational antifungal agents. silkworms are relatively inexpensive, can be simply grown in large numbers and can be easily infected with pathogenic fungi, including mutant strains. antifungal agents can then be injected into the silkworm either via the hemolymph to mimic intravenous administration or directly into the gut for oral administration, and their antifungal effect can be evaluated. common features regarding the mechanisms of pharmacokinetics between the silkworm and mammals result in consistent therapeutic effectiveness of antifungal agents. asp2397, a promising new antifungal agent, was discovered using the silkworm model. the conclusion is that silkworms can be a more ethical and less expensive alternative to standard animal models, particularly for the identification and testing of new antifungal agents.
low_testosterone	background: there is evidence for inverse association between endogenous testosterone and blood pressure. furthermore, low plasma testosterone is associated with increased risk of major cardiovascular events in middle-aged hypertensive men. central (aortic) blood pressures determine left ventricular hypertrophy and predict cardiovascular mortality. the aim of the present study was to assess the relationship of total testosterone (tt) with central haemodynamics and left ventricular mass in hypertensive men. methods: we investigated 134 non-diabetic, middle-aged, hypertensive men and 60 age-matched normotensive males. all participants were subject to measurement of aortic systolic (aosbp) and pulse pressure (aopp) by pulse wave analysis using the sphygmocor device. wave reflections were assessed by the measurement of heart rate corrected augmentation index (aix(75)). echocardiography was performed in all individuals and left ventricular mass (lvm) was calculated using the devereux 's formula. plasma tt was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: in hypertensive men, univariate analysis showed an inverse, significant correlation between tt and aosbp (r = -20, p = 0.02), aopp (r = -0.21, p = 0.01), aix75 (r = -0.22, p = 0.01) and lvm (r = -0.19, p = 0.008). multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent inverse association of tt with aopp (b = -0.21, p = 0.02), aix(75) (b = -0.19, p = 0.03) and lvm (b = -0.28, p = 0.005) after adjustment for age, bmi, smoking, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, mean arterial pressure, antihypertensive treatment and statin use. independent associations were retained even after inclusion of normotensive subjects in the analysis. conclusions: in hypertensive men, tt is independently and inversely associated with central pulse pressure, wave reflections and left ventricular mass. considering the adverse prognostic role of central blood pressures and lv hypertrophy on cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients, the present findings might explain part of the increased cardiovascular risk associated with low testosterone. whether measurement of central haemodynamics may improve risk stratification in hypertensive men with low testosterone warrants further investigation.

emergency_contraception	introductionpharmacists have extended opening hours and are located in communities. many offer sexual and reproductive health services such as emergency contraception. the opportunity to receive injectable contraception from community pharmacists would improve availability of this method and might increase uptake and continuation. a self-administered survey of women attending a large urban sexual and reproductive health clinic was undertaken to determine the acceptability of receiving contraceptive injections from a community pharmacist. methodswomen aged 16-50 years attending an nhs walk-in sexual and reproductive health clinic were invited to complete questionnaires while they were waiting to attend an appointment with a clinician. questionnaires asked women if they were current, previous or never users of the progestogen only injectable, their method of contraception and whether availability of the injectable from a local pharmacist would influence their decision to use this method. resultstwo hundred and forty questionnaires were distributed and 220 completed (92%). a total of 9% of respondents were past users of the injectable (n = 21), 4% were current users (n = 8) and the remaining 87% were never users. of those 191 current non-users, 33% (n = 64) indicated that they would consider using this method if it was available at the pharmacy. the main perceived advantages of attending the pharmacy were quicker appointments (52%) and easier access (47%). conclusionprovision of the injectable contraceptive from a pharmacist might make this method attractive to almost one in three women who are not currently using it. this could be a strategy to improve uptake and continuation of this method.
allergies	immunodeficient mice engrafted with functional human cells and tissues, that is, humanized mice, have become increasingly important as small, preclinical animal models for the study of human diseases. since the description of immunodeficient mice bearing mutations in the il2 receptor common gamma chain (il2rg(null)) in the early 2000s, investigators have been able to engraft murine recipients with human hematopoietic stem cells that develop into functional human immune systems. these mice can also be engrafted with human tissues such as islets, liver, skin, and most solid and hematologic cancers. humanized mice are permitting significant progress in studies of human infectious disease, cancer, regenerative medicine, graft-versus-host disease, allergies, and immunity. ultimately, use of humanized mice may lead to the implementation of truly personalized medicine in the clinic. this review discusses recent progress in the development and use of humanized mice and highlights their utility for the study of human diseases.
alzheimer's_disease	acetyl cholinesterase (ache) inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are approved by us-fda as first line drugs to treat the cognitive symptoms of alzheimer 's disease (ad). their beneficial effects are attributed to their ability to elevate endogenous acetylcholine (ach) at the m-1 muscarinic receptor in the brain. however, their side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, loss of appetite and altered heart rate are related to non-specific activation of m-2-m-5 muscarinic subtypes in various tissues. it is logical, therefore, to develop agonists with m-1 receptor selectivity. unfortunately, this is limited due to a high degree of orthosteric site homology among the receptor subtypes. in contrast, their allosteric sites are unique and, therefore, allow selective targeting using positive allosteric modulators (pams). pams of m-1 receptors are devoid of agonist activity, however, when bound they enhance the binding affinity of orthosteric ligand, ach. the major limitation of these pams is their bioavailability in the brain. in the current hypothesis, we propose surface modified nano-lipid drug conjugates (ldc-nps) of pams of m-1 receptors to improve their bioavailability in brain. when co-administered with ache inhibitors they are expected to increase their efficacy and reduce their therapeutic dose and side effects.

sports_injuries	background: most of the research in the area of psychosocial factors in rehabilitation after sports injuries has focused on risk behaviors, while relatively few studies have focused on behaviors that facilitate rehabilitation. the objective of our study was to understand the psychosocial features that characterize elite female football players who express a resilient behaviour during rehabilitation after a first-time anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injury and reconstruction. methods: a qualitative method was used based on individual in-person interviews and video communication of players who incurred a first-time acl tear during the 2012 season of the swedish women 's elite football league. in total, 13 players had a first-time acl and were interviewed post-season. the interviews were followed by a thematic content analysis. based on this, eight players were identified as showing resilient behaviors during their rehabilitation and were included in the final analysis. results: three core themes representing psychosocial factors that help players cope successfully with rehabilitation were identified: (i) constructive communication and rich interaction with significant others; (ii) strong belief in the importance and efficacy of one 's own actions; and (iii) the ability to set reasonable goals. conclusions: the findings suggest three core themes of psychosocial factors that characterize first-time acl-injured elite female football players showing resilience during rehabilitation after acl reconstruction. suggestions for medical teams about ways to support communication, self-efficacy, and goal-setting during the rehabilitation process, are provided.
birth_control	study objective: long acting reversible contraceptives, including etonogestrel implants, are top tier contraceptives for adolescents, yet they remained underutilized. this study aimed to assess awareness of and attitudes toward etonogestrel implants among adolescent and young adult women. design, main outcome measures: this is a cross sectional study. we distributed an original, self-administered survey to a convenience sample of anonymous subjects. the survey assessed demographic information, pregnancy and sexual history, general contraceptive preferences, and awareness of implants. subjects then read a brief description of implants before completing the section assessing attitudes toward them. we used chi-square and t-test analyses to identify factors associated with awareness of and positive attitudes toward implants. setting, participants: women aged 10-24 attending a birth control education group at an adolescent health center in new york city. results: of the 129 participants, only 40% had heard of etonogestrel implants. some (33%) reported positive attitudes toward implants. positive attitudes were associated with preferences for birth control convenience (or = 3.3, 95% ci = 1.1-9.5) and privacy (or = 2.2, 95% cl = 1.0-4.8). neutral or negative attitudes were associated with a preference for birth control that maintained menstrual regularity (or = 0.4, 95% cl = 0.2-0.8) and with having experienced at least 1 unintended pregnancy (or = 0.4, 95% cl = 0.2-0.9). age, race, and education were not associated with participants' attitudes toward implants. conclusions: women who value convenience and privacy are more likely to report positive attitudes toward implants, and thus may represent especially receptive candidates for them.
menopause	diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin of natural origin, has demonstrated benefits when it comes to the treatment of malignancies, cardiovascular issues and menopausal symptoms. in this study, we investigated the histological changes of the adrenal gland after diosgenin application in a rat model of the menopause. middle-aged, acyclic female wistar rats were divided into control (c; n= 6) and diosgenin treated (d; n = 6) groups. diosgenin (100 mg/kg b.w./day) was orally administered for four weeks, while c group received the vehicle alone. a histological approach included design-based stereology, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. the adrenal cortex volume decreased in d females by 15% (p <0.05) while the volume of adrenal medulla increased (p < 0.05) by 64%, compared to the same parameters in c group. volume density of the zona glomerulosa (expressed per absolute adrenal gland volume) in d rats increased (p < 0.05) by 22% in comparison with c animals. diosgenin treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the volume density of the zona fasciculata (expressed per volume of adrenal cortex) by 15% when compared to c females. absolute volume of the zona reticularis in d group decreased (p < 0.05) by 38% in comparison with the same parameter in c rats. also, after diosgenin application, the volume density of the zona reticularis (expressed per volume of adrenal cortex) and the zona reticularis cell volume were decreased by 51% and 20% (p <0.05) respectively, compared to c animals. our results, reflecting a decrease in many stereological parameters of the adrenal cortex, indicate that diosgenin took over the role of corticosteroid precursors and became incorporated into steroidogenesis.

overactive_bladder	objectivesto investigate urodynamic efficacy and safety of mirabegron add-on treatment with tamsulosin for japanese male patients with overactive bladder (oab). methodsa prospective study was conducted in 26 consecutive male patients with oab who had been taking tamsulosin. oab was diagnosed by overactive bladder symptom score (oabss). before and 8weeks after mirabegron add-on treatment with preceding tamsulosin, we assessed oabss, international prostate symptom score (ipss), free uroflowmetry (ufm), filling cystometry and pressure-flow study (pfs). resultsmean age and prostate volume of the study patients were 757years and 32 +/- 19ml, respectively. mirabegron significantly improved oabss (from 8.5 +/- 2.3 to 4.7 +/- 2.5, p<0.001). on free ufm, mirabegron significantly increased voided volume (from 135 +/- 47 to 182 +/- 102ml, p=0.01), maximum (from 10.7 +/- 3.7 to 13.5 +/- 6.4ml/sec, p<0.01) and average flow rate (from 5.5 +/- 1.9 to 7.1 +/- 3.3ml/sec, p<0.01), while postvoid residual urine volume did not change significantly (from 47 +/- 38 to 63 +/- 61ml, p=0.23). before mirabegron, 24 patients (92%) had detrusor overactivity (do). after mirabegron add-on, maximum cystometric capacity significantly increased from 170 +/- 98 to 212 +/- 95ml (p=0.01) and do disappeared in six patients (25%). in the other 18 patients with persistent do, amplitude of involuntary contraction decreased and bladder volume at first involuntary contraction increased with statistical significance. on pfs, detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate (from 79 +/- 31 to 68 +/- 19cmh(2)o, p=0.10) or bladder contractility index (from 126 +/- 39 to 120 +/- 27, p=0.45) did not change significantly. conclusions: mirabegron add-on treatment with tamsulosin has efficacy and safety because it improves storage symptom without impairment of bladder contractility during voiding in male patients with oab.
emergency_contraception	introduction: pharmacists' timely provision of emergency contraception (ec) requires critical thinking and a sensitive patient-centred approach. aim: to explore the impact of socratic teaching on pharmacy students' professional judgement, critical thinking and patient-centredness, in relation to ec provision. methods: one hundred and fifty-three first and second year graduate entry master of pharmacy students, representing pre- and post-ec teaching groups, were presented with a questionnaire comprising an array of challenging hypothetical scenarios involving pharmacy requests for ec. results: one hundred and forty-two (92.8%) students responded. first and second year students showed significant differences in their intentions to supply ec or refer to another health professional. student comments demonstrated differences in both social and professional judgement pre-and post-teaching. justifications provided to explain their choices indicated that post-teaching students better understood that context impacts on decision making, especially when delivering patient-centred care. conclusion: socratic teaching enhances students' critical thinking and patient-centredness in relation to hypothetical ec provision.
low_testosterone	life expectancy has increased in many countries as a result the world 's population is aging. the projections indicate that the proportion of the elderly in a few decades will increase significantly. aging carries with it a series of physiological changes; one of them is an imbalance in the hemostatic system. thus the levels or activity of various proteins involved, such as most coagulation factors, natural anticoagulants and the fibrinolytic system are altered so that the hemostatic balance leans toward thrombosis. also, platelet activity suggests a state of abnormal activation (p-selectin, beta thromboglobulin and platelet factor). in this review we will systematically examine the alterations in the hemostatic components that occur during aging. therefore, understanding these hemostatic changes could contribute to developing strategies for the proper management of health in old age.

parenting	whereas previous research on environmental factors implicated in the intergenerational transmission of depression has tended to focus on the role of parenting quality (e.g., harshness), the current study sought to assess whether structural aspects of families may contribute to depression-relevant affective and immune processes in youths. specifically, the present study examined the role of family routines in linking parental depressive symptoms to youth emotion regulation, a depression-relevant marker of low-grade inflammation, and depressive symptoms in youths. 261 parent-adolescent dyads reported on their own depressive symptoms, family routines, and youths' emotion regulation abilities. in addition, peripheral blood was drawn from youths to assess levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (il-6). path analyses provided support for a model in which parental depressive symptoms related to fewer family routines, which in turn were associated with higher il-6 and depressive symptoms in youths as well as marginally associated with worse youth emotion regulation. moreover, family routines were found to statistically account for part of the association between parent- and youth- depressive symptoms. together, these results suggest that family routines may represent an additional facet of the family environment that can potentially contribute to the intergenerational transmission of depressive symptoms.
sports_injuries	the purpose of this study was to determine if the time-loss (tlir) and non-time-loss injury rates (ntlir) in youth football were decreased by the implementation of the p.r.e.p.a.r.e injury prevention program. this study consisted of two groups: coaches and players. some coaches took the program and select elements of the program were instituted. the injury rates (ir) in the players were compared pre and post. there was a reduction of some of the irs during the intervention season. this reduction may be due in part to some of the coaches completing the entire program and all of the coaches instituting six elements of the program. continued research is needed to determine if the irs, in youth football, are consistently reduced by implementation of the program. further research is needed to examine the impact of coaches taking and implementing the program on the reduction of injuries in other youth sports.
overactive_bladder	aims: to systematically review the management of lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts) in patients with dementia and associated disorders. methods: this systematic review was performed according to the prisma statement. studies were identified by electronic search of embase and medline databases ( last search august 2015) and by screening of reference lists and reviews. results: of 1,426 abstracts that were screened, 102 full-text articles were identified and assessed for eligibility. seventy-six articles were then included in the quantitative synthesis. urinary incontinence ( ui) prevalence rates in dementia patients have varied considerably, ranging from 11 to 93%. in alzheimer 's disease patients, ui usually correlates with disease progression ( late-stage dementia). in contrast, luts usually precede severe mental failure in lewy body disease and in vascular dementia. behavioral therapy, including toilet training and prompted voiding, may be especially useful in patients with unawareness ui. high-quality data to guide the choice of treatment strategies in this population are lacking. current evidence suggests that antimuscarinics, especially oxybutynin, can be associated with cognitive worsening, due to the blockade of m1 receptors. thus, the use of antimuscarinics that do not easily cross the blood-brain barrier or are more m2/m3 selective should be considered. no data are available for beta-3 agonists so far. conclusion: different types of dementia cause different luts at varying time points during the disease process and need singular therapeutic approaches. treatment of luts should be tailored to individual patient needs and disease status, considering factors like mobility, cognitive function, and general medical condition.

hepatitis_c	backgroundwhether the introduction of model for end-stage liver disease (meld) has an effect on transplant outcome for different age categories remain unclear. methodswe analyzed 49,762 adult hepatitis c virus (hcv) candidates through 1 january 1995 to 31 december 2012 from the scientific registry of transplant recipients. patients were divided into four age categories (18-34, 35-49, 60-64, 65 years) in the pre-meld era and meld era, respectively. resultswaiting list dropouts have decreased in the meld era for all categories. a reduced trend in survival was observed for 18-34 years patients in the meld era compared with the pre-meld era, with 5-year intention-to-treat, overall and graft survival of 56.5%, 57.9%, 56.3% vs. 56.4%, 69.7%, 64.4% (p = 0.604, 0.034, and 0.071, respectively). for other age categories, survival rates were all superior in the meld era. cox-regression analysis showed values of hazard ratio for age increased with advanced age (all >1) in the pre-meld era compared with the reference group (18-34 years), while these hazard ratios were <1 for overall and graft survival in meld era. conclusionsour study provides useful evidence that the introduction of meld for liver allocation may adversely affect survival of specific hcv patients.
hypothyroidism	down syndrome characterized by trisomy of chromosome 21 is frequently associated with thyroid dysfunctions due to underlying autoimmune disorders. hypothyroidism is the commonest thyroid dysfunction and hyperthyroidism, usually graves' disease, is far less common. on literature review, we came across approximately 112 cases reported so far with the first such case report in 1946. the published data from india on hyperthyroidism in down syndrome is of three case reports. we report one such patient, an adult male of 28 years who was administered iodine-131 as a definitive treatment after 9-10 years of initial diagnosis.
senior_health	this systematic review evaluates long-term dental arch changes after rapid maxillary expansion treatment on orthodontic patients with constricted arches. clinical trials that assessed dental arch changes through measurements on dental casts or cephalometric radiographs were selected. no patients with surgical or other simultaneous treatment during the active expansion period were accepted. electronic databases were searched with the help of a senior health sciences librarian. original articles were retrieved from the selected abstracts, and their references were also scanned for possible missing articles. forty-one articles met the initial inclusion criteria, but 35 were later rejected because they lacked a control group or only evaluated dental changes or used a semirapid technique. some of them also lacked a reported measurement error. from the remaining articles, two did not report a long-term evaluation. from the final four articles, two measured changes through dental casts and two assessed changes through radiographs (one through lateral cephalometric radiographs and one through posteroanterior radiographs). similar maxillary molar and cuspid expansion could be found in adolescents and young adults. significantly less indirect mandibular molar and cuspid expansion was attained in young adults compared with adolescents. a significant overall gain in the maxillary and inandibular arch perimeter was found in adolescents. more transverse dental arch changes were found after puberty as compared with before, but the difference may not be clinically significant. no anteroposterior dental changes were found on lateral cephalometric radiographs.
myelofibrosis	primary myelofibrosis is one of the philadelphia negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. it is a rare disease featured by cytopenias and hepatosplenomegaly. although the etiology of the disease is still unknown, our knowledge about its pathology and prognosis has been improving in the last few years. furthermore, the jak2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has become available in hungary since 2015. beside its high efficacy in spleen volume and in reduction of myelofibrosis-associated symptoms, this novel therapy also exerts a disease-modifying effect and, therefore, ruxolitinib may improve the life expectancy too. treatment approach of myelofibrosis has been changed these years, which gives a reason for this summary.
parenting	backgroundthe aim was to investigate the role of measured intellectual function in framing parents as unfit' in child custody deprivation cases. methodgrounded theory was used to analyse a national sample of custody deprivation cases in iceland 2002-2014. resultsthe terminology used to evaluate and describe the intellectual and developmental status of parents in child deprivation custody cases served as a device to define and shape the unfit parent'. intellect itself, whether as low, average or even above average at times acts as a master narrative which informs and explains all manner of perceived parental deficiencies. conclusionthe intellectual and developmental status served as a yardstick of identifying, understanding and interpreting the unfit parent. as a tool to achieve an end, parents were framed in language and culture using underlying belief set to make sense of events and issues.
cancer	backgroundvegetarian diets may be associated with certain benefits toward human health, although current evidence is scarce and contrasting. in the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed with respect to the association between vegetarian diets and breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk. methodsstudies were systematically searched in pubmed and embase electronic databases. eligible studies had a prospective design and compared vegetarian, semi- and pesco-vegetarian diets with a non-vegetarian diet. random-effects models were applied to calculate relative risks (rrs) of cancer between diets. statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were explored. resultsa total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. studies were conducted on six cohorts accounting for 686 629 individuals, and 3441, 4062 and 1935 cases of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, respectively. none of the analyses showed a significant association of vegetarian diet and a lower risk of either breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer compared to a non-vegetarian diet. by contrast, a lower risk of colorectal cancer was associated with a semi-vegetarian diet (rr = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-0.94; i-2 = 0%, p-heterogeneity = 0.82) and a pesco-vegetarian diet (rr = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.53, 0.83; i-2 = 0%, p-heterogeneity = 0.46) compared to a non-vegetarian diet. the subgroup analysis by cancer localisation showed no differences in summary risk estimates between colon and rectal cancer. conclusionsa summary of the existing evidence from cohort studies on vegetarian diets showed that complete exclusion of any source of protein from the diet is not associated with further benefits for human health.
emergency_contraception	access to family planning has been identified as critical to public health. improving the linkage between medical and social services could result in improved access to care for those most at risk of unintended pregnancy. this study used a survey based on alfred bandura 's social cognitive theory (1986) to increase the understanding of the barriers social workers confront in the provision of family planning information to clients. although moral disagreement with family planning presented a barrier for some, workplace policy, participation in family planning trainings, and working in an urban setting were of greater value in understanding barriers.
birth_control	this paper studies the heterogeneous effects of the birth control pill and abortion rights on young people 's career plans. in particular, these effects are allowed to vary by sex, race, religion, and, importantly, by level of academic ability. using annual surveys of over two million college freshmen from 1968 to 1976, i find that the pill mainly affected high ability women, by shifting their plans toward occupations with higher wages and higher male ratios. abortion rights, in contrast, were mainly shown to affect women in the low ability group, with their plans shifting toward careers associated with lower income and lower prestige scores. my findings also suggest that the career plans of black males were positively affected by both increased access to the pill and abortions.

skin_care	rosa rubiginosa l. seed oil has been studied for its application in skin care products, but the chemical nature of seeds, pulp and even leaves, apart from that of oil, is also relevant with a view to the application of this weed for biodiesel production. all these vegetal materials were studied by infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) for characterisation purposes. ftir bands at 3005, 2924, 1740, 1654 and 1456 cm(-1) were used to estimate the iodine index, suitable for biofuels, and the oxidation stability degree. from the viewpoint of the thermal stability, both the seed oil (for which pyrolysis occurs at 462 degrees c), the raw seeds and the rosehip pulp (with decomposition temperatures of 373 degrees c and 333 degrees c, respectively) showed potential as a biomass feedstock for conversion into biofuels.
sprains_and_strains	objective: to investigate the effects of different rearfoot orthotics on postural sway during unilateral stance after lateral ankle sprain. design: repeated-measures 3-factor analysis of variance on postural sway length and velocity in the frontal and sagittal planes with factors being stance leg(injured, uninjured), session (within 3d, 2wk, 4wk postinjury), and condition (6 orthotic conditions). setting: university biomechanics laboratory. patients: fifteen collegiate athletes with acute, unilateral first- or second-degree lateral ankle sprain. interventions: balance testing was performed under 6 conditions: (1) shoe only, (2) molded aquaplast orthotic, (3) lateral heel wedge, (4) 7 degrees medially posted orthotic, (5) 4 degrees laterally posted orthotic, and (6) neutral orthotic. main outcome measures: postural sway length and postural sway velocity in the frontal and sagittal planes. results: significant main effects were found for side and session, but not orthotic condition, for all 4 dependent variables. postural sway length and velocity were greater on the injured limbs as compared with the uninjured limbs during the first 2 sessions but not during the third session. none of the orthotics significantly reduced postural sway compared with the shoe-only condition after lateral ankle sprain. conclusions: rearfoot orthotics, irrespective of design pr posting, were ineffective at improving postural sway after lateral ankle sprain.
senior_health	resource allocation in the irish health service, based on historical allocations with incremental increases, is widely believed to be inequitable. using a three-round policy delphi survey, which seeks to explore both consensus and disagreement surrounding policy issues, the views of 52 senior health service personnel were sought in order to determine ways to improve equity in resource allocation. panellists provided several reasons why the current method of resource allocation is inequitable and several suggestions for improving equity. the level of consensus on views was determined by calculating the percentage of ratings in each category based on a series of rating scales. the main suggestion centred around the development and implementation of a needs based resource allocation formula. panellists reached a high consensus in favour of this but only reached a low consensus as to its feasibility. potential obstacles identified included methodological difficulties, insufficient resources and resistance from potential losers. these findings highlight concerns about the lack of transparency in the resource allocation process and openness to the development of a more equitable needs based resource allocation model, a move which is becoming more common internationally. feasibility concerns should not preclude an attempt to begin this process.

sports_injuries	background: the frequency and severity of injury in beach soccer are unknown. purpose: to estimate the incidence rates, characteristics, and risk factors for injuries associated with beach soccer. study design: cohort study; level of evidence, 3. methods: the same sports physician examined and recorded injuries incurred during the japanese national beach soccer championships in 2013 and 2014. posttournament follow-up was made for all injuries. match exposure for each player was recorded through video review to examine individual risk factors. results: a total of 58 injuries were recorded during 54 matches. the overall injury rate was 179.0 (95% ci, 138.4-231.6), and the time-loss injury rate was 28.2 (95% ci, 14.7-54.1) per 1000 player-hours. the foot/toe (34.9%) was the most frequently injured area, followed by the lower leg (22.2%) and thigh (11.1%). there was only 1 ankle injury (1.6%). the most frequent injury type was contusions (60.3%), followed by lacerations/abrasions (14.3%) and sprains/ligament injuries (6.3%). only 4 injuries resulted in 30 days of time-loss (7.4%). after adjusting for age, a previous history of severe injury and longer experience of beach soccer were significantly associated with injury risk. conclusion: the time-loss injury rate in this study was comparable to the rates reported during the matches of soccer or futsal tournaments. however, a greater incidence of foot/toe injury and lacerations/abrasions as well as a lower incidence of ankle injury distinguished beach soccer from soccer and futsal, possibly related to the specific playing conditions of being barefoot on a sand surface.
myelofibrosis	objectivesomatic mutations in asxl1 seem to have a negative prognostic impact in patients with several myeloid neoplasms, including myelofibrosis (mf). the aim of this work was to determine the prevalence and profile of asxl1 mutations in mf. methodswe analyzed mutations in asxl1 in 70 consecutive mf patients from 8 spanish hospitals by means of sanger sequencing, as well as jak2, calr, and mpl mutations. resultsasxl1 mutations were found in 16/70 (23%) of cases, most commonly p.gly646trpfsx12 (5/16). most mutations (13/16) were frameshift mutations. of 54 asxl1- wild-type patients, 32 (59%) had at least one single nucleotide polymorphism (snp), 27 of them had g.78128c>t, g.79017a>c, and g.79085t>c [triple snp (tsnp) patients]. the 5-yr overall survival probability of tsnp patients was 67% (95% ci, 43-91%) vs. 90% (95% ci, 77-100%) in asxl1-wt patients (p = 0.152). conclusionasxl1 mutations were found in 23% of cases, p.gly646trpfsx12 being the most frequent. about 85% of mutations were found only in individual cases and 46% had not previously been reported, a pattern also seen in other series. fifty percent of asxl1-wt patients had a combination of three specific snps that might have a prognostic correlation that needs to be determined in larger series.
alzheimer's_disease	introduction: trem2 is a lipid-sensing activating receptor on microglia known to be important for alzheimer 's disease (ad), but whether it plays a beneficial or detrimental role in disease pathogenesis is controversial. methods: we analyzed ad risk of trem2 variants in the nimh ad genetics initiative study and ad sequencing project. we compared each variant 's risk and functional impact by a reporter assay. finally, we analyzed expression of trem2 on human monocytes. results: we provide more evidence for increased ad risk associated with several trem2 variants, and show that these variants decreased or markedly increased binding to trem2 ligands. we identify hdl and ldl as novel trem2 ligands. we also show that trem2 expression in human monocytes is minimal compared to monocyte-derived dendritic cells. discussion: our results suggest that trem2 signaling helps protect against ad but can cause harm in excess, supporting the idea that proper trem2 function is important to counteract disease progression.

cancer	in this work, bimetallic bi/pt nanoparticles in bovine serum albumin biomolecular scaffold (bsa-bi/ ptnps) were synthesized through a facile and green method. as compared with bsa-ptnps, the bsa-bi/ ptnps possess enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity. moreover, the bsa-bi/ptnps are stable in harsh conditions such as high temperature, extreme ph environments, and high ionic strength, as well as in common biological matrixes. these prominent advantages enable the bsa-bi/ptnps to be applied to a wide range of fields. bioassays, such as serum glucose detection, extracellular hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) monitor, and cancer cells labeling, have been realized with satisfying results. the linear range of glucose determination was from 1 to 100 mu m and the limit of detection (lod) was 0.2 mm. the h2o2 released from each mcf-7 cell after stimulation was calculated to be 2.66 x 10(-16) mol/s. by utilizing folic acid as a recognition element, tumor cell could be readily distinguished by bsa-bi/ptnps and the lod for mcf-7 cell detection was 90 cells.

hepatitis_c	the prevalence of hcv infection is higher among prisoners than in the general population. the introduction of hcv direct-acting antivirals (daa) holds the potential to improve clinical outcomes also in inmates. however, treatment of hepatitis c in inmates has to face several clinical and logistical issues which are peculiar of prison environment. recommendations on the management of hcv infection specific for the penitentiary setting in the daa era remain scant. the italian society for penitentiary medicine and healthcare has, therefore, issued these recommendations, to provide clinicians with a guide for the comprehensive management of hcv infection in the restriction setting, taking into account its peculiar characteristics. dedicated diagnostic and treatment procedures should be established in each prison. in particular, the use of daas appears crucial to provide patients with an effective therapeutic option, able to overcome the limitations of ifn-based regimens with a short period of treatment. daa treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in all eligible subjects with the aim to cure the patient, as well as to limit the transmission of hcv infection both inside the penitentiary system and to the free community, once the inmates ends his/her release. importantly, efforts should be made to open a discussion with regulatory bodies, to define specific regulations aimed to guarantee wide access to effective therapies of all eligible patients, to optimize the management of and the adherence to the hcv treatment, and to ensure the therapeutic continuity after discharge from prison.
parkinson's_disease	adaptive deep brain stimulation uses feedback about the state of neural circuits to control stimulation rather than delivering fixed stimulation all the time, as currently performed. in patients with parkinson 's disease, elevations in beta activity (13-35 hz) in the subthalamic nucleus have been demonstrated to correlate with clinical impairment and have provided the basis for feedback control in trials of adaptive deep brain stimulation. these pilot studies have suggested that adaptive deep brain stimulation may potentially be more effective, efficient and selective than conventional deep brain stimulation, implying mechanistic differences between the two approaches. here we test the hypothesis that such differences arise through differential effects on the temporal dynamics of beta activity. the latter is not constantly increased in parkinson 's disease, but comes in bursts of different durations and amplitudes. we demonstrate that the amplitude of beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus increases in proportion to burst duration, consistent with progressively increasing synchronization. effective adaptive deep brain stimulation truncated long beta bursts shifting the distribution of burst duration away from long duration with large amplitude towards short duration, lower amplitude bursts. critically, bursts with shorter duration are negatively and bursts with longer duration positively correlated with the motor impairment off stimulation. conventional deep brain stimulation did not change the distribution of burst durations. although both adaptive and conventional deep brain stimulation suppressed mean beta activity amplitude compared to the unstimulated state, this was achieved by a selective effect on burst duration during adaptive deep brain stimulation, whereas conventional deep brain stimulation globally suppressed beta activity. we posit that the relatively selective effect of adaptive deep brain stimulation provides a rationale for why this approach could be more efficacious than conventional continuous deep brain stimulation in the treatment of parkinson 's disease, and helps inform how adaptive deep brain stimulation might best be delivered.
headache	objective: to assess the three-dimensional vision syndrome among the viewers of three-dimensional movies. methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted at the ziauddin university, karachi, from july to november 2015 among viewers of three-dimensional movies. the frequency of three-dimensional vision syndrome during and at the end of a movie was assessed. a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data immediately at the end of the movie. data was analysed using spss 20. results: there were 474 participants with an overall mean age of 25.6 +/- 10.1 years; 270(57%) participants were male and 204(43%) were female. most common symptoms were tired eyes, blurred vision and headache found during the movie among 96(20.3%), 73(15.4%) and 43(9.1%) individuals, whereas at the end of the movie among 100(21.1%), 33(7.0%) and 35(7.4%) viewers, respectively. movies with duration of 2 to 3 hours were also more likely to be associated with three-dimensional vision syndrome during and at the end of the movie (p= 0.001) and (p= 0.004). conclusion: watching three-dimensional movies increased the likelihood of visual fatigue and visually-induced motion sickness.
hepatitis_c	based on classical drug design theory, a novel series of gentiopicroside derivatives was designed and synthesized. all synthesized compounds were then biologically evaluated for their inhibition of influenza virus and anti-hcv activity in vitro. some of the gentiopicroside derivatives, such as 11a, 13d and 16 showed interesting anti-influenza virus activity with ic50 at 39.5 mu m, 45.2 mu m and 44.0 mu m, respectively. however, no significant anti-hcv activity was found for all of gentiopicroside derivatives. the preliminary results indicate that modification of the sugar moiety on gentiopicroside was helpful for enhancing the anti-influenza activities. our works demonstrate the importance of secoiridoid natural products as new leads in the development of potential antiviral inhibitors.

low_testosterone	although high rates of serum testosterone deficiency have been reported in men with spinal cord injury (sci), its determinants and attributes are not yet established. the aim of this study was to recognize, among putative determinants and attributes of androgen deficiency, those significantly associated to low testosterone after adjustment for confounders recognizable in men with chronic sci. a biochemical androgen deficiency (total testosterone < 300 ng/dl) was exhibited by 18 of 51 patients (35.3%). significant correlates of testosterone levels were as follows: weekly leisure time physical activity (ltpa) explored by the ltpa questionnaire for people with sci, body mass index (bmi), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (homa-ir), triglycerides and sexual symptoms, explored by the aging males' symptom (ams) questionnaire. at the multiple linear regression analysis, among putative determinants of low testosterone, only weekly ltpa and bmi exhibited a significant association with testosterone levels, explaining 54.2 and 9.0% of testosterone variability respectively. at the linear regression models, among various putative attributes of androgen deficiency, only lower sexual desire and, at a lesser extent, higher homa-ir, exhibited significant associations with lower testosterone levels, after adjustment for bmi, age, comorbidities and weekly ltpa. in conclusion, poor ltpa, high bmi and low sexual desire are independent predictors of low testosterone in men with chronic sci. this is relevant to clinical practice, as all these features are routinely assessed in rehabilitation settings for sci. as poor ltpa and high bmi are modifiable life-style related risk factors, prospective studies could clarify whether life-style modification could increase the level of testosterone and improve the low sexual desire, relevant clinical attribute of low testosterone in men with sci.
hepatitis_c	background porto alegre is the brazilian state capital with second highest incidence of tuberculosis (tb) and the highest proportion of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) among patients with tb. hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection increases the risk of anti-tb drug-induced hepatotoxicity, which may result in discontinuation of the therapy. objectives the aim of this study was (i) to estimate prevalence of hcv and hiv in a group of patients newly diagnosed with active tb in a public reference hospital in porto alegre and (ii) to compare demographic, behavioural, and clinical characteristics of patients in relation to their hcv infection status. methods one hundred and thirty-eight patients with tb were tested for anti-hcv antibody, hcv rna, and anti-hiv1/ 2 antibody markers. hcv rna from real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-positive samples was submitted to reverse transcription and pcr amplification. the 5' non-coding region of the hcv genome was sequenced, and genotypes of hcv isolates were determined. findings anti-hcv antibody, hcv rna, and anti-hiv antibodies were detected in 27 [20%; 95% confidence interval (ci), 13-26%], 17 (12%; 95% ci, 7-18%), and 34 (25%; 95% ci, 17-32%) patients, respectively. hcv isolates belonged to genotypes 1 (n = 12) and 3 (n = 4). some characteristics were significantly more frequent in patients infected with hcv. among them, non-white individuals, alcoholics, users of illicit drugs, imprisoned individuals, and those with history of previous tb episode were more commonly infected with hcv (p < 0.05). main conclusions hcv screening, including detection of anti-hcv antibody and hcv rna, will be important to improving the management of co-infected patients, given their increased risk of developing tb treatment-related hepatotoxicity.
allergies	egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies during childhood along with cow 's milk allergy. the measles-mumpsrubella (mmr) vaccine is included in the pediatric immunization schedule and contains egg protein. the currently accepted opinion is that the mmr vaccination should be done in a single dose under medical observation in patients with egg allergy. although it is reported that the mmr vaccine is safe for that patients, there are some patients who developed anaphylaxis. generally, the development of anaphylaxis after the previous vaccination is reported as a contraindication. we present a successful administration of mmr vaccine by gradually increased doses for a patient who developed anaphylaxis after the previous vaccination.
cancer	objective: the aim of this study is to evaluate the use of peg/glycerides of different hlb; oleoyl macrogol-6-glycerides (labrafil (r) m 1944 cs) and caprylocaproylmacrogol-8-glycerides (labrasol (r)), compared to labrafac lipophile (r) as peg-free glyceride in the preparation of nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs). peg/glycerides are suggested to perform a dual function; as the oily component, and as the peg-containing substrate required for producing the pegylated carriers without physical or chemical synthesis. methods: lipid nanocarriers were loaded with simvastatin (sv) as a promising anticancer drug. an optimization study of nlc fabrication variables was first conducted. the effect of lyophilization was investigated using cryoprotectants of various types and concentrations. the prepared nlcs were characterized in terms of particle size (ps), size distribution (pdi), zeta potential (zp), drug entrapment, in vitro drug release, morphology and drug-excipient interactions. the influence of glyceridespeg on the cytotoxicity of sv was evaluated on mcf-7 breast cancer cells, in addition to the cellular uptake of fluorescent blank nlcs. results: the alteration between different oil types had a significant impact on ps, zp and drug release. both sucrose and trehalose showed the lowest increase in ps and pdi of the reconstituted lyophilized nlcs. the in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies indicated that sv showed the highest antitumor effect on mcf-7 cancer cells when loaded into labrasol (r) nlcs demonstrating a high cellular uptake as well. conclusion: the study confirms the applicability of peg/glycerides in the development of nlcs. encapsulating sv in labrasol (r)-containing nlc could enhance the antitumor effect of the drug.
menopause	aims: urinary incontinence in general is a major cause of quality of life impairment, morbidity and hospitalization. its onset is strongly linked to the menopause. our study aimed to elucidate the possible relationship between endogenous circulating estrogens and the onset and development of stress urinary incontinence (sui). methods: one hundred and thirty eight peri-and postmenopausal women with sui were matched 1: 1 with continent women based on age and bmi. morning fasting blood samples were drawn from all subjects for assessment of estradiol (e2), fsh, lh, testosterone, delta 4-androstendione (d4a), dheas, prolactin, sbhg as well as a biochemical profile (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, hdl, ldl, apoa1, apob). hormone and biochemical parameters were compared between continent and incontinent women. results: incontinent women had significantly lower serum estradiol levels compared to those in the control group (17.30 +/- 8.16 vs. 24.22 +/- 8.99, p<0.001). furthermore, the same association was observed for serum d4a (146.07 +/- 52.63 vs. 159.99 +/- 42.62, p = 0.017). these associations remained significant after controlling for age, menopausal age, bmi, and number of deliveries. conclusions: these results may indicate that within the postmenopausal range, endogenous sex hormones may be associated with the presence of sui in women not on menopausal hormone therapy.

diabetes	what is known and objectivethe prevalence of diabetic nephropathy continues to rise and it remains a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. patients diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy are actively excluded from most trials involving diabetic medications and it is important to understand the prescription patterns in this subset of patients with diabetes. methodsusing the ims health 's national disease and therapeutic index, we analysed the medication prescription patterns for six classes of medications from 2010 to 2014 among patients, 35 years or older, with diabetic nephropathy. resultsannual office visits increased from 772 860 (95% confidence interval (ci), 755, 470-790, 249) in 2010 to 1 868 618 (95% ci, 1 834 422-1 902 814) in 2013 and declined to 830 596 (95% ci, 809 167-852 025) in 2014. sulfonylureas and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (dpp-4 inhibitors) were the most frequently used of the four classes of diabetic medications included in this study. dpp-4 inhibitors use increased gradually and was used in 54% (95% ci 49-58) of treatment visits by the last quarter of 2014. across these years, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (aceis and arbs) were prescribed in the majority of treatment visits with peaks above 90%. however, there were some periods when utilization of these antihypertensives was low. what is new and conclusionssignificant increases occurred in the uptake of new diabetic medications; dpp-4 inhibitors and sglt-2 inhibitors and in the utilization of aceis and arbs compared to the findings reported in other studies with increased complexity in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy. improved and continued used of these medications may be beneficial in improving patient outcomes.
menopause	background and aims: the mediterranean diet ( md) has been associated with reduced morbidity from cardiovascular diseases in the general population. the aim of this study was to assess whether different degrees of adherence to the md were associated with the cardiometabolic risk in peri and menopausal women. methods and results: this cross-sectional study included 198 peri and menopausalwomen participating in the flamenco project. validated questionnaires were used to assess menopause healthrelated quality of life and degree of adherence to the md (low, medium and high). the following cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed: fat mass percentage, waist circumference, blood pressure and resting heart rate, plasma markers (total cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [hdl-c and ldl-c, respectively], total cholesterol/hdl ratio, triglycerides, c-reactive protein and fasting glucose), physical activity levels and smoking status. the degree of adherence to the md among the study sample was 27%, 40% and 30% for low, medium and high adherence, respectively. after controlling for potential confounders, women with a high adherence to the md showed lower plasma total cholesterol (p = 0.025), resting heart rate (p = 0.005), ldl-c (p = 0.019), triglycerides (p = 0.046) and c-reactive protein (p = 0.009) compared to those with a low adherence. likewisewomen with high adherence to the mdshowed lower total cholesterol/ hdl-c ratio (p = 0.020) compared to those with a medium adherence. the high md adherence group also showed lower clustered cardiometabolic risk (p = 0.004). moreover, when analysing specificmd components, whole grain cereals, pulses (both p < 0.05) and red wine (p < 0.01) consumption were inversely associated with the clustered cardiometabolic risk. conclusion: the present findings suggest that a high but not medium adherence to the md is associated with a cardioprotective effect in peri and menopausal women. as a low percentage of the sample showed a high adherence to the md, future research aimed at increasing the adherence to this dietary pattern for a better cardiometabolic status during peri and menopause is warranted.

myelofibrosis	the patient was a 73-year-old healthy female farmer who had been treated with terbinafine for 25.5 months by a primary physician. she exhibited a discoloration and thickening of the right big toenail. she had no concomitant paronychia. direct microscopy revealed chlamydoconidia and hyphae, and periodic acid-schiff stained nail specimen showed septate hyphae. on the basis of these morphological features and gene analysis, the final diagnosis was ungual hyalohyphomycosis caused by fusarium proliferatum. topical application of 10% efinaconazole solution cured the disease in 10 months.
polycythemia_vera	objectivespopulation-based studies have reported an increased incidence of skin cancer in patients with essential thrombocythemia (et) and polycythemia vera (pv). we have examined the risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (nmsc) in patients diagnosed with et or pv during 1973-2012. methodsa case-control study was performed to compare the clinical and treatment-related data of 51 et/pv patients who had nmsc with that of 401 patients who did not. we also evaluated whether polymorphisms in 12 genes involved in dna integrity predisposed to nmsc. resultsby multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk factors for nmsc were older age (or: 1.7, 95% ci: 1.3-2.1, p<0.001), male sex (or: 2.1, 95% ci: 1.1-3.8, p=0.023), higher cumulated hydroxycarbamide dose (or: 1.3, 95% ci: 1.1-1.7, p=0.017), and busulphan exposure (or: 3.2, 95% ci: 1.05-10.0, p=0.041). on the time-to-event prognostic model, factors independently associated with increased cumulative incidence of nmsc were age (5% increased risk per year; p<0.001), male sex (91% increased risk; p=0.022), and hydroxycarbamide exposure (22% increased risk; p=0.065). no susceptibility gene variant was identified. conclusionsthese findings suggest that the risk to develop nmsc in et/pv patients results from the combined effect of common risk factors (age, male sex) together with cytoreductive treatment.
cancer	background: patient adherence is important with the increasing use of oral anticancer drugs. recent studies reported different capecitabine adherence rates based on self-reporting and microelectronic monitoring of the medication bottle. patient 's awareness of being monitored may confound these results. prescription records provide a larger and more objective dataset for adherence investigation. we report the use of computer algorithm and manual review of prescription and medical documentation to determine the rate of capecitabine adherence. methods: two years of capecitabine prescription records from five ambulatory cancer centres were reviewed. prescription data were extracted using a custom java-based software tool to compare the predicted vs. actual dispensing date. the difference between the dates was the primary adherence measure ( altered treatment date incident) and estimated using a computer algorithm and by manual review of medical charts. results: of 4412 refill prescriptions, 45.2% was associated with an altered treatment date incident based on the initial computer algorithm. this was reduced to 29.5% after adjusting for clinic scheduling processes and 10.2% after manual chart review to adjust for valid reasons for delay. the reasons for altered treatment date incident were not identified in 52.2% of prescriptions. conclusions: adherence rate of capecitabine based on refill data seem to be high and consistent with other findings based on patient self-report. population analysis of prescription data with custom computer algorithm may identify trends in capecitabine adherence with some efficiency. manual review would likely be required to verify these results. the accuracy of using altered prescription refill dates as an adherence measure requires further studies.
headache	introduction: recent triptan development has focused on new administration methods and formulations, triptan combination therapies, treatment in menstrually related migraines, and novel serotonin receptor subtype agonists (5htf). areas covered: clinical triptan research related to migraine was reviewed, analyzing embase and pubmed data bases from 01/01/2011 to 06/29/2016, with a focus on clinical trials of class 1 or 2 level of evidence. there have been advances in drug combination therapies, as well as administration devices that aid in ease of use, increase efficacy, and decrease adverse reactions. some new agents and devices have similar or less efficacy compared to previous generic triptan formulations. new agents have action at the 5htf receptor subtype, and avoid vascular side effects of classic 5ht1b/d agonists, however adverse reactions may limit their clinic use. long half-life triptans, frovatriptan and naratriptan, do appear to have good benefit in menstral related migraine. expert opinion: recent advances in triptan development can offer some advantages to migraine therapy and patient preferences, but have a much higher cost compared to individual generic triptan agents. in the coming years, triptan advances with high efficacy, limiting adrs and cost are welcomed, in this regard the 5ht1b/d triptans are already well established.
cancer	malignant melanoma is one of the most dangerous skin cancer originating from melanocytes. thus, an early and proper melanoma diagnosis influences significantly the therapy efficiency. the melanoma recognition is still difficult, and generally, relies on subjective assessments. in particular, there is a lack of quantitative methods used in melanoma diagnosis and in the monitoring of tumour progression. one such method can be the atomic force microscopy (afm) working in the force spectroscopy mode combined with quartz crystal microbalance (qcm), both applied to quantify the molecular interactions. in our study we have compared the recognition of mannose type glycans in melanocytes (hema-lp) and melanoma cells originating from the radial growth phase (wm35) and from lung metastasis (a375-p). the glycosylation level on their surfaces was probed using lectin concanavalin a (con a) from canavalia ensiformis. the interactions of con a with surface glycans were quantified with both afm and qcm techniques that revealed the presence of various glycan structural groups in a cell-dependent manner. the con a - mannose (or glucose) type glycans present on wm35 cell surface are rather short and less ramified while in a375-p cells, con a binds to long, branched mannose and glucose types of oligosaccharides.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	clostridium difficile causes nosocomial/antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. the major virulence factors are toxin a and toxin b (tcdb), which inactivate gtpases by monoglucosylation, leading to cytopathic (cytoskeleton alteration, cell rounding) and cytotoxic effects (cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis). c. difficile toxins breaching the intestinal epithelial barrier can act on underlying cells, enterocytes, colonocytes, and enteric neurons, as described in vitro and in vivo, but until now no data have been available on enteric glial cell (egc) susceptibility. egcs are crucial for regulating the enteric nervous system, gut homeostasis, the immune and inflammatory responses, and digestive and extradigestive diseases. therefore, we evaluated the effects of c. difficile tcdb in egcs. rat-transformed egcs were treated with tcdb at 0.1-10 ng/ml for 1.5-48 h, and several parameters were analysed. tcdb induces the following in egcs: (1) early cell rounding with rac1 glucosylation; (2) early g2/m cell-cycle arrest by cyclin b1/cdc2 complex inactivation caused by p27 upregulation, the downregulation of cyclin b1 and cdc2 phosphorylated at thr161 and tyr15; and (3) apoptosis by a caspase-dependent but mitochondria-independent pathway. most importantly, the stimulation of egcs with tnf-alpha plus ifn-gamma before, concomitantly or after tcdb treatment strongly increased tcdb-induced apoptosis. furthermore, egcs that survived the cytotoxic effect of tcdb did not recover completely and showed not only persistent rac1 glucosylation, cell-cycle arrest and low apoptosis but also increased production of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting self-rescuing mechanisms. in conclusion, the high susceptibility of egcs to tcdb in vitro, the increased sensitivity to inflammatory cytokines related to apoptosis and the persistence of altered functions in surviving cells suggest an important in vivo role of egcs in the pathogenesis of c. difficile infection.
parenting	over the past four to five decades, multiple randomized controlled trials have verified that preventive interventions targeting key parenting skills can have far-reaching effects on improving a diverse array of child outcomes. further, these studies have shown that parenting skills can be taught, and they are malleable. given these advances, prevention scientists are in a position to make solid empirically based recommendations to public child service systems on using parent-mediated interventions to optimize positive outcomes for the children and families that they serve. child welfare systems serve some of this country 's most vulnerable children and families, yet they have been slow (compared to juvenile justice and mental health systems) to adopt empirically based interventions. this paper describes two child-welfare-initiated, policy-based case studies that have sought to scale-up research-based parenting skills into the routine services that caseworkers deliver to the families that they serve. in both case studies, the child welfare system leaders worked with evaluators and model developers to tailor policy, administrative, and fiscal system practices to institutionalize and sustain evidence-based practices into usual foster care services. descriptions of the implementations, intervention models, and preliminary results are described.
low_testosterone	partnered adults tend to have lower risks of depression than do single individuals, while parents are more commonly depressed than non-parents. low testosterone men, and possibly women, are also at greater risk of depression. a large body of research has shown that partnered parents have lower testosterone than single non-parents in some cultural settings, including the u.s. here, we drew on a large (n = 2438), u.s.-population representative cohort of reproductive aged adults (age: 38.1 years +/- 11.1 sd) to test hypotheses regarding the intersections between partnering and parenting, testosterone, socio-demographic characteristics, and depression outcomes. men and women 's depression prevalence did not vary based on testosterone. partnered fathers had lower testosterone than single (never married, divorced) non-fathers, but were less commonly depressed than those single non-fathers. partnered mothers had reduced testosterone compared to never married and partnered non-mothers. never married mothers had higher depression prevalence and elevated depressive symptomology compared to partnered mothers; these differences were largely accounted for by key health-related covariates (e.g. cigarette smoking, bmi). we found significant three-way-interactions between socioeconomic status (ses), testosterone, and parenting for adults' depression risks. high testosterone, high ses fathers had the lowest prevalence of mild depression, whereas low testosterone, low ses non-fathers had the highest. compared to other mothers, low ses, low testosterone mothers had elevated prevalence of mild depression. overall, low ses, high testosterone non-mothers had substantially elevated depression risks compared to other women. we suggest that psychobiological profiles (e.g. a male with low testosterone) can emerge through variable psychosomatic and psychosocial pathways and the net effect of those profiles for depression are influenced by the social (e.g. partnering and parenting status; socioeconomic gradients), cultural (e.g. gender and family life domains), and ecological (e.g. the lived environment, particularly related to low ses and poverty) contexts in which individuals find themselves.

overactive_bladder	patients with pelvic organ prolapse (pop) may present with a large combination of symptoms including over-active bladder (oab) symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and urgency incontinence. the explanation as to why these symptoms are more prevalent in pop patients is not clearly understood, but there seems to be an overall agreement that prolapse-induced bladder outlet obstruction (boo) may trigger bladder changes resulting in oab symptoms. presuming this to be true, many of the studies managing oab in pop patients have focused on the surgical management of prolapse and its aftermath, which in many of the patients leads to improvement of oab symptoms. this review presents the most recent studies and evidence looking at management of oab in the face of pop and seeks to evaluate if there is any association between prolapse severity and oab symptoms.
skin_care	background: the intensive care unit (icu) is a high-cost high-risk area in which analysis of previous litigation cases may help to improve future practice. methods: claims received by the national health service litigation authority (nhsla) relating to icu, from 1995 to 2012, were analysed according to clinical categories. the severity of outcome was classified as none, low, moderate, severe and death. the cost of the claims were corrected to 2013 values using the retail prices index. results: of the 523 claims in the nhsla dataset, 210 were excluded (as the claims did not relate to icu care) and 313 were included in the analysis. the commonest claim categories were [number (% of all claims)1: positioning/nursing standards/skin care (mostly relating to pressure sores)- 86 (28%), infection- 79 (26%), respiratory/airway- 63 (20%). the commonest claims relating to patient death were: respiratory/airway (30%), missed/delayed diagnosis (20%) and paediatrics (17%). the claims categories with the highest proportion of severe outcomes were: positioning/nursing standards/skin care (52%) and infection (33%). the total cost of closed claims was 19 pound 973 339. the categories incurring the highest costs were: infection (6.6 pound million), positioning/skin care/nursing standards (4.5 pound million), delayed/inadequate treatment (4.3 pound million). conclusions: litigation arising from care in the icu is common, costly, and is likely to follow a poor outcome. whilst the importance of airway/respiratory care and infection control measures are highlighted, the clear prominence of pressure sores in icu-related litigation is worrisome and represents one particular area for practice improvement.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background. dientamoeba fragilis is commonly identified in children in primary care and is suspected to cause gastrointestinal disease. objective. to determine the association between d. fragilis colonization and gastrointestinal symptoms in children. methods. we performed a cross-sectional study with children who presented in primary care with gastrointestinal symptoms. the associations between d. fragilis colonization and specific symptoms were explored by means of logistic regression analyses. asymptomatic siblings of these cases were invited as control subjects for a case-control analysis, where we explored the association between d. fragilis and gastrointestinal symptoms with conditional logistic regression analysis. results. in the cross-sectional study, 107 children were included. their median age was 9 years (interquartile range = 6-12) and 38 (35.5%) were boys. colonization of d. fragilis was present in 59 children (55.1%). the absence of d. fragilis was associated with soft to watery stool [odds ratio (or) = 0.29; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.10-0.85], chronic diarrhoea (or = 0.42; 95% ci = 0.180.97) and fatigue (or = 0.45; 95% ci = 0.20-0.99). the case-control analyses included 44 children in each group. dientamoeba fragilis colonization was not observed more often in cases than in controls after adjustment for age and sex (or = 1.02; 95% ci = 0.28-3.65). conclusion. dientamoeba fragilis is a common parasite in children with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. the anomalous finding of the association between the absence of d. fragilis with soft to watery stools, chronic diarrhoea and fatigue are inexplicable. our study suggests that d. fragilis colonization does not increase the risk for gastrointestinal symptoms.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	fodmap, ""fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols"", is a heterogeneous group of highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols. dietary fodmaps might exacerbate intestinal symptoms by increasing small intestinal water volume, colonic gas production, and intestinal motility. in recent years the low-fodmap diet for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) has gained increasing popularity. in the present review we aim to summarize the physiological, clinical, and nutritional issues, suggesting caution in the prolonged use of this dietary treatment on the basis of the existing literature. the criteria for inclusion in the fodmaps list are not fully defined. although the low-fodmap diet can have a positive impact on the symptoms of ibs, particularly bloating and diarrhea, the quality of the evidence is lower than optimal, due to frequent methodological flaws, particularly lack of a proper control group and/or lack of blinding. in particular, it remains to be proven whether this regimen is superior to conventional ibs diets. the drastic reduction of fodmap intake has physiological consequences, e.g., on the intestinal microbiome and colonocyte metabolism, which are still poorly understood. a low-fodmap diet imposes an important restriction of dietary choices due to the elimination of some staple foods, such as wheat derivatives, lactose-containing dairy products, many vegetables and pulses, and several types of fruits. for this reason, patients may be at risk of reduced intake of fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, b and d vitamins, and natural antioxidants. the nutritional risk of the low-fodmap diet may be higher in persons with limited access to the expensive, alternative dietary items included in the low-fodmap diet.
cancer	objective: considering the higher rate of oral cancer, and reduction in salivary antioxidants in smokers as indicated in previous studies, antioxidant- containing nutrients such as green tea, seem to be beneficial in counteracting against oxidative stress in this group. this study assessed the salivary total antioxidant alteration in smokers compared to nonsmokers, after short-tem (7 days) and long-term (3 weeks), green tea drinking. design: in this experimental study, 20 volunteer moderate-to-heavy male smokers, and 20 matched healthy non-smokers were selected to participate, according to the inclusion criteria. participants were instructed to drink two cups of green tea per day, by dissolving 2 g of green tea in 150 ml of hot water for each cup. after saliva collection, antioxidant capacity of saliva was measured at baseline, after 7 days, and after 21 days. statistical evaluation was done by spss 21, using paired samplet tests, one-way anova and bonferroni tests. results: at day zero nonsmokers had a higher antioxidant capacity than smokers (686.6 +/- 62.22 vs. 338.8 +/- 59.9) mm/50 mu l, p < 0.001. there was also a significant difference between two groups in salivary total antioxidant capacity after one week and three weeks of green tea consumption (p < 0.001). however, there was an upward trend in both smokers and non-smokers over the study period (after tea drinking). in addition, a significant difference was found in total antioxidant capacity alteration in smokers compared to non-smokers from baseline to day 21. conclusions: results support the effectiveness of green tea consumption in salivary antioxidants enhancement in smokers, in both the short- and long term.

hypothyroidism	background: classical thyroid hormones have an established necessary role in the normal development of the central nervous system, and they have been recently considered as decisive factors influencing cognitive functions in the adult brain and involved in the development of alzheimer 's disease. the picture summarizing thyroid hormone effects on the adult brain, however, does not only include classical thyroid hormones but also the products of their peripheral metabolism. these latter have been considered as inactive breakdown products for long but recently were proved to produce significant biological effects. objective: in this review article we presented recent evidence supporting the hypothesis that thyroid hormones exert a neuroprotective effect in the brain areas involved in learning and memory. moreover, we summarized the evidence that suggests that non-classical thyroid hormones produce significant neurological effects in the adult brain. we also discussed the possible role of thyroid hormones in the cognitive impairment, typical of alzheimer 's disease. methods: a comprehensive review of the literature based on the current knowledge of the effects of classical and non-classical thyroid hormones on the adult brain and their role in alzheimer 's disease was performed. results: the available literature suggests that both classical and non-classical thyroid hormones act as neuroprotective agents in the brain areas related to learning and memory. their role in these areas supports the idea that they may be involved in the development of alzheimer 's disease. conclusion: thyroid hormones produce significant neurological effects, act as neuroprotective agents and might be considered as future diagnostic and therapeutic tools for alzheimer 's disease.
headache	aim: given the ubiquitous nature of hangover experience among drinkers, this study aimed to profile hangover experience in terms of the number and patterns of past year symptoms. methods: current drinkers in canada (n=565) recruited through zoompanel were asked about 13 past year hangover symptoms. these were explored through correlation with alcohol consumption, problems, treatment and other factors. findings: increased number of symptoms were associated with higher alcohol use disorders identification test (audit) problem score, perceived harm from drinking, younger age and flushing/blushing when drinking (mean = 3.3 symptoms). four patterns were found from latent class analysis; class 4 (43%) no symptoms; class 3 (13%) thirst, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting; class 2 (22%) thirst, tiredness and headache; and class 1 (21%) wide range. class 1 was characterised by blushing when drinking, higher perceived harm and attempts to reduce drinking due to hangovers. classes 1-3 were associated with heavier consumption; only class 3 compared with class 4 had lower drinking refusal self-efficacy. conclusions: higher alcohol consumption and lower drinking refusal self-efficacy relate to more symptoms; however, a group with variable alcohol consumption did not experience hangovers. the link between problems, treatment and hangover was not clear from patterns of symptoms; symptom severity may be worth further investigation.
fungal_infection	elderly people, especially those institutionalized in long-term care facilities, are at risk of various oral diseases. the aim of the study was to determine the incidence of hyposalivation and colonization/oral fungal infection of oral cavity with yeasts, as well as dental status in institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly. the study included 280 institutionalized and 61 non-institutionalized elderly people. salivary flow rate, oral colonization with yeasts/oral infection and dental status were assessed and compared between the groups. the institutionalized elderly had a significantly lower salivary flow rate (p=0.035). oral colonization with yeasts was more frequently found in institutionalized elderly (p<0.001) as compared with non-institutionalized elderly. a negative correlation was found between decreased salivary flow rate and oral yeast colonization and oral fungal infection in both the institutionalized (rs=-0.58; p<0.05) and non-institutionalized (rs=-0.52; p<0.05) groups. a significant difference in dmft index was observed between the two groups (p<0.001). a negative correlation between decreased salivary flow rate and dental status was found in both the institutionalized (rs=-0.22; p<0.05) and non-institutionalized (rs=-0.56; p<0.05) groups. the results revealed a significantly higher level of hyposalivation and oral yeast colonization and poorer dental status in the institutionalized group as compared with the non-institutionalized group of elderly people.
alzheimer's_disease	hyperphosphorylation of tau forming neurofibrillary tangles has been considered as a crucial event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease (ad). mir-124-3p belongs to microrna (mirna) family and was markedly decreased in ad, however, the functions of mir-124-3p in the pathogenesis of ad remain unknown. we observed that the expression of mir-124-3p was significantly decreased in n2a/app695swe cells; and transfection of mir-124-3p mimics not only attenuated cell apoptosis and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein without any changes of total tau protein, but also increased expression levels of caveolin-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k), phospho-akt (akt-ser473)/akt, phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (gsk-3 beta-ser9)/gsk-3 beta in n2a/app695swe cells. we further found that mir-12-3p directly targeted caveolin-1; mir-124-3p inhibited abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau by regulating caveolin-1-pi3k/akt/gsk3 beta pathway in ad. this study reveals that mir-124-3p may play a neuroprotective role in ad, which may provide new ideas and therapeutic targets for ad.
headache	clara haskil (january 7, 1895-december 7, 1960) was one of the most famous female pianists of the 20th century. in her life and work she set new standards in piano playing. however, her career was beset by poor health and the adversities of two world wars. in her lifetime haskil had three major disorders: juvenile scoliosis requiring treatment in her adolescence, a tumor of the sellar region requiring surgery at age 47 years, and a traumatic brain injury causing her death at the age of 65. her medical history illustrates the development of surgical methods and rehabilitation in medicine before and after world war ii. at an early age, she spent a year in a nursing home for orthopedic diseases due to scoliosis. in 1942, when she was 47 years old, she displayed the first symptoms of a suprasellar brain tumor: headache and hemianopsia. the famous surgeon marcel david performed surgery on her without general anesthesia while haskil mentally played a mozart piano concerto as a neuronal representation to control her memory and mental abilities. only 3 months after that operation she played a mozart piano concerto at a concert that began her career as a great interpreter of mozart. her neurologic rehabilitation was remarkable and highlighted new methods in the field. in 1960, she traveled to brussels for a concert. in the train station she stumbled on the stairs and hit her head on one of the steps. skull fracture and intracranial hematoma were diagnosed. doctors tried to operate on her but she lost consciousness and died. haskil created new styles in piano playing, and her medical history offers indications of new concepts in neurosurgery.
sports_injuries	the myotendinous junction (mtj) is a specialized structure in the musculotendinous system, where force is transmitted from muscle to tendon. animal models have shown that the mtj takes form of tendon finger-like processes merging with muscle tissue. the human mtj is largely unknown and has never been described in three dimensions (3d). the aim of this study was to describe the ultrastructure of the human mtj and render 3d reconstructions. fourteen subjects (age 25 +/- 3 years) with isolated injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (acl), scheduled for reconstruction with a semitendinosus/gracilis graft were included. semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were stripped as grafts for the acl reconstruction. the mtj was isolated from the grafts and prepared for transmission electron microscopy (tem) and focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy. it was possible to isolate recognizable mtj tissue from all 14 patients. tem images displayed similarities to observations in animals: sarcolemmal evaginations observed as finger-like processes from the tendon and endomysium surrounding the muscle fibers, with myofilaments extending from the final z-line of the muscle fiber merging with the tendon tissue. the 3d reconstruction revealed that tendon made ridge-like protrusions, which interdigitiated with groove-like indentations in the muscle cell.
hypothyroidism	aim to identify a set of contributors, and weight and rank them on a pathophysiological basis. methods patients who have undergone a lactulose or glucose hydrogen breath test to rule out small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) for various clinical symptoms, including diarrhoea, weight loss, abdominal pain, cramping or bloating, were seen as eligible for inclusion in a retrospective single-centre study. clinical data such as co-morbidities, medication, laboratory parameters and other possible risk factors have been identified from the electronic data system. cases lacking or with substantially incomplete clinical data were excluded from the analysis. suspected contributors were summarised under four different pathophysiological pathways (impaired gastric acid barrier, impaired intestinal clearance, immunosuppression and miscellaneous factors including thyroid gland variables) and investigated using the chi(2) test, student 's t-test and logistic regression models. results a total of 1809 patients who had undergone hydrogen breath testing were analysed. impairment of the gastric acid barrier (gastrectomy, odds ratio: or = 3.5, ppi therapy or = 1.4), impairment of intestinal clearance (any resecting gastric surgery or = 2.6, any colonic resection or = 1.9, stenosis or = 3.4, gastroparesis or = 3.4, neuropathy 2.2), immunological factors (any drug-induced immunosuppression or = 1.8), altered thyroid gland metabolism (hypothyroidism or = 2.6, levothyroxine therapy or = 3.0) and diabetes mellitus (or = 1.9) were associated significantly to sibo. any abdominal surgery, ileocecal resection, vagotomy or iga-deficiency did not have any influence, and a history of appendectomy decreased the risk of sibo. multivariate analysis revealed gastric surgery, stenoses, medical immunosuppression and levothyroxine to be the strongest predictors. levothyroxine therapy was the strongest contributor in a simplified model (or = 3.0). conclusion the most important contributors for the development of sibo in ascending order are immunosuppression, impairment of intestinal clearance and levothyroxine use, but they do not sufficiently explain its emergence.
heart_disease	the aims were to study biomarkers of systemic inflammation, platelet/endothelial activation and thrombosis in tunnel construction workers (tcw). biomarkers and blood fatty acids were measured in blood of 90 tcw and 50 referents before (baseline) and towards the end (follow-up) of a 12 days work period. they had been absent from work for 9 days at baseline. air samples were collected by personal sampling. personal thoracic air samples showed geometric mean (gm) particulate matter and alpha-quartz concentrations of 604 and 74 a mu g/m(3), respectively. the arithmetic mean (am) concentration of elemental carbon was 51 a mu g/m(3). the gm (and 95% confidence interval) concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha decreased from 2.2 (2.0-2.4) at baseline to 2.0 pg/ml (1.8-2.2) (p = 0.02) at follow-up among the tcw. also the platelet activation biomarkers p-selectin and cd40l decreased significantly [25.4 (24.1-26.6) to 24.4 (22.9-26.0)] ng/ml, p = 0.04 and 125 (114-137) to 105 (96-115) pg/ml, p < 0.001, respectively. icam-1 concentrations increased from 249 (238-260) to 254 (243-266) ng/ml (p = 0.02). no significant alterations were observed among the referents when assessed by paired sample t test. unbeneficial alterations in blood fatty acid composition were observed between baseline and follow-up, mainly among referents. tcw had slightly reduced systemic inflammation and platelet activation although highly exposed to particulate matter, alpha-quarz and diesel exhaust, which might be due to increased physical activity during the exposure period. the slightly increased icam-1 may indicate monocyte recruitment to the lungs. the diet was substantially altered towards a less beneficial fatty acid profile.
multiple_sclerosis	soluble cd40 ligand (scd4ol) is reported to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (bbb). cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and serum scd4ol levels were measured in 29 multiple sclerosis (ms), 29 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd), and 27 disease control (dc) patients. in ms, serum scd4ol levels were higher than in dcs and positively correlated with the csf/serum albumin ratio (qalb). in nmosd, csf scd4ol levels were significantly increased compared to dcs, and were correlated to qalb, csf cell counts, protein concentrations, and interleukin-6 levels. scd4ol could be involved in bbb disruption in ms, whereas it may contribute to cns inflammation in nmosd.

alzheimer's_disease	inflammation is an immune activity designed to protect the host from pathogens and noxious agents. in its low-intensity form, presence of an inflammatory process must be inferred from appropriate biomarkers. occult neuroinflammation is not just secondary to alzheimer 's disease (ad) but may contribute to its pathogenesis and promote its progression. a leaky blood-brain barrier (bbb) has been observed in early ad and may play a role in its initiation and development. studies of the temporal evolution of ad 's biomarkers have shown that, in ad, the brain 's amyloid burden correlates poorly with cognitive decline. in contrast, cognitive deficits in ad correlate well with synapse loss. oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (oa beta s) can be synaptotoxic and evidence of their deposition inside synaptic terminals of cognition-associated neurons explains early memory loss in ad better than formation of extracellular a beta plaques. among innate immune cells that reside in the brain, microglia sense danger signals represented by proteins like oa beta and become activated by neuronal damage such as that caused by bacterial endotoxins. the resulting reactive microgliosis has been implicated in generating the chronic form of microglial activation believed to promote ad 's development. genomewide association studies (gwass) have yielded data from patients with sporadic ad indicating that its causes include genetic variation in the innate immune system. recent preclinical studies have reported that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta ohb) may protect the brain from the adverse effects of both the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod)-like receptor protein 3 (nlrp3) inflammasome and the deacetylation of histone. consequently, there is an urgent need for clinical investigations designed to test whether an orally administered beta ohb preparation, such as a ketone ester, can have a similar beneficial effect in human subjects.

low_testosterone	two competing theories address the influence of foetal testosterone on cerebral laterality: one proposing exposure to high foetal testosterone concentrations is related to atypical lateralisation (geschwind-galaburda hypothesis), the other that high foetal testosterone concentrations exaggerate typical lateralisation (callosal hypothesis). the current study examined the relationship between cord testosterone concentrations and cerebral laterality for language and spatial memory in adulthood. male participants with high (>0.15 nmol) and low (<0.10 nmol) cord testosterone levels were invited to take part in the study (n=18 in each group). cerebral laterality was measured using functional transcranial doppler ultrasonography, while participants completed word generation and visual short-term memory tasks. typical left lateralisation of language was more common in the high-testosterone group than in the low-testosterone group, chi(2) = 4.50, df = 1, p = 034. spatial memory laterality was unrelated to cord testosterone level. our findings indicate that foetal testosterone exposure is related to language laterality in a direction that supports the callosal hypothesis.

allergies	atopic diseases like asthma and allergies to various foodborne proteins are among the widespread chronic diseases in newborns because of their allergy-prone th2-skewed immune response. increasing scientific reports indicate that the mother 's immune system plays a crucial role in mediating the development of fetal-infant immune responses. lactating mammary glands are part of an integrated mucosal immune system with confined production of antibodies particularly targeted against pathogenic agents in the mother 's environment and later encountered by newborns. passive immunity through mother 's milk is critical for a newborn 's immune maturation. thus, understanding the maternal influence of childhood atopic risk on newborn immune maturation could suggest novel treatment and prevention strategies. probiotics have been proposed to harmonize th1/th2 imbalance in allergic diseases; however, the mechanism remains largely unknown. feeding probiotics to mothers and offspring during the prenatal and postnatal periods to inhibit allergies in newborns may be a possible preventive approach in atopic diseases. hence, the present review focuses on the role of feeding probiotics to mothers during pregnancy and lactation as well to newborns during suckling and post weaning periods as possible modulators for the activation of maternal infant immune response to downregulate the allergy-prone th2-biased newborn system.
allergies	aim to determine whether oral administration of bifido-bacterium infantis cgmcc313-2 (b. infantis cgmcc313-2) inhibits allergen-induced airway inflammation and food allergies in a mouse model. methods ovalbumin (ova)-induced allergic asthma and beta-lactoglobulin-induced food allergy mouse models were used in this study. following oral administration of b. infantis cgmcc313-2 during or after allergen sensitization, histopathologic changes in the lung and intestine were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (he) staining. in the allergic asthma mouse model, we evaluated the proportion of lung-infiltrating inflammatory cells. ova-specific ige and igg1 levels in serum and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) were also assessed. in the food allergy mouse model, the levels of total ige and cytokines in serum were measured. results oral administration of b. infantis cgmcc313-2 during or after allergen sensitization suppressed allergic inflammation in lung and intestinal tissues, while the proportion of infiltrating inflammatory cells was significantly decreased in the balf of allergic asthma mice. moreover, b. infantis cgmcc313-2 decreased the serum levels of total ige in food allergy mice, and reductions in ige and igg1 were also observed in ova-induced allergic asthma mice. the expression of interleukin-4 (il-4) and il-13 in both serum and balf was suppressed following the administration of b. infantis cgmcc313-2, while an effect on serum il-10 levels was not observed. conclusion b. infantis cgmcc313-2 inhibits the secretion of allergen-induced ige, il-4 and il-13, and attenuates allergic inflammation.
weight_loss	obesity has become increasingly prevalent, and the number of obese patients in need of liver transplant is expected to continue to increase. in addition, liver disease due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the near future. however, obesity remains a relative contraindication in liver transplant. new strategies in managing this patient population are clearly needed. to this end, the authors review the current literature on the efficacy of bariatric surgery in the setting of liver transplantation in obese patients.
cancer	objectives to evaluate the ct features of ruptured gists and factors that might be predictive of rupture through comparison with cts taken prior to rupture and cts of non-ruptured gist. methods forty-nine patients with ruptured gist and fortynine patients with non-ruptured gist matched by age, gender and location were included. clinical data including pharmacotherapy were reviewed. the imaging features were analyzed. prior ct obtained before rupture were evaluated. results the most common location of ruptured gist was small bowel with mean size of 12.1 cm. ruptured gist commonly showed wall defects, >40 % eccentric necrosis, lobulated shaped, air density in mass, pneumoperitoneum, peritonitis, hemoperitoneum and ascites (p < 0.001-0.030). twenty-seven of 30 patients with follow up imaging received targeted therapy. during follow-up, thickness of the tumour wall decreased. increase in size and progression of necrosis were common during targeted therapy (p = 0.017). newly developed ascites, peritonitis and hemoperitoneum was more common (p40 % eccentric necrosis, wall defects and lobulated shape. the progression of necrosis with increase in size and decreased wall thickness during targeted therapy may increase the risk of rupture. rupture should be considered when newly developed peritonitis, hemoperitoneum, or ascites are noted during the follow-up.
parkinson's_disease	myoclonus in parkinson 's disease (pd) may be related or unrelated to dopaminergic medication and may share some features of cortical myoclonus. the aim of this study was to analyze clinical and electrophysiological correlates of the dopaminergic treatment unrelated myoclonus in pd patients. we included 17 pd patients with the end-of-dose myoclonus and 16 pd patients without myoclonus between january 2010 and june 2011. surface electromyography of upper extremity muscles and long latency reflexes (llrs) were performed. positive or negative myoclonus with a duration of 35-100 ms was observed. rest tremor was less frequent in the group with myoclonus. only one pd patient with myoclonus had c reflex. mean llr amplitude was significantly high in pd with myoclonus compared to the group without myoclonus (p = 0.024). dopaminergic treatment unrelated myoclonus is less related to rest tremor in pd, may be positive or negative, and exhibits similar features to cortical myoclonus.
heart_disease	a wide range of health benefits have been ascribed to soya intake including a lowered risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, and menopausal symptoms. because it is a hormonally active diet, however, soya can also be endocrine disrupting, suggesting that intake has the potential to cause adverse health effects in certain circumstances, particularly when exposure occurs during development. consequently, the question of whether or not soya phyto-oestrogens are beneficial or harmful to human health is neither straightforward nor universally applicable to all groups. possible benefits and risks depend on age, health status, and even the presence or absence of specific gut microflora. as global consumption increases, greater awareness and consideration of the endocrine-disrupting properties of soya by nutrition specialists and other health practitioners is needed. consumption by infants and small children is of particular concern because their hormone-sensitive organs, including the brain and reproductive system, are still undergoing sexual differentiation and maturation. thus, their susceptibility to the endocrine-disrupting activities of soya phyto-oestrogens may be especially high. as oestrogen receptor partial agonists with molecular and cellular properties similar to anthropogenic endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol a, the soya phyto-oestrogens provide an interesting model for how attitudes about what is synthetic' v. what is natural,' shapes understanding and perception of what it means for a compound to be endocrine disrupting and/or potentially harmful. this review describes the endocrine-disrupting properties of soya phyto-oestrogens with a focus on neuroendocrine development and behaviour.
overactive_bladder	mirabegron, the first selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist for the treatment of overactive bladder (oab), inhibits cytochrome p450 isozyme cyp2d6. this study was performed in japanese healthy postmenopausal female volunteers to assess any pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mirabegron and tolterodine, another oab drug and a sensitive substrate of cyp2d6. tolterodine 4 mg was orally administered from days 1-7 and co-administered with mirabegron 50 mg from days 8-14. mirabegron 50 mg increased maximum concentration (c-max) and area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 24 h after dosing (auc(24h)) of tolterodine by 2.06-fold (90% confidence interval [ci] 1.81, 2.34) and 1.86-fold (90% ci 1.60, 2.16), respectively, and increased cmax and auc24h of the metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine by 1.36-fold (90% ci 1.26, 1.47) and 1.25-fold (90% ci 1.15, 1.37), respectively. this suggested a weak pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mirabegron and tolterodine. mean change from baseline of fridericia 's qt correction formula (delta qtcf) was slightly higher on day 14 than on day 7. no subject had qtcf >480 msec or delta qtcf >60 msec. all the treatment-emergent adverse events were mild. mirabegron 50 mg was considered to be safe and well tolerated when coadministered with tolterodine 4 mg in healthy postmenopausal female volunteers.

low_testosterone	low testosterone is associated with late-onset hypogonadism, age-related disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. in this study, we investigated the effects of kaempferia parviflora extract and two of its components, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone, on testosterone production in mouse testis-derived tumour cells i-10. k. parviflora fractions containing 5,7-dimethoxyflavone elicited testosterone production in these cells, as did nobiletin, a polymethoxyflavonoid found in citrus species, but not k. paruiflora, which was used as a comparative control. furthermore, we found that these compounds enhanced testosterone production via cyclic amp (camp)/camp response element binding protein signalling. in particular, the compounds inhibited activation of phosphodiesterase and thereby increased production of camp. these findings support the possibility that k. paruiflora extract, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone, and nobiletin may mitigate age-related disease and hypogonadism by enhancing testosterone production.

senior_health	with the rapid development of internet technology, the new methodologies and techniques based on data analysis are increasing popular for decision-making on many aspects of society and economy, including insurance system. the research focus on the current challenges faced by the senior insurance system of china, such as the acceleration of population aging, the rising prevalence rate of chronic diseases among aging population, and the increasing burden of the senior insurance system. this paper, based on the analysis of clhls data from beijing university and other data sources, mainly investigated the relationship between the social insurance and the health level of the senior population through a multiple linear regression model from a grossman health function. the preliminary conclusions can be drawn from the study as follows. through the comparison of the regression coefficients, it is clear that the three kinds of basic medical care have different effects on the health level of senior population. the interpretation function of medical insurance on senior health level is lower than those of other social decisions and social support factors, while the influence of pension insurance is minor. furthermore, the paper studied the coupling mechanism among pension, medical and nursing insurances, and put forward the suggestions of merging pension, medical and nursing insurances to one single plan to improve the efficiency performance of the current social security service system.
parkinson's_disease	introduction: aging and age-associated disorders such as parkinson 's disease (pd) are often associated with turning difficulties, which can lead to falls and fractures. valid assessment of turning and turning deficits specifically in non-standardized environments may foster specific treatment and prevention of consequences. methods: relative orientation, obtained from 3d-accelerometer and 3d-gyroscope data of a sensor worn at the lower back, was used to develop an algorithm for turning detection and qualitative analysis in pd patients and controls in non-standardized environments. the algorithm was validated with a total of 2,304 turns >= 90 degrees extracted from an independent dataset of 20 pd patients during medication on-and off-conditions and 13 older adults. video observation by two independent clinical observers served as gold standard. results: in pd patients under medication off, the algorithm detected turns with a sensitivity of 0.92, a specificity of 0.89, and an accuracy of 0.92. during medication on, values were 0.92, 0.78, and 0.83. in older adults, the algorithm reached validation values of 0.94, 0.89, and 0.92. turning magnitude (difference, 0.06 degrees; sem, 0.14 degrees) and duration (difference, 0.004 s; sem, 0.005 s) yielded high correlation values with gold standard. overall accuracy for direction of turning was 0.995. intra class correlation of the clinical observers was 0.92. conclusion: this wearable sensor-and relative orientation-based algorithm yields very high agreement with clinical observation for the detection and evaluation of >= 90 degrees turns under non-standardized conditions in pd patients and older adults. it can be suggested for the assessment of turning in daily life.
alzheimer's_disease	deficiencies of the retrograde transport mediated by the retromer complex have been described in alzheimer 's disease (ad). genetic manipulation of retromer modulates brain amyloidosis in tg2576 mice. however, whether the complex is altered during the development of the ad-like phenotype remains unknown. in this study we assayed the expression levels of the vacuolar sorting protein 35 (vps35), vps26, vps29, and its cargo proteins, cation independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, sortilin-related receptor in brains of tg2576 and controls at the ages of 3, 8, and 14 months. while cortex showed an age-dependent decrease in all but vps29, levels of the same proteins in the cerebellum were unchanged at any age. neuronal cells expressing human amyloid beta precursor protein swedish mutant had also reduced retromer complex levels. however, incubation with a pharmacological chaperone dose-dependently restored these levels together with a reduction in amyloid beta. our study is the first to show that in a transgenic mouse model of ad the changes in the expression levels of the retromer complex are age and region dependent, and that the complex is a viable therapeutic target since its deficiency can be restored pharmacologically by a retromer chaperone.

heart_disease	purpose of review the prevalence of cardiovascular disease differs among ethnic groups and along geographic boundaries. at present, most of the projected increase in mortality from cardiovascular disease occurs in sub-saharan african, chinese and southeast asian populations. ethnic disparities in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease coincide with quantitative and qualitative differences in risk factors for cardiovascular disease. high plasma cholesterol is one of the most important preventable causes of ischemic heart disease. recent findings the current review summarizes recent evidence on ethnic differences in ischemic heart disease and its correlates with genetic and acquired differences in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. the nature of ethnic differences in plasma lipid levels, apolipoprotein l1 en lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)] is outlined, and the effects of lipid-lowering therapy and future efforts and challenges regarding implementation are discussed. summary ethnic differences in hdl-cholesterol (hdl-c), triglyceride levels and lp(a) may impact ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease and result in higher residual risk during lipid-lowering therapy. further efforts should be made to stimulate the use of statins in both high-income and low-income countries and study their effects in individuals with different ethnic backgrounds.
parkinson's_disease	objective: to assess body distribution and timing of appearance of rest tremor in parkinson 's disease. methods: information was obtained by a computerized database containing historical information collected at the first visit and data collected during the subsequent follow-up visits. information on rest tremor developed during the follow-up could be therefore obtained by our own observation in a proportion of patients. results: among 289 patients, rest tremor was reported at disease onset in 65.4% of cases and detected at last follow-up examination in 74.4% of patients. analysis of patients who did not report rest tremor at disease onset indicated that 26% of such patients (9% in the overall population) manifested rest tremor over the disease course. rest tremor spread to new sites in 39% of patients who manifested rest tremor at disease onset. regardless of tremor presentation at disease onset or during the follow-up, upper limb was the most frequent tremor localization. over the follow-up, rest tremor developed faster in the upper limb than in other body sites. the risk of developing rest tremor during the follow-up was not affected by sex, side of motor symptom onset and site of tremor presentation. however, age of disease onset >63 years was associated with an increased risk of rest tremor spread. conclusions: this study provides new information about body distribution and timing of rest tremor appearance during the course of early stages of parkinson 's disease that may help clinicians in patients' counselling.

sprains_and_strains	ketoprofen is used to treat painful conditions such as arthritis, sprains and strains, gout, period (menstrual) pain, and pain after surgical operations. it eases pain and reduces inflammation. after oral administration it can have side effects especially on digestive system. that 's why it is recommended with caution. in recent years we could note an orientation towards topical administration of nsaidss and hydrogels occupy one of the first places through the forms that were developed for topical use. five different experimental formulations coded g1 to g5 containing 1% carbomer 940 as gel forming agent were prepared in order to evaluate influence of both composition and preparation methodology on ketoprofen (ktp) diffusion kinetics. release of ktp from the various gel formulations was studied using a modified franz diffusion cell fitted with a standard cellophane membrane. the release profiles for all the experimental formulations as well for one commercial product (fastum (r) gel) were compared in terms of diffusion coefficients (d). the hydrogel formulated with isopropyl alcohol, presented the slowest release of ktp, whereas the gels using ethanol and propylene glycol respectively were similar, yielding about 60% of the incorporated substance after 5 hours. moreover, for the preparation of the ktp gels we recommend prior dissolution of the drug in the amount of the alcohol from the formulation. the release profile of the commercial formulation is intermediate between those of the experimental hydrogels. to establish the drug release mechanism from the tested hydrogels, several kinetic models were investigated: zero order, first order, higuchi and korsmeyer-peppas models. for the tested hydrogel, the release mechanism is as follows: (i) fickian diffusional model for the commercial product; (ii) zero order for the hydrogels gi-g4 (the release mechanism is represented by a time-independent case-ii, relaxational transport); (iii) a complex mechanism for hydrogel g5, super case-ii transport, where the diffusion is associated with hydrogel network swelling and destructuration, most probably due to its sensitivity by mechanical action during preparation. the results obtained confirmed that the ktp in vitro release kinetics, is influenced both by the type of alcohol from the gel basis and the preparation methodology, these variables being able to modify the bioactive compound release mechanism.
overactive_bladder	introduction: sacral neuromodulation (snm) remains one of the few effective treatments for refractory bladder and bowel dysfunction. however, snm is associated with frequent need for surgical intervention, in many cases because of a failed battery. a rechargeable snm system, with a manufacturer-reported battery life of 15years or more, has entered post-market clinical testing in europe but has not yet been approved for clinical testing in the united states.areas covered: we review existing neuromodulation technologies for the treatment of lower urinary tract and bowel dysfunction and explore the limitations of available technology. in addition, we discuss implantation technique and device specifications and programming of the rechargeable snm system in detail. lastly, we present existing evidence for the use of snm in bladder and bowel dysfunction and evaluate the anticipated trajectory of neuromodulation technologies over the next five years.expert commentary: a rechargeable system for snm is a welcome technological advance. however surgical revision not related to battery changes is not uncommon. therefore, while a rechargeable system would be expected to reduce costs, it will not eliminate the ongoing maintenance associated with neuromodulation. no matter the apparent benefits, all new technologies require extensive post-market monitoring to ensure safety and efficacy.
sprains_and_strains	the electrical stimulation of acupoint (esa) releases several endogenous neuropeptides, which play important roles in management of pain and inflammation. esa with low and high frequencies has been shown to release different neuropepides, suggesting its various therapeutic effects. pain and edema are major problems for ankle sprain. however, there have been few reports on the effects of esa for ankle sprain. we aimed to investigate that esa can reduce pain and edema resulting from ankle sprain, and whether there is a difference in therapeutic effects between low and high frequency esa. to induce ankle sprain in sprague-dawley rats, the ankle of right hindpaw was overextended in direction of simultaneous inversion and plantar flexion. stepping force and edema in the paw of the sprained ankle were measured by electronic balance and plethysmometer, respectively. in both 2 and 100 hz esa groups, stepping force was increased significantly in similar degrees (p < 0.05). only 2 hz esa produced the significant rapid decrease in ankle edema. this study demonstrates that esa of 2 hz and 100 hz shows comparable analgesic effects, but only 2 hz esa can facilitate the reduction of edema caused by ankle sprain.
skin_care	objective: against medical advice, head and neck cancer (hnc) patients have been shown to continue to smoke and misuse alcohol post-diagnosis and treatment. this study aimed to better understand the barriers to and facilitators of health behavior change (hbc) in hnc patients. method: we conducted nine focus groups following a standard protocol. eligible patients were diagnosed less than three years previously with a primary hnc and selected using maximum variability sampling (gender, age, cancer stage, smoking, and alcohol misuse). thematic analysis was conducted using nvivo 10 software. results: participants were mostly men (79%), 65 years of age (sd = 10.1), and married/common-law (52%, n = 15). mean time from diagnosis was 19 months (sd = 12.3, range = 5.0-44.5), and most had advanced cancer (65.5%, n = 19). participants provided a larger than anticipated definition of health behaviors, encompassing both traditional (smoking, drinking, diet, exercise, uv protection) and hnc-related (e.g., dental hygiene, skin care, speech exercises, using a peg, gaining weight). the main emerging theme was patient engagement, that is, being proactive in rehabilitation, informed by the medical team, optimistic, flexible, and seeking support when needed. patients were primarily motivated to stay proactive and engage in positive health behaviors in order to return to normal life and reclaim function, rather than to prevent a cancer recurrence. barriers to patient engagement included emotional aspects (e.g., anxiety, depression, trauma, demoralization), symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain), lack of information about hbc, and healthcare providers' authoritarian approach in counseling on hbc. we found some commonalities in barriers and facilitators according to behavior type (i.e., smoking/drinking/uv protection vs. diet/exercise). significance of results: this study underlines the key challenges in addressing health behaviors in head and neck oncology, including treatment-related functional impairments, symptom burden, and the disease 's emotional toll. this delicate context requires health promotion strategies involving close rehabilitative support from a multidisciplinary team attentive to the many struggles of patients both during treatments and in the longer-term recovery period. health promotion in hnc should be integrated into routine clinical care and target both traditional and hnc-related behaviors, emphasizing emotional and functional rehabilitation as key components.
sprains_and_strains	background to characterize work-related injuries and illnesses in minors. methods we analyzed washington state workers' compensation claims from 1988 through 1991. results there were 17,800 claims among adolescents from age 11 through 17 years accepted in the 4-year period, including three occupational fatalities, 22 amputations, and 464 fractures; 89% of all injuries occurred among the 16- and 17-year-olds. claims were most frequent in restaurants, food stores, service industry, other retail and wholesale trade, and agriculture. washington state census data were used for the denominator in calculating injury rates for adolescents and adults. the crude injury rate for 16- and 17-year-olds employed at the time of the census was similar to that seen among adults (9.0 vs. 10.4 per 100 workers), despite that minors work fewer hours per year. the rate among boys was almost twice that seen among girls (11.7 vs. 6.4 per 100 workers). highest rates, per 100 workers, were in public administration (27.0), construction (21.1), agriculture (11.4), and restaurants (11.0). using census data for those working anytime over the course of the year and adjusted for the number of hours worked, the injury rate for 16- and 17-year-olds was 19.4/100 full-time equivalents compared with 10.6 of 100 full-time equivalents for adults. most injuries were lacerations, sprains and strains, contusions, and burns. conclusions public health policy and injury prevention strategies for working adolescents should be developed and implemented.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	introduction: dietary fiber is an important component of human diet. since each fiber type has specific metabolic and gastrointestinal function effects, in each specific pathology we will have to choose the optimum type of fiber, considering its chemical, physical and physiological properties. objective: to put partially hydrolyzed guar gum in its place in the complex framework of dietary fiber, to review its physicochemical properties and possible mechanisms of action; as well as its potential usefulness in different clinical situations in adult patients. methods: non-systematic review in medline. results: partially hydrolyzed guar gum (phgg) is obtained from a partial enzymatic hydrolysis of guar gum by the enzyme p-endo-mannanase. it is a soluble, highly fermentable fiber with low viscosity. the fermentation of ggph in colon produces short chain fatty acids, implicated in the main pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for their clinical effects. its use in enteral nutrition associated diarrhea is supported by several studies and by the recommendations of scientific societies such as the european society for clinical nutrition and metabolism and the american society for parenteral and enteral nutrition. the usefulness of ggph has been studied in many other clinical situations, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, bacterial overgrowth, etc. with promising results. conclusions: ggph is useful in the management of enteral nutrition associated diarrhea. in other clinical situations, more quality studies would be necessary in order to make concrete recommendations.
multiple_sclerosis	alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the surface molecule cd52, resulting in a rapid depletion of innate and adaptive immune cells. infection rates in multiple sclerosis (ms) treatment trials were higher in alemtuzumab than in interferon beta-treated patients. we report two ms patients who developed cytomegalovirus disease within 1month after the first 5-day cycle of alemtuzumab. upon identification and appropriate treatment of the infection, each recovered completely. neurologists should be aware of this serious but treatable complication.
emergency_contraception	objective: to determine if differences exist in the pharmacokinetics (pk) of levonorgestrel-based emergency contraception (lng-ec) in obese and normal body mass index (bmi) users and test whether doubling the dose of lng-ec in obese women increases total and free (active) lng serum concentrations. study design: healthy, reproductive-age women with obese and normal bmis received 1.5 mg lng orally (ecx1) and then in a subsequent menstrual cycle, the obese group also received 3 mg lng (ecx2). dosing occurred during the follicular phase. total and free lng pk parameters were obtained via serum samples through an indwelling catheter at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 h. the primary outcome was the difference in total and free lng concentration maximum (cmax) between ecx1 and ecx2 in the obese group. results: a total of 10 women enrolled and completed the study (normal bmi=5, median 22.8 kg/m(2), range 20.8-23.7; obese bmi=5, 39.5 kg/m(2), range 35.9-46.7). the total lng cmax for obese subjects following ecx1 (5.57 +/- 2.48 ng/ml) was significantly lower than the level observed in normal bmi women (10.30 +/- 2.47, p=.027). notably, ecx2 increased the cmax significantly (10.52 +/- 2.76, p=.002); approximating the level in normal bmi subjects receiving ecx1. free lng cmax followed a similar pattern. conclusion: obesity adversely impacts both the total and free cmax levels of lng ec and this likely explains its lack of efficacy in obese women. doubling the dose appears to correct the obesity-related pk changes but additional research is needed to determine if this also improves ec effectiveness in obese women. implications: this study demonstrates that obesity interferes with the pharmacokinetics of lng ec, and that doubling the dose may be an effective strategy to improve its efficacy in obese women.

alzheimer's_disease	after intense scientific exploration and more than a decade of failed trials, alzheimer 's disease (ad) remains a fatal global epidemic. a traditional research and drug development paradigm continues to target heterogeneous late-stage clinically phenotyped patients with single 'magic bullet' drugs. here, we propose that it is time for a paradigm shift towards the implementation of precision medicine (pm) for enhanced risk screening, detection, treatment, and prevention of ad. the overarching structure of how pm for ad can be achieved will be provided through the convergence of breakthrough technological advances, including big data science, systems biology, genomic sequencing, blood-based biomarkers, integrated disease modeling and p4 medicine. it is hypothesized that deconstructing ad into multiple genetic and biological subsets existing within this heterogeneous target population will provide an effective pm strategy for treating individual patients with the specific agent(s) that are likely to work best based on the specific individual biological make-up. the alzheimer 's precision medicine initiative (apmi) is an international collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted towards the implementation of pm in neurology, psychiatry and neuroscience. it is hypothesized that successful realization of pm in ad and other neurodegenerative diseases will result in breakthrough therapies, such as in oncology, with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses, particularly through biomarker-guided early preclinical disease-stage clinical trials.
parenting	we examined the longitudinal effects of the family check-up (fcu) intervention beginning in toddlerhood on children 's peer preference at school-age. specifically, a sequential mediational model was proposed in which the fcu was hypothesized to promote peer preference (i.e., higher acceptance and lower rejection by peers) in middle childhood through its positive effects on parent-child interaction and child effortful control in early childhood. participants were 731 low-income families (49 % female). qualities of parent-child interaction were observed during structured activities at 2 to 5 years, child effortful control was assessed using behavioral tasks at 5 years, and peer acceptance and rejection were rated by teachers at 7.5 to 10.5 years. results indicated that the fcu indirectly predicted peer preference by sequentially improving parent-child interaction and child effortful control. the findings are discussed with respect to implications for understanding mechanisms by which early parenting-focused programs may enhance child functioning across time and context.
alzheimer's_disease	we examined the relationships between alzheimer 's disease neuropathologic change (adnc), lewy body disease (lbd), and vascular brain injury (vbi) in 2 large autopsy samples. because findings may differ between study populations, data came from u. s. alzheimer 's disease centers contributing to the national alzheimer 's coordinating center (n = 2742) and from the population-based adult changes in thought study (n = 499). regardless of study population, over 50% of participants with adnc had cooccurring lbd or vbi; the majority of whom had a clinical ad dementia diagnosis prior to death. overlap of pathologies was similar between studies, especially after standardizing to the distribution of age and dementia status in the adult changes in thought population. lbd, but not vbi, was positively associated with adnc in both studies. interestingly, cortical lbd was more common in those with intermediate adnc compared to low or high adnc, especially in the national alzheimer 's coordinating center (p < 0.001). high prevalence of co-occurring neuropathologies among older adults with dementia has implications for accurate diagnosis of dementia etiologies and development of disease-modifying strategies.

menopause	the development of premature ovarian failure and subsequent infertility are possible consequences of chemotherapy use in pre-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. among the available strategies for fertility preservation, pharmacological protection of the ovaries using luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogues (lhrha) during chemotherapy has the potential to restore ovarian function and fertility after anticancer treatments; however, the possible efficacy and clinical application of this strategy has been highly debated in the last years. following the availability of new data on this controversial topic, the panel of the italian association of medical oncology (aiom) clinical practice guideline on fertility preservation in cancer patients decided to apply the grades of recommendation, assessment, development and evaluation (grade) methodology around the relevant and current question on the clinical utility of temporary ovarian suppression with lhrha during chemotherapy as a strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility in breast cancer patients. to answer this question, preservation of ovarian function and fertility were judged as critical outcomes for the decision-making. three possible outcomes of harm were identified: lhrha- associated toxicities, potential antagonism between concurrent lhrha and chemotherapy, and lack of the prognostic impact of chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure. according to the grade evaluation conducted, the result was a strong positive recommendation in favour of using this option to preserve ovarian function and fertility in breast cancer patients. the present manuscript aims to update and summarise the evidence for the use of this strategy in light of the new data published up to january 2016, according to the grade process.

fungal_infection	organic agriculture does not rely on synthetic chemical fungicides. an alternative pest management strategy to chemical fungicides is the use of bioactive natural compounds. hordenine [4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)] is a phenethylamine alkaloid found in barley. although hordenine has various pharmacological effects, including antibiotic activity against microorganisms, no studies have been carried out to investigate the inhibitory effects of hordenine on phytopathogenic fungal infection in host plants. both grape downy mildew and strawberry anthracnose were suppressed by hordenine treatment. hordenine had no effect on mycelial growth of phytopathogenic fungi, whereas plant defense response through the jasmonate-dependent defense pathway was enhanced in hordenine-treated plants. the concern over environmental pollution has led to the introduction of new pesticides, including bioactive natural compound based pesticide. hordenine may be used in organic agriculture as an innovative elicitor of plant defense response to downy mildew and anthracnose.

diabetes	the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppar alpha) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is abundantly expressed in liver. ppara is activated by fatty acids and various other lipid species, as well as by a class of chemicals referred to as peroxisome proliferators. studies in mice have shown that ppara serves as the master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism during fasting. in addition, ppara suppresses inflammation and the acute phase response. comparatively little is known about ppara in human liver. here, an overview is provided of the role and regulation of ppara in human liver. the main outcomes are: 1) the level of ppara mrna expression in human and mouse liver is similar. 2) expression of ppara in human liver is reduced in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or infected with the hepatitis c virus. 3) ppara in human liver is able to effectively induce the expression of numerous genes involved in numerous lipid metabolic pathways, including microsomal, peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid binding and activation, fatty acid elongation and desaturation, synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides and lipid droplets, lipoprotein metabolism, gluconeogenesis, bile acid metabolism, and various other metabolic pathways and genes. 4) ppara activation in human liver causes the down-regulation of a large number of genes involved in various immunity-related pathways. 5) peroxisome proliferators do not promote tumour formation in human liver as opposed to mouse liver because of structural and functional differences between human and mouse ppara. 6) in addition to helping to correct dyslipidemia, ppara agonists may hold promise as a therapy for patients with cholestatic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and/or type 2 diabetes.

alzheimer's_disease	amyloid- (a) precursor protein (app) metabolism engages neuronal endolysosomal pathways for a processing and secretion. in alzheimer 's disease (ad), dysregulation of app leads to excess a and neuronal dysfunction; suggesting that neuronal app/a trafficking can be targeted for therapeutic gain. cathepsin b (catb) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that can lower a levels. however, whether catb-modulation of a improves learning and memory function deficits in ad is not known. to this end, progenitor neurons were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing catb and recovered cell lysates subjected to proteomic analyses. the results demonstrated lamp1 deregulation and linkages between catb and the neuronal phagosome network. hippocampal injections of adeno-associated virus expressing catb reduced a levels, increased lamp1 and improved learning and memory. the findings were associated with the emergence of c-fos + cells. the results support the idea that catb can speed a metabolism through lysosomal pathways and as such reduce ad-associated memory deficits.
hepatitis_c	background: the university of rochester (ur) specialty pharmacy hepatitis c patient management program offers a unique advantage of being integrated within the same health system as the university of rochester medical center (urmc) gastroenterology and hepatology division. objective: the primary purpose of this study was to assess treatment success through the incidence of achieving a sustained virological response (svr) in patients served by the ur specialty pharmacy versus other nonintegrated pharmacies. methods: this was a single-center retrospective cohort study in adult patients of urmc gastroenterology and hepatology prescribed hepatitis c treatment between january i, 2014, and july 15, 2015. the incidence of svr, adherence, delay in therapy initiation, early treatment discontinuation, rate of attainment of viral load measurement post therapy completion, and predictors associated with treatment outcome were assessed. results: a total of 414 patients were prescribed hepatitis c virus treatment during the study period; 137 did not initiate therapy. the rate of svr was 93% among patients at the ur specialty pharmacy and 89% at nonintegrated pharmacies (p = 0.357). adherence to therapy was 100% and 97% at the ur specialty pharmacy and nonintegrated pharmacies, respectively (p = 0.046). conclusions: the ur specialty pharmacy was associated with a 93% svr rate and significantly greater adherence compared with nonintegrated pharmacies. larger studies are needed to determine if a significant difference in svr exists between integrated and nonintegrated pharmacies. this study provides a framework for other institutions to justify developing integrated hepatitis c specialty pharmacy services and evaluate their success.
diabetes	purpose cilostazol (pletal), a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, was approved in the united states in 1999 to reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication. cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels increase from inhibition of phosphodiesterase resulting in anti-platelet, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilatory effects. diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes endothelial and platelet dysfunction leading to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. this mini-review highlights the emerging evidence suggesting benefits of using cilostazol in treating microvascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus. methods a review of literature was conducted using pubmed and embase databases focusing on cilostazol use in diabetes mellitus. results cilostazol demonstrated renoprotective effects in patients with diabetic nephropathy by reducing serum soluble adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. cilostazol 's anti-inflammatory actions predictably attenuate glomerular damage from increased leukocyte adherence. additionally, cilostazol delayed renal dysfunction secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus as albuminuria was reduced most likely resulting from inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-induced inflammatory and endothelial markers. cilostazol 's anti-inflammatory actions in addition to its vasodilatory actions relieved retinal hypoxia and decreased excessive production of retinal blood vessels suggesting benefit in diabetic retinopathy. cilostazol did not improve neuropathy symptom scores signifying that it may not be as beneficial in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy without diabetic nephropathy or diabetic retinopathy. conclusions cilostazol 's pleiotropic effects may be beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. additional, larger studies need to be conducted to assess the benefits and risks of using cilostazol as an alternative agent in treating patients with diabetic microvascular complications.
myelofibrosis	myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) are diseases of excess cell proliferation from bone marrow precursors. two classic mpns, polycythemia vera (pv) and essential thrombocytosis (et), are conditions of excess proliferation of red blood cells and platelets, respectively. although pv and et involve different cells in the myeloid lineage, their clinical presentations have shared features, consistent with overlapping mutations in growth factor signaling. the management of both diseases involves minimizing the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. both pv and et can progress to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia, portending a poor prognosis. mpns can also present as primary myelofibrosis.
sports_injuries	physical training is essential for every athlete, this is not only related to their movement of the explosive force, movement speed, but also related to their will power training. but, high physical training intensity is bound to lead to the occurrence of various sports injuries, this will not only affect the progress of the training, and even further on the physical and mental health of athletes. based on this, the article start from the problems of physical training of athletes, and base on this, put forward some feasible countermeasures, in order to provide readers with reference.
hypothyroidism	obesity and thyroid function are closely related. thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of metabolism, thermogenesis, food intake, and fat oxidation. in obese children the most frequent hormonal abnormalities are slight hyperthyrotropinaemia and moderate increases in total t3 and/or ft3 concentrations. those abnormalities are usually considered a cause of obesity, but according to recent studies, they should actually be considered an adaptation process aimed at increasing resting energy expenditure and total energy expenditure. those abnormalities do not require any treatment and normalise after substantial weight loss. the mechanisms of those changes are dependent on leptin, thyroid hormone resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction. the present paper describes the above-mentioned mechanisms based on the latest research. we also present a review of some recent original studies evaluating thyroid function in overweight and obese children, including thyroid ultrasound. a thyroid ultrasound scan in obese children frequently shows increased thyroid volume, which correlates with moderately increased tsh levels and a hypoechoic pattern typical of autoimmune thyroiditis, but without antithyroid autoantibodies. alterations of thyroid function in overweight and obese patients cause an increase in energy expenditure, which facilitates weight loss and prevents further weight gain. therefore, normalisation of tsh and ft3 after weight loss could explain difficulties in maintaining reduced weight.
heart_disease	background: platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1 (pear1), a membrane protein highly expressed in platelets and endothelial cells, plays a role in platelet contact-induced activation, sustained platelet aggregation and endothelial function. previous reports implicate pear1 rs12041331 as a variant influencing risk in patients with coronary heart disease. we investigated whether genetic variation in pear1 predicts cardiovascular outcome in a white population. methods: in 1938 participants enrolled in the flemish study on environment, genes and health outcomes (51.3% women; mean age 43.6 years), we genotyped 9 tagging snps in pear1, measured baseline cardiovascular risk factors, and recorded cardiovascular disease incidence. for snps, we contrasted cardiovascular disease incidence of minor-allele heterozygotes and homozygotes (variant) vs. major-allele homozygotes (reference) and for haplotypes carriers vs. non-carriers. in adjusted analyses, we accounted for family clusters and baseline covariables, including sex, age, body mass index, mean arterial pressure, the total-to-hdl cholesterol ratio, smoking and drinking, antihypertensive drug treatment, and history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. results: over a median follow-up of 15.3 years, 238 died and 181 experienced a major cardiovascular endpoint. the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of eight pear1 snps, including rs12566888, ranged from 0.87 to 1.07 (p >= 0.35) and from 0.78 to 1.30 (p >= 0.15), respectively. the hazard ratios of three haplotypes with frequency >= 10% ranged from 0.93 to 1.11 (p >= 0.49) for mortality and from 0.84 to 1.03 (p >= 0.29) for a cardiovascular complications. these results were not influenced by intake of antiplatelet drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or both (p-values for interaction >= 0.056). conclusions: in a white population, we could not replicate previous reports from experimental studies or obtained in patients suggesting that pear1 might be a susceptibility gene for cardiovascular complications.
hepatitis_c	peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) play a critical role in clearing hepatitis c virus (hcv). pbmc defects have been linked with hcv infection; however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. we hypothesized that pbmcs of hcv-infected patients are more susceptible to programmed cell death (pcd), and are therefore unable to clear hcv. we compared spontaneous pbmc pcd and cytokine [interleukin (il)-1, -6, -8, -10, and -12] secretion between untreated (naive) hcv+ and treated [sustained responder (sr)] patients with hcv, and hcv-healthy controls. spontaneous pbmc pcd was assessed by annexin-v fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidiumiodide staining, and cytokine levels were measured by cytometric bead array. differences between groups were analyzed through paired and nonpaired t tests and mann-whitney u test. the rate of spontaneous pcd was higher in pbmcs of naive hcv+ patients (p < 0.0001) and sr-hcv patients (p < 0.002) than in hcv-controls. significantly low levels of il-8, -6, and -10 were detected in the supernatant of cell cultures of pbmcs from naive hcv+ (p < 0.05) and sr-hcv (p < 0.05) patients relative to hcv-controls. there was no difference between the naive hcv+ and sr-hcv groups in terms of pbmc pcd rate or cytokine levels. the present findings indicate that hcv infection is associated with increased pbmc susceptibility to pcd and decreased production of il-8, -6, and -10.
hypothyroidism	subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum thyrotropin in presence of normal free thyroid hormones. lipid metabolism is influenced by thyroid hormone and many reports showed that lipids status worsen alongwith tsh level. subclinical hypothyroidismhas been also linked to other cardiovascular risk factors such as alteration in blood pressure and increased atherosclerosis. further evidences suggested that mild dysfunction of thyroid gland is associated withmetabolic syndrome and heart failure. thyrotropin level seems the best predictor of cardiovascular disease, in particular when its levels are above 10 mu/l. however, despite these observations, there is no clear evidence that levothyroxine therapy in subjects with milder form of subclinical hypothyroidism could improve lipid status and the other cardiovascular risk factors. in this review, we address the effect of thyroid hormone and cardiovascular risk, with a focus on lipid metabolism.

skin_care	objective the oral cavity represents an initial entry way for oral and gut indigenous colonization. skin-to-skin (sts) care, in which the mother holds the diaper clad naked preterm (pt) infant between her breasts, is associated with improved digestive function, decreased stress, and improved survival. this study evaluated the development of oral microbial colonization repertoires and health characteristics in pt infants with or without sts exposure. methods saliva from 42 pt infants (<32 weeks of gestation at birth) was collected prospectively at 1 month and/or at discharge. high-throughput 16s rrna sequencing identified microbial diversity and prevalence of bacterial signatures correlated with clinical sts or non-sts care. results corrected for gestational age (cga) at sampling, bacterial taxa demonstrated increased streptococcus as a signature of oral repertoire maturation. sts was associated with increased streptococcus (p < 0.024), while non-sts was associated with greater corynebacterium (p < 0.023) and pseudomonas (p < 0.019) in infants32 weeks cga, neisseria and acinetobacter were more prevalent, 50 vs. 16.7% and 40 vs. 0%, respectively. sts care was associated with shorter hospitalization < 0.039). conclusion sts care during earlier gestation was associated with a distinct microbial pattern and an accelerated pace of oral microbial repertoire maturity.
allergies	backgroundfarm exposure protects against development of allergies early in life. at 4.5 years, protection against asthma by farm-milk exposure was partially mediated by regulatory t cells (tregs). the aim of this study was to investigate the critical time window of the asthma-protective' farm effect via tregs during childhood immune maturation. methodstregs were assessed longitudinally at 4.5 and 6 years in 111 children (56 farm and 55 reference children) from the pasture/efraim birth cohort (flow cytometry). peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured unstimulated (u), with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (pi) or lipopolysaccharide (lps), and stained for tregs (cd4(+)cd25(high)foxp3(upper20%)). mrna expression of treg/th1/th2/th17-associated cell markers was measured ex vivo. suppressive capacity of tregs on effector cells and cytokines was assessed. detailed questionnaires assessing farm exposures and clinical phenotypes from birth until age 6 years were answered by the parents. resultstreg percentage before and after stimulation and foxp3mrna expression ex vivo decreased from age 4.5 to 6 years (p(u,lps) < 0.001; p(pi) = 0.051; p(foxp3) < 0.001). high vs low farm-milk and animal-stable exposure was associated with decreased lps-stimulated treg percentage at age 6 years (p(lps) = 0.045). elevated lps-stimulated-treg percentage at age 6 was associated with increased risk of asthma (aor = 11.29, ci: 0.96-132.28, p = 0.053). tregs from asthmatics vs nonasthmatics suppressed ifn- (p = 0.015) and il-9 (p = 0.023) less efficiently. mrna expression of th1/th2/th17-associated cell markers decreased between 4.5 and 6 years (p < 0.001). conclusionstregs at the age of 6 years were decreased with farm exposure and increased within asthmatics, opposite to age 4.5 years. this immunological switch defines a critical time window' for treg-mediated asthma protection via environmental exposure before age 6 years.
diabetes	activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (ppar delta) induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes that metabolize fatty acids and carbohydrate. attempts to identify cellular activators of ppar delta produced large lists of various fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives; however, there is no consensus on specific and selective binding interactions of natural ligands with ppar delta. most models on binding interactions within the ligand binding domain (lbd) of ppar delta have been derived from analyses of ppar delta-lbd crystals formed with synthetic low molecular weight ligands. nonetheless, crystals of the whole receptor with natural ligands or of its heterodimer with its cognate retinoid x receptor (rxr) are not yet available for analysis. we have found that 4-hydroxyalkenals, non-enzymatic peroxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa), namely, 4-hydroxy-2e,6z-dodecadienal (4-hdde) and 4-hydroxy-2e-nonenal (4-hne), activate ppar delta in vascular endothelial cells and insulin-secreting beta cells, respectively. in both cases activated ppar delta induced adaptive responses that allowed the cells to adjust to ambient stressful metabolic conditions. this review article addresses the interactions of 4-hydroxyalkenals with ppar delta and the resulting hormetic interactions in cells exposed to nutrient overload conditions.

weight_loss	aim to prospectively evaluate the postoperative morbimortality and weight loss evolution of patients who underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (lsg) as a primary bariatric procedure during 5 years of follow-up. methods since 2006, data from patients undergoing a highly restrictive primary lsg have been prospectively registered in a database and analysed. preoperative co-morbid conditions, operating time, hospital stay, early and late complications rate and evolution of weight loss after 5 years of follow-up were analysed. results a total of 156 patients were included, 74.3% of whom were women. the mean age was 43.2 +/- 13.1 years and the mean body mass index (bmi) was 41.5 +/- 7.9 kg/m(2). seventy patients (44.8%) presented a bmi under 40 kg/m(2). the mortality rate was 0%. the leakage rate was 1.2%, and the total 30-d morbidity rate was 5.1% (8/156). with a mean follow-up of 32.7 +/- 28.5 (range 6-112) mo, the mean percent of excess of weight loss (% ewl) was 82.0 +/- 18.8 at 1 year, 76.7 +/- 21.3 at 3 years and 60.3 +/- 28.9 at 5 years. the mean percent of excess of bmi loss (% ebmil) was 94.9 +/- 22.4 at 1 year, 89.4 +/- 27.4 at 3 years and 74.8 +/- 29.4 at 5 years. patients with preoperative bmi less than 40 kg/m(2) achieved greater weight loss than did the overall study population. diabetes remitted in 75% of the patients and hta improved in 71.7%. cpap masks were withdrawn in all patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. conclusion lsg built with a narrow 34 f bougie and starting 3 cm from the pylorus proved to be safe and highly effective in terms of weight loss as a stand-alone procedure, particularly in patients with a preoperative bmi lower than 40 kg/m(2). key words: sleeve gastrectomy; morbid obesity; bariatric surgery; obesity surgery; laparoscopy; long-term results; 5-year results (c) the author(s) 2017. published by baishideng publishing group inc. all rights reserved.
cancer	delanzomib (cep-18770), a reversible p2 threonine boronic acid proteasome (5/1 subunits) inhibitor that showed promising anti-myeloma effects in preclinical studies, was investigated in a single-agent multicenter phase i/ii study in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. sixty-one patients (17 during dose escalation; 44 in the expansion cohort) received delanzomib on days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-d cycles; 47 received the maximum tolerated dose (mtd), 2.1mg/m(2). dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) at 2.4mg/m(2) were rash and thrombocytopenia. at the mtd, the most prominent adverse events were nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, and pyrexia; grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 53 and 23% of patients, respectively. peripheral neuropathy (21%) was limited to grades 1/2. at the mtd, 26 patients (55%) had stable disease and four (9%) had a partial response (pr). median time to progression (ttp) was 2.5 months across the cohort. based upon the efficacy results, development of delanzomib for myeloma was discontinued.
birth_control	objectives: prior studies suggest that the composition of the vaginal microbiome may positively or negatively affect susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (stis) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). some female hormonal contraceptive methods also appear to positively or negatively influence sti transmission and bv. therefore, changes in the vaginal microbiome that are associated with different contraceptive methods may explain, in part, effects on sti transmission and bv. study design: we performed a retrospective study of 16s rrna gene survey data of vaginal samples from a subset of participants from the human vaginal microbiome project at virginia commonwealth university. the subset included 682 women who reported using a single form of birth control that was condoms, combined oral contraceptives (cocs), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (dmpa) or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (lng-ius). results: women using cocs [adjusted odds ratio (aor) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.13-0.64] and dmpa (aor 0.34, 95% ci 0.13-0.89), but not lng-ius (aor 1.55, 95% ci 0.72-3.35), were less likely to be colonized by bv-associated bacteria relative to women who used condoms. women using cocs (aor 1.94, 95% ci 1.25-3.02) were more likely to be colonized by beneficial h2o2-producing lactobacillus species compared with women using condoms, while women using dmpa (aor 1.09, 95% ci 0.63-1.86) and lng-ius (aor 0.74, 95% ci 0.48-1.15) were not. conclusions: use of cocs is significantly associated with increased vaginal colonization by healthy lactobacilli and reduced bv-associated taxa.
weight_loss	background: primary spinal osseous tumors are rare, yet they represent a difficult treatment paradigm because of the complexities of tumor resection and significant resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. the geographic distribution of primary spinal osseous tumors throughout the world appears to be quite variable, with a very low incidence reported in asian countries. methods: data on 1209 cases of primary spinal osseous malignant and benign tumor cases diagnosed during the 20-year period of 1995 through 2015 in eastern china were analyzed. results: in 780 cases (64.5%), the lesion was benign and in 429 (35.5%) was malignant. the commonest primary malignant tumors were chordoma (9.8% of all cases) followed by plasma cell myeloma (8.5% of all cases). the most common benign tumor was hemangioma (28.1% of all cases) followed by giant cell tumor of bone (15.7% of all cases) and osteoblastoma (4.4% of all cases). the benign tumors affected men in 33.8% of cases and women in 30.7% of cases, the malignant tumors affected men in 23.7% of cases and women in 11.8%. the mean age (mean +/- sd) in the benign group was 34.7 +/- 19.8 years and in the malignant group was 47.4 +/- 16.5 years. related symptoms were pain (54.4%), radiculopathy (12.9%), cord compression (9.2%), mass (5.7%), pathological fracture (4.7%), deformity (2.1%), and weight loss (1.9%). the anatomical locations included almost every vertebra of the spine. the thoracic spine (38.1%) was the most common location of the tumors, followed by the cervical spine (27.4%) and lumbar spine (18.4%). conclusions: compared with other similar series reported in the literature from the other countries, our results obtained in a developing country were different in some degree. this large series of primary spinal osseous tumors may reflect fairly well their real incidence and provide a sufficiently detailed perspective on epidemiologic studies of primary spinal osseous tumors in eastern china.
alzheimer's_disease	excessive a beta deposition in the brain is associated with the formation of senile plaques, and their diffuse distribution is related to alzheimer 's disease. thirty rats (eg) were irradiated with light-emitting diode (photobiomodulation (pbm)) in the frontal region of the skull after being inoculated with the a beta toxin in the hippocampus; 30 rats were used as the control group (cg). the analysis was conducted at 7, 14, and 21 days after irradiation. we observed a decreased in a beta deposits in treated animals compared with animals in the cg. the behavioral and motor assessment revealed that the eg group covered a larger ground distance and explored the open field than the cg group on days 14 and 21 (p < 0.05). the eg group was statistically significant in the spatial memory test compared to the cg group on day 14. the use of pbm significantly reduced the presence of a beta plaques and improved spatial memory and behavioral and motor skills in treated animals on day 21.
cancer	objective: the objective of this study was to determine the clinical impact of time to antibiotic administration in adult inpatients who have hematologic malignancies and develop febrile neutropenia. methods: a retrospective chart review was conducted to screen for all febrile neutropenia events amongst adult hematologic malignancy patients between 1 january 2010 and 1 september 2014. all included patients were admitted to the hospital at the time of fever onset, having been admitted for a diagnosis other than febrile neutropenia. descriptive statistics and logistic generalized estimated equations were used to analyze the data. results: two hundred forty-four neutropenic fever events met inclusion criteria. thirty-five events (14.34%) led to negative clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit transfer, or vasopressor requirement), with an inhouse mortality rate of 7.4%. the time to antibiotics ranged from 10 min to 1495 min. the median time to antibiotics in the events that led to negative outcomes was 120 min compared to 102 min in the events that did not lead to the negative outcome (p = 0.93). conditional order sets were used to order empiric antibiotics in 176 events (72.1%) and significantly reduced time to antibiotics from 287 min to 143 min (p = 0.0019). conclusion: prolonged time to antibiotic administration in hematologic malignancy patients who develop neutropenic fever was not shown to be associated with negative clinical outcomes.
multiple_sclerosis	background: information processing speed (ips) is a prevalent cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (ms). objectives: this review aims to summarize the methods applied to assess ips in ms and its theoretical conceptualization. a pubmed search was performed to select articles published between 1 january 2004 and 31 december 2013, resulting in 157 articles included. results: the majority (54%) of studies assessed ips with heterogeneous samples (several disease courses). studies often report controlling for presence of other neurological disorders (60.5%), age (58.6%), education (51.6%), alcohol history (47.8%), or use of steroids (39.5%). potential confounding variables, such as recent relapses (50.3%), history of developmental disorders (19.1%), and visual problems (29.9%), were often neglected. assessments used to study ips were heterogeneous (ranging from simple to complex tasks) among the studies under review, with 62 different tasks used. only 9.6% of articles defined the construct of ips and 22.3% discussed ips in relation to a theoretical model. future directions: the challenges for the upcoming decade include clarification of the definition of ips as well as its theoretical conceptualization and a consensus on assessment. based on the results obtained, we propose a new theoretical model, the tri-factor model of ips.
fungal_infection	esophagitis dissecans superficialis (eds) is a rare desquamative disorder of the esophagus. it is characterized by sheets of sloughed squamous tissue with normal underlying mucosa. we present a case of a 68-year-old man with severe anemia and a positive fecal occult blood test who was found to have features suggestive of eds during endoscopy. however, histological features were suggestive of both eds and fungal esophagitis. to our knowledge, this is the first reported case in literature which discusses the clinical scenario of fungal infection being a possible etiology rather than a commonly accepted differential diagnosis of eds. we also review the clinical features, diagnostic criteria and treatment of eds.
allergies	oral food challenges have a crucial role in the complex process in diagnosing food allergy. especially in case of an unclear medical history, food challenges help to validate the clinical relevance of a sensitization to food allergens or to re-evaluate the diagnosis. in particular in infants and young children, a precise diagnosis of a suspected food allergy is of major importance, in order to avoid unneeded, restrictive elimination diets or to prescribe an appropriate dietary supplementation. double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (dbpcfc) are considered the gold standard procedure. this article provides hands-on procedures for the conduction of oral food challenges in the pediatric population, with focus on the most common ige-mediated food allergies in this patient group.
parenting	parents play a crucial role in the development of their children 's relationships with their siblings. despite this, relatively few evidence-based parenting programs exist that specifically offer parents the strategies and techniques they desire and require for managing their children 's sibling relationships. one way of bridging this gap is to design a tailored parenting intervention for sibling relationships that incorporates the parent voice in various aspects of program design. the current study recruited a convenience sample of 409 australian parents to complete an online survey relating to their views on difficult sibling behaviors and what, if any, help they desire in dealing with the issue. the majority of respondents were caucasian, middle-to upper-class mothers. respondents predominantly attributed the causes of sibling conflict to their child 's internal traits, but expressed strong desire for assistance with managing behavioral problems, especially when sibling relationships were marked by physical aggression. respondents reported high levels of acceptability for positive, rather than punitive, parenting strategies and showed a clear preference for parenting interventions delivered in easy-to-access formats. the findings are interpreted in the context of guiding the development of a tailored parenting intervention for enhancing sibling relationships and reducing conflict.
headache	background: anxiety and mood disorders have been shown to be the most relevant psychiatric comorbidities associated with migraine, influencing its clinical course, treatment response, and clinical outcomes. limited information is available on how specific anxiety and depression symptoms are related to migraine. symptoms-based approach, a current trend in mental health research, may improve our understanding in migraine comorbidity. the purpose of this study was to analyze how anxiety and depression aspects are related to migraine through a symptom-based approach. methods: we studied 782 patients from the general population who completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing demographics, headache features, anxiety and depression symptoms. a binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the association between all four ratings in gad-7 (anxiety) and phq-9 (depression) scales subitems as covariates, and migraine vs no headache as the outcome. results: the leading odd ratios (or) observed in individuals with migraine relative to those without migraine were anxiety related, ""not being able to stop or control worrying"" on a daily basis [or (ci 95%)] 49.2 (13.6-178.2), ""trouble relaxing"" 25.7 (7.1-92.6), ""feeling nervous, anxious or on edge"" on a daily basis 25.4 (6.9-93.8), and ""worrying too much about different things"" 24.4 (7.7-77.6). although the hallmark symptoms of depression are emotional (hopelessness and sadness), the highest scores found were physical: apetite, fatigue, and poor sleep. irritability had a significant increase in migraine risk [or 3.8 (1.9-7.8) if experienced some days, 7.5 (2.7-20.7) more than half the days, and 22.0 (5.7-84.9) when experienced nearly every day]. conclusions: anxiety was more robustly associated with increase in migraine risk than depression. lack of ability to properly control worrying and to relax are the most prominent issues in migraine psychiatric comorbidity. physical symptoms in depression are more linked to migraine than emotional symptoms. a symptom-based approach helps clarifying migraine comorbidity and should be replicated in other studies.
menopause	beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (hmb) is commonly supplemented to maintain muscle in elderly and clinical populations and has potential as a nootropic. previously, we have shown that in both male and female rats, long-term hmb supplementation prevents age-related dendritic shrinkage within the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) and improves cognitive flexibility and working memory performance that are both age- and sex-specific. in this study, we further explore the cognitive effects by assessing visuospatial learning and memory with the morris water maze. female rats were ovariectomized at 11 months of age to model human menopause. at 12 months of age, male and female rats received relatively short- or long-term (1- or 7-month) dietary hmb (450 mg/kg/dose) supplementation twice a day prior to testing. spatial reference learning and memory was assessed across four days in the water maze with four trials daily and a probe trial on the last day. consistent with previous work, there were age-related deficits in water maze performance in both sexes. however, these deficits were ameliorated in hmb-treated males during training and in both sexes during probe trial performance. thus, hmb supplementation prevented the age-related decrement in water maze performance, especially in male rats.

weight_loss	backgroundpolycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is the most common endocrine disease in reproductive age women. the present study aimed to determine the effects of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash) diet on reproductive hormones, plasma total antioxidant status and anthropometric indices in overweight and obese pcos women. methodsin this randomised controlled clinical trial, 60 women with pcos were randomly assigned to one of two diets with energy restriction: the dash diet and a control diet. the dash and control diets consisted of 50-55% carbohydrate, 15-20% protein and 25-30% total fat. the dash diet was designed to be rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products, as well as low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains and sweets. in the present study, the anthropometric indices, body composition, total testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding globulin (shbg), free androgen index and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryylhydrazyl (dpph) scavenging activity were measured before and after 3 months. resultsthe consumption of dash diet compared to the control diet was associated with a significant reduction in weight [-5.78 (1.91) kg versus -4.34 (2.87) kg, p = 0.032], body mass index (bmi) [-2.29 (0.15) kg m(-2) versus -1.69 (0.20) kg m(-2), p = 0.02], fat mass [-3.23(1.66) kg versus -2.13 (1.26) kg, p = 0.008] and serum androstenedione [-1.75 (1.39) ng ml(-1) versus -1.02 (0.72) ng ml(-1), p-value = 0.019]. increased concentrations of shbg [28.80 (21.71) versus 11.66(18.82) nmol l-1, p = 0.003) and dpph scavenging activity [30.23% (19.09) versus 12.97% (25.12) were also found in the dash group. conclusionsthe dash diet could improve weight loss, bmi and fat mass. furthermore, it could result in a significant reduction in serum androstenedione and a significant increase in antioxidant status and shbg.
senior_health	the effect of a health education course guided by peers aged 55 and over was evaluated. the aim of the course was to empower older adults to participate in society and to promote their wellbeing. evaluation included determining the effect on attitude toward aging, self-efficacy, perception of the societal opinion regarding the place of the elderly in society (social influence), social participation, perceived social support, and wellbeing of the participants aged 55 to 79 years. a quasi-experimental approach was used. the effect on the experimental group of course participants was studied compared to a control group of older adults on the waiting list. the respondents filled out postal questionnaires at three time points (before starting the course (t(0)), immediately after termination (t(1)) and three months later (t(2))). using a multivariate analysis procedure, a significant interaction effect between time of measurement and group membership was found with respect to the outcome of social influence. at t(1) an effect was absent, but at t(2), the current idea that elderly occupy a marginal position in society. found less favour with the experimental group than the control group. moreover perceived social support and subjective health improved significantly at t(1) and t(2) among the course members, when compared to the control group. no effect was found on attitude, self-efficacy, social participation and wellbeing in the short time span of a three months follow-up.

hypothyroidism	introduction: the liver plays a central role in thyroid hormone metabolism, transport, and clearance. a normal function of both the thyroid gland and the liver is therefore necessary to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels and action. data regarding thyroid function in patients with liver cirrhosis are scarce and variable. the most consistent finding is a decreased free triiodothyronine (ft3) level, which correlates with the severity of liver disease and has been proposed as a prognostic factor for liver-related complications. aim of the study: to evaluate thyroid hormone values in patients with stable liver cirrhosis and to compare them with healthy controls without liver disease. we also assessed the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity and whether liver function tests correlated with thyroid function. material and methods: we performed a prospective case-control study in an endocrinological setting. twenty-nine patients with stable cirrhosis (20 males and 9 females, mean age 60.97 +/- 7.17 years) were included in the case group and 50 healthy subjects (22 males and 28 females, mean age 61.70 +/- 13.00 years) in the control group. we excluded patients with confounding factors known to influence thyroid function. levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), ft3, free thyroxine (ft4) and anti-tpo-antibodies (tpo-ab) were measured. these thyroid hormone values were compared in both groups. biochemical indices of liver function (aspartate aminotransferase [ast], alanine aminotransferase [alt], alkaline phosphatase [ap], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [ggt], inr, total bilirubin, and albumin levels) were correlated with thyroid function tests. results: ft3 en ft4 levels were significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis than in healthy subjects (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). tsh levels were not statistically significantly different in the two groups. the level of tpo-ab was not increased in patients with cirrhosis compared to healthy controls. ft3 correlated negatively with the child-pugh score. discussion: these results indicate that, compared to healthy controls, patients with cirrhosis have decreased ft3 and ft4 levels and comparable tsh levels and may be consistent with findings of limited acquired central hypothyroidism as observed in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome (ntis). ft3 levels correlated negatively with child-pugh score, a measure of severity of liver dysfunction. we did not find an increased prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in these patients.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objective: constipation is a common symptom affecting up to 30% of the western population and is strongly associated with the presence of intestinal methanogens, which may directly inhibit motor activity. two recent studies performed on adult and children affected by chronic constipation showed that the supplementation with l. reuteri significantly improved bowel movements. whether its action is related to a decreasing of methane (ch4) production has never been tested. we have therefore designed a study aimed at testing this hypothesis. patients and methods: data of 20 adults (12 females, mean age 36.2 +/- 13.7) affected by functional constipation, treated with the probiotic l. reuteri (dsm 17938) for 4 weeks who performed a h-2/ch4 lactulose breath test (lbt) in our institution showing a ch4 production higher than 5 ppm were retrospectively analyzed from march to june 2015. data recorded in their stool diary, reporting the frequency of defecations and stool consistency were also analysed, as well as the result of the lbt performed at the end of the treatment with l. reuteri. results: four weeks of l. reuteri administration was associated with a significant decrease of mean ch4 production determined by lbt (from 20.8 +/- 15 to 8.9 +/- 8.6; p < 0.0001 ci 95%) and of auc value (from 5101.5 +/- 3571.13 to 2128.4 +/- 2110.8; p < 0.0001 ci 95%). moreover, a total disappearance of ch4 production (< 5 ppm at lbt) was observed in 11 patients, while, we did not observe any significant decrease of h-2 production (from 13.2 +/- 8.8 to 11.4 +/- 7.3, ci 95%, n.s.). conclusions: this study highlights for the first time the beneficial effect of lactobacillus reuteri (dsm 17938) on chronic constipation, via a significant decrease of ch4 production.
parkinson's_disease	gut microbiota of patients with parkinson 's disease and healthy volunteers was analyzed by the method of high throughput 16s rrna sequencing of bacterial genomes. in patients with parkinson 's diseases, changes in the content of 9 genera and 15 species of microorganisms were revealed: reduced content of dorea, bacteroides, prevotella, faecalibacterium, bacteroides massiliensis, stoquefichus massiliensis, bacteroides coprocola, blautia glucerasea, dorea longicatena, bacteroides dorei, bacteroides plebeus, prevotella copri, coprococcus eutactus, and ruminococcus callidus, and increased content of christensenella, catabacter, lactobacillus, oscillospira, bifidobacterium, christensenella minuta, catabacter hongkongensis, lactobacillus mucosae, ruminococcus bromii, and papillibacter cinnamivorans. this microbiological pattern of gut microflora can trigger local inflammation followed by aggregation of alpha-synuclein and generation of lewy bodies.
overactive_bladder	the beta(3) adrenergic receptor is raising as an important drug target for the treatment of pathologies such as diabetes, obesity, depression, and cardiac diseases among others. several attempts to obtain selective and high affinity ligands have been made. currently, mirabegron is the only available drug on the market that targets this receptor approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. however, the fda (food and drug administration) in usa and the mhra (medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency) in uk have made reports of potentially life-threatening side effects associated with the administration of mirabegron, casting doubts on the continuity of this compound. therefore, it is of utmost importance to gather information for the rational design and synthesis of new beta(3) adrenergic ligands. herein, we present the first combined 2d-qsar (two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship) and 3d-qsar/comsia (three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship/comparative molecular similarity index analysis) study on a series of potent (3) adrenergic agonists of indole-alkylamine structure. we found a series of changes that can be made in the steric, hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, lipophilicity and molar refractivity properties of the compounds to generate new promising molecules. finally, based on our analysis, a summary and a regiospecific description of the requirements for improving beta(3) adrenergic activity is given.
parkinson's_disease	leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (lrrk2) is a recently discovered molecule associated with familial and sporadic parkinson 's disease. it regulates many central neuronal functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and axonal extension. however, in contrast to the well-documented function of lrrk2 in central neurons, it is unclear whether lrrk2 is expressed in enteric neurons and affects the physiology of the gut. by examining lrrk2-ko mice, this study investigated whether enteric neurons express lrrk2 and whether intestinal neuronal peptides and iga are quantitatively changed. intestinal protein lysates and sections prepared from male c57bl/6 j mice were analyzed by western blotting and immunostaining using anti-lrrk2 antibody, respectively. intestinal neuronal peptide-mrnas were quantified by real-time pcr in wild-type mice and lrrk2-ko mice. intestinal iga was quantified by elisa. lamina propria mononuclear cells (lpmcs) were analyzed by flow cytometry to evaluate the ratio of b1 to b2 b cells. western analysis and immunostaining revealed that lrrk2 is expressed in enteric neurons. the amounts of mrna for vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide y, and substance p were increased in lrrk2-ko mice accompanied by an increment of iga. however, the intestinal b cell subpopulations were not altered in lrrk2-ko mice. for the first time, we have revealed that lrrk2 is expressed in enteric neurons and related to quantitative alterations of neuronal peptide and iga. our study highlights the importance of lrrk2 in enteric neurons as well as central neurons.
sprains_and_strains	background the aim of this study was to compile nationally representative statistics describing inpatient hospital care for patients with work-related injuries and illnesses covered under workers' compensation (wc) insurance in the united states. methods three years of data (1997-1999)from the nationwide inpatient sample (nis) were used to describe wc inpatient stays with respect to patient and hospital characteristics, principal diagnoses, number and type of procedures provided, total charges, length of stay, and time from admission to administering of the principal procedure. results approximately 209,139 wc hospitalizations occurred annually, representing 0.62% of all inpatient admissions. the average total charge per wc hospitalization was $14,966. after adjusting for the type of diagnosis and other factors, wc hospital care was found to involve 13-24% more procedures, have a slightly longer (4%) length of stay, and take 23-54% less time from admission to the principal procedure than inpatient care for comparable diagnoses paid by other sources. inpatient care for disc and spinal disorders paid by wc had 16% higher charges than similar non-wc cases. three-year trends showed a steady decline in the number of wc hospitalizations between 1997 and 1999 but a sharp 16% rise in total charges per wc stay. conclusions this research provides an initial foundation for understanding the extent and nature of hospitalized care for injured workers in the us and identifying significant trends in the delivery of care.

hepatitis_c	persistent hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is associated with progressive hepatic fibrosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. the interleukin-28b (il28b) rs12979860 polymorphism is associated with fibrosis progression in chronic hcv infection. il28b encodes interferon-lambda, which has both antiviral and anti-proliferative properties. this study aimed to determine whether il28b rs12979860 polymorphism is also associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma both in chronic hcv infection and in non-viral-related cirrhosis. real-time polymerase chain reaction and melting curve analyses were used to genotype 311 patients who underwent liver transplantation for hcv cirrhosis (n = 202) or alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 109). hcv patients were older (p = 0.012) and less likely males (p < 0.001) than patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. il28b rs12979860 tt genotype [or 6.08, 95 % ci 2.11-17.53; p < 0.001] and t allele carriage (ct + tt; or 2.3, ci 95 % 1.42-3.72; p = 0.001) were more frequent among hcv patients and, among them, more common in patients infected with hcv genotype 1 (ct + tt; or 1.79, ci 95 % 1.03-3.09; p = 0.009). incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was higher in hcv cirrhosis (or 2.7, ci 95 % 1.5-4.7; p < 0.001), with no differences according to hcv genotype. il28b genotype distribution was similar among patients with or without hepatocellular carcinoma, in both hcv patients regardless viral genotype (p = 0.84) and alcoholic patients (p = 0.91). multivariate analysis showed that older age (or 1.06, ci 95 % 1.02-1.1; p = 0.003) and male gender (or 2.49, ci 95 % 1.24-5; p = 0.01) were independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in hcv patients. in summary, the current study did not find a significant association between il28b rs12979860 polymorphism and hepatocarcinogenesis.
allergies	recently, homozygous mutations in the desmoglein-1 (dsg1) gene and heterozygous mutation in the desmoplakin (dsp) gene have been demonstrated to be associated with severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (sam) syndrome (mendelian inheritance in man no. 615508). we aim to identify the molecular basis for a chinese pedigree of sam syndrome. a chinese pedigree of sam syndrome was subjected to mutation detection in the dsg1 gene. sequence analysis of the dsg1 gene and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for gene expression of dsg1 using cdna derived from the epidermis of patients and controls were both performed. skin biopsies were also taken from patients for pathological study and transmission electron microscopy observation. novel homozygous splicing mutation c.1892-1delg in the exon-intron border of the dsg1 gene has been demonstrated to be associated with sam syndrome. we report a new family of sam syndrome of asian decent and expand the spectrum of mutations in the dsg1 gene.
alzheimer's_disease	a series of novel ferulic acid-o-alkylamines derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands against alzheimer 's disease. in vitro studies displayed that all the synthesized target compounds showed impressive inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (buche), significant inhibition/disaggregation of self-induced beta-amyloid (a beta) aggregation and acted as potential antioxidants. particularly, compound 7f, one of the most potent buche inhibitor ( ic50 value of 0.021 mu m for equine serum buche, 8.63 mu m for ratbuche and 0.07 mu m for human serum buche), was found to be a good acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitor (ic50 = 2.13 mu m for electric eel ache, 1.8 mu m for ratache and 3.82 mu m for human erythrocytes ache), and the result of molecular docking provided an explanation for its selective buche inhibitory activity. compound 7f also had noteworthy inhibitory effects on selfinduced a beta(1-42) aggregation (50.8 +/- 0.82%) and was found to disaggregate self- (i)nduced a beta(1-42) aggregation (38.7 +/- 0.65%), which was further elucidated by the transmission electron microscopy. meanwhile, compound 7f showed the modest antioxidant activity (0.55 eq of trolox), good protective effect against h2o2-induced pc12 cell injury, with low toxicity. moreover, compound 7f could cross the blood-brain barrier (bbb) in vitro. significantly, compound 7f did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 1000 mg/ kg, and the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine- induced memory deficit in mice. taken together, the results indicated that compound 7f is a very promising multifunctional agent in the treatment of alzheimer 's disease, particularly the advanced stages of ad.

allergies	purposeadverse drug reactions (adrs) including medication allergies are not well-described among large national cohorts. this study described the most common documented medication allergies and their reactions among a national cohort of veterans affairs (va) inpatients. methodswe evaluated inpatient admissions in any va medical center from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2014. each admission was linked with allergy history preceding or upon admission. individual drugs were aggregated into drug class category including: penicillins, sulfonamides, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, opiates, hmg-coa reductase inhibitors (statins) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory inhibitors (nsaid). results were reported in aggregate and over time. resultsapproximately 10.8 million inpatient admissions occurred from 2000 to 2014. we found the most commonly reported allergy drug classes were penicillins (13%, n=1410080), opiates (9.1%, n=984978), ace inhibitors (5.7%, n=618075) sulfonamides (5.1%, n=558653), nsaids (5.1%, n=551216) and statins (3.6%, n=391983). several allergy histories increased over time including opiates (6.2 to 11.2%), ace inhibitors (1.3 to 10.2%), statins (0.3 to 7.3%) and nsaids (3.9 to 6.0%). rash was the most commonly documented reaction on reports for penicillins (25.5%, n=371825), sulfonamides (25.6%, n=165954) and nsaids (10.3%, n=65741). the most common reaction for opiates was nausea/vomiting (17.9%, n=211864), cough/coughing for ace inhibitors (41.0%, n=270537) and muscle pain/myalgia for statins (34.1%, n=186565). conclusionswe report that penicillins and opiates are the most commonly documented drug allergies among va inpatients, but other drug classes such as ace inhibitors, statins and nsaids are becoming increasingly common. clinicians also commonly document non-allergic adrs in the allergy section such as cough or myalgia. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
headache	calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) is a 37-amino acid peptide found primarily in the c and a delta sensory fibers arising from the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, as well as the central nervous system. calcitonin gene-related peptide was found to play important roles in cardiovascular, digestive, and sensory functions. although the vasodilatory properties of cgrp are well documented, its somatosensory function regarding modulation of neuronal sensitization and of enhanced pain has received considerable attention recently. growing evidence indicates that cgrp plays a key role in the development of peripheral sensitization and the associated enhanced pain. calcitonin gene-related peptide is implicated in the development of neurogenic inflammation and it is upregulated in conditions of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. it is most likely that cgrp facilitates nociceptive transmission and contributes to the development and maintenance of a sensitized, hyperresponsive state not only of the primary afferent sensory neurons but also of the second-order pain transmission neurons within the central nervous system, thus contributing to central sensitization as well. the maintenance of a sensitized neuronal condition is believed to be an important factor underlying migraine. recent successful clinical studies have shown that blocking the function of cgrp can alleviate migraine. however, the mechanisms through which cgrp may contribute to migraine are still not fully understood. we reviewed the role of cgrp in primary afferents, the dorsal root ganglion, and in the trigeminal system as well as its role in peripheral and central sensitization and its potential contribution to pain processing and to migraine.
overactive_bladder	the study is to investigate the effects of paeoniflorin (pa) on renal function in cyclophosphamideinduced mice. mice were injected with intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide (cyp, 200 mg/kg) or saline respectively. mice were treated with pa (15, 30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for the next 7 days. then, mice were sacrificed to analyze the biochemical, histological parameters and mechanism research. our results shown that pa significantly decreased the urine levels of uric acid and creatinine, serum and kidney levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), pa also obviously attenuated the histological changes of the kidney tissues caused by cyp. moreover, western blot demonstrated that pa increased the ampk levels and inhibited nf-kappa b signaling pathway and apoptosis in cyp-stimulated kidney tissues. in conclusion, pa might be considered as an effective agent in the amelioration of the kidney toxicity resulting from cyp treatment.

senior_health	background: karnataka state continues to have the highest rates of maternal mortality in south india at 144/100,000 live births, but lower than the national estimates of 190-220/100,000 live births. various barriers exist to timely and appropriate utilization of services during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. this study aimed to describe the patterns and determinants of routine and emergency maternal health care utilization in rural karnataka state, india. methods: this study was conducted in karnataka in 2012-2013. purposive sampling was used to convene twenty three focus groups and twelve individual interviews with community and health system representatives: auxiliary nurse midwives and staff nurses, accredited social health activists, community leaders, male decision-makers, female decision-makers, women of reproductive age, medical officers, private health care providers, senior health administrators, district health officers, and obstetricians. local researchers familiar with the setting and language conducted all focus groups and interviews, these researchers were not known to community participants. all discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated to english for analysis. a thematic analysis approach was taken utilizing an a priori thematic framework as well as inductive identification of themes. results: most women in the focus groups reported regular antenatal care attendance, for an average of four visits, and more often for high-risk pregnancies. antenatal care was typically delivered at the periphery by non-specialised providers. participants reported that sought was care women experienced danger signs of complications. postpartum care was reportedly rare, and mainly sought for the purpose of neonatal care. factors that influenced women 's care-seeking included their limited autonomy, poor access to and funding for transport for non-emergent conditions, perceived poor quality of health care facilities, and the costs of care. conclusions: rural south indian communities reported regular use of health care services during pregnancy and for delivery. uptake of maternity care services was attributed to new government programmes and increased availability of maternity services; nevertheless, some women delayed disclosure of pregnancy and first antenatal visit. community-based initiatives should be enhanced to encourage early disclosure of pregnancies and to provide the community information regarding the importance of facility-based care. health facility infrastructure in rural karnataka should also be enhanced to ensure a consistent power supply and improved cleanliness on the wards.
fungal_infection	trauma to the extremities is disproportionately represented in casualties of recent conflicts, accounting for >50% of injuries sustained during operations in iraq and afghanistan. infectious complications have been reported in >25% of those evacuated for trauma, and 50% of such patients were treated in the intensive care unit (icu). osteomyelitis has been reported in 9% (14% of intensive care unit patients), and deep-wound infection in 27% of type iii open-tibia fractures. infections complicating extremity trauma are frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria and have been demonstrated to lead to failure of limb salvage, unplanned operative take-backs, late amputations, and decreased likelihood of returning to duty. invasive fungal infections of extremities have also presented a unique challenge in combat-injured patients, particularly in those with blast injuries with massive transfusion requirements and high injury severity scores. infection prevention should begin at the time of injury and, although context-specific depending on the level of care, includes appropriate irrigation, surgical debridement, wound care and coverage, fracture fixation, and antibiotic prophylaxis, in addition to basic infection prevention measures. clinical practice guidelines to address infection prevention after combat trauma (including extremity infection) were developed in 2007 and revised in 2011, with endorsement from the surgical infection society and the infectious disease society of america. nevertheless, significant challenges remain, including austere environments of care, multiple transitions of care, and lack of coordinated efforts in prevention. treatment of established infections is optimally multidisciplinary, particularly when deep wounds, bone, and joints are involved. surgical debridement of overtly infected or necrotic tissue is necessary, with particularly aggressive margins if invasive fungal infection is suspected. infected nonunion frequently requires the use of prosthetic materials for fixation, potentiating biofilm formation, and complicating medical therapy. antibiotic therapy should be targeted at results of deep wound and bone cultures. however, this is complicated by frequent contamination of wounds, requiring differentiation between potential pathogens in terms of their virulence and decreased culture recovery in patient who have frequently received previous antibiotics. lessons learned in infection prevention and treatment of orthopaedic trauma from combat can serve to inform the care of patients injured in natural disasters and noncombat trauma.
emergency_contraception	this article first critically reviews the major philosophical positions in the literature on conscientious objection and finds that they possess significant flaws. a substantial number of these problems stem from the fact that these views fail to assess the reasons offered by medical professionals in support of their objections. this observation is used to motivate the reasonability view, one part of which states: a practitioner who lodges a conscientious refusal must publicly state his or her objection as well as the reasoned basis for the objection and have these subjected to critical evaluation before a conscientious exemption can be granted (the reason-giving requirement). it is then argued that when defenders of the other philosophical views attempt to avoid granting an accommodation to spurious objections based on discrimination, empirically mistaken beliefs, or other unjustified biases, they are implicitly committed to the reason-giving requirement. this article concludes that based on these considerations, a reason-giving position such as the reasonability view possesses a decisive advantage in this debate.
hepatitis_c	we report here the successful treatment of hepatitis c virus (hcv) transmitted from a nucleic acid testing (nat)-negative donor to three hcv-negative recipients-two renal transplants and one liver. both renal recipients underwent standard deceased-donor renal transplantation with immediate graft function. the liver recipient underwent standard orthotopic liver transplantation and recovered uneventfully. the donor was a 39-year-old woman with a terminal serum creatinine of 0.7mg/dl. she was high risk for bloodborne pathogens, based upon a history of sexual contact with an hcv-infected male partner. recipient 1 was a 45-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease from systemic lupus erythematosus. recipient 2 was a 62-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease caused by hypertension and insulin-dependent diabetes. recipient 3 was a 42-year-old man with acute liver failure from acetaminophen ingestion. all recipients became hcv polymerase chain reaction positive on post-transplant follow-up. both kidney recipients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination therapy for 12 weeks without side effects or rejection episodes. recipient 3 was treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks without side effects. all patients achieved a sustained viral response at 12 weeks and are considered cured of hcv. the kidney recipients maintained good allograft function with a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl and 1.0 mg/dl, respectively. both renal recipients maintained normal liver function post treatment and did not develop any evidence of fibrosis. the liver recipient 's liver function tests returned to normal without further incident. this case report provides evidence for the successful treatment of donor-derived hcv in transplant recipients.
allergies	cigarette smoking is associated with numerous diseases and poses a serious challenge to the current healthcare system worldwide. smoking impacts both innate and adaptive immunity and plays dual roles in regulating immunity by either exacerbation of pathogenic immune responses or attenuation of defensive immunity. adaptive immune cells affected by smoking mainly include t helper cells (th1/th2/th17), cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells, cd8+ t cells, b cells and memory t/b lymphocytes while innate immune cells impacted by smoking are mostly dcs, macrophages and nk cells. complex roles of cigarette smoke have resulted in numerous diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory and autoimmune diseases, allergies, cancers and transplant rejection etc. although previous reviews have described the effects of smoking on various diseases and regional immunity associated with specific diseases, a comprehensive and updated review is rarely seen to demonstrate impacts of smoking on general immunity and, especially on major components of immune cells. here, we aim to systematically and objectively review the influence of smoking on major components of both innate and adaptive immune cells, and summarize cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying effects of cigarette smoking on the immune system. the molecular pathways impacted by cigarette smoking involve nf kappa b, map kinases and histone modification. further investigations are warranted to understand the exact mechanisms responsible for smoking-mediated immunopathology and to answer lingering questions over why cigarette smoking is always harmful rather than beneficial even though it exerts dual effects on immune responses.
parenting	the morphological characteristics of an infant 's face are collectively referred to as baby schema or babyishness. it has been well established that infant traits are implicitly projected, or overgeneralized, to adults with babyish facial features. however, few studies to date have investigated the neural underpinnings of such over generalization. in the present study, we addressed this issue by comparing neural activations elicited by baby faced and mature-faced adult faces in men using fmri. we found increased activations in clusters surrounding the bilateral insula, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and right inferior frontal gyrus, which have been previously linked to the processing of facial attractiveness and infant-related information. we also discovered increased activation in the left medial prefrontal cortex, which might be related to emotional or empathic responses directed towards baby-faced adults. the activated region also included the left premotor cortex, which presumably reflects an embodied response or approach motivation directed toward infant-related information. furthermore, the activation level of the left caudate correlated with the salivary concentration of oxytocin. taken together, these findings indicate that passive viewing of babyish adult faces induces increased responses in neural regions linked to facial attractiveness and infant-related information processing, and that these responses are partially influenced by oxytocinergic factors.
hypothyroidism	background: in preparation for 131 i ablation, temporary withdrawal of thyroid hormone is commonly used in patients with thyroid cancer after total thyroidectomy. the current study aimed to investigate brain glucose metabolism and its relationships with mood or cognitive function in these patients using f-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (f-18-fdg-pet). method: a total of 40 consecutive adult patients with thyroid carcinoma who had undergone total thyroidectomy were recruited for this cross-sectional study. at the time of assessment, 20 patients were hypothyroid after two weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal, while 20 received thyroid hormone replacement therapy and were euthyroid. all participants underwent brain f-18-fdg-pet scans and completed mood questionnaires and cognitive tests. multivariate spatial covariance analysis and univariate voxel-wise analysis were applied for the image data. results: the hypothyroid patients were more anxious and depressed than the euthyroid participants. the multivariate covariance analysis showed increases in glucose metabolism primarily in the bilateral insula and surrounding areas and concomitant decreases in the parieto-occipital regions in the hypothyroid group. the level of thyrotropin was positively associated with the individual expression of the covariance pattern. the decreased f-18-fdg uptake in the right cuneus cluster from the univariate analysis was correlated with the increased thyrotropin level and greater depressive symptoms in the hypothyroid group. conclusions: these results suggest that temporary hypothyroidism, even for a short period, may induce impairment in glucose metabolism and related affective symptoms.
fungal_infection	pulmonary mucormycosis (pm) is a life-threatening fungal infection in patients with hematologic malignancies, and early and accurate diagnostic modalities are urgently needed. we conducted a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay targeting these fungi in peripheral blood from four patients with hematologic malignancies who were strongly suspected of having pm. in these four patients, the rhizopus species was identified in two patients, and the cunninghamella and absidia species in one each. based on these molecular findings, all of the patients were successfully treated via targeted therapy with liposomal amphotericin b. in this report, a pcr analysis proved very useful for managing pm in patients with hematologic malignancies.
alzheimer's_disease	a genome-wide association study identified gab2 rs2373115 to be associated with alzheimer 's disease (ad) risk in european population. however, inconsistent results are reported in east asian population. here, we performed an updated analysis using 65,704 samples including 20,982 ad cases and 44,722 controls. first, we investigated the gab2 rs2373115 variant in asian population using 3974 ad cases and 7568 controls. to further evaluate the effect of rs2373115 in different populations, we selected 17,008 ad cases and 37,154 controls in european population. we used three genetic models, and found no significant heterogeneity in asian population. a fixed effect model analysis showed no significant association between rs2373115 and ad in asian population. there was no significant heterogeneity in the pooled east asian and european populations. the fixed effect model analysis again showed no significant association between rs2373115 and ad in these pooled populations. taken together, these findings suggest that gab2 rs2373115 may contribute to ad susceptibility only in european population but not in east asian population.

menopause	objective: the aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of rad1901, an oral estrogen receptor ligand, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms of menopause. methods: this was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging, proof-of-concept trial. postmenopausal women with a minimum of 7 moderate-to-severe, diary-reported hot flashes per day, or 50 per week, were randomized to one of five blinded dose groups (0 [placebo], 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg rad1901 daily for 28 d). efficacy endpoints included frequency and severity of hot flashes over 4 weeks of treatment. results: one hundred participants were randomized across the five treatment regimens. the frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flashes decreased in all groups over the treatment period (mean percent change from baseline at 4 wk, -54.1%, -77.2%, -51.8%, -53.8%, and -67.0% for placebo, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg groups). the response in the 10 mg group was significantly different from placebo at 4 weeks (p = 0.024). no other dose group was significantly different from placebo. there were no statistically significant differences in severity of hot flashes between placebo and any dose group. treatment was well tolerated; most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: daily treatment with 10 mg rad1901 over 4 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flashes compared with placebo, with an acceptable safety profile. further clinical trials are warranted to investigate rad1901 's utility as a potential treatment for vasomotor symptoms.
sports_injuries	ankle injuries are a common health problem; data on ankle injury rates and time trends in the population at large are scarce. our aim was to investigate the incidence of and time trends in population-based and emergency department-treated ankle injuries related to sports activities and other activities related to daily living. data were obtained from one national survey on accidents and injuries (2000-2010) and one based on emergency department data (1986-2010). linear regression was used to determine linear trends in ankle injuries per 1000 person-years. the number of ankle injuries related to sports activities and other activities of daily living increased from 19.0 to 26.6 per 1000 person-years (p=0.002). the number of sports-related ankle injuries treated in emergency departments decreased from 4.2 to 1.5 per 1000 person-years (p<0.001), and from 3.2 to 2.1 per 1000 person-years (p<0.001) for other activities of daily living. according to our data, the incidence rates of all ankle injuries are around 5.5 times higher than those registered at emergency departments. the high incidence rates of ankle injuries highlight the need for proper ankle injury treatment and prevention.
skin_care	the genus ajuga is used traditionally as food and medicine. the aim of this study was to investigate the antidiabetic, anti-alzheimer 's diseases, skin-protective, and antioxidant activities of essential oil and extracts of ajuga chamaecistus subsp. scoparia (boiss.) rech.f., together with the identification of their chemical composition. the 1,1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazloine-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation scavenging activity, metal chelating activity, reducing power, content of total bioactive compounds, general toxicity, and enzyme inhibitory potential of essential oil, ethanol extract, and water decoction of the plant were evaluated. phenolics profile of the extracts was analyzed using the reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and the chemical composition of the essential oil was determined using the gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy techniques. the essential oil could significantly inhibit the activity of alpha-glucosidase (4.3 mmol acarbose equivalents/g), alpha-amylase (2.8 mmol acarbose equivalents/g), acetylcholinesterase (1.96 mg gallic acid equivalents/g), butyrylcholinesterase (2.2 mg gallic acid equivalents/g), and tyrosinase (36 mg kojic acid equivalents/g) while ethanol and water extracts showed moderate enzyme inhibitory activity. furthermore, essential oil had the strongest antioxidant capacity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging, 2,2-azino-bis (3ethylbenzothiazloine-6-sulfonic acid) scavenging, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and metal chelating assays. spathulenol (18.0%), thymol (15.1%), octen-3-ol (14.3%), and linalool oxide (11.2%) were identified as major constituents in the essential oil. quantitative highperformance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, and ferulic acid are the main phenolic compounds in this plant. the results suggested that ajuga chamaecistus could be useful for several applications as functional foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

myelofibrosis	monocytes are critical components of the innate immune system and they can differentiate into dendritic cells (dcs). cutaneous neoplasms of dendritic cell origin are uncommon and mostly represented by histiocytic lesions derived primarily from langerhans cells. the myeloid dc (mdc) while recognized in the immunology literature does not have a well-defined neoplastic cutaneous counterpart. eleven patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous mdc dyscrasia were evaluated. routine hematoxylin and eosin stain were performed followed by selective phenotypic studies. the patients were older without a gender predilection and exhibited an asymptomatic papular skin rash with a waxing and waning course. the biopsies demonstrated a dermal based monomorphic small mononuclear cell infiltrate. the cells expressed cd14, cd11c, hla-dr, as well as granzyme and lysozyme that defines terminally differentiated monocyte/dendritic cells. expression of bdca-3 (cd141) by the tumor cells indicated that they were myeloid dendritic cells (mdc2). each patient had a prior or subsequent diagnosis of an abnormal bone marrow biopsy that included myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. we propose the term cutaneous mdc cell dyscrasia for distinctive infiltrates of differentiated mdcs reflective of underlying myeloproliferative disease. the clinical course is variable and can be indolent although it is strongly correlated with myelodysplastic syndrome that included leukemia.

skin_care	backgroundall-trans retinol, a precursor of retinoic acid, is an effective anti-aging treatment widely used in skin care products. in comparison, topical retinoic acid is believed to provide even greater anti-aging effects; however, there is limited research directly comparing the effects of retinol and retinoic acid on skin. objectivesin this study, we compare the effects of retinol and retinoic acid on skin structure and expression of skin function-related genes and proteins. we also examine the effect of retinol treatment on skin appearance. methodsskin histology was examined by h&e staining and invivo confocal microscopy. expression levels of skin genes and proteins were analyzed using rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry. the efficacy of a retinol formulation in improving skin appearance was assessed using digital image-based wrinkle analysis. resultsfour weeks of retinoic acid and retinol treatments both increased epidermal thickness, and upregulated genes for collagen type 1 (col1a1), and collagen type 3 (col3a1) with corresponding increases in procollagen i and procollagen iii protein expression. facial image analysis showed a significant reduction in facial wrinkles following 12weeks of retinol application. conclusionsthe results of this study demonstrate that topical application of retinol significantly affects both cellular and molecular properties of the epidermis and dermis, as shown by skin biopsy and noninvasive imaging analyses. although the magnitude tends to be smaller, retinol induces similar changes in skin histology, and gene and protein expression as compared to retinoic acid application. these results were confirmed by the significant facial anti-aging effect observed in the retinol efficacy clinical study.
sports_injuries	operative treatment is usually recommended in displaced patella fractures. several techniques have been advocated for internal fixation of patella fractures. despite the relatively good clinical outcomes that have been demonstrated in many studies, postoperative morbidities such as fixation failure, nonunion, infection, and knee stiffness are not uncommon. we present a new alternative treatment technique for displaced patellar fractures. between april 1995 and may 2005, we used the nitinol patella concentrator (ntpc) to treat 156 consecutive patients with displaced patellar fractures. injuries arose from vehicular accidents in 56 (35.9%) cases, direct falls onto the knee in 85 (54.5%) cases, and sports injuries in 15 (9.6%) cases. the mean patient age was 46.3 years (range, 25-77 years). clinical assessments were made using the bostman knee score and the mos sf-36 questionnaire (medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey), which were both recorded at the final follow-up visit. the mean follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 6-17 years). at the final follow-up, the bostman knee scores were excellent in 88 cases (28-30), good in 55 (20-27), and unsatisfactory in 13 (<20). according to the mos sf-36 evaluation, the average score was 84.5 (range, 62-91). treatment of patellar fracture with the ntpc not only may serve as an effective and rigid fixation method in multifragmented displaced and inferior pole fractures, but also may provide continuous concentrative compression during the osseous healing process. thus, use of the ntpc may help restore the functional integrity of the extensor mechanism and permit early rehabilitation with a lower incidence of postoperative complications.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and characterized by motor system disorders resulting in loss of dopaminergic (da) neurons. cxc195, a novel tetramethylpyrazine derivative, has been shown strongest neuroprotective effects due to its antiapoptotic activity. however, whether cxc195 protects against da neuronal damage in pd and the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are unknown. the purpose of our study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective role of cxc195 and to elucidate its mechanism of action against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda)-induced mouse model of pd. cxc195 administration improved da neurodegeneration in pd mice induced by 6-ohda. our further findings confirmed treatment of cxc195 at the dose of 10 mg/ kg significantly inhibited the apoptosis by decreasing the level of cleaved caspase-3 and bax, and increasing the level of bcl-2 in 6-ohda-lesioned mice. meanwhile, 6-ohda also decreased the amount of phosphorylated akt while increased gsk-3 beta activity (the amount of phosphorylated gsk-3 beta at ser9 was decreased) which was prevented by cxc195. wortmannin, a specific pi3k inhibitor, dramatically abolished the changes induced by cxc195. our study firstly demonstrated that cxc195 protected against da neurodegeneration in 6-ohda-induced pd model by its anti-apoptotic properties and pi3k/ akt/ gsk3 beta signaling pathway was involved in it.
polycythemia_vera	the jak2v617f mutation that results in a hyper-activation of the jak2 kinase in the erythropoietin pathway is a molecular marker for myeloproliferative neoplasms. using allele-specific real-time pcr, we detected the mutation in the blood of 173% (17/98) of normal donors; the mutant allele burden was, however, very low (1% in polycythemia vera). it was much higher in differentiated blood cells in the peripheral blood than in undifferentiated cd34(+) cells. erythropoietin-stimulated differentiation of normal cd34+ cells in liquid culture increased the mutation frequency by 3.34-fold. when progenitors from 9 normal donors were grown in erythropoietin-stimulated semi-solid cultures, the mutation was found in 8.69% of the colonies, but only in <3% of the jak2 alleles in each positive colony, suggesting that the mutation occurred only in a few cells per colony. in mouse erythroleukemia cells carrying human jak2 dna, wild-type or jak2v617f, the frequencies of mutations from jak2 wild-type to jak2v617f and vice versa increased following erythroid differentiation. these results suggest that the mutation occurs and accumulates during differentiation. we hypothesize that genetic stability, which relies on dna repair, is efficient in normal hematopoietic stem cells but is downgraded in differentiating cells, rendering them susceptible to mutations, including jak2v617f.

cancer	in this study, we compared subjective fracture risks of hungarian women with osteoporosis to frax (r)-based estimates. patients with a previous fracture, parental hip fracture, low femoral t-score, higher age, and higher bmi were more likely to underestimate their risks. patients also failed to associate risk factors with an increased risk of fractures. purpose the main objectives were to explore associations between self-perceived 10-year fracture risks of women with osteoporosis (op) and their risks calculated by the frax (r) algorithm and to identify determinants of the underestimation of risk. methods we carried out a cross-sectional study in 11 op centers in hungary and collected data on the risk factors considered by the frax (r)-calculator. patients estimated their subjective 10-year probability of any major osteoporotic and hip fracture numerically, in percentages and also on a visual analog scale (vas). we compared subjective and frax (r) estimates and applied logistic regression to analyze the determinants of the underestimation of risk. associations between risk factors and subjective risk were explored using linear probability models. results nine hundred seventy-two op patients were included in the analysis. major op and hip fracture risk by frax (r) were on average 20.1 and 10.5%, while subjective estimates were significantly higher, 30.0 and 24.7%, respectively. correlations between frax (r) and subjective measures were very weak (r = 0.12-0.16). underestimation of major op fracture risk was associated with having had a single previous fracture (or = 2.0), parental hip fracture (or = 3.4), femoral t-score <=-2.5 (or = 4.2), higher age, body mass index, and better general health state. we did not find significant associations between subjective risk estimates and most of the risk factors except for previous fractures. conclusions hungarian op patients fail to recognize most of the risk factors of fractures. thus, education of patients about these risk factors would be beneficial especially for the elderly with a low femoral t-score and parental hip fracture history.
sports_injuries	introduction: osteotomy and internal fixation are usually the most effective way to treat the malunion of lateral tibial plateau fractures, and the accuracy of the osteotomy is still a challenge for surgeons. this is a report of a series of prospectively study of osteotomy treatment for the malunion of lateral plateau fractures with the aid of 3d printing technology. methods: a total of 7 patients with malunion of lateral tibial plateau fractures were enrolled in the study between september 2012 to september 2014 and completed follow up. ct image data were used for 3d reconstruction, and individually 3d printed models were used for accurate measurements and detail osteotomy procedures planning. under the premeditated operation plan, the osteotomy operations were performed. patients were invited for follow-up examinations at 2 and 6 weeks and then at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks until 12 months or more. results: mean age of the patients was 44 years (range 30-52 years), 3 cases were result of fall injuries, 2 were traffic accidents and 2 were sports injuries. among the cases, one accompanied with craniocerebra trauma, one with pelvic fracture, one accompanied with both. according to the schatzker tibial plateau classification, the original fracture type were 3 type i, 1 type ii and 3 type iii. the lateral tibial plateau collapse ranges from 4 mm-12 mm, with an average of 9.4 mm. all the operations were successfully completed, the average operation time was 77.1 min (range 70-90 min), the average intraoperative blood loss was 121.4 ml (range 90-180 ml), the mean follow-up time was 14.4 months (range 12-18 months), and the average healing time of the osteotomy fragments was 12 weeks (range 11-13 weeks). the difference between preoperative and postoperative rasmussen scores were statistically significant (p < 0.05). all the patients were obtained functional recovery, with no complications. conclusion: 3d printing technology is helpful to accurately design osteotomy operation, reduce the risk of postoperative deformity, decrease intraoperative blood loss, shorten the operation time, and can effectively improve the treatment effect.

fungal_infection	the advancement of phytochemical and phytopharmacological sciences has enabled elucidation of the composition and biological activities of several medicinal plant products including plant extract and essential oils. these products have been widely used around the world since ancient times for the treatment of various disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, microbial infection, sexual disorder and many more. its popularity in the modern system of medicine is mainly due to their availability and fewer adverse reactions compared to synthetic drugs. various scientifific investigations have been conducted to look for the potential of the extract from the plant or isolated compounds for the continued use of these products in the treatment and prevention of various kinds of human diseases. it is evident from the available literature and scientifific investigations that many plant species possess potential for use as a benefificial therapeutic remedy with multiple pharmacological actions such as analgesic, anti-inflflammatory, antipyretic, hypoglycemic, hypotensive, antimicrobial, antiulcer and anticonvulsant activities. the present review aims to provide relevant updated information about certain plant products, its composition, preparation and its fungicidal or fungistatic effects on different species of fungus as evaluated by studies done in the past. it introduces six medicinal plants that have been studied for their antifungal property and are found to be effective. the overall objective is to provide comprehensive information about the use of plant extract and essential oil for treating fungal infections and to explore the evidence supporting its effectiveness in treating fungal diseases without causing any serious adverse reactions.
overactive_bladder	this article examines the experiences of family caregivers working with patients affected by overactive bladder (oab) in hong kong. chronic diseases create physical and emotional burdens not only for patients but also for family caregivers, who often experience physical and emotional burnout and social impairment. extensive literature has pertained to caregiver experiences in western and non-western settings; however, few studies have addressed the livelihoods and experiences of family caregivers of patients with oab in ethnic chinese communities. because of the increasing prevalence of oab worldwide, this study investigated the experiences of such caregivers in hong kong, examining their emotional and social needs. a qualitative research design with individual semistructured interviews was adopted, and snowball sampling was used to recruit 35 family caregivers who were referred by patients with oab. the participants were interviewed individually from may to august 2013. a phenomenological approach was adopted in the data analysis. the data revealed that all participants had unpleasant experiences in caring for family members with oab. a sense of powerlessness, helplessness, confusion and guilt, as well as grievances and social withdrawal, was prevalent, causing great physical and emotional suffering and subsequent physical and emotional burnout. these negative experiences were often caused by confusion regarding caretaking duties. the negative emotions of the participants and their family members also caused a lack of communication and mutual understanding about the disease, causing care-giving to be even more confusing and difficult. furthermore, because of traditional chinese cultural values and gender expectations, male participants experienced the triple burden of employment, domestic duties and care-giving. more holistic social and healthcare support services should be provided for care-giving family members of patients with oab patients, empowering such caregivers to attend to family members and care for their own emotional well-being.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: evidence shows the negative impact of irritable bowel syndrome on the quality of life of patients who suffer from the condition as compared to the general population. objective: the objective of this study was to determine the health-related quality of life in adults with irritable bowel syndrome who are receiving treatment at a specialist hospital. material and methods: the study had a cross-sectional prospective design. the study included consecutive patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome under the rome iii criteria and attending outpatient appointments. the sf-36 questionnaire was applied in its standard spanish version and the results were compared with population reference scores in mexico. statistical analysis was performed with the student 's t test, analysis of variance and the chi-squared test, considering a significance of 0.05%. results: one hundred and fifty-four patients were included in the study, 137 (89%) women and 17 (11%) men, with an average age of 52.8 (sd 12.6). the constipation, diarrhea and mixed subtypes comprised 85 (55.2%), 27 (17.5%) and 42 (27.3%) patients, respectively. the quality of life of patients with irritable bowel syndrome vs the population reference scores in mexico were 50 vs 79 for the physical health sub-scale and 59.1 vs 76.7 for the mental health sub-scale, respectively (p = 0.000). no significant difference was found in quality of life among the irritable bowel syndrome subtypes (p >0.05). conclusions: health-related quality of life is lower in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in a population in the north east of mexico compared to the data taken from a population reference study undertaken in the same country, enabling an inference in the female population and a cautious one from the results found in the small male sample studied. there was no significant difference found in the quality of life according to the clinical subtype of irritable bowel syndrome.
headache	traditional chinese herbal drugs have been used for thousands of years in chinese pharmacopoeia. the bark of magnolia officinalis rehder & e. wilson, known under the pinyin name ""houpo"", has been traditionally used in chinese and japanese medicines for the treatment of anxiety, asthma, depression, gastrointestinal disorders, headache, and more. moreover, magnolia bark extract is a major constituent of currently marketed dietary supplements and cosmetic products. much pharmacological activity has been reported for this herb and its major compounds, notably antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and antispasmodic effects. however, the mechanisms underlying this have not been elucidated and only a very few clinical trials have been published. in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies have also been published and indicate some intriguing features. the present review aims to summarize the literature on m. officinalis bark composition, utilisation, pharmacology, and safety.
sports_injuries	context: the functional movement screen (fms) evaluates performance in 7 fundamental movement patterns using a 4-point scale. previous studies have reported increased injury risk with a composite score (cs) of 14/21 or less; these studies were limited to specific sports and injury definition. objective: to examine the association between fms cs and movement pattern scores and acute noncontact and overuse musculoskeletal injuries in division i college athletes. an exploratory objective was to assess the association between injury and fms movement pattern asymmetry. design: prospective cohort. setting: college athletic facilities. participants: 167 injury-free, college basketball, football, volleyball, cross country, track and field, swimming/diving, soccer, golf, and tennis athletes (males = 89). intervention: the fms was administered during preparticipation examination. main outcome measure: noncontact or overuse injuries that required intervention from the athletic trainer during the sport season. results: fms cs was not different between those injured (n = 74; 14.3 +/- 2.5) and those not (14.1 +/- 2.4; p =.57). no point on the roc curve maximized sensitivity and specificity; therefore previously published cut-point was used for analysis with injury (= 14 [n = 92]). after adjustment, no statistically significant association between fms cs and injury (odds ratio [or] = 1.01, 95% ci 0.53-1.91) existed. lunge was the only movement pattern that was associated with injury; those scoring 2 were less likely to have an injury vs those who scored 3 (or = 0.21, 95% ci 0.08-0.59). there was also no association between fms movement pattern asymmetry and injury. conclusion: fms cs, movement patterns, and asymmetry were poor predictors of noncontact and overuse injury in this cohort of division i athletes.
parkinson's_disease	the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of human adipose stem cells derived from the buccal fat pad (hbfp-ascs) for nerve regeneration. parkinson 's disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive death of dopaminergic neurons. pd is a candidate disease for cell replacement therapy because it has no fundamental therapeutic methods. we examined the properties of neural-related cells induced from hbfp-ascs as a cell source for pd treatment. hbfp-ascs were cultured in neurogenic differentiation medium for about 2 weeks. after the morphology of hbfp-ascs changed to neural-like cells, the medium was replaced with neural maintenance medium. cells differentiated from hbfp-ascs showed neuron-like structures and expressed neuron markers (beta 3-tubulin, neurofilament 200, and microtubule-associated protein 2), an astrocyte marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or dopaminergic neuron-related marker (tyrosine hydroxylase). induced neural cells were transplanted into a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda)-lesioned rat hemi-parkinsonian model. at 4 weeks after transplantation, 6-ohda-lesioned rats were subjected to apomorphine-induced rotation analysis. the transplanted cells survived in the brain of rats as dopaminergic neural cells. no tumor formation was found after cell transplantation. we demonstrated differentiation of hbfp-ascs into neural cells, and that transplantation of these neural cells improved the symptoms of model rats. our results suggest that neurons differentiated from hbfp-ascs would be applicable to cell replacement therapy of pd.
emergency_contraception	background: a growing number of countries legislate for nurses to have medication prescribing authority although it is a contested issue. the uk is one of these countries, giving authority to nurses with additional qualifications since 1992 and incrementally widened the scope of nurse prescribing, most recently in 2006. the policy intention for primary care was to improve efficiency in service delivery through flexibility between medical and nursing roles. the extent to which this has occurred is uncertain. this study investigated nurses prescribing activities, over time, in english primary care settings. methods: a secondary data analysis of a national primary care prescription database 2006-2010 and national health service workforce database 2010 was undertaken. results: the numbers of nurses issuing more than one prescription annually in primary care rose from 13,391 in 2006 to 15,841 in 2010. this represented forty three percent of those with prescribing qualifications and authorisation from their employers. the number of items prescribed by nurses rose from 1.1% to 1.5% of total items prescribed in primary care. the greatest volume of items prescribed by independent nurse prescribers was in the category of penicillins, followed by dressings. however, the category where independent nurse prescribers contributed the largest proportion of all primary care prescriptions was emergency contraception (9.1%). in contrast, community practitioner nurse prescribers' greatest volume and contribution was in the category of gel and colloid dressings (27%), medicated stockings (14.5%) and incontinence appliances (4.2%). there were slightly higher rates of nurse prescribing in areas with higher levels of socio-economic deprivation and fewer physicians per capita, but the correlations were weak and warrant further investigation. conclusions: the percentage of prescriptions written by nurses in primary care in england is very small in comparison to physicians. our findings suggest that nurse prescribing is used where it is seen to have relative advantage by all stakeholders, in particular when it supports efficiency in nursing practice and also health promotion activities by nurses in general practice. it is in these areas that there appears to be flexibility in the prescribing role between nurses and general practitioners.
low_testosterone	the role of androgens in cardiovascular disease is still controversial in men. in this study, we investigated metabolic disorders in tunisian hypogonadal men compared with healthy controls. forty hypogonadal men and 80 control subjects were enrolled. patients with a history of pre-existing panhypopituitarism, thyroid dysfunction or inflammatory disease were excluded. glycaemia, glycated haemoglobin (hba1c), high-sensitive c-reactive protein (hscrp), lipid profile, insulin, testosterone and gonadotrophins were measured. insulin resistance was assessed by homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (homa ir). waist circumference, body mass index and blood pressure were significantly higher in patients compared with controls. glycemia, hba1c, fasting serum insulin and homa ir were significantly increased among hypogonadal men. in univariate analysis, testosterone levels were inversely correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, glycaemia, hba1c, insulin, homa ir and hscrp. in multivariate analysis including all significant variables, initial testosterone level was the only independent risk factor for developing dyslipidaemia. with logistic regression, male hypogonadism was an independent risk factor for ms (p<0.001). we conclude that low testosterone level plays a central role in the development of metabolic syndrome. further prospective data are required to establish the causative link.
low_testosterone	objective. opioids can suppress gonadal hormone production, which may result in low testosterone levels. to date, there have been no large-scale population-based studies examining the extent to which opioid use may contribute to changes in testosterone levels. design. cross-sectional study. setting. 2011-2012 national health and nutrition examination survey. subjects. participants 17 years and older who had data on prescription medication usage and serum testosterone levels available. participants were divided in two groups, opioid exposed and unexposed. methods. testosterone levels of participants who responded that they had been exposed (n = 320) to prescription opioids in the past 30 days were compared with those who were unexposed (n = 4909). the number of participants with low testosterone levels was calculated and unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed. results. participants on opioids had higher odds of having low testosterone levels than those unexposed, odd ratio (or) = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (ci) (1.07-1.84). after controlling for opioid exposure, as the age and the number of comorbidities increased, the odds of having low testosterone levels significantly increased in all categories. compared with participants between 17 and 45 years of age, participants >70 years had or = 1.70, 95% ci (1.16-2.50). compared with participants with no comorbidities, participants with >2 comorbidities had or = 1.69 95% ci (1.24-2.30). conclusion. when assessing the impact of opioids on testosterone, the effects of age and medical conditions should be considered.
birth_control	hofmann (1935) submitted a proposal, using a timed mating and farrowing system to program the reproductive dates in a sow herd and thus to direct the breeding and production cycle taut. in 1958 to 1964, the developed system of periodic farrowing was operated in thuringia first farms successfully introduced. this work coincided with the beginning of the so-called ""industrial methods of production"" in the eastern livestock. first porcine semen collection centers emerged in 1961. from 1970, the proportion inseminated sows increased the total sow population from 10.6% to 86.6% in 1989. this made it possible to realize the nationwide uniform hybrid pig breeding program and the parallel developed reproductive technology in practice establish. starting from an oriented on natural sexual cycle grouping of sows in the system of periodic farrowing other methods for cycle synchronization with young and old sows and birth control have been developed and filed either in the practice production cycles of sows producing farms in combination with ai. more than 85% of all sows were managed according to the principle of group farrowing system in east germany across all farm size categories.
polycythemia_vera	thrombocytosis is a frequent laboratory finding but not a diagnosis. therefore, elevated platelet counts (>450 x 10(9)/1) require careful diagnostic work-up to differentiate between reactive thrombocytosis (rt), caused by various conditions, and essential thrombocythemia (et), a myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn). in either setting, aspirin is widely used in clinical practice. however, rt (even at platelet counts >1000 x 10(9)/1) has never been shown to cause thrombosis or bleeding due to acquired von willebrand factor defects in association with high platelet counts. identification of reactive conditions and appropriate therapy of the underlying disorder are most relevant. by contrast to rt, et and related mpn can be associated with thrombosis and/or hemorrhage. current recommendations suggest the use of low-dose aspirin in all patients with et unless contraindicated. however, the strength of this recommendation is weak, i.e. evidence level ilb grade b.a potential benefit of aspirin used for primary thromboprophylaxis in et is mostly derived from the eclap study in polycythemia vera (pv). however, translating study results from pv to et appears to be highly questionable and may be biased. in the absence of robust data regarding the benefit-risk balance of aspirin in et, it appears reasonable (1) to stratify patients according to their individual thrombotic and bleeding risk, (2) to restrict the use of aspirin to high-risk categories and patients with microcirculatory disturbances, (3) to test for pharmacological efficacy (cox-1 inhibition; measurement of txb2), and (4) to modify the aspirin dosing regimen (twice instead of once daily) if required.
overactive_bladder	mirabegron is a relatively new drug introduced to treat overactive bladder syndrome. it can be used either on its own or as part of a combination. this drug has been extensively studied, with a good number of phase ii and phase iii trials showing promising outcomes. these studies show that mirabegron is an effective, well-tolerated drug, which could have some adverse effects of concern. in this review, we look at the trials on mirabegron, as well as its pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and side effects as documented in the literature.
skin_care	the aim of this work was to determine antioxidant capacities, neuroprotective, skin care, antidiabetic effects, and fatty acid composition of anchusa undulata subsp. hybrida. the antioxidant activity was screened by four different test systems including total antioxidant, antiradical, reducing power, and metal chelating activities. neuroprotective potential was determined by anticholinesterase inhibitor assay. tyrosinase inhibitory activity was tested to detect skin care effect. antidiabetic effects were evaluated with alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory assays. inhibitory activities on acetycholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase enzymes were observed as 2.238 and 1.239 mu mol galaes/g, 0.339 mmol kaes/g, 0.193, and 0.219 mmol aces/g extract, respectively. amount of total phenolics and flavonoids were found as 80.34 mu g gaes/mg and 25.09 mu g qes/mg in the extract, respectively. twenty-three fatty acids were found in the aerial parts, being oleic acid (24.30 g/100 g of total fatty acids) the most abundant, followed by linoleic (21.19 g/100 g of total fatty acids) and palmitic acids (17.50 g/100 g of total fatty acids).
menopause	background: proponents of bioidentical estrogens claim that they are superior for treating menopausal symptoms, including depressive symptoms. small trials examining the effects of bioidentical estrogens on depressive symptoms show conflicting results. we conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical estrogens for treatment of depressive symptoms in peri-and postmenopausal women. methods: we searched the scientific literature for randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks duration, comparing bioidentical estrogen with placebo for depressive symptoms in menopausal women. the main outcome measure was improvement in depressive symptoms on a validated scale. results: we found 12 clinical trials that met inclusion criteria, two of which contained insufficient data for quantitative analysis. in the 10 studies (inclusive of 1208 subjects) for which complete data were available for inclusion in the meta-analysis, bioidentical estrogen had no clinically significant effect on depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [smd] -0.02; confidence interval [95% ci] -0.41 to + 0.38). pooled studies were highly heterogeneous, and numerous approaches to reducing heterogeneity were unsuccessful. subgroup analyses showed no significant difference in effect for women treated with adjunctive progestogen, women treated with unopposed estrogen, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal and mixed populations. a possible benefit in perimenopausal women treated with unopposed estradiol may have been diluted by studies including older postmenopausal women whose depressive symptoms were unrelated to menopause. conclusions: in this first systematic review of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, we found that bioidentical estrogen has no clear benefit in treating depressive symptoms in menopausal women, but heterogeneity of available studies limits the potential for definitive conclusions. future research should compare bioidentical estrogen with nonbioidentical estrogen for treatment of depressive symptoms in perimenopausal women.
heart_disease	background and aims: insulin resistance is associated with a cluster of abnormalities that increase cardiovascular disease (cvd). several indices have been proposed to identify individuals who are insulin resistant, and thereby at increased cvd risk. the aim of this study was to compare the abilities of 3 indices to accomplish that goal: 1) plasma triglyceride x glucose index (tg x g); 2) plasma triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (tg/hdl-c); and 3) metabolic syndrome (mets). methods and results: in a population sample of 723 individuals (486 women and 237 men, 50 +/- 16 and 51 +/- 16 years old, respectively), baseline demographic and metabolic variables known to increase cvd risk and incident cvd were compared among individuals defined as high vs. low risk by: tg x g; tg/hdl-c; or mets. cvd risk profiles appeared comparable in high risk subjects, irrespective of criteria. crude incidence of cvd events was increased in high risk subjects: 12.2 vs. 5.3% subjects/10 years, p = 0.005 defined by tg/hdl-c; 13.4 vs. 5.3% subjects/10 years, p = 0.002 defined by tg x g; and 13.4% vs. 4.5% of subjects/10 years, p < 0.001 in subjects with the mets. the area under the roc curves to predict cvd were similar, 0.66 vs. 0.67 for tg/hdl-c and tg x g, respectively. however, when adjusted by age, sex and multiple covariates, hazard ratios for incident cvd were significantly increased in high risk patients classified by either tg/hdl-c ratio (2.18, p = 0.021) or mets (1.93, p = 0.037), but not by tg x g index (1.72, p = 0.087). conclusion: although the 3 indices identify cvd risk comparably, the tg x g index seems somewhat less effective at predicting cvd.

polycythemia_vera	introductionthe janus kinase (jak)2 p.v617f gain-of-function mutation is a hallmark of bcr-abl1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns). this study analyzed jak2 mutations in 1811 patients tested between 2010 and 2013. methodsexons 12-15 of jak2 were sequenced in 1706 samples, and patients harboring mutations were clinically evaluated. resultsof 271 patients (16%) with jak2 mutations, 148 (54.6%) were female and 123 (45.4%) were male; 103 (38%) were local and 168 (62%) were referred; and 13 (5%) had additional genetic abnormalities. the median patient age was 54years, and there was only one pediatric patient. in agreement with previous reports, 262 patients (96.7%) were positive for the jak2 p.v617f mutation. non-p.v617f jak2 mutations were detected in the remaining nine (3.3%) patients: five (1.8%) had a p.g571s mutation, and one (0.3%) each had p.e543_d544del, p.y570y silent, p.r541_e543delinsk, and p.i540_n542delinsm mutations. diagnosis of 103 (38%) in-house cases revealed a predominance of mpn patients (87 cases, or 84.4%). conclusionjak2 p.v617f was the most prevalent mutation detected among patients in this study. non-p.v617f jak2 mutations were identified in exons 12 and 13 corresponding to recently reported mutations, except for the novel p.i540_n542delinsm.
cancer	the local resection of the stomach is an ideal method for preventing postoperative symptoms. there are various procedures for performing local resection, such as the laparoscopic lesion lifting method, non-touch lesion lifting method, endoscopic full-thickness resection, and laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery. after the invention and widespread use of endoscopic submucosal dissection, local resection has become outdated as a curative surgical technique for gastric cancer. nevertheless, local resection of the stomach in the treatment of gastric cancer in now expected to make a comeback with the clinical use of sentinel node navigation surgery. however, there are many issues associated with local resection for gastric cancer, other than the normal indications. these include gastric deformation, functional impairment, ensuring a safe surgical margin, the possibility of inducing peritoneal dissemination, and the associated increase in the risk of metachronous gastric cancer. in view of these issues, there is a tendency to regard local resection as an investigative treatment, to be applied only in carefully selected cases. the ideal model for local resection of the stomach for gastric cancer would be a combination of endoscopic full-thickness resection of the stomach using an esd device and hand sutured closure using a laparoscope or a surgical robot, for achieving both oncological safety and preserved functions.
weight_loss	reduction of iron ore-coal composite pellets in multi-layers at rotary hearth furnace (rhf) is limited by heat and mass transfer. effect of various parameters like pellet shape, size, and bed packing material that are supposed to influence the heat and mass transfer in the pellet bed, have been investigated, on the reduction behaviour of iron ore-coal composite pellets at 1250 degrees c for 20 min in a laboratory scale rhf. reduced pellets have been characterised through weight loss measurement, estimation of shrinkage, porosity, and qualitative, quantitative phase analysis by xrd. a significant difference in the degree of reduction is observed layer-wise in the pellet bed with the variation in pellet shape and size. pellet bed without any packing material or packed with coal have demonstrated higher degrees of reduction compared to the pellet bed packed with graphite and sand.
skin_care	atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic relapsing, inflammatory skin disease. failure to treat ad successfully can often be directly linked to poor treatment adherence as a result of the lack of information about the disease and basic principles of treatment. several studies have found that making patients active participants in their care through information and education is a successful treatment strategy in ad. the aim of this study was to evaluate parental knowledge on ad and to stress the importance of therapeutic educational program in long term management and control of the disease. we carried out a short questionnaire-based study among 238 parents of children with ad regarding their knowledge on the etiology and treatment of ad. our results showed that 21% of the participants reported corticophobia and were concerned about systemic absorption affecting the child 's growth and development even after short application. in children with ad who have food hypersensitivity, 14% of parents thought that a small amount of food allergen could be beneficial in achieving tolerability. the role of interdisciplinary educational program is to explain the epidemiology and pathogenesis of ad, as well as concomitant atopy related diseases and to teach parents about the importance of appropriate skin care.
myelofibrosis	myelofibrosis (mf) is a bcr-abl1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm that is mainly characterised by reactive bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary haematopoiesis, anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, leukaemic progression, and shortened survival. as such, this malignancy is still orphan of curative treatments; indeed, the only treatment that has a clearly demonstrated impact on disease progression is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but only a minority of patients are eligible for such intensive therapy. however, more recently, the discovery of jak2 mutations has also led to the development of small-molecule jak1/2 inhibitors, the first of which, ruxolitinib, has been approved for the treatment of mf in the united states and europe. in this article, we report on old and new therapeutic strategies that proved effective in early preclinical and clinical trials, and subsequently in the daily clinical practice, for patients with mf, particularly concerning the topics of anaemia, splenomegaly, iron overload, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
menopause	objective: to compare the metabolic profiles of normo- and hyperandrogenic women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) with those of control women at different ages during reproductive life. design: case-control study. setting: not applicable. patient(s): in all, 1,550 women with normoandrogenic (n = 686) or hyperandrogenic (n = 842) pcos and 447 control women were divided into three age groups:39 years). interventions(s): none. main outcome measure(s): body mass index (bmi), waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, cholesterol, lipoproteins, triglycerides and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein. result(s): both normo- and hyperandrogenic women with pcos were more obese, especially abdominally. they had increased serum levels of insulin (fasting and in oral glucose tolerance tests), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol, higher blood pressure, and lower high-density lipoprotein levels independently from bmi compared with the control population as early as from young adulthood until menopause. the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was two-to fivefold higher in women with pcos compared with control women, depending on age and phenotype, and the highest prevalence was observed in hyperandrogenic women with pcos at late reproductive age. conclusion(s): when evaluating metabolic risks in women with pcos, androgenic status, especially abdominal obesity and age, should be taken into account, which would allow tailored management of the syndrome from early adulthood on.

emergency_contraception	background: cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) is expressed in all female reproductive organs. therefore, inhibitors of cox-2 may affect reproductive function. we evaluated the effect of extended administration of meloxicam on ovulation and the menstrual cycle. our hypothesis was that meloxicam administered from menstrual cycle day 5- 22 could interfere with follicular rupture, without disrupting the menstrual cycle, and could be a potential non-hormonal contraceptive method. methods: the study was conducted in 56 healthy sterilized women. before the onset of treatment and after the end of treatment, participants were observed during a control cycle to ensure that they had progesterone (p-4) serum levels (>12 nmol/l) consistent with ovulation. participants were treated for 18 days, during three consecutive cycles. they were randomized to 15 or 30 mg/day. the menstrual cycle was monitored with serial ultrasound and hormone assays in blood. results: fifty-six volunteers completed the study. in 55% of cycles treated with 15 mg/day and in 78% of cycles treated with 30mg/day (p<0.001) we observed dysfunctional ovulation defined as follicular rupture not preceded 24-48 h earlier by an lh peak or preceded by a blunted lh peak (12 nmol/l. ovulation was observed in 44.6% and in 21.7% of women in the lower dose group and the higher dose group, respectively. there were no differences between the two doses in other parameters measured. there were no serious adverse events and adverse events were not different between doses or between control and treated cycles. conclusions: although administration of meloxicam on menstrual cycle days 5- 22 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ovulation, more than 20% of subjects had normal ovulation with the highest dose.

weight_loss	background: epigenetic mechanisms provide an interface between environmental factors and the genome and are known to play a role in complex diseases such as obesity. these mechanisms, including dna methylation, influence the regulation of development, differentiation and the establishment of cellular identity. here we employ two approaches to identify differential methylation between two white adipose tissue depots in obese individuals before and after gastric bypass and significant weight loss. we analyse genome-wide dna methylation data using (a) traditional paired t tests to identify significantly differentially methylated loci (bonferroni-adjusted p0.75, p <= 0.001) were observed between changes in dna methylation (subcutaneous adipose vs omentum) and changes in clinical trait, in particular for cpg sites within pitx2 and fasting glucose and four cpg sites within isl2 and hdl. a single cpg site (cg00838040, atp2c2) gave strong tissue separation, with validation in independent subcutaneous (n = 681) and omental (n = 33) adipose samples. conclusions: this is the first study to report a genome-wide dna methylome comparison of subcutaneous abdominal and omental adipose before and after weight loss. the combinatorial approach we utilised is a powerful tool for the identification of methylation loci that strongly differentiate between these tissues. this study provides a solid basis for future research focused on the development of adipose tissue and its potential dysfunction in obesity, as well as the role dna methylation plays in these processes.
headache	introduction. lumber punctures are a common procedure in patients with cancer. however, a potential complication of a lumbar puncture is a postdural puncture headache. the risk of neoplastic seeding to the central nervous system has led to concern over performing epidural blood patches (ebps) for the treatment of postdural puncture headaches in patients with cancer. the goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate cancer seeding in the central nervous system in patients diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma. methods. institutional electronic records were queried over a 13-year period from 2000 to 2013 for patients with leukemia and/or lymphoma and who received at least one ebp. demographic and procedural data, cancer treatments, and mortality were all examined. patient records were reviewed for evidence of new-onset neoplastic central nervous system seeding after an epidural blood patch. results. a total of 80 patients were identified for review. eighteen patients had a diagnosis of leukemia, and 62 had lymphoma. following an ebp, none of the patients experienced new cancer or cancer seeding in the central nervous system following an epidural blood patch at a median follow-up of 3.74 years. discussion. though the risks of ebp in the cancer patient population have been hypothesized, no previous studies have assessed the risk of seeding cancer to the central nervous system. based on our results, an epidural blood patch bears low risk of cancer seeding when used to treat postdural puncture headache that is unresponsive to conservative treatments.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	purpose of review irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorder with negative impact on quality of life and it represents a substantial economic burden on healthcare cost. the medical management of ibs remains largely symptomatic. this review provides an update related to the most recently published diagnostic rome iv criteria for ibs and clinical trial data for novel treatment modalities in ibs targeting the peripheral opioid receptors of the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiota. recent findings the new rome iv criteria define functional gastrointestinal disorders as disorders of the gut-brain interaction. in addition to previously introduced pharmacological treatment modalities for ibs with constipation (ibs-c) with synthetic peptides and small molecules targeting gastrointestinal receptors and ion channels, the newly food and drug administration-approved mixed peripheral opioid receptor agonist/antagonist eluxadoline and the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin demonstrate efficacy and safety in the treatment of ibs with predominant diarrhea (ibs-d). summary diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders, including ibs, have been revised in rome iv and are defined as gut-brain disorders. the mixed peripheral opioid receptor agonist/antagonist eluxadoline and the antibiotic rifaximin have been recently food and drug administration approved for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant ibs (ibs-d) with proven efficacy and acceptable side-effect profiles.
menopause	there is increasing attention and concern about managing the adverse effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with early breast cancer as the side effects of therapy influence compliance and can impair quality of life (qol). most side effects associated with tamoxifen (tam) and aromatase inhibitors (als) are directly related to estrogen deprivation, and the symptoms are similar to those experienced during natural menopause but appear to be more severe than that seen in the general population. prolonged estrogen deprivation may lead to atrophy of the vulva, vagina, lower urinary tract and supporting pelvic structures, resulting in a range of genitourinary symptoms that can in turn lead to pain, discomfort, impairment of sexual function and negatively impact on multiple domains of qol. the genitourinary side effects may be prevented, reduced and managed in most cases but this requires early recognition and appropriate treatment. we provide an overview of practical clinical approaches to understanding the pathophysiology and the management of genitourinary symptoms in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.
fungal_infection	background: while candida pneumonia is life-threatening, biomarker measurements to early detect suspected candida pneumonia are lacking. this study compared the diagnostic values of measuring levels of (1, 3)-beta-d-glucan in endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum to detect suspected candida pneumonia in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. methods: this prospective, observational study enrolled immunocompromised, critically ill, and ventilated patients with suspected fungal pneumonia in mixed intensive care units from november 2010 to october 2011. patients with d-glucan confounding factors or other fungal infection were excluded. endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were collected from each patient to perform a fungal smear, culture, and d-glucan assay. results: after screening 166 patients, 31 patients completed the study and were categorized into non-candida pneumonia/non-candidemia (n = 18), suspected candida pneumonia (n = 9), and non-candida pneumonia/candidemia groups (n = 4). d-glucan levels in endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage were highest in suspected candida pneumonia, while the serum d-glucan level was highest in non-candida pneumonia/candidemia. in all patients, the d-glucan value in endotracheal aspirate was positively correlated with that in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. for the detection of suspected candida pneumonia, the predictive performance (sensitivity/specificity/d-glucan cutoff [pg/ml]) of d-glucan in endotracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 67%/82%/120 and 89%/86%/130, respectively, accounting for areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.833 and 0.939 (both p < 0.05), respectively. measuring serum d-glucan was of no diagnostic value (area under curve = 0.510, p = 0.931) for the detection of suspected candida pneumonia in the absence of concurrent candidemia. conclusions: d-glucan levels in both endotracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage, but not in serum, provide good diagnostic values to detect suspected candida pneumonia and to serve as potential biomarkers for early detection in this patient population.
fungal_infection	the reduction of crown rot disease observed in uvc-irradiated banana fruit, 'berangan' was associated with activation of the defense response mechanisms, increased peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities as well as accumulation of lignin and phenolic compounds in its crown tissue, but not phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. transmission electron microscope micrographs revealed that 0.01 kj m (2) uvc retarded the losses of cell compartments and disintegrations of fibril fraction in cell wall structure of the crown tissue. uvc treatment 24 h after fungal inoculation induced the accumulation of phenol-storing cells that could create an antimicrobial environment in the host tissue for combating the fungal colonization. moreover, formation of cell wall lignification and heterogenous matrix of cell wall appositions at site of fungal penetration was clearly observed in uvc-irradiated crown tissue, which otherwise absent in the control crowns. these structures might be important physical barriers that were induced by the irradiation to prevent diffusions of toxin and enzyme from the crown rot-infecting fungi.

alzheimer's_disease	introduction: neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology. cerebrospinal fluid (csf) ykl-40 - an indicator of microglial activation - has recently been identified by proteomic studies as a candidate biomarker for alzheimer 's disease (ad).areas covered: we review the impact of csf ykl-40 as a pathophysiological biomarker for ad and other neurodegenerative diseases. csf ykl-40 concentrations have been shown to predict progression from prodromal mild cognitive impairment to ad dementia. moreover, a positive association between csf ykl-40 and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration - particularly total tau protein - has been reported during the asymptomatic preclinical stage of ad and other neurodegenerative diseases. albeit preliminary, current data do not support an association between apoe-epsilon 4 status and csf ykl-40 concentrations. when interpreting the diagnostic/prognostic significance of csf ykl-40 concentrations in neurodegenerative diseases, potential confounders - including age, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, diagnostic criteria for selecting cases/controls - need to be considered.expert opinion/commentary: csf ykl-40 represents a pathophysiological biomarker reflecting immune/inflammatory mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, associated with tau protein pathology. besides being associated with tau pathology, csf ykl-40 adds to the growing array of biomarkers reflecting distinct molecular brain mechanisms potentially useful for stratifying individuals for biomarker-guided, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies emerging from precision medicine.
fungal_infection	what is known and objectiverhabdomyolysis is a severe potential adverse drug reaction of statin therapy. we report a case of rhabdomyolysis due to drug-drug interaction (ddi) between atorvastatin and fluconazole and review the literature. case summarya 70-year-old woman received atorvastatin for hyperlipidaemia without any problem for 4 years. when intravenous fluconazole was added for treating a fungal infection, rhabdomyolysis developed 2 weeks later. removal of atorvastatin led to the resolution of her rhabdomyolysis. what is new and conclusionour case demonstrates that in some subjects even a moderate cyp3a4 inhibitor such as fluconazole may lead to rhabdomyolysis in subjects receiving a statin. characteristics of reported cases of rhabdomyolysis associated with drug interaction between statins and fluconazole.
parenting	the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of rewarding and parenting styles on kindergarteners' cheating behavior. the participants were 77 young children enrolled in one of three public kindergartens in the sanlurfa province of turkey. ages ranged from 54 to 76months, with a mean age of 67.36months (sd=4.69). participants were randomly assigned to reward and control groups. each participant was tested individually. participants were asked to solve a labyrinth puzzle without looking at the solution in the absence of an applicator (research assistants). reward group participants were informed that if they successfully solved the puzzle they would get a lollipop. findings revealed that the reward group exhibited significantly more cheating behavior than the control group. cheating behavior was not related to parenting styles. the investigator concluded that using rewards as an educational tool may increase children 's tendency to cheat.
birth_control	this paper exploits the discrete jump in alcohol consumption at the minimum legal drinking age (mlda) in the usa and uses a regression discontinuity design to investigate the relationship between drinking and risky sexual behaviors among young adults. using confidential data from the national longitudinal survey of youth (1997 cohort), we document that young adults tend to drink up to 2.1 days more once they are granted legal access to alcohol at age 21. although the discrete jump in alcohol consumption at the mlda is associated with an increase in the probability of having sex by up to 7.8 percentage points, it does not have a significant impact on the probability of engaging in risky sexual behaviors among young adults. we also document that the effect of the mlda on the probability of using several different birth control methods is not significant for those who had sex in the past 4 weeks. these results are robust under alternative specifications and imply that although the mlda law is quite effective in reducing alcohol consumption among young adults, spillover effects of this law on risky sexual behaviors are relatively limited.
hypothyroidism	fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism may occur in mothers with graves' disease. fetal thyrotoxicosis manifestation is observed with the transition of tsh receptor stimulating antibodies to the fetus from the 17th-20th weeks of pregnancy and with the fetal tsh receptors becoming responsive after 20 weeks. the diagnosis is confirmed by fetal tachycardia, goiter and bone age advancement in pregnancy and maternal treatment is conducted in accordance. the probability of neonatal hyperthyroidism is high in the babies of mothers that have ongoing antithyroid requirement and higher antibody levels in the last months of pregnancy. clinical manifestation may be delayed by 7-17 days because of the antithyroid drugs taken by the mother. neonatal hyperthyroidism symptoms can be confused with sepsis and congenital viral infections. herein, the diagnosis and therapeutic approach are reviewed in cases of fetal neonatal hyperthyroidism.
skin_care	background: inconsistent evidence about product effectiveness to prevent moist desquamation during radiation treatment and minimal research about the acceptability to patients of recommended products prompted this study. objective: this randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness of 2 creams at minimizing the incidence of moist desquamation in a tropical setting and explored which product was most acceptable to patients receiving radiation treatment. methods: participants (n = 255) were stratified according to breast or chest wall radiation treatment and randomly allocated to use a moisturizing or barrier cream. nurses assessed radiation skin reactions weekly with a standardized grading system, and patients were telephoned 1 month after completing treatment for a final skin assessment. participants completed an acceptability survey at similar times. results: at treatment completion, 15% of participants had moist desquamation. an additional 26% self-reported this at follow-up. risk factors for moist desquamation included increased breast cup size and body mass index. the barrier cream significantly reduced the incidence of moist desquamation during treatment in patients receiving radiation to the chest wall ((2) = 3.93, p = .047). participants preferred the barrier cream over the moisturizer ((2) = 5.81, p = .02) during treatment. conclusions: this study identified a relatively high incidence of moist desquamation in patients receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer. future patients will have information about product effectiveness in minimizing moist desquamation when choosing skin care products. implications for practice: structured discharge planning and patient education need to include information about factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing moist desquamation.
alzheimer's_disease	early detection of alzheimer 's disease (ad) is imperative in enabling the understanding and clinical treatment of this disorder, as well as in preventing its progression. imaging agents specifically targeting a beta plaques in the brain and the retina may lead to the early diagnosis of ad. among them, near-infrared fluorescent (nirf) imaging has emerged as an attractive tool to noninvasively identify and monitor diseases during the preclinical and early, stages. in the present study, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a series of new near-infrared fluorescent probes. most of these probes displayed maximum emission in pbs (>650 nm), which falls in the goad range for nirf probes. among them, 4a1 showed the highest affinity toward a beta aggregates (k-d = 7.5 nm) and an excellent targeting ability for a beta plaques in slices of brain and retina tissue from double transgenic mice. these compounds are also found to effectively prevent a beta fibril formation and disaggregate preformed a beta fibrils, showing a promising potential as theranostic agents for the diagnosis and therapy of ad.
overactive_bladder	electroacupuncture (ea) at zhongliao (bl33) can improve the symptoms of overactive bladder (oab), such as urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. however, its performance compared with other acupoints remains unclear. this study investigated the effects of ea at bl33 with deep needling on rats with oab by detecting urodynamics in eight groups: no intervention group, d-bl33 group (deep needling at bl33), s-bl33 group (shallow needling at bl33), non-acupoint group (needling at the non-acupoint next to bl33), weizhong (bl40) group, sanyinjiao (sp6) group, tongtian (bl7) group, and hegu (li4) group. results revealed that ea at bl33 with deep needling, bl40, and sp6 prolonged the intercontraction interval (ici) of rats with oab (p = 0.001, p = 0.005, p = 0.046, respectively, post-treatment vs. post-modeling). furthermore, the change in ici from post-modeling in the d-bl33 group was significantly greater than those of the no intervention and other ea groups (all p < 0.01). significantly shortened vesical micturition time (vmt) and elevated maximum detrusor pressure (mdp) were also observed in the d-bl33 group (p = 0.017 and p = 0.024, respectively, post-treatment vs. post-modeling). however, no statistically significant differences in the changes of vmt and mdp from post-modeling were observed between d-bl33 and the other ea groups. in conclusion, ea at bl33 with deep needling may inhibit acetic-acid-induced oab more effectively.
birth_control	reproductive coercion involves behavior that interferes with contraceptive and pregnancy choices of women and occasionally men. this includes birth control sabotage (intentional destruction of a woman 's chosen method of contraception), pregnancy pressure (behaviors to coerce pregnancy against one 's wishes), and pregnancy coercion (threats to direct the outcome of a pregnancy). all are associated with serious reproductive consequences including unintended pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted infections, poor pregnancy outcomes, and psychological trauma. this article presents an overview of the recent literature surrounding reproductive coercion and how it relates to the reproductive health outcomes of women, adolescents, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. men 's experience with reproductive coercion will also be discussed. clinical implications and evidence-based strategies for assessment and intervention will be identified.
low_testosterone	a summary this manuscript describes the role of low vitamin d in bone metabolism of klinefelter subjects. low vitamin d is frequent in this condition and seems to be more important than testosterone in inducing low bone mineral density (bmd) and osteoporosis. supplementation with vitamin d restores bmd after 2 years of treatment, whereas testosterone alone seems to be ineffective. introduction decreased bone mineral density (bmd) in klinefelter syndrome (ks) is frequent, and it has been traditionally related to low testosterone (t) levels. however, low bmd can be observed also in patients with normal t levels and t replacement therapy does not necessarily increase bone mass in these patients. nothing is known about vitamin d levels and supplementation in ks. in this study, we determine vitamin d status and bone mass in ks subjects and compare the efficacy of t therapy and vitamin d supplementation on bmd. methods a total of 127 non-mosaic ks patients and 60 age-matched male controls were evaluated with reproductive hormones, 25-hydroxyvitamin d, pth, and bone densitometry by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa). patients with hypogonadism and/or 25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency were treated with t-gel 2 % and/or calcifediol and re-evaluated after 24 months of treatment. results 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels were significantly lower in ks patients with respect to controls, and they had significantly lower lumbar and femoral bmd. the percentage of osteopenia/osteoporosis in subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency was higher with respect to subjects with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin d and was not related to the presence/absence of low t levels. subjects treated with calcifediol or t + calcifediol had a significant increase in lumbar bmd after treatment. no difference was found in t-treated group. conclusion these data highlight that low 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels seem to have a more critical role than low t levels in inducing low bmd in ks subjects. furthermore, vitamin d supplementation seems to be more effective than t replacement therapy alone in increasing bmd.
senior_health	background: the impact of presumed consent on donation rates has been widely debated. in june 2013 greece adopted a 'soft' presumed consent law for organ and tissue donation, where relatives' approval is sought prior to organ removal. aims: to report on the knowledge, attitudes and concerns of undergraduate students, enrolled in three health science disciplines, in regards to organ donation and presumed consent. methods: undergraduate junior and senior health science students [medical (ms), nursing (ns) and medical laboratory students (mls)] were recruited from higher education settings in thessaly, greece. dichotomous questions, previously used, were adopted to assess knowledge, attitudes and concerns towards organ donation, together with questions regarding the recent presumed consent legislation. results: three hundred seventy-one out of 510 students participated in the study (response rate: 72.7%). only 3.6% of ns, 8.7% of ms and 3.2% of mls carried a donor card. although over 78% in all groups knew that it was possible to leave kidneys for transplant after death, only 10% to 39% considered themselves well-informed. ns were more likely to consider opting-out (21.5%), followed by mls (17.9%) and ms (10.9%). respondents were more likely to refuse organ removal upon death when expressing one of the following views: a) opposing a system making it lawful to take kidneys from an adult who has just died, unless forbidden while alive [odds ratio (or) 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.96 (1.48-5.93), p=0.002], b) worrying about their kidneys being removed after death [or, 95% ci: 3.37 (1.75-6.49), p=<0.001] and c) believing that an intact body was needed after death [or, 95% ci: 4.23 (2.15-8.31), p<0.001]. conclusion: health science students, soon to become healthcare professionals, demonstrated limited awareness in regards to the newly reformed organ donation system. identified knowledge deficits and concerns could have far-reaching implications in terms of conveying a clear message and shaping the public 's stand. the feasibility and effectiveness of a joint inter-professional curriculum on organ and tissue donation issues across all three health science disciplines, addressing common themes and concerns deserves further study.
fungal_infection	background: radiotherapy for head and neck cancers (hnc) causes alteration of oral mucosal barrier predisposing it to colonization and infection. such infections often result in pain and burning sensation thus contributing to major morbidity. objective: 1. to identify the fungi isolated from the patients undergoing radiotherapy for hnc. 2. to determine their antifungal susceptibility and week of colonization. 3. to find out association between oral fungal infection and severity of oral mucositis. materials and methods: study was done on 50 patients of hnc treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. three samples (throat, urine, blood) were collected for fungal culture and sensitivity. these samples were collected before the start of radiotherapy, during radiotherapy (2nd and 6th week) and post radiotherapy (10th week). results: only 49 patients were available for analysis. fungal infection was found in 27/49 patients (55.10%) out of which non-albicans candida was isolated in 18/49 (36.73%) and candida albicans in 9/49 (18.36%) cases. about 66.66% (18/27) isolates were sensitive to fluconazole. maximum isolation of yeast was during 6th week of radiotherapy. all grade 4 and 71.42% of grade 3 oral mucositis were found in patients who were positive for fungal infection. conclusion: the spectrum of fungal species in throat swab was: non-albicans candida and candida albicans observed in 36.73% and 18.36% of patients respectively. higher rate of fungal colonization and infection was found in patients with grade 3/4 oral mucositis. prophylactic fluconazole in hnc patients on concurrent chemoradiotherapy has the potential to reduce emerging invasive fungal infection and its associated morbidity.

low_testosterone	objectives: we examined the prevalence of low testosterone (lt) in the subset of men in the proscar long-term efficacy and safety study (pless) who had serum total testosterone (tt) measured at baseline. methods: pless enrolled 3040 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). of these men, 299 had tt and body mass index (bmi) measurements at baseline. patients were classified as having lt if their baseline tt was <300 ng/dl. results: of the 299 pless patients with baseline tt and bmi measurements, 65 (21.7%) had lt. the prevalence of lt increased with increasing bmi, occurring in 8/78 (10.3%) normal weight patients (baseline bmi= 25-= 30 kg/m(2)). conclusions: lt was observed in more than one in five pless patients with baseline tt and bmi measurements. the prevalence of lt increased with increasing bmi - more than one in three obese pless patients with baseline tt measurements had lt.
heart_disease	background: the aim was to investigate whether mean perfusion pressure (mpp) calculated as the difference between mean arterial pressure (map) and central venous pressure (cvp) was associated with risk of progression from aki i to aki iii in critically ill patients. methods: retrospective analysis of adult patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary adult intensive care unit (icu) between july 2007 and june 2009 who developed aki i and in whom advanced haemodynamic monitoring was initiated within 12 h of diagnosis of aki i. we compared patients with a mpp above and below the median value in the first 12 h of diagnosis of aki. multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for progression to aki iii, to explore the impact of map and cvp separately, and to investigate the impact of mpp in pre-defined sub-groups. results: among 2118 icu patients, 790 patients (37%) developed aki i of whom 205 underwent advanced haemodynamic monitoring within 12 h of aki stage i. their median mpp was 59 mmhg. aki i patients with a mpp <= 59 mmhg had a significantly higher risk of progressing to aki stage iii (48.6% versus 34%, respectively; p = 0.0034). this association was stronger in patients with ischemic heart disease, congestive cardiac failure or without pre-existing hypertension and in patients with a map1 h. as individual components, a raised cvp was independently associated with progression to aki stage iii but map alone was not an independent risk factor for aki progression. conclusion: mpp <60 mmhg was independently associated with aki progression. cvp was the key component of mpp.
emergency_contraception	as emergency contraception (ec) pills become more easily accessible to the general public, women are able to purchase contraception with less - or completely without - guidance from medical professionals. public knowledge about a more effective option, the copper red, is poor and access is difficult. many women are resorting to the familiar and highly available, ec pills rather than an alternative that may better suit their needs. here we present an interactive and engaging mobile-based application (m-app) which aims to increase awareness and knowledge of both ec methods and thereby support the user 's informed choice. the goal of the m-app is not to ""make"" the choice for the user, but rather, to enable the user to make her own well-informed decision.
hypothyroidism	background. thyroid dysfunction is common after radiotherapy (rt) for patients with head and neck cancers. we attempted to discover rt dose parameters that correspond with rt-induced thyroid dysfunction. methods. records of 102 patients who received rt from 2008 to 2010 were reviewed with respect to thyroid function. abnormalities were grouped in 2 ways: (1) none, transient, or permanent; and (2) overt or subclinical. results. at median follow-up of 33.5 months, incidence of any thyroid abnormality was 39.2% (women vs men - 50% vs 35%). permanent dysfunction was seen in 24.5% with higher incidence in women versus men (42.9% vs 17.6%; p = .0081). permanent abnormalities most strongly correlated with d-50% (p = .0275). v-50gy also correlated with thyroid dysfunction post-rt (p = .0316). concurrent chemotherapy increased permanent dysfunction (p = .0008). conclusion. achieving d-50% <50 gy, v-50 <50%, and mean dose <54.58 gy during rt planning may decrease the incidence; whereas female sex and concurrent chemotherapy seem to increase the risk of rt-induced hypothyroidism.

menopause	botanical estrogen (be) dietary supplements are consumed by women as substitutes for loss of endogenous estrogens at menopause. to examine the roles of estrogen receptor alpha (er alpha) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) and their crosstalk in the actions of bes, we studied gene regulation and proliferation responses to four widely used bes, genistein, daidzein, and s-equol from soy, and liquiritigen from licorice root in breast cancer and liver cells. bes and estradiol (e2), acting through era, stimulated proliferation, era chromatin binding and target-gene expression. bes but not e2, acting through ahr, bound to xenobiotic response element-containing chromatin sites and enhanced ahr target-gene expression (cyp1a1, cyp1b1). while e2 and tcdd acted quite selectively through their respective receptors, bes acted via both receptors, with their ahr activity moderated by negative crosstalk through ella. both er alpha and ahr should be considered as mediators of the biology and pharmacology of bes.

heart_disease	background: malvidin (alvidin-3-glucoside) is a polyphenol that belongs to the class of natural anthocyanin, which is abundantly found in red wines, colored fruits, and the skin of red grapes. therefore, the current investigation was intended to evaluate the effect of malvidin against myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol in the rats. material/methods: the cardioprotective effects was assessed by determining the effect of malvidin on the activities of endogenous antioxidants - catalase (cat), superoxide dismutase (sod), and glutathione peroxidase (gsh) - and on the levels of lipid peroxidation and serum marker enzymes. the serum levels of il-6 and tnf-alpha were also determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kit. result: the present study demonstrated a significant cardioprotective effect of malvidin by restoring the defensive activities of endogenous antioxidants - catalase (cat), superoxide dismutase (sod), and glutathione peroxidase (gsh) - and by reducing the levels of lipid peroxidation and serum marker enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (ld) and creatine kinase (ck). malvidin significantly ameliorated the histopathological changes and impaired mitochondria in the cardiac necrosis stimulated with isoproterenol. additionally, the results also demonstrated that nuclear translocation of nrf-2 and subsequent ho-1 expression might be associated with nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappa b) pathway activation. conclusions: our findings suggest that malvidin exerts cardioprotective effects that might be due to possible strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. therefore, this study provides the basis for the development of malvidin as a safe and effective treatment of myocardial infarction.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objective: to quantify the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) among medical students of king saud bin abdulaziz university for health sciences (ksau-hs) and to observe the association between anxiety and ibs. methods: this cross-sectional observational study conducted during academic year 2015-2016 has used two self-administered, pre-validated questionnaires: depression anxiety stress scales-21 (dass-21) and rome iii criteria. the sample size was 270, and proportional allocation was used to determine distribution of this sample across study population based on percentages of students in each academic year. convenience sampling was used to select participants. results: the overall prevalence of ibs was 21% (n=57), with a higher prevalence among females (26%, n=23) than males (19%, n=34). ibs was most and least prevalent among first-year students (14%, n=5) and fifth-year students (29%, n=21) respectively. anxiety levels were normal, mild, moderate, and severe or extremely severe in 39% (n=105), 7% (n=19), 26% (n=70), and 27%. a significant association was found between gender & ibs and anxiety levels & ibs. conclusion: the prevalence of ibs in this study was 21% and higher among females than males but were highest among fifth-year students for both genders. more than 50% of students had moderate or high levels of anxiety for both genders. the prevalence of ibs was highest among students of 5th fifth year. the study provides evidence that, as medical students of higher year of their under graduation were having higher level of anxiety which leads to ibs.
birth_control	objective: increasing use of long-acting methods of contraception, such as intrauterine devices (iuds), has been recognized as a promising strategy to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy. while men may play an important role in promoting or discouraging contraceptive use, very little research has examined men 's knowledge of and attitudes toward iuds. study design: we used data from the 903 men included in the 2009 national survey of reproductive and contraceptive knowledge to examine their awareness and knowledge of iuds and other contraceptive methods by several individual-level characteristics. results: men 's awareness and perceived knowledge of iuds is low in comparison to condoms and birth control pills. men 's perceived knowledge of iuds was lower than their objective knowledge, as measured by true/false questions about iuds, suggesting that men may be more knowledgeable of iuds than they perceive. in the multivariate models, men who were uninsured [adjusted odds ratio (aor), 0.4; 95% confidence interval (cl), 0.2-0.6], identified as christian (aor, 0.6; 95% ci, 0.3-1.0) and who had never had a sexual health visit (aor, 0.6; 95% ci, 0.4-1.0) were less likely to have heard of iuds. among men who had heard of the method, hispanic men were less likely (aor, 0.2; 95% ci, 0.1-0.5) to be more knowledgeable of the method. conclusion: young men report low awareness of iuds in comparison to other methods, and this varies by demographic characteristics including health insurance status. family planning programs should consider targeted knowledge promotion for young men, with a focus on contraceptive methods besides condoms and oral contraception.

weight_loss	background: mediastinal thymic seminomas are rare male germ cell tumors with extragonadal origin that appear predominately with a cystic appearance. case presentation: a 22-year-old male was referred to our department for further investigation of a mediastinal mass discovered incidentally during routine chest x-ray. the patient has denied any symptoms including dyspnea, chest pain, cough, fever, dysphagia, hemoptysis, weight loss, and weakness. his past medical history was remarkable for orchitis, for which he had undergone a bilateral testicular biopsy, without the latter however, indicating the presence of a germ cell tumor or a premalignant lesion. contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed a lobulated and well-marginated cystic lesion in the anterior mediastinum. differential diagnosis included mostly a multilocular thymic cyst, a lymphoma, a seminoma, or a soft tissue tumor. resection of the mass revealed a primary thymic seminoma. conclusions: a surgical approach for the management of these tumors might be reasonable considering that an extensive sampling is mandatory to gain an appropriate biopsy preoperatively in order to securely confirm or refute the presence of a mediastinal extragonadal tumor. orchitis might be a sign of a general disorder of the germ cells which might transform in time.
cancer	fatty acid synthase (fasn) is a key lipogenic enzyme for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and a druggable metabolic oncoprotein that is activated in most human cancers. we evaluated whether the her2-driven lipogenic phenotype might represent a biomarker for sensitivity to pharmacological fasn blockade. a majority of clinically her2-positive tumors were scored as fasn overexpressors in a series of almost 200 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. reclassification of her2-positive breast tumors based on fasn gene expression predicted a significantly inferior relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival in her2+/fasn+ patients. notably, non-tumorigenic mcf10a breast epithelial cells engineered to overexpress her2 upregulated fasn gene expression, and the fasn inhibitor c75 abolished her2-induced anchorage-independent growth and survival. furthermore, in the presence of high concentrations of c75, her2-negative mcf-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing her2 (mcf-7/her2) had significantly higher levels of apoptosis than her2-negative cells. finally, c75 at non-cytotoxic concentrations significantly reduced the capacity of mcf-7/her2 cells to form mammospheres, an in vitro indicator of cancer stem-like cells. collectively, our findings strongly suggest that the her2-fasn lipogenic axis delineates a group of breast cancer patients that might benefit from treatment with therapeutic regimens containing fasn inhibitors.
heart_disease	purpose of review we provide here an up-to-date perspective on the potential use of ldl particle number and size as complementary risk factors to predict and manage cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk in the clinical realm. recent findings studies show that a significant proportion of the population has discordant ldl particle number and cholesterol indices [non-hdl cholesterol (hdl-c)]. data also show that risk prediction may be improved when using information on ldl particle number in patients with discordant particle number and cholesterol data. yet, most of the current cvd guidelines conclude that ldl particle number is not superior to cholesterol indices, including non-hdl-c concentrations, in predicting cvd risk. ldl particle size, on the other hand, has not been independently associated with cvd risk after adjustment for other risk factors such as ldl cholesterol, triglycerides, and hdl-c and that routine use of information pertaining to particle size to determine and manage patients' risk is not yet justified. summary additional studies are required to settle the debate on which of cholesterol indices and ldl particle number is the best predictor of cvd risk, and if such measures should be integrated in clinical practice.
hepatitis_c	oral contraceptive pills (ocps) are an important element of hepatitis c virus (hcv) treatment in women of childbearing potential. these studies evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetic interactions between elbasvir (ebr) and grazoprevir (gzr) and ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel (ee/lng). both studies were open-label, single-site, two-period, fixed-sequence, one-way interaction studies. in period 1, subjects received one tablet of ee/lng (0.03 mg/0.15 mg). in period 2, subjects received ebr (50 mg once daily) for 13 days or gzr (200 mg once daily) for 10 days, with one tablet of ee/lng on day 7 (gzr group) or 10 (ebr group). each study enrolled 20 healthy, nonsmoking adult females. there was no clinically meaningful effect of multiple doses of ebr or gzr on the pharmacokinetics of ee or lng. geometric mean ratios (gmrs) for auc(0-a) and c-max in the presence and absence of ebr were 1.01 and 1.10 for ee and 1.14 and 1.02 for lng, with 90% confidence intervals (cis) that were contained in the interval [0.80, 1.25]. similarly, the auc(0-a) and c-max gmrs in the presence and absence of gzr were 1.10 and 1.05 for ee and 1.23 and 0.93 for lng, respectively. the 90% cis for ee auc(0-a) and for ee and lng c-max were contained in the interval [0.80, 1.25]; however, the 90% ci for the lng auc(0-a) [1.15, 1.32] slightly exceeded the upper bound. these results suggest that ebr/gzr can be co-administered to female patients with hcv of childbearing potential who are on ocps to prevent pregnancy.
skin_care	the moisturizing and potentially protective properties of the organic osmolyte betaine (trimethylglycine) have made it an attractive component for skin care products. its wide use despite the lack of comprehensive studies addressing its specific effects in skin led us to characterize the molecular targets of betaine in keratinocytes and to explore, whether it modifies the effects of acute uvb exposure. genome-wide expression analysis was performed on organotypic cultures of rat epidermal keratinocytes, treated either with betaine (10 mm), uvb (30 mj/cm(2)) or their combination. results were verified with qrt-pcr, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. additionally, cell proliferation and differentiation were analyzed. among the 89 genes influenced by betaine, the differentiation marker keratin 2 showed the highest upregulation, which was also confirmed at protein level. expression of egr1, a transcription factor, and purkinje cell protein 4, a regulator of ca2+/calmodulin metabolism, also increased, while downregulated genes included several ion-channel components, such as fxyd2. bioinformatics analyses suggest that genes modulated by betaine are involved in dna replication, might counteract uv-induced processes, and include many targets of transcription factors associated with cell proliferation and differentiation. our results indicate that betaine controls unique gene expression pathways in keratinocytes, including some involved in differentiation.

low_testosterone	objectives: testosterone deficit syndrome (tds) is a clinical and biochemical entity characterized by low testosterone levels and androgenic deprivation clinic, which can cause a decrease in the quality of life. however, today there are doubts about its diagnosis and therapeutic management. methods: bibliographic review using the medline database and detailed presentation of one clinical case. results: testosterone deficit syndrome is associated with metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipemia). currently, the performance of tds screening in all males over the age of 45 years is under discussion. we propose a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for the management of tds and erectile dysfunction. conclusions: the treatment of erectile dysfunction associated with late start hypogonadism follows the same steps tha other generic cases of erectile dysfunction.
hypothyroidism	background/aims: thyroid disease is a common comorbidity in individuals with down syndrome (ds), but historical studies have multiple limitations. we assessed thyroid abnormalities in a large cohort of children with ds. methods: retrospective records review from a single institution. calculated prevalence of common thyroid abnormalities and associations with common comorbidities. results: among 508 patients, 120 (24%) had a thyroid-related diagnosis, the majority having elevated thyrotropin treated with levothyroxine. a kaplan-meier estimate projects that 50% have thyroid disorder by adulthood, with 20% of hypothyroidism diagnosed before the age of 6 months. when tested, approximately 50% had positive antithyroid antibodies, though this rate was 100% in overt hypothyroidism. there was no association between congenital or acquired hypothyroidism and common comorbidities. conclusion: thyroid disease in ds is more common and occurs earlier than in the general population, and is often transient. thyroid disease is unrelated to gender, obesity, or other comorbidities. apart from overt hypothyroidism, much of hypothyroidism in ds appears unrelated to autoimmunity; we recommend checking of antithyroid antibodies only in select cases. an additional screen for thyroid disease between the newborn screen and the 6-month well-child visit will detect early cases of hypothyroidism who passed their newborn screen.

sports_injuries	objective:to describe rates, patterns, and causes of acute injuries in an increasingly popular outdoor sport.design:prospective cohort study.setting:one winter season ranging from november 2011 to march 2011.participants:seventy ice climbers from 13 different countries and various performance levels.main outcome measures:participants were asked to complete a monthly internet-based survey regarding their completed hours of training and competitions and eventual sustained injuries.results:during 4275 hours of ice climbing, 42 injuries occurred, of which 81.0% were defined as mild, 16.6% as moderate, and 2.4% as severe. the calculated injury rate was 9.8 injuries per 1000 hours of sports exposure. intermediate ice climbers had a significantly higher injury risk compared with advanced ice climbers (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence intervals, 1.17-5.54; p = 0.018). about 73.8% of all injuries occurred on a frozen waterfall, icicles, or icefalls, whereas 4.8% occurred on artificial ice walls. the head was the most injured body part (47.6%), followed by the knee (14.3%) and the shoulder (11.9%). the most common types of injuries were abrasions (38.1%), contusions (35.7%), and joint sprains (7.1%). falling ice was the main circumstance leading to injury (59.5%). all athletes with a head injury wore a helmet; however, only 35.0% mentioned they used protective goggles.conclusion:ice climbing is a sport with moderate risk for injury with most of the reported injuries being of minor severity. however, severe and fatal injuries, although less common, also occur. advanced ice climbers with greater experience and skill level have a lower overall injury risk.
senior_health	light exposure regulates several circadian functions in normal humans including the sleep-wake cycle. individuals with alzheimer 's disease (ad) often do not have regular patterns of activity and rest, but, rather, experience random periods of sleep and agitation during both day and night. bright light during the day and darkness at night has been shown to consolidate activity periods during the day and rest periods at night in ad patients. the important characteristics of bright light exposure (quantity, spectrum, distribution, timing and duration) for achieving these results in ad patients is not yet understood. recent research has shown that moderate (similar to18 lx at the cornea) blue (similar to470 nm) light is effective at suppressing melatonin in normal humans. it was hypothesized that blue light applied just before ad patients retire to their beds for the night would have a measurable impact on their behavior. a pilot study was conducted for 30 days in a senior health care facility using four individuals diagnosed with mild to moderate levels of dementia. four ad patients were exposed to arrays of blue light from light emitting diodes (max wavelength = 470 nm) in two-hour sessions (18:00 to 20:00 hours) for 10 days. as a control, they were exposed to red light (max wavelength = 640 nm) in two-hour sessions for 10 days prior to the blue light exposure. despite the modest sample size, exposure to blue leds has shown to affect sleep quality and median body temperature peak of these ad patients. median body temperature peak was delayed by approximately 2 hours after exposure to blue leds compared to exposure to red leds and sleep quality was improved. this pilot study demonstrated that light, especially leds, can be an important contribution to helping ad patients regulate their circadian functions.
overactive_bladder	aimsrefractory overactive bladder (oab) treatments, including sacral neuromodulation (snm), onabotulinumtoxin a (onabota), and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (ptns), differ considerably. best-worst scaling (bws) was used to assess patient preferences for these treatments. methodsa cross-sectional web survey, based on findings from qualitative interviews with 23 oab patients and 7 clinical experts, was conducted with idiopathic oab patients in the us and uk. the bws exercise involved prioritizing subsets of 13 attributes across 13 choice tasks, where patients identified the attribute they considered as best and as worst in each task. attribute bws scores, ranging from -1.0 (worst) to 1.0 (best) were calculated based on the rates that each attribute was chosen. attitudes toward the attributes also were assessed via like/dislike likert scales, and questions regarding the percentage likelihood (0-100%) of trying each treatment, based on standardized treatment descriptions. resultsthe sample included 245 patients (118 us, 127 uk); 79% female, mean age 507.8 years. all 13 attribute bws scores were significantly positive or negative. lasting improvement (0.82), minimal side effects (0.67), and sends signals between bladder and brain (0.35)' were rated most favorably, and complications with implant (-0.65), and be willing to self-catheterize (-0.53) were rated worst. all but one of the attribute bws scores were significantly correlated with the respective like/dislike scores and the percentage likelihood estimates for trying one of the three treatments. conclusionbws was successful in assessing the magnitude of patient preferences for key attributes associated with substantially different refractory oab therapies. neurourol. urodynam. 35:1028-1033, 2016.

alzheimer's_disease	developmental lead (pb) exposure is suggested in laboratory studies to be a trigger for neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer 's disease (ad). sortilin-related receptor, l (dlr class) a repeats-containing (sorl1) is a recently identified ad genetic risk factor. sorl1 has limited characterization in vertebrate models in comparison to other ad genetic risk factors. to characterize sorl1 further, protein sequence homology between humans, mice and zebrafish was analyzed and showed conservation of functional repeats and domain orientation. next, spatial expression of sorl1 in zebrafish larvae was completed and diffuse expression in neural tissue that was not restricted to the brain was observed. influences of sex and age on quantitative expression of sorl1 in the brain of adult zebrafish were then assessed. sex-specific alteration of sorl1 expression transpired during the aging process in females. the zebrafish was then utilized to investigate the impacts of a 100ppb embryonic pb exposure on sorl1 expression and other known ad genetic risk factors. sex-specific quantitative gene expression analysis was completed with adult zebrafish brain to compare those developmentally exposed to pb or a control treatment, but no significant difference in sorl1 expression or other ad genetic risk factors was observed. overall, this study provided characterization of sorl1 with changes in brain expression during aging being female-specific. this finding is in agreement with females being more prone to the onset of ad, but analysis of additional ad genetic risk factors is needed to facilitate our understanding of the impact of a 100ppb embryonic pb exposure. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
birth_control	what is the bleeding pattern during second consecutive levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (lng-ius) use? consecutive use of lng-ius is associated with a predictable bleeding pattern, characterized by the absence of the initial period of irregular bleeding seen after interval insertion of an lng-ius and a non-bleeding pattern in the vast majority of women. with increased popularity of the lng-ius for long-term birth control and treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (hmb), consecutive use of the system is becoming more frequent. one previous study showed 60% amenorrhea rate in consecutive ius users; however, the sample size was small. a prospective multicenter study in four european countries recruited women who wished to continue with lng-ius use immediately after the first 5-year period. a total of 204 women were followed up until the end of the first year of the second ius. thereafter 170 women continued into the extension phase of the study up to the full 5 years of use of the second ius and 144 women continued to the end of the study. a total of 170 women (mean age 39 years) who had been using their first lng-ius for between 4 years 3 months and 4 years 9 months, either for contraception or for treatment of hmb, and who planned to replace the device with a new lng-ius, were recruited and followed up to 5 years of the second ius use. a total of 17 centers in four european countries were involved in the study. bleeding patterns were analyzed using daily bleeding diaries using 90-day reference periods (rp) for the first year of the second ius use and for the last rp of each year during years 2-5 of use. approximately 70% of women were free of bleeding during years 2-5 and up to 49% were amenorrheic. there was a slight increase in the number of bleeding/spotting days of similar to 3 days during the first rp immediately after the placement of the second ius, whereafter the number of bleeding/spotting days returned to the level preceding the second ius insertion or below that. absence of bleeding was associated with high overall satisfaction and continuation rates. no serious adverse events assessed as related to the lng-ius use occurred during the 5-year period. the cumulative expulsion rate during the 5-year study period was 1.2%. the sample size was large enough to study bleeding patterns, and subjects are likely to represent typical consecutive ius users, and therefore, the role of chance is small. the women represent a selected group as they had already successfully used their first ius for almost 5 years and were willing to continue its use-however, this is currently a common clinical situation. the results may therefore not be extrapolated to first-time users of the lng-ius. these data are of importance when counseling women who are making decisions concerning long-term contraception.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	the esophagus and stomach are host to their own population of bacteria, which differs in health and disease. helicobacter pylori uniquely colonizes only gastric mucosa, but an increasing number of bacteria is now isolated from the gastric juice and gastric mucosa, including lactobacillus. the presence of h pylori alters populations of other gastric bacteria with a marked reduction in diversity. alterations in intragastric acidity may be the cause or the consequence of changes in the microbial populations of the stomach. esophageal inflammation is associated with an altered microbiota in gastroesophageal reflux disease, barrett 's esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, and cancer.
menopause	although the positive effects of vaginal estrogens and the selective estrogen receptor modulator, ospemifene (os), on the vaginal epithelium are well recognized, less is known regarding the effects of these therapies on the lower urinary tract or vaginal muscularis. clinical evidence suggests that vaginally administered estrogenmay improve overactive bladder-related symptoms. the objective of this study was to compare the effects of os, vaginal conjugated equine estrogens (cee), or both on the vaginal wall and lower urinary tract in a rat model of menopause. contractile force of the bladder neck, dome, and external urethral sphincter at optimal field stimulation did not differ significantly among treatment groups. pharmacologic responses to atropine, carbachol, and potassium chloride were similar among groups. vaginal epithelial thickness and differentiation were differentially regulated by cee or os. ospemifene altered epithelial differentiation pathways in vaginal epithelium in a unique way, and these effects were additive with local cee. unless contraindicated, the beneficial effects of vaginal cee on the vaginal wall outweigh those of os. summary sentence although ospemifene has no effect on the lower urinary tract, it alters vaginal epithelium in a unique way that is additive with local estrogen.
parenting	the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between food-related parenting practices and child fruit, vegetable, and high fat/sugar food preferences. parents (n = 148) of children (3-7 years old) completed the comprehensive feeding practices questionnaire (cfpq), the preschool adapted food liking scale (pals), and answered demographic questions. separate linear regressions were conducted to test relationships between the different food categories on pals (fruits, vegetables, and high fat/sugar foods) and each food-related parenting practice using race, ethnicity, and income level, and child age and gender as covariates. it was found that when a parent allows a child to control eating, it was negatively associated with a child 's preference for fruit (beta= -0.15, p = 0.032) and parent encouragement of child involvement in meal preparation was positively related to child preference for vegetables (beta = 0.14, p = 0.048). children preferred high fat and sugar foods more if parents used food to regulate child emotions (beta = 0.24, p = 0.007), used food as a reward (beta = 0.32, p < 0.001), pressured the child to eat more food (beta = 0.16, p = 0.045), and restricted unhealthy food (beta = 0.20, p = 0.024). conversely, children preferred high fat and sugar foods less if parents made healthy food available in the home (beta = -0.13, p = 0.05), modeled healthy eating in front of the child (beta= -0.21, p = 0.021), and if parents explained why healthy foods should be consumed (beta = -0.24, p = 0.011). although it cannot be determined if the parent is influencing the child or vice versa, this study provides some evidence that coercive feeding practices are detrimental to a child 's food preferences.(c) 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
multiple_sclerosis	objective: to define values of normalized brain volume (nbv) that can be categorized as low, medium, or high, according to baseline characteristics of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) patients. methods: expected nbv (enbv) was calculated for each patient based on age, disease duration, sex, baseline expanded disability status scale (edss), and t2-lesion volume, entering these variables into a multiple regression model run on 2342 rrms patients (pooled freedoms/freedoms-ii population). according to the difference between their observed nbv and their enbv, patients were classified as having low nbv, medium nbv, or high nbv. we evaluated whether these nbv categories were clinically meaningful by assessing correlation with disability worsening. results: the distribution of differences between observed nbv and enbv was used to categorize patients as having low nbv, medium nbv or high nbv. taking the high-nbv group as reference, the hazard ratios (hrs) for 2-year disability worsening, adjusted for treatment effect, were 1.23 (95% confidence interval (ci): 0.92-1.63, p = 0.16) for the medium nbv and 1.75 (95% ci: 1.26-2.44, p = 0.001) for the low nbv. the predictive value of nbv groups was preserved over 4 years. treatment effect appeared more evident in low-nbv patients (hr = 0.58) than in medium-nbv (hr = 0.72) and in high-nbv (hr = 0.80) patients; however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.57). conclusion: rrms patients can be categorized into disability risk groups based on individual enbv values according to baseline demographics and clinical characteristics.
polycythemia_vera	although the median survival in polycythemia vera (pv) is 14 years, mortality is higher than in an age- and sex-matched population. this study included 3941 pv patients diagnosed between 2000-2012 from surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer) 13 registry to determine 5-year survival and the incidence of second primary malignancies (spm). the actuarial 5 year survival in the overall cohort was 79.5%. the cumulative incidence of spm was 13.1% at 10 years. spms occurred at a standardized incidence ratio (sir) of 1.29 (95% ci = 1.16-1.43; p < 0.001) with an absolute excess risk (aer) of 42.49 per 10 000 population. a significantly higher risk was noted for acute myeloid leukemia (sir = 12.24; 95% ci = 8.17-17.8; p-value < 0.001) and chronic myeloid leukemia (sir = 10.66; 95% ci = 3.75-19.6; p-value < 0.001). patients with pv are at a high risk of spm and leukemic transformation, which may compromise long-term survival.
heart_disease	background: smoking cessation following hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (acs) significantly reduces subsequent mortality. depressed mood is a major barrier to cessation post-acs. although existing counseling treatments address smoking and depression independently in acs patients, no integrated treatment addresses both. we developed an integrated treatment combining gold standard cessation counseling with behavioral activation-based mood management; behavioral activation treatment for cardiac smokers (bat-cs). the purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of bat-cs vs. standard of care (sc). methods: participants were recruited during hospitalization for acs and were randomly assigned to bat-cs or sc. the nicotine patch was offered in both conditions. smoking, mood, and stress outcomes were collected at end-of-treatment and 24-week follow-up. results: fifty-nine participants (28 bat-cs, 31 sc) were recruited over 42 weeks, and assessment completion was above 80% in both conditions. treatment acceptability and fidelity were high. at 24 week follow-up adjusted odds ratios favoring bat-cs were 1.27 (95% ci: 0.41-3.93) for 7-day point prevalence abstinence and 1.27 (95% ci: 0.42-3.82) for continuous abstinence. time to first smoking lapse was significantly longer in bat-cs (62.4 vs. 31.8 days, p = 0.03). at 24-weeks, effect sizes for mood and stress outcomes ranged from eta(2)(partial) of. 07-.11, with significant between treatment effects for positive affect, negative affect, and stress. conclusions: the design of this study proved feasible and acceptable. results provide preliminary evidence that combining behavioral activation with standard smoking cessation counseling could be efficacious for this high risk population. a larger trial with longer follow-up is warranted.
polycythemia_vera	gitelman 's syndrome (gs) is characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, and neurological symptoms. the association of gs with type 1 diabetes is rare, described only in a few case reports. we report a patient with an unusual combination of gs and type 1 diabetes mellitus with erythrocytosis. a 26-year-old male with gs and type 1 diabetes, who was on intensive insulin therapy with poor compliance, presented with the complaint of headache. on physical examination, his blood pressure was 120/70 mmhg and there was no neurological deficit or proximal muscle weakness. he had no previous medical history of obstructive sleep apnea, heart or lung disease. he had negative smoking history. his laboratory tests revealed erythrocytosis with a hemoglobin level of 18.9 g/dl (13.6-17.2 g/dl) and a hematocrit level of 54.8% (39.5-50.3%). cranial magnetic resonance imaging was normal. he had no evidence of hypovolemia. hematological workout excluded polycythemia vera and chronic myeloid neoplasm. a bone marrow aspiration revealed a hypercellular marrow with increased erythroid precursors, megakaryocytes and granulocytes. the reticulin stain grade was zero. there was no iron accumulation with iron stain. there was no radiologic evidence of any kind of erythropoietin-producing tumors. his echocardiography was normal. serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels and endogenous androgens were within normal limits. after 2 therapeutic phlebotomies, his symptoms improved and his hemoglobin was 16.1 mg/dl. our patient, besides having gs and type 1 diabetes, was complicated with idiopathic erythrocytosis, all having deleterious effects on hemodynamic status of the patient.
heart_disease	group,a streptococci (gas) cause a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from benign pharyngitis and skin infections to severe invasive disease and the immune sequelae rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. pharyngitis, one of the most frequent diseases caused by gas, is highly prevalent in school-age children in temperate climates and a major cause of antibiotic use. an efficacious vaccine would reduce disease burden associated with pharyngitis and the need of care for sick children. importantly, gas pharyngitis is recognised as the main precursor for acute rheumatic fever so a vaccine that is efficacious against gas pharyngitis should also prevent acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. it may also prevent post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and invasive disease since gas pharyngitis is one of the precursors for these clinical syndromes. there has been no clearly articulated pathway for clinical trial design leading to gas vaccine registration. this review outlines a clinical development strategy detailing the phases of development required for registration of a candidate gas vaccine for gas pharyngitis initially, followed by impetigo and associated sequelae. the major advantages of a strategy first focused on gas pharyngitis is an early proof of principle, that can be followed by studies for other clinical syndromes. the end goal being the availability of a preventive tool for the most prevalent gas-associated diseases globally.

headache	until 2014, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin was the recommended standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection in india. this open-label phase 3b study, conducted across 14 sites in india between 31 march 2014 and 30 november 2015, evaluated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy among treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 or 3 hcv infection. a total of 117 patients with genotype 1 or 3 hcv infection were randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir 400mg and weight-based ribavirin (1000 or 1200mg) daily for 16 or 24weeks. among those with genotype 1 infection, the primary efficacy endpoint of sustained virologic response at 12weeks post-treatment (svr12) was reported in 90% (95% confidence intervals [ci], 73-98) and 96% (95% ci, 82-100) of patients following 16 and 24weeks of treatment, respectively. for patients with genotype 3 infection, svr12 rates were 100% (95% ci, 88-100) and 93% (95% ci, 78-99) after 16 and 24weeks of therapy, respectively. adverse events, most of which were mild or moderate in severity, occurred in 69% and 57% of patients receiving 16 and 24weeks of treatment, respectively. the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were asthenia, headache and cough. only one patient in the 24-week group discontinued treatment with sofosbuvir during this study. overall, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy achieved svr12 rates 90% and was well tolerated among treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 or 3 hcv infection in india.
multiple_sclerosis	the immune function of amigo2 is currently unknown. here, we revealed novel roles of amigo2 in modulating t-cell functions and eae using amigo2-knockout (amg2k0) mice. amigo2 was abundantly expressed by murine t helper (th) cells. its deficiency impaired transplanted t-cell infiltration into the secondary lymphoid organs and dampened th-cell activation, but promoted splenic th-cell proliferation and abundancy therein. amg2k0 th cells had respectively elevated t-bet in th1- and gata-3 in th2-lineage during early th-cell differentiation, accompanied with increased ifn-gamma and il-10 but decreased il-17a production. amg2k0 mice exhibited ameliorated eae, dampened spinal t-cell accumulation, decreased serum il-17a levels and enhanced splenic il-10 production. adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic amg2k0 t cells induced milder eae and dampened spinal th-cell accumulation and tnf expression. mechanistically, amigo2-overexpression in 293t cells dampened nf-kb transcriptional activity, while amigo2-deficiency enhanced akt but suppressed gsk-3 beta phosphorylation and promoted nuclear translocations of nf-kb and nfat1 in th-cells. collectively, our data demonstrate that amigo2 is important in regulating t-cell functions and eae, and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis.

allergies	background: rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life is often reduced during seasonal allergies. the mini rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (mrqlq) is a validated tool used to measure quality of life in people experiencing allergies (0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled). probiotics may improve quality of life during allergy season by increasing the percentage of regulatory t cells (tregs) and inducing tolerance. objective: the objective of this study was to determine whether consuming lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and b. longum mm-2 compared with placebo would result in beneficial effects on mrqlq scores throughout allergy season in individuals who typically experience seasonal allergies. secondary outcomes included changes in immune markers as part of a potential mechanism for changes in mrqlq scores. design: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial, 173 participants (mean +/- sem: age 27 +/- 1 y) who self-identified as having seasonal allergies received either a probiotic (2 capsules/d, 1.5 billion colony-forming units/capsule) or placebo during spring allergy season for 8 wk. mrqlq scores were collected weekly throughout the study. fasting blood samples were taken from a subgroup (placebo, n = 37; probiotic, n = 35) at baseline and week 6 (predicted peak of pollen) to determine serum immunoglobulin (ig) e concentrations and treg percentages. results: the probiotic group reported an improvement in the mrqlq global score from baseline to pollen peak (-0.68 +/- 0.13) when compared with the placebo group (-0.19 +/- 0.14; p = 0.0092). both serum total ige and the percentage of tregs increased from baseline to week 6, but changes were not different between groups. conclusions: this combination probiotic improved rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life during allergy season for healthy individuals with self-reported seasonal allergies; however, the associated mechanism is still unclear. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials. gov as nct02349711.
cancer	the aim of this study was to determine the polyphenols, glucosinolates and ascorbic acid content as well as antioxidant activity of beverages on the base of apple juice with addition of frozen and freeze-dried curly kale leaves. upon enrichment with frozen (13%) and freeze-dried curly kale (3%), the naturally cloudy apple juice was characterized by an increase in phenolic compounds by 2.7 and 3.3-times, accordingly. the antioxidant activity of beverages with the addition of curly kale ranged from 6.6 to 9.4 p.mol trolox/ml. the obtained beverages were characterized glucosinolates content at 117.6-167.6 mg/l and ascorbic acid content at 4,1-31,9 mg/l. the results of sensory evaluation of colour, taste and consistency of apple juice and beverages with the addition of kale did not differ significantly prior to pasteurization (p <= 0.05), whereas after the pasteurization the evaluated factors decreased significantly.

overactive_bladder	objective: traditionally, urodynamic studies (uds) have been used to assess lower urinary tract symptoms (luts), but their routine use is now discouraged. while urodynamic stress incontinence is strongly associated with the symptom of stress urinary incontinence (sui) and a positive cough test, there is a weak relationship between symptoms of overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity (do). the aim of our study was to develop a model to predict do in women with luts. study design: this prospective study included consecutive women with luts attending a urodynamic clinic. all women underwent a comprehensive clinical and urodynamic assessment. the effect of each variable on the odds of do was estimated both by univariate analysis and adjusted analysis using logistic regression. results: 1006 women with luts were included in the study with 374 patients (37%) diagnosed with do. the factors considered to be the best predictors of do were urgency urinary incontinence, urge rating/void and parity (p-value= 2 scores 2; previous continence surgery scores -1; presence of sui scores -1; and the complaint of vaginal bulging scores -1. if a criterion is absent, then the score is 0 and the total score can vary from a value of -3 to +10. the receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis for the overall cut-off points revealed an area under the curve of 0.748 (95%ci 0.741, 0.755). conclusion: this model is able to predict do more accurately than a symptomatic diagnosis alone, in women with luts. the introduction of this scoring system as a screening tool into clinical practice may reduce the need for expensive and invasive tests to diagnose do, but cannot replace uds completely.

hepatitis_c	hepatitis c virus (hcv) is an enveloped rna virus belonging to the flaviviridae family. it infects mainly human hepatocytes and causes chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis and cancer. hcv encodes two envelope proteins, e1 and e2, that form a heterodimer and mediate virus entry. while e2 has been extensively studied, less has been done so for e1, and its role in the hcv life cycle still needs to be elucidated. here we developed a new cell culture model for hcv infection based on the trans-complementation of e1. virus production of the hcv genome lacking the e1-encoding sequence can be efficiently rescued by the ectopic expression of e1 in trans. the resulting virus, designated hcv.e1, can propagate in packaging cells expressing e1 but results in only single-cycle infection in naive cells. by using the hcv.e1 system, we explored the role of a putative fusion peptide (fp) of e1 in hcv infection. interestingly, we found that the fp not only contributes to hcv entry, as previously reported, but also may be involved in virus morphogenesis. finally, we identified amino acid residues in fp that are critical for biological functions of e1. in summary, our work not only provides a new cell culture model for studying hcv but also provides some insights into understanding the role of e1 in the hcv life cycle. importance hepatitis c virus (hcv), an enveloped rna virus, encodes two envelope proteins, e1 and e2, that form a heterodimeric complex to mediate virus entry. compared to e2, the biological functions of e1 in the virus life cycle are not adequately investigated. here we developed a new cell culture model for single-cycle hcv infection based on the trans-complementation of e1. the hcv genome lacking the e1-encoding sequence can be efficiently rescued for virus production by the ectopic expression of e1 in trans. this new model renders a unique system to dissect functional domains and motifs in e1. using this system, we found that a putative fusion peptide in e1 is a multifunctional structural element contributing to both hcv entry and morphogenesis. our work has provided a new cell culture model to study hcv and provides insights into understanding the biological roles of e1 in the hcv life cycle.
allergies	mycotoxins, the secondary metabolites of fungal species, are the most frequently occurring natural food contaminants in human and animal diets. risk assessment of mycotoxins focused as yet on their mutagenic, genotoxic and potential carcinogenic effects. recently, there is an increasing awareness of the adverse effects of various mycotoxins on vulnerable structures in the intestines. in particular, an impairment of the barrier function of the epithelial lining cells and the sealing tight junction proteins has been noted, as this could result in an increased translocation of luminal antigens and pathogens and an excessive activation of the immune system. the current review aims to provide a summary of the available evidence regarding direct effects of various mycotoxins on the intestinal epithelial barrier. available data, based on different cellular and animal studies, show that food-associated exposure to certain mycotoxins, especially trichothecenes and patulin, affects the intestinal barrier integrity and can result in an increased translocation of harmful stressors. it is therefore hypothesized that human exposure to certain mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol, as the major trichothecene, may play an important role in etiology of various chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and in the prevalence of food allergies, particularly in children.
diabetes	objective: the purpose of this study was to measure immunohistochemically the expression of elf5 protein in term human and rat placentas and in human placentas associated with gestational diabetes (gd) and intrauterine growth restriction (iugr).methods: the results were quantitated stereologically using the stereological variable of volume density. a semiquantitative analysis was performed independently by a certified pathologist.results: total expression of elf5 protein was higher in pathological pregnancies than in corresponding control term placentas, with both methods of quantifications showing similar results. in addition, elf5 expression was also higher in connective tissue and blood vessels in chorionic villi in iugr placentas (but not in gd placentas) compared to healthy controls. elf5 is higher in placenta as a whole and in most of its components in both pathologies. the two exceptions are chorionic plates in iugr and decidua in gd, where its expression is lower than in healthy controls.conclusions: we have shown that iugr and gd are associated with significantly increased levels of elf5 protein in placentas, which suggests that elf5 may play an important role in normal placentation. however, these are term placentas and to study elf5 in premature births would give better insight into human placentation in health and disease.
diabetes	metabolic syndrome defines a cluster of interrelated risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. these factors include metabolic abnormalities, such as hyperglycemia, elevated triglyceride levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and obesity, mainly central adiposity. in this context, extracellular vesicles (evs) may represent novel effectors that might help to elucidate disease-specific pathways in metabolic disease. indeed, evs (a terminology that encompasses microparticles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies) are emerging as a novel mean of cell-to-cell communication in physiology and pathology because they represent a new way to convey fundamental information between cells. these microstructures contain proteins, lipids, and genetic information able to modify the phenotype and function of the target cells. evs carry specific markers of the cell of origin that make possible monitoring their fluctuations in the circulation as potential biomarkers inasmuch their circulating levels are increased in metabolic syndrome patients. because of the mixed components of evs, the content or the number of evs derived from distinct cells of origin, the mode of cell stimulation, and the ensuing mechanisms for their production, it is difficult to attribute specific functions as drivers or biomarkers of diseases. this review reports recent data of evs from different origins, including endothelial, smooth muscle cells, macrophages, hepatocytes, adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and finally, those from microbiota as bioeffectors of message, leading to metabolic syndrome. depicting the complexity of the mechanisms involved in their functions reinforce the hypothesis that evs are valid biomarkers, and they represent targets that can be harnessed for innovative therapeutic approaches.
heart_disease	background: although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin t (hs-ctnt) are associated with incident heart failure (hf) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. evaluating the association of hs-ctnt with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a hf prevention strategy. methods: we measured hs-ctnt at baseline among 4986 participants in mesa (multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (cvd). cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. repeat cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim cvd events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. progression of subclinical cvd was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. associations of hs-ctnt with incident hf, cv-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using cox regression models. results: late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim cvd events by follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance. a graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-ctnt categories and late gadolinium enhancement (>= 7.42 ng/l versus <limit of detection [12% (highest category versus= 8.81 ng/l versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% ci, 2.97-10.68). conclusions: hs-ctnt levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in cvd-free adults, findings that may precede hf symptoms by years. minor elevations of hs-ctnt may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac disease, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background/aims irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort accompanied by abnormal bowel movements. in sensitized subjects, ingested nickel (ni) may induce gastrointestinal symptoms similar to ibs, in addition to typical systemic cutaneous lesions (systemic nickel allergy syndrome [snas]). a low nickel diet could improve the systemic manifestations. we evaluated prevalence of nickel allergy in ibs and effects of low ni diet on (1) gastrointestinal symptoms control, (2) intestinal barrier function, (3) quality of life, and (4) psychological status of patients with ibs and ni-sensitized patients. methods twenty consecutive patients affected by ibs and suspected snas underwent intestinal permeability tests. gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the visual analogue scale before and after 3 months low ni diet. subjects with increased intestinal permeability at baseline repeated nuclear examination after the diet. results the most frequent profile was diarrhea-predominant ibs (8/20). the low ni diet induced a significant and constant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and an equally significant improvement of visual analogue scale. mean urinary output of (51)chromium ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetate (cr-51-edta) was 5.91%/24 hr ( +/- 2.08), significantly different from the control group (2.20%/24 hr +/- 0.60, p < 0.0001). conclusion this pilot study shows that low ni diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with ibs and snas.
skin_care	most nursing homes lack information technology (it) for supporting clinical work in spite of its potential to improve the safety, quality, and efficiency of nursing home care in the united states. increased attention to medical error and concern for patient safety have prompted general recommendations to develop sophisticated technologies to support clinical decision making at the point of care, to promote data standards in electronic records, and to develop systems that communicate with each other. however, little is known about what it applications best support communication and risk assessment practices to improve resident outcomes in nursing homes. thus, the overall aim of this study was to evaluate how differences in it sophistication in nursing homes impact communication and use of technology related to skin care and pressure ulcers. we used a mixed method approach to conduct case studies on two nursing homes one with high it sophistication and one with low it sophistication. observational analysis and social network analysis were used to identify patterns in communication types and locations; also, focus groups were conducted to explore communication strategies used by certified nursing assistants (cnas) to support pressure ulcer prevention practices. overall, results from social network analysis of observational data indicate that direct interactions between cnas and registered nurses (rns) or licensed practical nurses (lpns) were more frequent in the low it sophistication home and occurred in more centralized locations (e.g. the nursing station) compared to the high it sophistication home. moreover, these findings are supported by focus group results, which indicate that the high it sophistication home had more robust and integrated communication strategies (both it and non it) that may allow for interactions throughout the facility and require less frequent face to face interactions between cnas and rns or lpns to verify orders or report patient status. results from this study provide insight into the design and assessment of different forms of communication to support clinical work in nhs. relevance to industry: nurses bear great burdens for nursing home care; yet, issues persist with poor quality, variable performance of caregiving, and lack of implementation of proven care interventions. one new hope for improvement in nursing home care is the introduction of it to improve communication, clinical decision-making, and quality of care.

diabetes	background: the prognostic role of hypertension on long-term survival after percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) is limited and inconsistent. we hypothesize that hypertension increases long-term mortality after pci.methods: we analyzed data from scaar (swedish coronary angiography and angioplasty registry) for all consecutive patients admitted coronary care units in sweden between january 1995 and may 2013 and who underwent pci due to st-elevation myocardial infarction (stemi), non-st-elevation myocardial infarction (nstemi)/unstable angina (ua) or stable angina pectoris. we used cox proportional-hazards regression for statistical modelling on complete-case data as well as on imputed data sets. we used interaction test to evaluate possible effect-modulation of hypertension on risk estimates in several pre-specified subgroups: age categories, gender, diabetes, smoking and indication for pci (stemi, nstemi/ua and stable angina).results: during the study period, 175,892 consecutive patients underwent coronary angiography due to stemi, nstemi/ua or stable angina. 78,100 (44%) of these had hypertension. median follow-up was 5.5 years. after adjustment for differences in patient 's characteristics, hypertension was associated with increased risk for mortality (hr 1.12, 95% ci 1.09-1.15, p<.001). in subgroup analysis, risk was highest in patients less than 65 years, in smokers and in patients with stemi. the risk was lowest in patients with stable angina (p<.001 for interaction test).conclusion: hypertension is associated with higher mortality in patients with stemi, nstemi/ua or stable angina who are treated with pci.
hypothyroidism	introduction. abnormal thyroid function affect spermato-genesis and male infertility. for men, the aromatase deficiency can cause infertility. in this study, the aim is to investigate the effect of maternal hypothyroidism on offspring testicular morphology and cytochrome-p450-aromatase (p450arom) immunoreactivity. materials and methods. eighteen wistar albino pregnant rats were divided into three groups, namely a, b and k groups. hypothyroidism was induced by adding 0.01% of propyl thiouracil (ptu) in drinking water. hypothyroid mothers, group a: given ptu for 21 days during pregnancy, group b: given ptu for 21 days prior to pregnancy; control mothers, group k, given only water. hypothyroid and control group mothers' pups at postnatal day (pnd) 15 and 60 were sacrificed. we determined immunoreactivity intensity of p450arbm and mrna levels by rt-pcr performed in the testis tissues. elisa method was used for thyroid function tests for t3, t4 and tsh. structure of seminiferous tubule was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. results. it was seen that the aromatase expression in 15-day-old maternal hypothyroid groups was similar to the one in the control group while there was a decline in the aromatase expression of 60-day-old groups. as for mrna, it was determined that it had a tendency to increase over time in all groups but this increase was not significant. the tubule diameter and johnsen 's testicular biopsy score diminished in all hypothyroid groups in comparison to the control group. conclusion. the changes that occur in the early period of testis development due to maternal hypothyroidism negatively affect testis development in the next stages of life. this situation leads to a decline in aromatase expression in the following years.
birth_control	study objective: to examine differences in factors associated with contraceptive use between younger and older adolescent age groups, which has not previously been well described. design: age group-specific analyses were performed on cross-sectional survey data to identify factors associated with any contraceptive use at last sex among younger (14- to 16-year-old) and older (17- to 19-year-old) sexually active african american female adolescents; interaction analyses were used to assess whether these associations differed by age. setting: adolescent reproductive health clinic in atlanta, georgia. participants: sexually active african american female adolescents 14-19 years of age. interventions: no intervention tested; cross-sectional design. main outcome measure: self-reported contraceptive use during most recent vaginal sex with a male partner. results: the prevalence of contraceptive use at last sex was identical in both groups; however, factors associated with contraceptive use differed according to age. the only factor associated with contraceptive use in both age groups was involvement in decisions about sexual health in the most recent relationship. associations between factors and contraceptive use significantly differed according to age. history of sexually transmitted infection, age difference with partner, discussion of condoms with partner, and concurrent partners were important factors among younger adolescents; worry about pregnancy and discussion of birth control with partner were important among older adolescents. conclusion: factors associated with contraceptive use at last sex differ according to adolescent age; this should be considered when designing counseling and interventions for teens, as well as research.
headache	background: the periaqueductal gray (pag) dysfunction was recognized in migraine, and the altered dysfunction of pag subregions were not totally detected up to now. the aim of this study is to investigate the altered functional connectivity of pag subregions in em patients. methods: the brain structural images and resting state functional mr imaging (rs-fmri) data were obtained from 18 normal controls (nc) and 18 em patients on 3.0 t mr system. seven subregions of pag were classified as bilateral ventrolateral pag (vlpag), lateral pag (lpag), dorsolateral pag (dlpag) and dorsomedial pag (dmpag). the functional connectivity maps of each pag subregion were calculated, and two sample t-test was applied with age and sex as covariables. results: bilateral vlpag and left dlpag presented decreased functional connectivity, and the other subregions (bilateral lpags, right dlpag and dmpag) showed no significant altered functional connectivity in em compared with nc. the brain regions with decreased functional connectivity mainly located in bilateral prefrontal cortex(pfc), middle temporal gyrus, primary motor area (pma) and supplementary motor area (sma) and right ventrolateral pfc (vlpfc) in em patients in this study. disease duration was positively related to the functional connectivity of bilateral vlpag on the bilateral thalamus and putamen, left pallidum and right medial orbitofrontal gyrus in em patients. conclusion: the present study suggested that the dysfunction of bilateral vlpag and left dlpag presented in em, and functional evaluation of pag subregions may be help for the diagnosis and understanding of em pathogenesis.
menopause	objectives: the objective of this prospective comparative cohort study was to establish the effectiveness and safety of erbium: yag (er:yag) laser treatment for genitourinary syndrome of menopause and to compare it with an established topical estriol treatment. methods: fifty patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause were divided into two groups. the estriol group received a treatment of 0.5mg estriol ovules for 8 weeks and the laser group was first treated for 2 weeks with 0.5mg estriol ovules 3 times per week to hydrate the mucosa and then received three sessions with 2,940 nm er: yag laser in non-ablative mode. biopsies were taken before and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. maturation index, maturation value and ph where recorded up to 12-months post-treatment, while the vas analysis of symptoms was recorded up to 18 months post-treatment. results: statistically significant (p < 0.05), reduction of all assessed symptoms was observed in the laser group at all follow-ups up to 18 months post-treatment. significant improvement in maturation value and a decrease of ph in the laser group was detected up to 12 months after treatment. the improvement in all endpoints was more pronounced and longer lasting in the laser group. histological examination showed changes in the tropism of the vaginal mucosa and also angiogenesis, congestion, and restructuring of the lamina propria in the laser group. side effects were minimal and of transient nature in both groups, affecting 4% of patients in the laser group and 12% of patients in the estriol group. conclusions: our results show that er:yag laser treatment successfully relieves symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause and that the results are more pronounced and longer lasting compared to topical estriol treatment.

skin_care	background: pressure ulcer formation continues to be problematic in acute care settings, especially intensive care units (icus). our institution developed a program for early mobility in the icu using specially trained nursing aides. the goal was to impact hospital-acquired pressure ulcers incidence as well as factors associated with icu deconditioning by using specially trained personnel to perform the acute early mobility interventions. methods: a 5-point mobility scale was developed and used to establish a patients' highest level of activity achievable during evaluation. a mobility team was created consisting of skin-care prevention/mobility nurses and a new category of worker called a patient mobility assistant. each level has a corresponding plan of care (intervention) that was followed and adjusted according to the patient 's progress and nursing evaluation. data collection included the type of interventions at each encounter, mobility and skin assessments, new hospital-acquired pressure ulcer, the current mobility level, braden score, rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia, icu length of stay, and hospital readmission. staff was also surveyed about their attitudes toward mobilization and perception of mobility barriers; a prepilot and a postpilot survey were planned. results: during the 1-year study interval, 3233 patients were enrolled from the medical intensive care unit (micu). the 2011 preimplementation micu hospital-acquired pressure ulcer rate was 9.2%. after 1 year of employing the mobility team, there was a statistically significant decrease in the micu hospital-acquired pressure ulcer rate to 6.1% (p =.0405). hospital readmission of micu patients also significantly decreased from 17.1% to 11.5% (p =.0010). the mean micu length of stay decreased by 1 day. there were no safety issues directly or indirectly associated with these interventions. conclusions: use of this mobility program resulted in a 3% decrease in the most recalcitrant patients in the micu. this corresponds to a decrease of 1.2 per 1000 patient days. it is definitely both statistically and clinically significant. we believe this lays the groundwork for further work in this area. we have shown that properly trained nonlicensed professionals can safely and effectively mobilize patients in the icu setting. this can represent a cost-effective way to introduce early mobility in the icu setting.

headache	introduction: vaccination against salmonella typhi is one of the leading public health interventions reducing the risk of typhoid fever. there are two available licensed vaccines, vivotif, oral live attenuated, and typhim vi, intramuscular vi capsular polysaccharide. the us military is a high risk travel population commonly vaccinated for s. typhi. we describe the use of s. typhi vaccination in this population and the acute reactogenicity profile of these vaccines. methods: data were obtained from the defense medical surveillance system and vaccination identified between 1998 and 2011 from vaccination codes. clinical outcomes were assessed for four weeks post vaccination. adverse event rates and odds ratios were estimated across the two vaccine types. results: a total of 1.9 million predominately male military personnel received 3.6 million s. typhi vaccinations with 94.3% of vaccinees receiving the vi capsule vaccine though variability in the vaccine administered was observed. receipt of other vaccinations in the 6 months surrounding the s. typhi vaccine was common. rates of nausea (195 per 100,000 vaccinations), headache (13 per 100,000 vaccinations) and fever (40 per 100,000 vaccinations) were significantly higher following vi capsule vaccination compared to receipt of vivotif (130, 2, 10 per 100,000 vaccinations, respectively). in contrast the rates of rash and non-infectious diarrhea (186 and 426 per 100,000 vaccinations, respectively) were increased in those receiving vivotif compared to the vi, capsule vaccine. discussion: the us military is a major consumer of s. typhi vaccines. the parenterally administered vaccine appears to be more amenable, though we were limited in our ability to assess the reasons for its higher usage. while we observed a higher rate of several adverse events in subjects receiving the intramuscular vaccination, the overall rate of these events was low. future studies assessing more long-term health outcomes are warranted. published by elsevier ltd.
multiple_sclerosis	therapies with both immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties are thought to have the greatest promise in reducing the severity and progression of multiple sclerosis (ms). several reactive oxygen (ros) and reactive nitrogen species (rns) are implicated in inflammatory-mediated damage to the central nervous system (cns) in ms and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae). tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-n-oxyl) is a stable nitroxide radical with potent antioxidant activity. the goal of our studies was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects and therapeutic potential of orally-delivered tempol in the mouse eae model. mice receiving tempol chow ad libitum for 2 weeks prior to induction of active eae showed delayed onset and reduced incidence of disease compared to control-fed animals. reduced disease severity was associated with limited microglial activation and fewer inflammatory infiltrates. tempol 's effects were immunomodulatory, not immunosuppressive: t cells produced less interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and tempol-fed mice exhibited a shift towards t(h)2-type antibody responses. both myeloid and myeloid-dendritic cells of tempol-fed eae animals had significantly lower levels of mhc class ii expression than controls; cd40 was also significantly reduced. tempol administration was associated with an enrichment of cd8(+) t cell populations and cd4(+)foxp(3)(+); regulatory populations. tempol reduced the severity of clinical disease when administered after the induction of disease, and also after the onset of clinical symptoms. to exclude effects on t cell priming in vivo, tempol was tested with the passive transfer of encephalitogenic t cells and was found to reduce the incidence and peak severity of disease. protection was associated with reduced infiltrates and a relative sparing of neurofilaments and axons. the ability of oral tempol to reduce inflammation and axonal damage and loss demonstrate both anti-inflammatory and protective properties, with significant promise for the treatment of ms and related neurological disorders.

weight_loss	in this study, wear mechanisms of al6061-cnt nanocomposites produced by cryomilling and mechanical milling, cold compacting and extrusion have been studied. the wear maps showed that the maximum amount of abrasive wear region in all milling times, was observed for the cryomilling samples. also these maps show that the abrasive wear region for the cryomilling and mechanical milling was maximized at 12 h milling time. for cryomilled samples with 8 h milling time or more, the weight loss decreases with increasing sliding speed at normal loads of 5 and 10 n, also abrasive wear mechanism was observed at above conditions. cryomilled samples show increased resistance against delamination and crack initiation during wear test.
heart_disease	we report a case of sudden unexpected death of a young woman who was found in a bathtub of hot water. the autopsy concluded that all possible causes of sudden loss of consciousness, except cardiac origin, could be excluded. however, the heart did not show any obvious pathological changes. we used next-generation dna sequencing (ngs) to examine 73 genes and detected 3 rare, potentially pathogenic variants with minor allele frequencies <= 1.0%. the pathogenicity of these variants was evaluated using 8 in silico predictive algorithms, and scn5a_p. gly289ser, cacnb2_p. ser502leu, and myh11_p.lys1573glu were detected as possible pathogenic variants. inherited heart disease is a likely cause of sudden unexpected deaths of young people in hot baths, even before the clinical manifestation of the disease. in the future, molecular analysis by ngs may help to predict young to early middle-aged people who could be at risk of sudden arrhythmogenic fatality in hot baths.
hepatitis_c	introduction: hepatitis c virus (hcv) infects nearly 170 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of progressive liver damage, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. curative therapies have historically relied on interferon-based treatments and were limited by significant toxicity and poor response rates, particularly among patients with prior treatment failure and advanced hepatic fibrosis. the recent advent of direct acting antiviral (daa) agents which target key steps in the hcv viral life cycle has transformed the landscape of hcv treatment by offering highly effective and well tolerated interferon-free treatments. however, current therapies are genotype-specific and have variable efficacy amongst less prevalent hcv variants.areas covered: this review covers the preclinical and clinical development of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (sof/vel), an interferon-free, once daily, pangenotypic treatment for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. all relevant literature from 2014 through september of 2016 is included.expert opinion: sof/vel offers the promise of a single tablet, interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment that has extremely high efficacy in persons with chronic hcv infection regardless of genotype, subtype, treatment history or fibrosis status. it is expected to play a major role on a global scale in the therapeutic armamentarium against this ubiquitous threat to human health.
overactive_bladder	the vascular supply to the human bladder is derived mainly from the superior and inferior vesical arteries, the latter being directly connected to the internal iliac artery. aging is associated with an impairment of blood vessel function and changes may occur in the vasculature at the molecular, cellular and functional level. pelvic arterial insufficiency may play an important role in the development of bladder dysfunctions such as detrusor overactivity (do) and the overactive bladder syndrome. chronic ischemia-related bladder dysfunction may progress to bladder underactivity and it would be desirable to treat not only lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) induced by chronic ischemia, but also the progression of the morphological bladder changes. studies in experimental models in rabbits and rats have shown that pelvic arterial insufficiency may result in significant bladder ischemia with reduced bladder wall oxygen tension. in turn, this will lead to oxidative stress associated with upregulation of oxidative stress-sensitive genes, increased muscarinic receptor activity, ultrastructural damage, and neurodegeneration. the phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitor tadalafil, the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (ar) blocker silodosin, the beta(3)-ar agonist mirabegron, and the free radical scavenger melatonin, exerted a protecting effect on urodynamic parameters, and on functional and morphological changes of the bladder demonstrable in vitro. since the agents tested are used clinically for relieving luts, the results from the animal models seem to have translational value, and may be of relevance for designing clinical studies to demonstrate if the drugs may prevent progression of ischemia-related functional and morphological bladder changes.
overactive_bladder	aims: to explore factors that may predispose patients to reoperation after sacral neuromodulation (snm). methods: patients enrolled in our longitudinal neuromodulation database were reviewed. medical records data, and voiding diaries, interstitial cystitis symptom-problem indices (icsi-pi), and overactive bladder questionnaires (oab-q) at baseline and 3 months were analyzed with pearson 's chi(2), fisher 's exact test, wilcoxon rank tests, and multivariable logistic regression. results: of 407 patients, 134 (33%) had at least one reoperation over median 28.9 months follow-up (range 1.6-121.7); 78/407 (19%) were revised, and 56/407 (14%) were explanted. the most common reason for reoperation was lack of efficacy/worsening symptoms (n = 87). the reoperations group had a higher proportion of women(p = 0.049), lower mean body mass index (bmi; p = 0.010), more reprogramming events (p<0.0001), longer median follow-up (p = 0.0008), and higher proportions with interstitial cystitis (p = 0.013), using hormone replacement therapy (p = 0.0004), and complications (p<0.0001). both reoperations/no reoperations groups had similar improvements in icsi-pi (p<0.0001 for both), oab-q severity (p<0.0001 for both) and quality of life (p<0.0001 for both). on multivariate analysis, only longer follow-up (p = 0.0011; or 1.048; ci 1.019, 1.078) and having a complication (p<0.0001; or 23.2; ci 11.47, 46.75) were significant predictors of reoperations. in women only, using hrt at time of implant was also predictive of reoperation (p = 0.0027; or 3.09; ci 1.48, 6.46). conclusions: in this largest known series to date, one third of the patients required reoperation and the most common reason was lack of efficacy/ worsening symptoms. ongoing study is needed as the technology continues to evolve.

parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is a frequent neurodegenerative process in old age. accumulation and aggregation of the lipid-binding snare complex component alpha-synuclein (snca) underlies this vulnerability and defines stages of disease progression. determinants of snca levels and mechanisms of snca neurotoxicity have been intensely investigated. in view of the physiological roles of snca in blood to modulate vesicle release, we studied blood samples from a new large pedigree with snca gene duplication (park4 mutation) to identify effects of snca gain of function as potential disease biomarkers. downregulation of complexin 1 (cplx1) mrna was correlated with genotype, but the expression of other parkinson 's disease genes was not. in global rna-seq profiling of blood from presymptomatic park4 indviduals, bioinformatics detected significant upregulations for platelet activation, hemostasis, lipoproteins, endocytosis, lysosome, cytokine, toll-like receptor signaling and extracellular pathways. in park4 platelets, stimulus-triggered degranulation was impaired. strong spp1, gzmh and pltp mrna upregulations were validated in park4. when analysing individuals with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, the most specific known prodromal stage of general pd, only blood cplx1 levels were altered. validation experiments confirmed an inverse mutual regulation of snca and cplx1 mrna levels. in the 3'-utr of the cplx1 gene we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism that is significantly associated with pd risk. in summary, our data define cplx1 as a pd risk factor and provide functional insights into the role and regulation of blood snca levels. the new blood biomarkers of park4 in this turkish family might become useful for pd prediction.
multiple_sclerosis	mitoxantrone (mtx) is an antineoplastic agent used to treat several types of cancers and on multiple sclerosis, which shows a high incidence of cardiotoxicity. still, the underlying mechanisms of mtx cardiotoxicity are poorly understood and the potential toxicity of its metabolites scarcely investigated. therefore, this work aimed to synthesize the mtx-naphthoquinoxaline metabolite (napht) and to compare its cytotoxicity to the parent compound in 7-day differentiated h9c2 cells using pharmacological relevant concentrations (0.01-5 a mu m). mtx was more toxic in equivalent concentrations in all cytotoxicity tests performed [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reduction, neutral red uptake, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays] and times tested (24 and 48 h). both mtx and napht significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in 7-day differentiated h9c2 cells after a 12-h incubation. however, energetic pathways were affected in a different manner after mtx or napht incubation. atp increased and lactate levels decreased after a 24-h incubation with mtx, whereas for the same incubation time and concentrations, napht did not cause any significant effect. the increased activity of atp synthase seems responsible for mtx-induced increases in atp levels, as oligomycin (an inhibitor of atp synthase) abrogated this effect on 5 a mu m mtx-incubated cells. 3-methyladenine (an autophagy inhibitor) was the only molecule to give a partial protection against the cytotoxicity produced by mtx or napht. to the best of our knowledge, this was the first broad study on napht cardiotoxicity, and it revealed that the parent drug, mtx, caused a higher disruption in the energetic pathways in a cardiac model in vitro, whereas autophagy is involved in the toxicity of both compounds. in conclusion, napht is claimed to largely contribute to mtx-anticancer properties; therefore, this metabolite should be regarded as a good option for a safer anticancer therapy since it is less cardiotoxic than mtx.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is the most common movement disorder associated with the elderly which, other than symptomatic therapies, has no effective treatment or preventive measures. sirtuins and their pharmacological activators/inhibitors have been associated with a range of neuroprotective effects, and a large body of work on sirtuins' influence on pd pathology has accumulated over the past decade. here, evidence for sirtuins' activities as modifiers of pd pathology and how the mammalian sirtuin paralogues may have conflicting impacts on pd pathogenesis and disease progression is reviewed. the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sirtuin activities in pd are discussed in the light of current knowledge with reference to autophagy, mitochondrial homeostasis, and microtubule dynamics.

allergies	drug delivery systems (dds) are based on the concept of providing the optimal amount of a drug to a specific area requiring treatment. liposomes are lipid-based nanoparticles capable of encapsulating any drug into both their membrane and aqueous phases. they have the potential to be targeted when their surfaces are modified with functional molecules such as antibodies and peptides. thus, liposomes have strong potential as drug carriers if designed for active targeting. our research group has recently developed a new concept for liposome targeting called ""reverse targeting dds (rt-dds)"". rt-dds differs from conventional active targeting in that the surface of the liposomes is modified with an antigenic molecule that is specifically recognized by antigen-specific immune cells. this review describes in detail the differences between these two dds targeting concepts and proposes the application of rt-dds to the treatment of allergies based on research using ovalbumin as a model allergy antigen.
fungal_infection	paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by paracoccidioides brasiliensis and endemic in certain areas of central and south america. we report a case of a 62-year-old-man with a complex history of tuberculosis and imaging findings of a cerebral lesion and bilateral adrenal enlargement. biopsy of adrenal gland revealed paracoccidioides brasiliensis. this case highlights the importance of travel history for diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis in non-endemic areas and emphasizes the clinical and histopathological similarities with tuberculosis.
hypothyroidism	background: thyroid hormones have been associated with renal dysfunction in cross-sectional studies. however, prospective studies exploring the effect of thyroid hormones on renal function decline were sparse and got contradictive results. we aimed to prospectively explore the associations of thyroid hormones with incident chronic kidney disease (ckd) and rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) in chinese adults. methods: the participants were from a community-based cohort including 2103 individuals aged 40 years or above without ckd at baseline. thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), free triiodothyronine (ft3) and free thyroxin (ft4) were measured by radioimmunoassay at baseline. serum creatinine, urinary creatinine and albumin were measured at baseline and follow-up. ckd was defined as egfr= 30 mg/g. rapid egfr decline was defined as an annual egfr decline >3 ml/min/1.73 m(.)(2) results: during 4 years of follow-up, 198 participants developed ckd and 165 experienced rapid egfr decline. compared to tertile 1, tertile 3 of ft4 levels were associated with 1.88-folds (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.27-2.77) increased risk of incident ckd; and 1.64-folds (95% ci, 1.07-2.50) increased risk of rapid egfr decline (both p for trend <= 0.02), after adjustment for confounders. each 1-pmol/l of ft4 was associated with 12% increased risk of incident ckd and 10% of rapid egfr decline. among the incident ckd individuals, ft4 was significantly associated with higher risk of concurrent complications and further outcomes of ckd. we did not find associations of ft3 or tsh with ckd or rapid egfr decline. conclusions: higher ft4, but not tsh and ft3, was associated with increased risk of incident ckd and rapid egfr decline in middle-aged and elderly chinese.
myelofibrosis	myelofibrosis (mf) is a rare haematopoietic disorder, commonly diagnosed in the 6th decade: less than 20% are diagnosed before the age of 50years. in this retrospective study we included all patients given a diagnosis of world health organization-defined primary or secondary mf when aged 50years. forty-three patients with a median age of 43years were included. median follow up was 44months. twenty-two (51%) harboured the jak2 v617f mutation, 18/43 (42%) calr, 0/43 (0%) mpl mutations and 3/43 (7%) were triple negative' (tn). at the time of diagnosis, no significant differences existed in haematological and clinical phenotypes between jak2, calr and tn patients. the frequency of splenomegaly was greater (p=0047) in the jak2-mutated group compared to calr-mutated patients. in the whole cohort, the 5-year probability of developing anaemia, thrombocytopenia and marked leucocytosis was 24%, 10% and 13% respectively. finally, the cumulative incidence of thrombotic events and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia was 1% and 05% patient-year respectively. no death was reported during the follow-up. these findings suggest that mf in younger patients may have a more indolent course when compared to older patients.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objectives: the first drug repurposed for the treatment of depression was the tuberculostatic iproniazid. at present, drugs belonging to new classes of antidepressants still have antimicrobial effects. dysbiosis of gut microbiota was implicated in the development or exacerbation of mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder (mdd). based on the current interest in the gut-brain axis, the focus of this narrative review is to compile the available studies regarding the influences of gut microbiota in behavior and depression and to show the antimicrobial effect of antidepressant drugs. a discussion regarding the possible contribution of the antimicrobial effect of antidepressant drugs to its effectiveness/resistance is included. methods: the search included relevant articles from pubmed, scielo, lilacs, psycinfo, and isi web of knowledge. results: mdd is associated with changes in gut permeability and microbiota composition. in this respect, antidepressant drugs present antimicrobial effects that could also be related to the effectiveness of these drugs for mdd treatment. conversely, some antimicrobials present antidepressant effects. conclusion: both antidepressants and antimicrobials present neuroprotective/antidepressant and antimicrobial effects. further studies are needed to evaluate the participation of antimicrobial mechanisms of antidepressants in mdd treatment as well as to determine the contribution of this effect to antidepressant resistance.
cancer	ophiocoma erinaceus muller & troschel (ophiocomidae) is part of the extensive group of echinoderm that contains bioactive metabolites. as the anti cancer potential of brittle star saponin has not been reported against cervical cancer, the present study was conducted to evaluate the anticancer effect of extracted crude saponin. saponin extraction was conducted using conventional method such as froth test, tlc, ftir and erythrolysis assay. the hela-s3 cervical carcinoma and hncf-pi52 normal cells were treated with different concentrations of saponin fraction for 24 and 48 h. the cytotoxicity was examined by mtt, dapi, ao/pi, annexin v-fitc and flow cytometry. in addition, the apoptotic induced pathway was studied using caspase assay, evaluation of ros generation and bcl-2 mrna level. crude saponin showed cytotoxic properties in hela-s3 cells (ic50of 23.4 mu g/ml) without significant impact against normal cells. in addition, the crude saponin increased sub-g1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells, ros generation and caspase-3 and -9 activity (ic50 of 11.10, 11.27 mu g/ml). the dose dependent down regulation of bcl-2 in treated cells demonstrated that saponin fraction can trigger intrinsic apoptotic pathway in cancer cells. this study provides valuable information about the apoptotic inducing effect of saponin fraction, which can offer new insights into the anticancer potential of saponin as a promising candidate against human cervical carcinoma.
alzheimer's_disease	both normal aging and alzheimer 's disease (ad) have been associated with a reduction in functional brain connectivity. it is unknown how connectivity patterns due to aging and ad compare. here, we investigate functional brain connectivity in 12 young adults (mean age 22.8 +/- 2.8), 12 older adults (mean age 73.1 +/- 5.2) and 12 ad patients (mean age 74.0 +/- 5.2; mean mmse 22.3 +/- 2.5). participants were scanned during 6 different sessions with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fmri), resulting in 72 scans per group. voxelwise connectivity with 10 functional networks was compared between groups (p < 0.05, corrected). normal aging was characterized by widespread decreases in connectivity with multiple brain networks, whereas ad only affected connectivity between the default mode network (dmn) and precuneus. the preponderance of effects was associated with regional gray matter volume. our findings indicate that aging has amajor effect on functional brain interactions throughout the entire brain, whereas ad is distinguished by additional diminished posterior dmn-precuneus coherence.
sports_injuries	background: within international rugby union, only injury rates during the rugby world cup have been reported. therefore, injury rates and types during other international tournaments are unknown. purpose: to assess the 3-year incidence, severity, nature, and causes of match and training injuries sustained during different international tournaments played by the welsh national rugby union team. study design: descriptive epidemiology study. methods: injury data for all players (n = 78) selected for 1 national rugby union team over a 3-year period were analyzed using the international consensus statement methods. player height (cm) and mass (kg) were recorded. tournaments were grouped for comparisons as: autumn tournaments (2012 and 2013), rugby world cup (rwc; 2011), six nations (2012, 2013, and 2014), and summer tournaments (2012, 2013, and 2014). injury incidence (injuries/1000 hours), prevalence (% of players unavailable), and severity (days lost) were calculated for each tournament. injury location, type, and cause of match and training injuries were analyzed. results: match injury incidence was highest during autumn tournaments (262.5/1000 match-hours) and lowest during the rwc (178.6/1000 match-hours). summer tournaments had the highest training incidence (5.5 injuries/1000 training-hours). mild injuries were most likely during the rwc (risk ratio [rr], 2.02; 95% ci, 1.26-3.24), while severe injuries were most likely during autumn tournaments (rr, 3.27; 95% ci, 1.70-6.29). quadriceps hematomas (18.8/1000 match-hours; 95% ci, 11.3-31.1) and concussions (13.8/1000 match-hours; 95% ci, 7.6-24.8) were the most common match injuries, with shoulder dislocations being the most severe (111 mean days lost per injury). conclusion: injury rates were considerably higher than those previously reported for multiple teams during rwc tournaments. further investigation of injury rates and risk factors is recommended to accurately gauge their impact within international rugby union, particularly with regard to lower limb hematoma, concussion, and shoulder injuries.
hepatitis_c	background: in the united states, approximately 3 million people are infected with hepatitis c virus (hcv). genotypes of hcv variably affect disease progression and treatment response. however, the relationships between hcv genotypes and liver disease progression, healthcare resource utilization, and healthcare costs have not been fully explored.research design and methods: in this retrospective study of patients with chronic hepatitis c (chc), healthcare claims from a large us health plan were used to collect data on patient demographic and clinical characteristics.main outcome measures: main outcome measures include healthcare resource utilization (hcru) and healthcare costs. linked laboratory data provided genotype and select measures to determine liver disease severity.results: the sample (mean age 50.6 years, 63.5% male) included 10,331 patients, of whom 79.1% had genotype (gt)1, 12.8% had gt2, and 8.1% had gt3. descriptive analyses demonstrated variation by hcv genotype in liver and non-liver related comorbidities, liver disease severity, and healthcare costs. the highest percentage of patients with liver-related comorbidities and advanced liver disease was found among those with gt3. meanwhile, patients with gt2 had lower hcru and the lowest costs, and patients with gt1 had the highest total all-cause costs. these differences may reflect differing rates of non-liver-related comorbidities and all-cause care. multivariable analyses showed that genotype was a significant predictor of costs and liver disease severity: compared with patients having gt1, those with gt3 were significantly more likely to have advanced liver disease. patients with gt2 were significantly less likely to have advanced disease and more likely to have lower all-cause costs.limitations: results may not be generalizable to patients outside the represented commercial insurance plans, and analysis of a prevalent population may underestimate hcru and costs relative to a sample of treated patients.conclusions: these results suggest that liver disease progression varies by genotype and that chc patients with gt3 appear to have more severe liver disease. these findings highlight the importance of effective hcv treatment for all patients and support guidelines for treatment of high-risk patients, including those with gt3.
myelofibrosis	background: the driver mutations jak2v617f, mplw515l/k and calr influence disease phenotype of myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) and might sustain a condition of chronic inflammation. pentraxin 3 (ptx3) and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) are inflammatory biomarkers potentially useful for refining prognostic classification of mpns. methods: we evaluated 305 with essential thrombocythemia (et) and 172 polycythemia vera (pv) patients diagnosed according to the 2016 who criteria and with full molecular characterization for driver mutations. results: ptx3 levels were significantly increased in carriers of homozygous jak2v617f mutation compared to all the other genotypes and triple negative et patients, while hs-crp levels were independent of the mutational profile. the risk of haematological evolution and death from any cause was about 2- and 1.5-fold increased in individuals with high ptx-3 levels, while the thrombosis rate tended to be lower. high hs-crp levels were associated with risk of haematological evolution, death and also major thrombosis. after sequential adjustment for potential confounders (age, gender, diagnosis and treatments) and the presence of jak2v617f homozygous status, high hs-crp levels remained significant for all outcomes, while jak2v617f homozygous status as well as treatments were the factors independently accounting for adverse outcomes among patients with high ptx3 levels. conclusions: these results provide evidence that jak2v617f mutation influences mpn-associated inflammation with a strong correlation between allele burden and ptx3 levels. plasma levels of hs-crp and ptx3 might be of prognostic value for patients with et and pv, but their validation in future prospective studies is needed.
headache	dural venous sinus thrombosis (dvst) is a rare cause of stroke, which typically affects young women. the importance of identifying pre-disposing factors that lead to venous stasis lies in the foundation of understanding the etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. the precise therapeutic role of interventional therapies is not fully understood though the current data do suggest potential applications. the aim of the study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the utility of and short-term 30-day survival after endovascular therapy for patients with dvst. standard prisma guidelines were followed. data sources included pubmed keywords and phrases, which were also incorporated into a mesh search to yield articles indexed in medline over a 5-year period. all rcts, observational cohort studies, and administrative registries comparing or reporting dvst were included. sixty-six studies met inclusion criteria. 35 articles investigating treatment in a summation of 10,285 patients were eligible for data extraction and included in the review of treatment modalities. a total of 312 patients were included for statistical analysis. all patients included received endovascular intervention with direct thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy or both. 133 (42.6%) patients were documented to have a neurologic decline, which prompted endovascular intervention. all patients who had endovascular interventions were those who were started on and failed systemic anticoagulation. 44 patients were reported to have intracranial hemorrhages after intervention. regardless of systemic anticoagulation, patients were still reported to have complications of vte and pe. primary outcome at 3-6 month follow up revealed mrs< 1 in 224 patients. dvst presents with many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. the utility of invasive interventions such as local thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy is not fully understood. it is exceedingly difficult to conduct large randomized trials for this low incidence disease process with large pathophysiological heterogeneity.
polycythemia_vera	introduction: in patients with essential thrombocythemia (et), the vascular complications contribute to morbidity and mortality. to better predict the occurrence of thrombotic events, an international prognostic score for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ipset-thrombosis) has recently been proposed. we present the application of this score and compare its results with the usual classification system. method: we retrospectively evaluated the characteristics and risk factors for thrombosis of 46 patients with a diagnosis of et seen in the last 6 years at faculdade de medicina do abc (fmabc). results: thrombosis in the arterial territory was more prevalent than in venous sites. we observed that cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking) were also risk factors for thrombosis (p<0.001). age over 60 years and presence of jak2 v617f mutation were not associated with the occurrence of thrombotic events. no patient classified by ipset-thrombosis as low risk had a thrombotic event. furthermore, using the ipset-thrombosis scale, we identified two patients who had thrombotic events during follow-up and were otherwise classified in the low-risk group of the traditional classification. leukocytosis at diagnosis was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis (p=0.02), while splenomegaly was associated with venous thrombotic events (p=0.01). conclusion: cardiovascular risk factors and leukocytosis were directly associated with arterial thrombosis. ipset-thrombosis appears to be better than the traditional classification at identifying lower risk patients who do not need specific therapy.
emergency_contraception	emergency contraception (ec) prevents pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. use of ec has increased markedly in countries where a product is available over the counter, yet barriers to availability and use remain. although effective in clinical trials, it has not yet been possible to show a public health benefit of ec in terms of reduction of unintended pregnancy rates. selective progesterone receptor modulators developed as emergency contraceptives offer better effectiveness than levonorgestrel, but still ec is less effective than use of ongoing regular contraception. methods which inhibit ovulation whenever they are taken or which act after ovulation to prevent implantation and strategies to increase the uptake of effective ongoing contraception after ec use would prevent more pregnancies.
emergency_contraception	the political debate for adolescents to have access to emergency contraception that is available over the counter has been going on for years. since 1999, levonorgestrel, plan b one step (r), has been used in the united states as an emergency contraception but with a prescription at the time. the fda has done years of research and testing with barr laboratories, the manufacture of plan b one step (r), to make it safe for females of all ages. in 2003, the fda recommended the over the counter use of plan b one step (r) for all ages, yet this did not occur. in pharmacies across our nation young women find it impossible to purchase this product whether they be of age or not. politics is making the choices for our young females, not medical evidence. how long are we going to let this continue?
emergency_contraception	the aim of the study was to describe the use of emergency contraception (ec) in family health units in recife between march and september, 2011. the questionnaire was answered by 234 professionals, 154 nurses and 80 physicians selected by random sampling in 117 usf. almost all professionals (90.6%) reported availability of ec in family health unit; physicians and/or nurse were the main prescribers (73.9%); 27.4% knew the distribution strategy by ""women 's health kit"". although 85.0% of professionals have already prescribed the ec, only 8.5% considered the ec as a woman 's right. the majority (80.7%) understand the family planning manual of the ministry of health and about half (51.2%) understand the reproductive rights manual of the municipality 's manual. 51.3% knew the ec action mechanism and 77.4% usually inform women about ec. among those who do not explain about ec, the main reasons were: ""lack of opportunity"" (10.0%) for physicians and ""to avoid becoming routine"" (6.5%) for nurses. half of the professionals (50.0%) reported prescribing in three recommended situations (unprotected intercourse, rape and failure of contraceptive methodin use) and 65.8% agree that religion interfere in the decision of the prescription/advice. health professionals have demonstrated sufficient technical knowledge to prescribe ec, but do not recognize it as a right of women. also, they consider that the influence of religion may interfere with the decision of prescribing and with the use of ec by women.
overactive_bladder	aimsbladder dysfunction is frequent during the course of multiple sclerosis (ms), observed in up to 75% of patients. urinary symptomatology can be a feature of the first episode of ms in a minority of cases, and most often shows characteristics of an overactive bladder (oab), with voiding symptoms seen less frequently, often in combination with oab. the neural control of micturition is complex, involving systems located in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery, and implicating central noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic activities. urinary disorders are also linked to anxiety and depression, conditions connected to hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. in this study we aimed to investigate neurochemical and neuroendocrine correlates of bladder dysfunction in early ms. methodswe included 101 patients at first demyelinating episode suggestive of ms that were drug-free at assessment. we evaluated the presence of urinary symptomatology and estimated csf levels of the main metabolites of noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine, as well csf-acth and serum cortisol. resultsin total, 15 patients (15%) reported urinary dysfunction suggestive of oab. four of these had coexistent voiding symptomatology. the serotonin metabolite 5-hiaa was significantly reduced (p=0.017) in patients with oab syndrome, while there were no differences in the metabolites of noradrenaline (mhpg) and of dopamine (hva). additionally, significantly lower serum cortisol (p=0.009) and borderline lower csf-acth (p=0.08) were found in patients with oab. conclusionsms patients with oab syndrome at the first demyelinating episode show reductions in central serotonergic activity and stress hormones. whether the same changes persist at later disease stages remains to be investigated. neurourol. urodynam. 35:955-958, 2016.

weight_loss	a new material from clay was developed that has a resistance to carbon dioxide flow in upstream for plugging co2 storage wells. thermogravimetric and thermal stability of this material showed a minimal variation in weight loss with incremental heating up to 420 degrees c. adsorption-desorption of co2 at various modeled temperature showed an exothermic and spontaneous process with maximum adsorption capacity of 775 mg/g obtained at 640 psi (43.5 bar) and 50 degrees c. higher pressure led to more storage capacity with physisorption hysteresis curves. freundlich and bet models best fit the equilibrium adsorption data with average regression coefficient of 0.995. the new material can substitute the conventional cement plugs for upstream carbon sequestration and prevents the migration of the stored co2 through the cement plug to the surface. also the developed new cement showed no chemical interaction which confirms the economical impact of using this cement to plug the co2 sequestrations wells.

heart_disease	a ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality encountered in infants and children. many of them survive through adulthood before diagnosis. two-thirds of the cases involve the membranous part of the septum. in the absence of an interventricular shunt or concomitant cardiac surgery, guidelines for surgical intervention or resection of isolated aneurysms of the membranous septum are not well established. in this report, we discuss a multi-imaging modality approach for the diagnosis and assessment of membranous ventricular septal aneurysms and review the experts' consensuses for follow-up and treatment strategies.
sports_injuries	long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations for intra-articular injection might be effective in the management of joint pain and inflammation associated sports injuries and osteoarthritis. in this study, a prodrug-based delivery system was evaluated. the synthesized diclofenac ester prodrug, a weak base (pka 7.52), has relatively high solubility at low ph (6.5 mg ml(-1) at ph 4) and much lower solubility at physiological ph (4.5 g ml(-1) at ph 7.4) at 37 degrees c. in biological media including 80% (v/v) human synovial fluid (sf), the prodrug was cleaved to diclofenac mediated by esterases. in situ precipitation of the prodrug was observed upon addition of a concentrated slightly acidic prodrug solution to phosphate buffer or sf at ph 7.4. the degree of supersaturation accompanying the precipitation process was more pronounced in sf than in phosphate buffer. in the rotating dialysis cell model, a slightly acidic prodrug solution was added to the donor cell containing 80% sf resulting in a continuous appearance of diclofenac in the acceptor phase for more than 43 h after an initial lag period of 8 h. detectable amounts of prodrug were found in the rat joint up to 8 days after knee injection of the acidic prodrug solution.

hepatitis_c	background & aims: cd4(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) expand during chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, inhibit antiviral immunity and promote fibrosis. direct-acting antiviral agents (daa) have revolutionized hcv therapy. however, it is unclear if tregs are normalized after daa-induced hcv elimination. methods: we analyzed tregs before (baseline), at end of therapy (eot), 12 and 24 weeks (svr12, svr24) and long-term (51 +/- 14 weeks) after eot in 26 genotype-1-infected patients who were successfully treated with sofosbuvir (sof) plus interferon (ifn)/ribavirin (n = 12) and ifn-free daa regimens (sof plus daclatasvir or simeprevir; n = 14). frequency, phenotype and suppressor function of peripheral foxp3(+) cd25(+) cd4(+) t cells were studied by multi-color flow cytometry and co-culture inhibition assays. results: frequencies and activation status of foxp3(+) cd25(+) cd4(+) t cells remained elevated above those of normal controls in both treatment groups even long-term after hcv elimination. coculture assays indicated a dose-response relationship for functional inhibition of autologous cd4(+) effector t cells and confirmed that activation of tregs remained largely unchanged over the observation period. unlike ifn-free regimens, sof plus ifn/ribavirin induced a transiently increased frequency of foxp3+ cd25(+) cd4(+) t cells at eot (5.0% at baseline to 6.1% at eot; p = 0.001). these foxp3(+) cd25(+) cd4(+) t cells co-expressed the activation markers glycoprotein a repetitions predominant (garp; p = 0.012) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (ox-40; p = 0.001) but showed unchanged in vitro inhibitory activity. conclusion: although ifn-based daa therapy induced transient expansion of activated foxp3(+) cd25(+) cd4(+) t cells, neither ifn-based nor ifn-free daa regimens normalized frequencies and activation status of tregs one year after viral elimination. persistence of immunosuppressive tregs may thus contribute to complications of liver disease even long-term after hcv cure. lay summary: in chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, cd4(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) can reduce antiviral immune responses, promote liver fibrosis and may increase the risk for liver cancer, because they gradually expand during disease. modern directacting antiviral agents (daa) can ""cure"" hepatitis c in almost all treated patients. however, our study shows that daa do not normalize the increased frequency and activation status of tregs even long-term after hcv elimination. tregs may persistently modulate functions of the immune system even after ""cure"" of hepatitis c.

fungal_infection	lasers and photodynamic therapy have been considered a convergence treatment for onychomycosis, which is a fungal infection on the nail bed and nail plate. laser therapies have shown satisfactory results without significant complications for onychomycosis; however, the mechanism of clearing remains unknown. in this work, we investigated changes in the chemical structure of nail keratin induced by nd: yag laser using raman spectroscopy. toe nails with onychomycosis were treated with 1064 nm nd: yag laser. after laser treatment, the disulfide band (490-590 cm(-1)) of nail keratin was rarely observed or was reduced in intensity. the amide i band (1500-1700 cm(-1)) also showed changes induced by the laser. the a-helical (1652 cm(-1)) structures dominated the beta-sheet (1673 cm(-1)) in nontreated nail, but the opposite phenomenon was observed after laser treatment.
low_testosterone	we present a case of feminizing adrenal tumor with high estradiol who presented with fatigue, anorexia, decreased libido, and gynecomastia. he had bilateral gynaecomastia without galactorrhea. estradiol was high (1722 pg/ml) with low testosterone (0.47 ng/ml:n=2.4-8.3). abdominal ultrasound showed a huge tumor above the right kidney that was compressed and was confirmed by ctscan.at surgery, a well limited much vascularized mass weighing 2.5 kg was removed successfully.

cancer	pyruvate membrane crossing and its lactate dehydrogenase-mediated conversion to lactate in cells featuring different levels of expression of membrane monocarboxylate transporters (mct4) were probed by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization-enhanced nmr. hyperpolarized c-13-1-labeled pyruvate was transferred to suspensions of rodent tumor cell carcinoma, cell line 39. the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate monitored by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization-nmr in carcinoma cells featuring native mct4 expression level was lower than the rate observed for cells in which the human mct4 gene was overexpressed. the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase was also assessed in buffer solutions, following the real-time pyruvate-to-lactate conversion speeds at different enzyme concentrations. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
weight_loss	effects of chitosan (0.5 and 1%), trans-resveratrol (1.6 x 10(-5) m, 1.6 x 10(-4) m and 1.6 x 10(-3)m) and glycine betaine (gb) (10, 15 and 20 mm) dipping on quality and biochemical changes of `sukkarf bananas were studied during ripening at shelf life (sl) conditions for 13 days. weight loss increased during shelf life but was not affected by treatments. peel color index increased during sl and was lower at both resveratrol and gb treatments than control. membrane stability index (msi) of peel decreased during sl and was higher, especially after 6 days, at resveratrol and gb treatments than control. firmness decreased during sl and was higher, especially after 6 days, at resveratrol and low and moderate rates of gb than control. tss increased during sl and was lower at all treatments than control. acidity concentration decreased during sl and was higher, especially after 6 days, at low rate of chitosan, resveratrol and high rate of gb than control. ph increased during sl and was higher at low rate of gb and lower at low and moderate rates of resveratrol than control. vitamin c concentration decreased during sl but was not affected by treatments. total phenols concentration decreased during sl and was higher at gb and moderate rate of resveratrol than control. total flavonoids concentration decreased during sl and was lower at resveratrol and low and high rates of gb than control. frsc (dpph ic50) increased during sl and was lower at gb and low and moderate rates of resveratrol than other treatments, especially after 6 days. the relations of such biochemical changes with alpha-amylase, xylanase, polygalacturonase, peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase activities were discussed. in conclusion, both postharvest trans-resveratrol and gb treatments retained quality of 'sukkari' bananas during sl and being suggested as natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	purpose of review small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) has been proposed as a cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). however, this relationship has been subject to controversy. this review aims to provide a current perspective on the sibo-ibs hypothesis. recent findings case-control studies evaluating the prevalence of sibo in ibs and healthy individuals have shown conflicting results. moreover, the tests available in routine clinical practice to diagnose sibo are not valid and lack both sensitivity and specificity. hence, interpreting the effect of interventions based on these tests is fraught with uncertainty. furthermore, the sibo-ibs hypothesis has paved the way to assess antibiotic therapy in nonconstipated ibs, with rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, showing modest but significant clinical benefit. however, individuals were not tested for sibo and the mechanism of action of rifaximin in ibs remains to be elucidated. preliminary data suggest that rifaximin decreases microbial richness and previous studies have noted antibacterial interventions in ibs to reduce colonic fermentation and improve symptoms. the advent of rapid culture-independent molecular techniques is a promising tool that will seek to clarify and advance our understanding of the gut microbial function. summary the sibo-ibs hypothesis lacks convincing evidence but remains under scrutiny. the mechanism resulting in symptom improvement after rifaximin treatment in some ibs individuals requires exploration. novel molecular techniques provide an exciting and challenging opportunity to explore the host-gut microbiota interaction.
menopause	introduction: the aim of the study was to evaluate the effects on serum insulin and serum thyroid profile of a dietary supplement, myo-inositol, given alone or in combination with melatonin to women during menopausal transition.methods: forty women aged 45-55 years and at least 6 months of amenorrhea were enrolled in this study. they were randomly assigned to two groups of 20 each. one group took myo-inositol (myo-ins) (2g twice a day) and the other group took 2g/d myo-ins plus 3g/d melatonin before sleeping. at the beginning of the study and after 6 months, all women were evaluated for the following indices: waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, endometrial thickness, as well as serum concentrations of tsh, ft3, ft4 and insulin.results: both at baseline and at 6 months, the two groups were statistically similar for each of the considered indices. if percent changes (%, 6 months over baseline) are contrasted in the two groups, serum tsh decreased in the myo-ins group but increased in the latter, while serum insulin decreased in both groups.conclusions: the combination of myo-ins plus melatonin seems to affect positively glucose metabolism, while myo-ins only seems to improve thyroid function.
diabetes	background data regarding cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) in patients with multiple comorbidities are limited. objectives this study evaluated the association of multiple comorbidities with the benefits of crt over implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd) alone. methods we examined 1,214 madit-crt (multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial with cardiac resynchronization therapy) study patients with left bundle branch block (lbbb) and 0, 1, 2, or >= 3 comorbidities, including renal dysfunction, hypertension (htn), diabetes, coronary artery disease, history of atrial arrhythmias, history of ventricular arrhythmias, current smoking, and cerebrovascular accident. in an adjusted analysis, we analyzed risk of heart failure (hf) events or death by comorbidity group in all patients and in patients with crt with defibrillator (crt-d) versus icd. then we examined percent change in left ventricular (lv) end-diastolic volume, lv end-systolic volume, lv ejection fraction, left atrial volume, and lv dyssynchrony at 1-year in crt-d patients by comorbidity group. results there was an inverse relationship between comorbidity burden and improvements in lv end-systolic volume, lv end-diastolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial volume, and lv dyssynchrony. in an adjusted model, there was an increasing risk of death or nonfatal hf events with increasing comorbidity burden regardless of treatment group (p= 3), the absolute risk reduction associated with crt-d over icd alone appeared greater than that seen for groups with less comorbidity burden (0 and 1). conclusions during long-term follow-up of madit-crt study patients with lbbb randomized to crt-d, there were differences in hf or death risk and in the degree of reverse remodeling among comorbidity groups. however, the burden of comorbidity does not appear to compromise the clinical benefits of crt-d compared with icd alone.

allergies	ethnopharmacological relevance: traditional medicine has used uvaria rufa blume as an ethnomedicinal plant for treating fever, skin allergies, intestinal ulcers and prostate disorders including bph. however, no scientific evidence supports the traditional use. aim of the study: this study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of u. rufa on bph using in vitro and in vivo models. materials and methods: in vitro studies screened the efficacy of a 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha r) inhibition and antioxidant activity of petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol and aqueous extracts from the stem of u. rufa. phytochemical screening was performed to determine the active compound using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). ethyl acetate extract (ur-etoac) of u. rufa was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy in vivo models. bph was induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate (3 mg/kg) to male rats for 30 days. after 30 days of oral administration of ur-etoac at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg and finasteride at a dose of 1 mg/kg, the prostate weight, prostate index (pi), testosterone and androgen receptor (ar) levels, and histopathological alteration of prostate gland were determined. also, oxidative status and toxicity indices were assessed. results: ur-etoac exhibited the highest potency of inhibition of 5 alpha r and possessed potent antioxidants rich in phenolics and flavonoids contents. the active compound analyzed by hplc was beta-sitosterol. in vivo results show a significant reduction in prostate weight, pi, and ar in all treated groups when compared to the bph model group (p < 0.001). also, the ur-etoac and finasteride treated groups had increased prostatic and serum testosterone levels when compared to the bph model group. a histopathological investigation of the prostate glands supported the above results. ur-etoac elevated the antioxidant enzymes and reduced the malondialdehyde level in bph-induced rats. moreover, treatment of ur-etoac at all doses had no toxic effects on the vital organs and serum biochemical indices. conclusions: ur-etoac from the stem of uvaria rufa blume appears to have the potential as a phytotherapeutic agent in the management of bph, which provides the scientific evidence for traditional use.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive loss of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and with multiple incapacitating motor and non-motor symptoms. troxerutin is a natural bioflavonoid with nephro- and hepato-protective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. in this study, we evaluated its possible neuroprotective effect in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) rat model of pd. intrastriatal 6-ohda-lesioned rats were pretreated with troxerutin at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 1 week. results showed that troxerutin mitigates apomorphine-induced motor asymmetry and lowered the latency to initiate and the total time in the narrow beam task and this beneficial effect was lost following central application of estrogen receptor beta (er beta) antagonist or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitor. in addition, troxerutin reduced striatal malondialdehyde (mda) as an index of lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, glial fibrillary acid protein (gfap) as a marker of astrogliosis, and dna fragmentation as an apoptotic marker with no significant alteration of catalase activity and nitrite level. meanwhile, troxerutin was capable to prevent loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (th)-positive neurons. these findings indicate neuroprotective potential of troxerutin in 6-ohda rat model of pd through mitigation of apoptosis, astrogliosis, and oxidative stress and part of its effect is dependent on pi3k/er beta signaling.
menopause	objective: to assess whether an educational intervention in women in perimenopausal age with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and/or dyslipidemia could improve aspects of quality of life and exercise. methods: a randomized clinical trial. variables: physical activity, quality of life and weight in women aged 45-60 years (n = 320) at time 0 and 12 months after surgery. intervention group (ig): 3 interactive workshops on cardiovascular disease prevention and control group (cg): information by mail. results: the ig obtained better scores on the mental component of quality of life one year later (p < 0.05) and showed a significant increase in physical activity (p < 0.01). gi women maintained their weight while in cg women it increased (p < 0.01). conclusions: a simple educational intervention in premenopausal women with a cardiovascular risk factor improves aspects of quality of life and of healthy habits such as physical activity.

overactive_bladder	aimby investigating the association of urodynamics and urogenital nerve growth factor (ngf) levels in vaginal mesh surgery, we may be able to associate the likelihood of postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms developing as a result of synthetic mesh implanted for pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. methodsthirty-eight female sprague-dawley rats were divided into three groups: mesh, sham (no mesh), and control. urodynamic study and ngf analysis of the urogenital tissues were done and results were compared among all groups. the urodynamic studies of the mesh and sham groups were further divided into the 4th and 10th days. a p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. resultsall rats survived and no complications were observed during the post-implantation period. histological evaluation showed intense acute inflammatory reaction on days 4 and 7 in the mesh and sham groups when compared to the control. the mesh group showed a larger area of inflammation as compared to the sham. the ngf levels increased significantly in the mesh and sham groups on the 4th and 10th days when compared to the control (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). both the mesh and sham groups had shorter voiding interval and lower voiding volume on days 4 and 10 when compared to the control group (p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). the magnitude on increasing ngf level and decreasing voiding interval and voiding volume was significantly more on the mesh group than the sham group. conclusiona higher level of ngf in the early days post-transvaginal mesh implantation is associated with a shorter voiding interval and a smaller bladder capacity, which represents abnormal lower urinary tract symptoms following transvaginal mesh implantation.
skin_care	background: social media have become outlets for patients to voice opinions and ask questions. since suffering from rosacea is an isolating experience and the disease is poorly understood, patients use social media to expand their knowledge about the condition. objective: to understand rosacea patients' online health information seeking habits to obtain a better insight of their educational needs. methods: ten percent of posts in online rosacea forum composed of 3350 members and 27 051 posts, discussing patient viewpoints and concern, selected by stratified random sampling. three hundred and nine queries were directly categorized to patients seeking advice by two investigators and qualitatively analyzed. results: patients primarily sought advice about treatments (n=155, 50.1%), triggers (n=53, 17.1%), diet (n=48, 15.5%), skin care (n=37, 11.9%) and special presentations of the disease (n=22, 7.1%). questions frequently pertained to adverse effects, efficacy and target of therapy (78, 49, 30 posts, respectively). conclusion: proactively providing reliable resources and comprehensive explanations on treatments, triggers, diet and skin care could be helpful in reducing patients' confusion about rosacea and enhancing rosacea patient-physician relationships.
skin_care	the skin is fortified with a setup of lipophilic and hydrophilic, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. ascorbyl palmitate (ap) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (sap) are reported as lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants, respectively used for skin care. present study was aimed to assess the combined ap (in oil phase) and sap (in aqueous phase) via multiple emulsion (me1) for controlling sebum secretions in healthy human females. ftir analysis of ap and sap was performed for identification. multiple emulsions (me1 and control) were prepared and analyzed for physical stability. antioxidant activities of ap, sap as well as me1 (with combination of these compounds) were determined by dpph method. 11 female volunteers were included in a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, split-face comparative study. volunteers were instructed to apply me1 on left cheek while control (without ap and sap) on right cheek, for a period of 90 days. a non-invasive photometric device (sebumeter((r))) was used for the measurement of sebum secretions on both sides of the face with subsequent time intervals. a good antioxidant activity of me1 was observed. me1 treatments reduced significant facial sebum secretions as compared with control/placebo treatments. it was concluded that combined ap and sap supplementations to skin proved a promising choice for controlling facial sebum secretions and could be evaluated for undesired oily skin and acne reductions for beautifying the facial appearance.
sprains_and_strains	our purpose was to assess the effect of wearing close-fitting neoprene. shorts on swinging leg movement discrimination (md) scores in elite level. australian football players. twenty players had their swinging leg md assessed using the active movement extent discrimination apparatus (ameda), once wearing close-fitting neoprene and once wearing loose-fitting. running shorts. subjects were randomly allocated to one of the shorts conditions prior to repeating the test in the other condition. the ameda was used to assess the accuracy at which subjects judge the extent of a standing backward swinging leg movement corresponding to the late swing early stance phase of running. each subject performed 40 movements made to on a of five randomly set physical limits, and without the aid of vision made a judgment as to the perceived limit position. from the accuracy of these judgments, a movement discrimination (md) score was calculated for each subject under each condition. subjects were grouped as having tow or high neuromuscular control, or ability to use proprioception when controlling active movements without vision, based on their loose-shorts md score. analysis was performed on the md scores obtained for each limb from subjects in the two groups, under the two shorts-wearing conditions. there was no main effect of wearing close-fitting shorts when the cohort was treated as a whole. a significant interaction effect was obtained (f = 17.027, p = 0.0006) whereby the mean md score of the low neuromuscular control ability group was improved when wearing neoprene shorts but was reduced for the high ability group. wearing close-fitting neoprene shorts has a beneficial effect on leg swing judgment accuracy in subjects with tow neuromuscular control ability. conversely, leg swing judgment accuracy for subjects with high ability was reduced by wearing neoprene shorts.

sports_injuries	purpose physical activity-related injuries in children constitute a costly public health matter. the influence of motor performance on injury risk is unclear. the purpose of this study was to examine if motor performance was a risk factor of traumatic and overuse lower extremity injuries in a normal population of children. methods this study included 1244 participants from 8 to 14 yr old at baseline, all participating in the childhood health, activity and motor performance school study denmark. the follow-up period was up to 15 months. the motor performance tests were static balance, single leg hop for distance, core stability tests, vertical jump, shuttle run, and cardiorespiratory fitness test. lower extremity injuries were registered by clinicians using weekly questionnaires and classified according to the international classification of diseases, 10th revision, system. results poor balance increased the risk for traumatic injury in the foot region (incidence rate ratio [irr] = 1.09-1.15), and good performance in single leg hop for distance protected against traumatic knee injuries (irr = 0.66-0.68). good performance in core stability tests and vertical jump increased the risk for traumatic injuries in the foot region (irr = 1.12-1.16). poor balance increased the risk for overuse injuries in the foot region (irr = 1.65), as did good performance in core stability tests and shuttle run, especially for knee injuries (irr = 1.07-1.18). conclusions poor balance (sway) performance was a consistent predictor of traumatic injuries, in particular, for traumatic ankle injuries. good motor performance (core stability, vertical jump, and shuttle run) was positively associated with traumatic and overuse injuries and negatively (single leg hop) associated with traumatic injuries, indicating different influences on injury risk. previous injury was a confounder affecting the effect size and the significance. more studies are needed to consolidate the findings, to clarify the influence of different performance tests on different types of injuries, and to examine the influence of behavior in relation to injury risk.
birth_control	objectives. this study investigated the effect of menstrual cycle on vocal fold vibratory characteristics in young women using high-speed digital imaging. this study examined the menstrual phase effect on five objective high-speed imaging parameters and two self-rated perceptual parameters. the effects of oral birth control use were also investigated. methods. thirteen subjects with no prior voice complaints were included in this study. all data were collected at three different time periods (premenses, postmenses, ovulation) over the course of one menstrual cycle. for five of the 13 subjects, data were collected for two consecutive cycles. six of 13 subjects were oral birth control users. from high-speed imaging data, five objective parameters were computed: fundamental frequency, fundamental frequency deviation, harmonics-to-noise ratio, harmonic richness factor, and ratio of first and second harmonics. they were supplemented by two self-rated parameters: reflux severity index and perceptual voice quality rating. analysis included mixed model linear analysis with repeated measures. results. results indicated no significant main effects for menstrual phase, between-cycle, or birth control use in the analysis for mean fundamental frequency, fundamental frequency deviation, harmonics-to-noise ratio, harmonic richness factor, first and second harmonics, reflux severity index, and perceptual voice quality rating. additionally, there were no interaction effects. conclusions. hormone fluctuations observed across the menstrual cycle do not appear to have direct effect on vocal fold vibratory characteristics in young women with no voice concerns. birth control use, on the other hand, may have influence on spectral richness of vocal fold vibration.
hypothyroidism	objective. the present study reviews a series of patients who underwent thyroid surgery in eldoret, kenya, to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting long-term (>1 year) outcomes research in a resource-limited setting, impact on the quality of life of the recipient population, and inform future humanitarian collaborations. study design. case series with chart review. setting. tertiary public referral hospital in eldoret, kenya. subjects and methods. twenty-one patients were enrolled during the study period. a retrospective chart review was performed for all adult patients who underwent thyroid surgery during humanitarian trips (2010-2015). patients were contacted by mobile telephone. medical history and physical examination, including laryngoscopy, were performed, and the sf-36 was administered (a quality-of-life questionnaire). laboratory measurements of thyroid function and neck ultrasound were obtained. results. the mean follow-up was 33.6 +/- 20.2 months after surgery: 37.5% of subtotal thyroidectomy patients and 15.4% of lobectomy patients were hypothyroid postoperatively according to serologic studies. there were no cases of goiter recurrence or malignancy. all patients reported postoperative symptomatic improvement and collectively showed positive pre- and postoperative score differences on the sf-36. conclusion. although limited by a small sample size and the retrospective nature, our study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term surgical and quality-of-life outcomes research in a resource-limited setting. the low complication rates suggest minimal adverse effects of performing surgery in this context. despite a considerable rate of postoperative hypothyroidism, it is in accordance with prior studies and emphasizes the need for individualized, longitudinal, and multidisciplinary care. quality-of-life score improvements suggest benefit to the recipient population.

sports_injuries	background and study aim. changed thigh muscles action balance can cause sports injuries. the aim of our investigation was the knowledge about effect of thigh muscles fatigue resistance on the knee flexor (fl)/extensor (ext) muscles mean work (w) and power (p) ratio. material and methods. fourteen amateur male handball players participated the tests were carried out by a dynamometer system using the knee isokinetic flexion-extension movements at angular velocity of 90 degrees/s (five repetitions) and 240 degrees/s (20 repetitions) by the concentric contractions. the mean thigh muscles w, p and fl/ext muscles mean w and p ratios were calculated for the first ten and last ten repetitions. the correlation between the thigh muscles peak torques (tau(max)) at the velocity of 90 degrees/s, 240 degrees/s and w, p at the first and last ten repetitions was determined. results. mean w produced by the knee fl in the last ten movements was smaller than in the first ten motions (p<0.02). the knee w-fl/w-ext=0.69; p-fl/p-ext=0.65 in the last ten motions were lower than in the first ten movements: w-fl/w-ext=0.73; p-fl/p-ext=0.71 (p<0.002). therefore the knee joint trauma may occur more probably after fatigue appearance. the positive correlation between thigh muscles tmax and w, p in the first ten and last ten knee movements (p<0.01) confirms that strength training of muscles will improve not only the maximal strength but also the fatigue resistance. conclusion. the significant positive correlation between thigh (hamstrings and quadriceps femoris) muscles peak torques and the mean work and power of the same muscles in the first ten and last ten knee flexion-extension movements (p<0.01) confirms that the strength training of these muscle groups will improve not only the maximal strength but also the fatigue resistance of these muscles.
sports_injuries	the use of biologic treatment strategies in the nonoperative and operative care of orthopaedic and sports injuries continues to expand in parallel with our understanding of the healing response after injuries. this is in large part because of the growing number of basic, translational, and clinical studies investigating the use of biologic augmentation in musculoskeletal care. platelet-rich plasma, growth factors, and cell-based and gene-based treatments are among the most commonly explored options, and they have found varying levels of success in promoting soft tissue and osseous healing. preclinical studies have illustrated the potential for broad application of biologic treatment strategies in orthopaedics. however, many important questions remain regarding delivery, efficacy, and safety of biologic treatments. additional well-designed basic and clinical studies are of paramount importance to create evidence-based guidelines for the implementation of biologic treatments in orthopaedics.

hepatitis_c	background: the effect of hepatitis c virus (hcv) coinfection on cd4+t cell recovery in treated hiv-infected children is poorly understood. objective: to compare cd4+ t cell recovery in hiv/hcv coinfected children with recovery in hiv monoinfected children. method: we studied 355 hiv monoinfected and 46 hiv/hcv coinfected children receiving antiretroviral therapy (art) during a median follow-up period of 4.2 years (interquartile range: 2.7-5.3 years). our dataset came from the ukraine pediatric hiv cohort and the hiv/hcv coinfection study within the european pregnancy and paediatric hiv cohort collaboration. we fitted an asymptotic nonlinear mixed-effects model of cd4+ t cell reconstitution to age-standardized cd4 counts in all 401 children and investigated factors predicting the speed and extent of recovery. results: we found no significant impact of hcv coinfection on either preart or long-term age-adjusted cd4 counts (z scores). however, the rate of increase in cd4 z score was slower in hiv/hcv coinfected children when compared with their monoinfected counterparts (p < 0.001). both monoinfected and coinfected children starting art at younger ages had higher preart (p < 0.001) and long-term (p < 0.001) cd4 z scores than those who started when they were older. conclusions: hiv/hcv coinfected children receiving art had slower cd4+ t cell recovery than hiv monoinfected children. hiv/hcv coinfection had no impact on pre-art or long-term cd4 z scores. early treatment of hiv/hcv coinfected children with art should be encouraged.
sports_injuries	pediatric and adolescent sports participation has increased with a concomitant increase in injuries. sports have transitioned from recreational to deliberate, structured activities wherein success is determined by achievement of 'elite' status. this has led to specialization in a single sport with intensive, repetitive activity at younger ages causing physical and emotional consequences, particularly true for the growing athlete who is particularly susceptible to injury. clinicians caring for this population must understand the epidemiology of youth sports specialization, the unique physiology/structure of this age group, and the potential physical and emotional consequences.
cancer	a novel label-free system for the sensitive fluorescent detection of deoxyribonuclease i (dnase i) activity has been developed by utilizing dna-templated silver nanocluster/graphene oxide (dna-agnc/go) nanocomposite. agnc is first synthesized around c-rich template dna and the resulting dna-agnc binds to go through the interaction between the extension dna and go. the resulting dna-agnc/go would show quite reduced fluorescence signal because the fluorescence from dna-agncs is quenched by go. in the presence of dnase i, however, it degrades the dna strand within dna/rna hybrid duplex probe employed in this study, consequently releasing rna which is complementary to the extension dna. the released free rna then extracts dna-agnc from go by hybridizing with the extension dna bound to go. this process would restore the quenched fluorescence, emitting highly enhanced fluorescence signal. by employing this assay principle, dnase i activity was reliably identified with a detection limit of 0.10 u/ml which is lower than those from previous fluorescence-based methods. finally, the practical capability of this assay system was successfully demonstrated by its use to determine dnase i activity in bovine urine.

hepatitis_c	background & aims: cryoglobulins (circulating immune complexes of polyclonal igg, monoclonal igm, and rheumatoid factor) are detected in the circulation of 40% to 60% of patients with chronic hepatitis c virus infection, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (cv) is observed in approximately 10% of patients. we aimed to assess the clinical and immune effects of direct-acting antiviral treatment. methods: we performed a prospective study of 64 patients with hcv infection with circulating cryoglobulins receiving direct-acting antiviral therapy at a single center in barcelona, spain, from january 2014 through april 2016. patients were classified as having cv (n = 35) or asymptomatic circulating cryoglobulins (acc, n = 29). clinical response was considered complete if a patient 's birmingham vasculitis activity score (version 3) was 0, or if all affected organs improved 12 weeks after the end of therapy. a complete immunologic response (cir) was defined as no detection of circulating cryoglobulins and normalized levels of complement and/or rheumatoid factor. results: clinical manifestations of cv included purpura (65%), weakness (70%), arthralgia (31%), myalgia (20%), peripheral neuropathy (50%), and renal involvement (20%). at baseline, patients with cv had significantly higher levels of rheumatoid factor and lower levels of c4 complement than patients with acc, whereas cryocrits were similar between groups (3.2% vs 2.6%). overall, 60 patients (94%) had a sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy. among patients with cv, the median birmingham vasculitis activity score (version 3) decreased from 9 (range, 2-31) to 3 (range, 0-12) (p <.001). twenty-five patients with cv (71%) achieved a complete clinical response. immune-suppressive therapy was reduced for 4 of 13 patients and withdrawn for 6 of 13. overall, 48% of patients achieved a cir. a low baseline cryocrit level (< 2.7%) was the only factor associated with cir (odds ratio, 9.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-44; p =.03). conclusions: viral eradication was associated with clinical improvement in most patients with cv. markers of immune activation, including circulating cryoglobulins, persisted in 52% of patients with cv or acc, despite a sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy. a longer follow-up period after viral eradication might be necessary to ensure a normal immune response.
multiple_sclerosis	background and purpose: increasing evidence suggests the presence of demyelination in the normal-appearing white matter (nawm) of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd). the objective was to determine the presence of subclinical demyelination in the nawm of patients with nmosd using myelin water imaging (mwi). methods: whole brain and regions-of-interest (rois) analyses, including the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, and optic radiation, were conducted in the nawm of 28 nmosd patients and 18 healthy controls (hcs) using two mwi modalities: conventional mwi and direct visualization of short transverse relaxation time component (vista) mwi. results: conventional myelin water fractions (mwfs) of the global nawm and three rois (centrum semiovale, corona radiata, and genu of the corpus callosum) were slightly lower in nmosd patients than in hcs, although not statistically significant. on the other hand, vista mwf values of the global nawm and all rois except the genu of the corpus callosum were significantly lower in nmosd patients relative to hcs. in particular, the mwf in the optic radiation was significantly reduced in nmosd patients relative to hcs in both mwi methods, even in patients who had no brain involvement. additionally, patients with optic neuritis showed lower mwf than patients without optic neuritis and a negative correlation was identified between the mwf of the optic radiation and visual functional system score. conclusions: this study identified the presence of widespread demyelination in the nawm of nmosd patients and highlighted the optic radiation as a site of marked demyelination.
birth_control	objectives: the objective of this study was to investigate factors of condom use among a sample of 490 sexually active chinese college students. methods: a cross-sectional survey by systematic sampling was conducted on students' interpersonal sexual communication, media exposure, and condom use. multiple regression was employed for analysis. results: self-efficacy, peer and partner sexual communication, parent norms about condom usage, hiv/aids information from brochures, and exposure to sexual content in books were associated with variables related to condom use. conclusions: the current study underscores the importance of self-efficacy and peer and partner sexual communication in hiv preventive intervention programs that promote condom use among young chinese.
heart_disease	chronic subdural hematoma (csdh) is one of the most common intracranial hematomas worldwide with a high incidence in the general population. however, the optimum treatment for csdh is burr-hole drainage with or without rinse considering the poor outcomes of csdh in aged patients, and ambiguous prediction of recurrence in many sides of recurrent csdhs who have been analyzed, new effective therapies are needed for those csdhs who are predicated to have poor prognosis for surgery and/or have a higher risk of recurrence. statins, which is the first-line treatment for patients with high cholesterol and coronary heart disease. however, statins are still not solely limited in the treatment of these diseases. it has been demonstrated that statins could improve csdh due to its effect of regulation of angiogenesis and inflammation. in this review, in order to provide potential new treatment for csdh we summarize the recent findings of statins in csdh in order to try to clarify the mechanisms of this effect.
birth_control	introduction: in recent years there has been an explosion in the development of medical apps, with more than 40,000 apps now available. nearly 100 apps allow women to track their fertility and menstrual cycles and can be used to avoid or achieve pregnancy. apps offer a convenient way to track fertility biomarkers. however, only some use evidence-based fertility awareness-based methods (fabms), which with ideal use have rates of effectiveness similar to those of commonly used forms of hormonal birth control. since having a baby or preventing a pregnancy are important responsibilities, it is critical that women and couples have access to reliable, evidence-based apps that allow them to accurately track their fertility. methods: we developed a tool to evaluate and rate fertility apps. this tool is specifically designed to help couples avoid pregnancy. results: results showed that the majority of fertility apps are not based on evidence-based fabms or include a disclaimer discouraging use for avoiding pregnancy. however, at least 1 app in each fabm category (except symptohormonal methods) had a perfect score on accuracy. conclusion: relying solely on an app to use an fabm, without appropriate training in the method, may not be sufficient to prevent pregnancy.
sports_injuries	context: researchers have identified high exposure to game conditions, low back dysfunction, and poor endurance of the core musculature as strong predictors for the occurrence of sprains and strains among collegiate football players. objective: to refine a previously developed injury-prediction model through analysis of 3 consecutive seasons of data. design: cohort study. setting: national collegiate athletic association division i football championship subdivision football program. patients or other participants: for 3 consecutive years, all 152 team members (age = 19.7 +/- 1.5 years, height = 1.84 +/- 0.08 m, mass = 101.08 +/- 19.28 kg) presented for a mandatory physical examination on the day before initiation of preseason practice sessions. main outcome measure(s): associations between preseason measurements and the subsequent occurrence of a core or lower extremity sprain or strain were established for 256 player-seasons of data. we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to identify optimal cut points for dichotomous categorizations of cases as high risk or low risk. both logistic regression and cox regression analyses were used to identify a multivariable injury-prediction model with optimal discriminatory power. results: exceptionally good discrimination between injured and uninjured cases was found for a 3-factor prediction model that included equal to or greater than 1 game as a starter, oswestry disability index score equal to or greater than 4, and poor wall-sit-hold performance. the existence of at least 2 of the 3 risk factors demonstrated 56% sensitivity, 80% specificity, an odds ratio of 5.28 (90% confidence interval = 3.31, 8.44), and a hazard ratio of 2.97 (90% confidence interval = 2.14, 4.12). conclusions: high exposure to game conditions was the dominant injury risk factor for collegiate football players, but a surprisingly mild degree of low back dysfunction and poor core-muscle endurance appeared to be important modifiable risk factors that should be identified and addressed before participation.
cancer	objective: a recent study identified a survival benefit with prophylactic neck dissection (nd) at the time of primary surgery as compared with watchful waiting followed by therapeutic neck dissection for nodal relapse, in patients with cn0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc). alternative management of cn0 neck cancer is recommended to minimize the adverse effects of nd, indicating the need for sentinel node biopsy (snb) and limited neck dissection. we conducted a multicenter phase ii study to examine the feasibility of snb for clinically n0 oscc. methods: previously untreated n0 oscc patients (n = 57) with clinical late-t2 or t3 tumors were enrolled across 10 institutions. snb navigated with multislice frozen section analysis of sentinel nodes (sns) and snb supported sentinel node lymphatic basin dissection (sn basin dissection) were performed in a one-stage procedure. the endpoint was to investigate the rate of false-negative metastases after sn basin dissection and snb alone. results: most tumors were late-t2 lesions (n = 50; 87.7%). sns were identified in all patients. a total of 196 sns were detected. among these sns, 35 (17.8%) were positive for metastasis (9 in level i, 12 in level ii, 12 in level iii, 1 in level v and 2 in the contralateral region of the neck). the false-negative rate of snb supported by sn basin dissection and snb alone was 4.5% and 9.1%, respectively. the concordance of the sn status in intraoperative frozen sections with the permanent histopathology was 97.4% (191/196). the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative pathological evaluation were 85.7% (30/35) and 100% (30/30), respectively. the 3-year overall survival (os) and disease-free survival was 89.5% and 82.5%, respectively. the os of sn-negative patients was significantly longer than that of sn-positive patients (p = 0.047). conclusion: the current study verified that sn basin dissection was a useful back-up procedure for snb performed as a one-stage procedure, showing a low false-negative rate. snb, alone is an appropriate staging method for patients with clinical n0 staging, and a reliable procedure to determine the appropriate levels for neck dissection.

sprains_and_strains	many construction injuries are musculoskeletal related in the form of sprains and strains arising from the handling of materials, which are specified by designers. the paper presents the results of a study conducted among delegates attending two 'designing for h&s' (dfh&s) seminars using a questionnaire. the salient findings include: the level of knowledge relative to the mass and density of materials is limited; designers generally do not consider the mass and density of materials when designing structures and elements and specifying materials; to a degree designers appreciate that the mass and density of materials impact on construction ergonomics; designers rate their knowledge of the mass and density of materials as limited, and designers appreciate the potential of the consideration of the mass and density of materials to contribute to an improvement in construction ergonomics. conclusions include: designers lack the requisite knowledge relative to the mass and density of materials; designers are thus precluded from conducting optimum design hazard identification and risk assessments, and tertiary built environment designer education does not enlighten designers relative to construction ergonomics. recommendations include: tertiary built environment designer education should construction ergonomics; professional associations should raise the level of awareness relative to construction ergonomics, and design practices should include a category 'mass and density of materials' in their practice libraries.
multiple_sclerosis	aims and objectives. to explore and describe how young adults between 18-25 years of age experienced growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis and how these experiences continue to influence their daily lives. background. chronic parental illness is occurring in about 10% of families worldwide, but little is known about how the children experience growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis during their childhood and into young adulthood. design. we chose a qualitative design using a phenomenological approach based on giorgi. methods. exploratory and open-ended interviews with 14 young adults were conducted. results. the essence of the phenomenon of having a parent with multiple sclerosis was synthesized into 'striving for balance between caring and restraint' from two themes 'caring' and 'restraint' and eight subthemes. participants' experiences of caring for parents with multiple sclerosis continued influencing their other close relationships, in which they tended to assume responsibility while concealing some of their feelings and desires. most participants showed restraint among parents with and without multiple sclerosis, friends and partners. conclusion. it seems that one of the greatest challenges of having a parent with multiple sclerosis is achieving a balance between caring for others and asserting one 's own desires. relevance to clinical practice. healthcare professionals can support the family by encouraging family members to participate in consultations and to assist the parents in providing information about multiple sclerosis and its symptoms to the children. parents might need assistance in applying for help with domestic chores or referrals to support groups for their children or other family members.
skin_care	aims and objectivesthe aim of the study was to explore the experiences of older people as they self-managed following venous leg ulcer healing. the objectives were to describe the beliefs, attitudes, actions, enablers and barriers to self-management and to consider the impact of an e-learning client education package on how people approach recurrence prevention. backgroundvenous leg ulcers affect 1% of people worldwide and more than 3% of older people. up to 70% of ulcers reoccur. appreciation of the experience of self-management following healing can equip health services to more effectively prepare people for self-management in the longer term. designa descriptive exploratory design was used. methodsolder people who had received an e-learning education programme while their venous ulcer was active were interviewed after healing from july-september 2010. interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. resultsparticipants believed in the efficacy of compression therapy, skin care, activity and exercise and healthy eating to prevent recurrence, and engage in activities that reflect recommendations of the education. as beliefs and conduct of self-management activities can change over time, regular professional monitoring and support would assist people to refine health goals, plan self-management activities and prevent recurrence. conclusionsparticipation in a standardised education programme completed prior to healing informed successful self-management strategies among people who seek to prevent venous leg ulcer recurrence. further research should consider the benefits of regular, ongoing professional monitoring and support among this group. relevance to clinical practiceclinicians have a role in supporting their clients to know about, perform and believe in the importance of self-management strategies for healing and recurrence prevention. clinicians require the capacity to support clients which standardised client education tools can facilitate.
birth_control	the purpose of this qualitative secondary data analysis is to examine the major influencers on mothers with hiv in their childbearing decisions, as well as how those influencers shape conversations with clinicians and health-care providers regarding hiv treatment and prevention. the original study gained insight into the reproductive decision-making of mothers with hiv. by analyzing a subsample of 15 interviews from an original cohort of 25 participants in the earlier study, three major themes were identified as follows: (1) family members, not health-care providers, influence reproductive decisions; (2) negative attitudes toward subsequent pregnancies are mainly due to hiv transmission; and (3) birth control decisions were predominately supported by family members, while health-care providers were not consulted.
parkinson's_disease	impaired dual tasking, namely the inability to concurrently perform a cognitive and a motor task (e.g. 'stops walking while talking'), is a largely unexplained and frequent symptom of parkinson 's disease. here we consider two circuit-level accounts of how striatal dopamine depletion might lead to impaired dual tasking in patients with parkinson 's disease. first, the loss of segregation between striatal territories induced by dopamine depletion may lead to dysfunctional overlaps between the motor and cognitive processes usually implemented in parallel cortico-striatal circuits. second, the known dorso-posterior to ventro-anterior gradient of dopamine depletion in patients with parkinson 's disease may cause a funnelling of motor and cognitive processes into the relatively spared ventro-anterior putamen, causing a neural bottleneck. using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain activity in 19 patients with parkinson 's disease and 26 control subjects during performance of a motor task (auditory-cued ankle movements), a cognitive task (implementing a switch-stay rule), and both tasks simultaneously (dual task). the distribution of task-related activity respected the known segregation between motor and cognitive territories of the putamen in both groups, with motor-related responses in the dorso-posterior putamen and task switch-related responses in the ventro-anterior putamen. during dual task performance, patients made more motor and cognitive errors than control subjects. they recruited a striatal territory (ventro-posterior putamen) not engaged during either the cognitive or the motor task, nor used by controls. relatively higher ventro-posterior putamen activity in controls was associated with worse dual task performance. these observations suggest that dual task impairments in parkinson 's disease are related to reduced spatial focusing of striatal activity. this pattern of striatal activity may be explained by a loss of functional segregation between neighbouring striatal territories that occurs specifically in a dual task context.
polycythemia_vera	the jak2 v617f mutant -mediated aberrant signaling pathway is a hallmark of myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns). although cytokine-inducible src homology 2 protein (cis) and suppressors of cytokine signaling (socs) are negative regulators of the jak-stat pathway, the functional role of cis/socs family members in the jak2 v617f mutant -induced oncogenic signaling pathway has not yet been elucidated. in this study, we found that the expression of cis and socs1 was induced through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (stat5) in not only the cells stimulated with epo or il -3 but also the cells transformed by the jak2 v617f mutant. cell proliferation and tumor formation in nude mice induced by the jak2 v617f mutant were significantly enhanced when the expression of cis was silenced using an rna interference technique, whereas the knockdown of socs1 had no effect. the enforced expression of cis caused apoptotic cell death in the transformed by jak2 v617f mutant and drastically inhibited the jak2 v617f mutant -induced tumor formation. cis interacted with phosphorylated epor at y401, which was critical for the activation of stat5 and erk. whereas the activation of stat5 and erk in the transformed cells by jak2 v617f mutant was increased by the knockdown of cis, the enforced expression of cis reduced the activation of these molecules. furthermore, these anti -tumor effects of cis required the function of sh2 domain and its tyrosine phosphorylation at y253. we herein elucidated the mechanism by which cis functions as a novel type of tumor suppressor in jak2 v617f mutant -induced tumorigenesis.

overactive_bladder	purpose: to evaluate changes in nocturia after surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea (osa). methods: a total of 66 patients were included in the present study. all had been diagnosed with osa syndrome by polysomnography and underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (uppp). preoperative and postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms (luts), quality of life (qol), and nocturia episodes were evaluated using the international prostate symptom score (ipss) and overactive bladder symptom score (oabss) questionnaires. three months postoperatively, telephone interviews were performed to determine the success of surgery, current luts, and nocturia episodes. patients were divided into surgical success and failure groups. surgical success was defined as snoring decrease more than 50% based on the patient 's subjective judgment. results: the response rate was 56% and success rate was 73%. in all patients, nocturia episodes significantly decreased from 1.7 +/- 1.1 to 0.8 +/- 1.2 (p = 0.002). mean ipss score, oabss score, and qol scores were also significantly improved. the success group showed a significant decrease in nocturia episodes, and total ipss, oabss, and qol scores. however, the failure group did not show significant changes in all parameters. conclusions: osa correction improved nocturia as well as other luts. these improvements were not observed in the failure group. this study shows that osa is a cause of nocturia and that other luts and nocturia can be improved by surgical correction of osa.
cancer	this review reports on the beneficial pharmacological properties of naturally occurring polyphenols for the treatment of inflammatory pulmonary diseases. in addition, it presents an overview of the different types of inhalable formulations which have been developed in order to achieve efficient delivery of polyphenols to the respiratory tract. the main biological activities of polyphenols (anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory) are covered, with particular emphasis on the studies describing their therapeutic effects on different factors and conditions characteristic of lung pathologies. special focus is on the technological aspects which influence the pulmonary delivery of drugs. the various polyphenol-based inhalable formulations reported in the literature are examined with specific attention to the preparation methodologies, aerosol performance, lung deposition and in vitro and in vivo polyphenol uptake by the pulmonary epithelial cells.
hypothyroidism	background: climacteric is associated with both depression and metabolic dysregulation. scarce evidence suggests that metabolic dysregulation may predict poor response to conventional antidepressants. response to depression treatment has not been studied in homeopathic medicine. the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic disorders in depressed climacteric women treated with homeopathic medicines, fluoxetine or placebo, and if these alterations have any association with response to depression treatment. methods: one hundred and thirty-three mexican women (40-65 years) with depression, enrolled in the homdep-menop study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, three-arm trial with a 6 week follow-up, underwent a complete medical history and clinical examination. metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline. association between baseline metabolic parameters and response to depression treatment was analyzed with bivariate analysis in the three groups. odds ratios (or) with their 95% confidence interval (95% ci) were calculated. metabolic parameters were considered for inclusion in the logistic regression model if they had a statistically significant relationship with response rate on bivariate analysis at p < 0.05 or if they were clinically relevant. results: overall combined prevalence (obesity and overweight) was 86.5%; 52.3% had hypertriglyceridemia; 44.7% hypercholesterolemia; 46.7% insulin resistance; and 16% subclinical hypothyroidism. there was no statistically significant association between dyslipidemia, overweight, or insulin resistance and non-response in the homeopathy group [or (95% ci) 1.57 (0.46-5.32), p = 0.467; 0.37 (0.003-1.11), p = 0.059; 0.67 (0.16-2.7), p = 0.579, respectively]. conclusion: metabolic dysregulation was not significantly associated with response to depression treatment in depressed climacteric women treated with individualized homeopathic treatment (iht), fluoxetine or placebo. due to the high prevalence of metabolic disorders and its relationship with depression in the climacteric, further investigation should be focused on whether individualized prescriptions based on classical homeopathy for depressed climacteric women have an effect on metabolic parameters, and/or if treating the metabolic disorders at the same time could lead to higher response rates.
cancer	a series of ph/redox dual stimuli-responsive poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)(25)-block-poly(l-histidine)(n) (p[mpc])(25)-b-p[his](n), n=20, 35, 50, and 75) copolymers consisting of a ph-responsive p(his)(n) block and a biocompatible phospholipid analog p(mpc) block connected by a redox-responsive disulfide linker have been synthesized. the block copolymers are self-assembled into uniform micelles (approximate to 100 nm) in which doxorubicin (dox) is efficiently encapsulated. the in vitro release profile shows an enhanced release of dox at low ph (5.0) in 10 mm glutathione (gsh). the in vitro cell viability assays performed using various cell lines show that the blank hybrid micelles have no acute or intrinsic toxicity. a ph-dependent cytotoxicity is observed with the dox-loaded micelles, especially at ph 5.0. moreover, confocal microscopy images and flow cytometry results show the ph-dependent cellular uptake of dox-loaded micelles. therefore, the dox-loaded micelles can be considered a good candidate for cancer therapy.

birth_control	objective: to describe the rate of contraceptive use and types of contraception used by low-income women. design: a descriptive study was used to survey women about their contraceptive use and sexual behaviors 12 months prior to the time of the interview. participants and setting: a convenience sample of 110 low-income women living in three urban medically underserved neighborhoods who enrolled in a larger study was included. methods: univariate and bivariate descriptive analyses were conducted using stata 10. results: forty-eight (43.6%) of the women were african american, 43 (39.1%) were hispanic, and 17 (15.5%) were white. the women were age 18 to 55 years (mean = 31 years). forty percent of these women who were not pregnant or planning to get pregnant had sex without contraceptives in the past 12 months. the percentage of women who used contraception decreased from 77.3% users in the last 12 months to 63.6% current users. the most common methods used within the last 12 months were condom use by male partner (28.2%), birth control pills (14.6%), contraceptive injection (12.7%), intrauterine device (10.9%), and the patch (1.8%). conclusions: many of the low-income women from medically underserved neighborhoods did not use contraceptives and of those who used contraceptives, the majority used the least effective methods.
hepatitis_c	health care is changing rapidly, so we must change with the times to develop more efficient, practical, cost-effective, and, importantly, high-quality methods to care for patients. we teach medical students that optimal patient care requires face-to-face interaction to collect information on the patient 's history and perform the physical examination. however, management of many patients-especially those with chronic diseases-does not always require physical examination. telemedicine offers an opportunity to take advantage of technology while leveraging the progressive push toward efficiency and value but also requires the belief that excellent patient care is not always provided in person. telemedicine can include a variety of aspects of patient care adapted to be performed remotely, such as telemonitoring, tele-education, teleconsultation, and telecare. all of these have been evaluated in gastroenterology practice and have demonstrated feasibility and patient preference but have produced mixed results regarding patient outcomes. by combining telemedicine tools and new care models, we can redesign chronic disease management to include fewer in-person visits when patients are well yet increase access for patients who need to be seen. this change could lead to higher-value care by improving the experience of care, decreasing costs, and improving the health of the population. barriers include reimbursement, licensing, and fear of litigation. however, if we hope to meet the needs of patients within our changing health care system, telemedicine should be incorporated into our strategy.
emergency_contraception	an increase in apoptotic activity has been observed in both the rabbit and the rat endometria following treatment with ru486. the aim of this study was to assess whether bax and bcl-2 signaling, in response to ru486, could be crucial role players mediating apoptosis in the rat uterus during early pregnancy. ru486 is a partial progesterone (p4) and estrogen receptor antagonist, functioning to actively silence p4 receptor gene-associated transcription. although an increase in apoptosis as a result of ru486 administration has been previously reported in rabbits, the specific apoptotic factors and pathways involved in driving this process have not yet been established. immunofluorescent techniques were used to determine protein expression levels of both box and bcl-2 in ru486-treated endometria at days 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 of pregnancy. the bax/bcl-2 index was used to determine the overall pro- or anti-apoptotic setting at each day of pregnancy, following ru486 administration. changes in the bax and bcl-2 gene expression levels as a consequence of ru486 administration were evaluated using rt-qpcr. both the protein and gene expression analyses suggest that ru486 induces a change toward an overall anti-apoptotic signal within the bax/bcl-2 pathway. these results suggest that the observed increase in apoptosis following ru486 administration is not driven by a shift in the bax/bcl-2 ratio toward cell death, when the p4 and estrogen receptors are partially inactivated by ru486, but is possibly regulated by another apoptotic pathway.

alzheimer's_disease	differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) has been employed to examine the thermal behavior of brain tissues affected by a drug-induced neurodegenerative disorder. an animal (mouse) model of scopolamine-induced dementia was used. the dsc measurements performed on supernatants of brain tissue homogenates revealed large differences between the heat capacity profiles for healthy animals and for animals with scopolamine-induced dementia. the heat capacity profiles of the supernatants from healthy animals displayed well expressed exothermic transitions peaking in the range 35-45 degrees c, thus preceding in temperature the endothermic denaturational transitions. no such exothermic transitions were found in other samples from the same animals, e.g., centrifugation sediments of brain homogenates, liver homogenates, blood plasma. remarkably, the low-temperature exotherms were completely abolished by the scopolamine treatment. the exothermic events may possibly reflect a process of aggregation of specific protein fractions in the brain supernatants. the reported findings may be important for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of cognitive impairment.

heart_disease	background: hospice care is most appropriate when a patient no longer benefits from curative treatment and has limited life expectancy. these patients may suffer from any type of life-limiting illness, including end-stage cancer, end-stage heart disease, end-stage renal failure, aids, and alzheimer 's disease, among other illnesses. patients are managed on their pain and symptoms and home hospice care manages these patients in the comfort of their own home, enabling patients to spend their last days with dignity and have a good quality of life. objective: to describe the home hospice patients at hca hospice care (hhc) singapore from 2000 to 2010. description of home care patients in terms of their sociodemographic profile and diagnosis at admission. we reviewed the electronic medical records of patients admitted into hhc from 2000 to 2010. results: patients had multiple admissions into hhc home hospice as identified in the electronic medical records (emr) between january 1, 2000, and december 31, 2010, but we only selected patient 's first admission into hhc home hospice for this analysis. of the 25,065 patients in the entire samples, 47.3% were males, 65.2% were married, and 84.3% were chinese. 50.9% of the patients died at home, 75.5% were referred from public hospitals, 53.9% of primary caregivers were children, and the mean age of the patients was 68.0 years. among all cancer patients admitted into hhc home hospice, lung cancer (23.6%) was the most common principal diagnosis for admission, followed by colorectal (10.5%) and liver cancers (7.7%). among noncancer patients, renal failure (7.0%) was the most common diagnosis. among male patients admitted into hhc home hospice, lung cancer (29.6%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by liver cancer (10.8%), colorectal cancer (10.0%), and end-stage renal failure (5.5%). for female patients, lung cancer (16.9%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by breast cancer (15.9%), colorectal cancer (11.0%), and end-stage renal failure (8.7%). ten-year trends of the sociodemographic profile and diagnosis at admission were further analyzed to determine home hospice services utilization and the needs of the home care patients. conclusion: with an increasing emphasis to encourage aging and dying in the community and more attention given to building up the home hospice industry 's capacity and capability, it is important to understand the profile of the patients who have been utilizing home hospice services. this also helps to plan and develop similar services in other parts of the world.
myelofibrosis	the janus kinase 1 (jak1) and jak2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is currently the only therapy indicated for intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis. results from clinical trials and experience in clinical practice have shown that ruxolitinib reduces myelofibrosis-related splenomegaly and symptom burden, and improves quality-of-life measures. in addition, ruxolitinib was associated with a survival advantage compared with placebo or conventional therapy in controlled trials. however, owing to the myelosuppressive effects of jak2 inhibition, ruxolitinib is associated with decreases in hemoglobin and platelet counts, particularly during the first 8-12 weeks of therapy. close monitoring of blood counts and careful dose management, particularly early in the course of therapy, are essential to avoid unnecessary cytopenias that may prompt premature treatment discontinuation by patients who otherwise would benefit from continued therapy. in general, starting doses and dose reductions should be used as recommended by the prescribing information based on platelet counts. a dose-escalation approach at the start of therapy is only recommended for patients with platelet counts of 50-100 x 10(9)/l. if possible, maximum tolerated doses should be maintained and extended treatment interruptions should be avoided to prevent lack or loss of treatment responses. an individualized dosing approach is key to long-term treatment success.
parenting	the current study examined parent heart rate (hr) dynamic changing patterns and their links to observed negative parenting (i.e., emotional unavailability and psychological control) during a parent-child conflict resolution task among 150 parent-child dyads (child age ranged from 6 to 12 years, m-age = 8.54 +/- 1.67). parent hr was obtained from electrocardiogram (ecg) data collected during the parent-child conflict resolution task. negative parenting was coded offline based on the video recording of the same task. results revealed that emotionally sensitive parents during the task showed greater hr increases while discussing a conflict and greater hr decreases while resolving the conflict, whereas emotionally unavailable parents showed no changes in hr. however, parent psychological control was not associated with hr dynamics during the task. these findings indicated the physiological underpinnings of parent emotional sensitivity and responsiveness during parent-child interactions. the potential association between hr baseline levels and parenting behaviors was also discussed.
skin_care	mild diaper dermatitis often occurs in children before toilet training is complete, particularly from 9 to 12 months of age, and the most common presentation is an irritant contact dermatitis. diaper dermatitis may account for up to 25% of dermatology visits to health care providers during the first year of life. fortunately, since the introduction of hypoallergenic, superabsorbent modern disposable diapers, the incidence and severity of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis has decreased dramatically. diaper dermatitis broadly refers to skin disorders that occur in the diaper area, such as skin eruptions triggered by diapers, rashes exacerbated by the diaper, and other events that occur in the diaper area. a number of skin conditions that can occur anywhere on the skin may present with distinctive findings in the diaper area. the following discussion will review the most common triggers of diaper dermatitis and contact irritant dermatitis, while focusing on the skin conditions that may be associated or overlap clinically with contact dermatitis.
multiple_sclerosis	1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxamide derivative vl15 has been recently developed as a selective cannabinoid cb2 receptor compound. given the high selectivity of this compound at the cannabinoid cb2 receptor and the well-known protective function of this receptor in neurological disorders with autoimmune component like multiple sclerosis, we assessed the immunomodulatory properties of vl15. we assessed on activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells), proliferation and viability, cell cycle progression and measured activation markers and the expression of phosphorylated proteins. we found that vl15 reduces pbmc proliferation slightly affecting cell vitality, blocks the cell cycle progression and down-regulates the levels of t cell activation markers as well as the expression of phosphorylated proteins, nf-kb, ikk alpha beta, ikb alpha, erk and akt. vl15 was also used in drug permeability assays on caco-2 cell line to evaluate its oral bioavailability and on mdckii-hmdr1 cell lines to estimate its propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion, in order to potentially maintain its efficiency on the infiltrating auto-reactive lymphocytes in the central nervous system. in these models, vl15 showed high intestinal absorption and good blood-brain barrier penetration. our findings suggest that vl15, by controlling the immune response, might find potential application as orally administered drug in pathologies like multiple sclerosis.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	purpose: we aimed to identify topics of research that have been neglected, undervalued, or overseen in the past 2 decades of placebo/nocebo research. methods: a highly specialized literature database containing >3200 articles on the placebo or nocebo effects or response was screened for articles covering placebo effects in nutrition, sports medicine, physical therapy, and psychotherapy; for article covering gender, age, and culture as influencing factors; for articles dealing with long-term outcome, multimodality; and for articles related to technical (ehealth, mhealth) aspects of placebo effects. findings: although placebo research has gained substantial progress over the past 2 decades, it has not resolved all its puzzles, it has ignored some obvious and some less obvious facets of the placebo topic, and it has overlooked that during these years, medicine has further developed and progressed, as has the doctor patient relationship and the social environment in which this communication happens. implications: the biggest threat for placebo research is that it may outdate itself by declaring all and everything as a placebo effect even if there may be better terms and concepts (eg, patient expectations, doctor patient communication, empathy), and by ignoring that medicine continuously changes its face, for patients as well as for clinical researchers. its biggest opportunity is the fact that it, as no other topic in medicine, requires both medical and psychological experts for its exploration and to stay updated.

menopause	age-and menopause-related impairment in working memory mediated by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) occurs in humans and nonhuman primates. long-term cyclic 17 beta-estradiol treatment rescues cognitive deficits in aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys while restoring highly plastic synapses. here we tested whether distributions of g protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (gper1) within monkey layer iii dlpfc synapses are sensitive to age and estradiol, and coupled to cognitive function. ovariectomized young and aged monkeys administered vehicle or estradiol were first tested on a delayed response test of working memory. then, quantitative serial section immunoelectron microscopy was used to determine the distributions of synaptic gper1. gper1-containing nonperforated axospinous synapse density was reduced with age, and partially restored with estrogen treatment. the majority of synapses expressed gper1, which was predominately localized to presynaptic cytoplasm and mitochondria. gper1 was also abundant at plasmalemmas, and within cytoplasmic and postsynaptic density (psd) domains of dendritic spines. gper1 levels did not differ with age or treatment, and none of the variables examined were tightly associated with cognitive function. however, greater representation of gper1 subjacent to the psd accompanied higher synapse density. these data suggest that gper1 is positioned to support diverse functions key to synaptic plasticity in monkey dlpfc.
parenting	purpose: this brief research report presents findings from a us national household survey on the number and percentage of parents with mental illness. methods: using combined annual data from the 2008-2014 national survey on drug use and health, parents were defined as having children in the household from birth to 18 years. prediction models developed in an earlier clinical study using a national survey on drug use and health subsample were used to estimate serious mental illness (smi). results: a total of 2.7 million parents (3.8%) had a smi in the past year and 12.8 million parents (18.2%) had any mental illness in the past year. mental illness was more common among mothers than fathers and least common among asians compared with other races. smi was less prevalent in parents who were aged 50 years and older compared with younger age groups. conclusions: the burden of mental illness in parents is high in the united states, especially among mothers. physicians who treat parents should routinely screen for mental illness and discuss its implications for parenting.

sports_injuries	the purpose of this study was to examine the perception of injury risk in the taekwondo community. members of the taekwondo community (n=298) completed an online survey in which they rated the perceived risk of injury across a range of different sports, including taekwondo. overall, the respondents perceived the risk of injury in their own sport to be lower than that in other collision and contact sports, including popular combat sports such as boxing, mixed martial arts, judo, and karate. males (odds ratio 0.50; p=0.006) and instructors/coaches (odds ratio 0.34; p<0.001) perceived the risk of injury to be significantly less compared to their female and athlete counterparts. because behaviour is determined by perceived rather than actual risk, underestimation of injury risk and concomitant overestimation of ability to negotiate risk may lead to an increased frequency of injury. therefore, a comprehensive injury prevention strategy for combat sports such as taekwondo should ensure that erroneous beliefs and attitudes about injury risk among participants are addressed.
skin_care	isoflavones are polyphenol compounds found mainly in legumes such as soybeans (glycine max (l.) merrill). these compounds can be found in different chemical forms; however, the beneficial effects for skin care have been mainly credited to their free forms. this manuscript claims to review the main effects of isoflavone aglycones on the skin, the different techniques for obtaining bioactive forms from soybeans, and the interest in incorporating them into topical systems. the benefits of dermatological application of isoflavones, as anti-aging action, estrogenic activity, wound healing properties, and antiphotocarcinogenic effects are highlighted. moreover, the advantages and drawbacks of the extraction techniques of soybeans, methods for converting glucosides into aglycones, and purification procedures are described. different strategies to incorporate these poorly soluble compounds in conventional or nanostructured delivery systems are also discussed. illustrative examples especially for genistein-loaded liposomes, nanoemulsions, nanocapsules and cyclodextrin complexation are reported.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background and aims food is the most important synchronizer of gastrointestinal motility and secretion. many patients with functional bowel or anorectal disorders complain of fecal urge and stool output after eating. patients and methods in this prospective observational study, 408 consecutive outpatients with functional bowel and/or anorectal disorders (74% female, 50.2 +/- 15.6 years, 24.8 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2)) filled rome iii questionnaires. depression and anxiety scores, a physiological evaluation (total and segmental colonic transit time, colonic transit response to eating using a standard 1000 kcal test meal, and anorectal manometry), were measured. univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were carried out according to the presence or not of stool output after eating. results defecation after eating was found in 21% of patients. these patients were not different according to the demographic characteristics of sex ratio (p=0.702), age (p=0.830), and bmi (p=0.314). in contrast, they had lower state anxiety (p=0.032), but similar scores of depression (p=0.240) and trait anxiety (p=0.933). they had similar manometric characteristics (anal pressure and rectal sensitivity), but a greater response to eating in all segments of the colon. there was an increase in the frequency of functional diarrhea (odds ratio=2.576, 95% confidence interval=1.312-5.056; p=0.006) and levator ani syndrome (odds ratio=2.331, 95% confidence interval=1.099-4.944; p=0.017), but no other functional bowel disorder including irritable bowel syndrome and its subtypes was found. conclusion stool output after eating is associated with clinical disorders but not physiological parameters. this symptom is not associated with irritable bowel syndrome, but a higher frequency of functional diarrhea. copyright (c) 2017 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
hepatitis_c	background: efficacious, well-tolerated, direct antiviral agents have drastically changed the prognosis of hepatitis c virus (hcv) disease, but real-world data for oral treatments are limited in key populations such as hiv/hcv coinfection with advanced liver disease. daclatasvir (dcv) efficacy and safety was assessed in the french ""autorisation temporaire d'utilisation"" (atu) program, providing dcv ahead of market authorization to patients with advanced hcv disease without other treatment options. methods: this was a subanalysis of hiv/hcv coinfected atu patients treated with dcv plus sofosbuvir (sof). recommended duration was 24 weeks; addition of ribavirin (rbv) and/or shorter treatment was at the physician 's discretion. the primary efficacy analysis was sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12 (svr12; modified intention-to-treat). safety was assessed by spontaneous adverse event reporting. results: the efficacy population (n = 407) was mostly cirrhotic (72%, of whom 18% were decompensated), hcv treatment-experienced (82%), and infected with genotypes 1 (69%), 3 (12%), or 4 (19%). median cd4 was 555 cells/mm3; 95% had hiv rna <50 copies/ml. most (74%) were treated for 24 weeks; 14% received rbv. svr12 was 92% overall (95% confidence interval: 88.6% to 94.0%); 90% (86.4% to 93.2%) in patients with cirrhosis; 95% (88.9% to 97.5%) in patients without cirrhosis. svr12 was consistent across hcv genotypes and antiretroviral regimens. among 617 patients with safety data, 7 discontinued for an adverse event and 10 died. conclusions: dcv+sof +/- rbv achieved high svr12 and was well tolerated in this large real-world cohort of hiv/hcv coinfected patients with advanced liver disease.
headache	introduction: primary headaches have high epidemiologic impact but their symptomatic treatment often remains problematic. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are frequently used, but their modality of employment and efficacy/differential efficacy are highly variable. this study investigated current nsaid use for episodic headache at an italian headache center (january 2000 to february 2013). methods: a retrospective evaluation was performed on 6,443 patient records: migraine (n = 2,330), tension-type headache (tth; n = 807), and migraine plus tth (n = 3,306). results: among migraine patients, 80% had used nsaids in the past year. preferences were: nimesulide (57%), ketoprofen (25%), and ibuprofen (24%); complete efficacy was significantly higher than incomplete/absent efficacy (p < 0.0001). nsaids were replaced with triptans in 53% of patients at first visit; after 1 year there was a spontaneous significant return to nsaids (56%; p < 0.0005). among tth patients, 90% were nsaid users; preferences were: nimesulide (48%), ketoprofen (47%), and diclofenac (19%), with significantly higher complete vs. incomplete/ absent efficacy (nimesulide and ketoprofen, p < 0.02). replacement with analgesics was performed in 24% of patients; after 1 year, there was a 29% return to nsaids. among migraine plus tth patients, 89% were nsaid users. preferences were: nimesulide (44%), ibuprofen (42%), and ketoprofen (38%), with significantly higher complete vs. incomplete/absent efficacy (0.001 < p < 0.0001). replacement with analgesics was performed in 31% of patients; after 1 year, there was a 37% return to nsaids. conclusions: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in headache was higher than could be hypothesized based on guidelines, with nsaid preferences not entirely coinciding with international recommendations. this outcome suggests the need for greater awareness of all treatment options in headache by both patients and physicians.
menopause	the authors here report a 54-year-old (gravida 0, para 0), who claimed to have had her menarche at age 13 and menopause at 52 years. two months prior to presentation, the subject first noticed a hard but elastic fist-sized mass in the left inguinal region that gradually grew, causing pressure-related pain. although the external genitalia appeared female, the vagina was short and blind-ending, and no uterus or ovaries were identified on transvaginal ultrasound. chromosome banding results (g-band method) showed 46xy. laparoscopy revealed no traces of a vestigial uterus or ovaries; thus, based on the appearance of the external genitalia, a diagnosis of testicular feminization syndrome was made. pathological testing of the palpable mass led to a diagnosis of seminoma with leydig cell hyperplasia. thus, in this case, the development of a seminoma in an undescended testis led to the detection of testicular feminization syndrome.
cancer	lung transplantation is a necessary step for the patients with the end stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the use of artificial lungs is a promising alternative to natural lung transplantation which is complicated and is restricted by low organ donations. for successful lung engineering, it is important to choose the correct combination of specific biological cells and a synthetic carrier polymer. the focus of this study was to investigate the interactions of human lung epithelial cell line ncl-h292 that is involved in lung tissue development with the biodegradable poly(epsilon-caprolactone) before and after its chemical modification to evaluate potential for use in artificial lung formation. also, the effect of polymer chemical modification on its mechanical and surface properties has been investigated. the poly(epsilon-caprolactone) surface was modified using aminolysis followed by immobilization of gelatin. the unmodified and modified polymer surfaces were characterized for roughness, tensile strength, and ncl-h292 metabolic cell activity. the results showed for the first time the possibility for nci-h292 cells to adhere on this polymeric material. the resazurin assay showed that the metabolic activity at 24h postseeding of 80% in the presence of the unmodified and greater than 100% in the presence of the modified polymer was observed. the roughness of the poly(epsilon-caprolactone) increased from 4 to 26nm and the film strength increased from 0.01 to 0.045 kn when the material was chemically modified. the results obtained to date show potential for using modified poly(epsilon-caprolactone) as a scaffold for lung tissue engineering.
hypothyroidism	background: hashimoto 's thyroiditis (ht) is the most common autoimmune thyroid disease that may lead to hypothyroidism due to progressive destruction of the thyroid. the etiology of ht is unclear. however, it is associated with multiple genetic predispositions. consanguinity has been associated with an increased susceptibility to different inherited conditions. this study investigated the association between consanguinity and risk of ht for the first time. methods: using a case-control study design, 298 ht patients were compared with two subject groups: (i) 299 participants with non-ht hypothyroidism, and (ii) 298 healthy control participants. the three groups were age and sex matched. presence of consanguinity among the parents was compared in these groups, and odds ratios (or) were calculated to establish a correlation. results: consanguinity significantly increased the risk of ht (compared with healthy subjects; or= 3.3; p < 0.0001). in addition, consanguinity was a significant risk factor for ht compared with non-ht hypothyroidism patients (or= 2.8; p < 0.0001). however, the prevalence of consanguinity was not significantly different in non-ht hypothyroidism patients and healthy subjects. conclusions: the results suggest that the risk for ht is increased in consanguineous unions, but no significant increase in the risk of non-ht hypothyroidism was observed. however, for more precise risk estimates, larger studies that include different populations may be helpful. these findings highlight the health impact of consanguinity and have applications in empiric risk estimations in genetic counseling, particularly in countries with high rates of consanguineous marriages.
diabetes	purpose: to assess the frequency of blood glucose level higher than 150 mg/dl in non-diabetic patients presenting for fdg pet. methods: we reviewed the electronic medical record ( emr) of all lymphoma patients who had at least one fdg pet/ct from july 1, 2014 through june 30, 2015. we extracted the blood glucose level at the time of the fdg pet during this 1-year time period and any previous pet scans these patients had. patients' diabetic status was determined from emr. results: one hundred seventeen patients with 574 scans were included: 91 non-diabetic with 429 scans and 26 diabetic patients with 145 scans. blood glucose level ranged from 44 to 259 mg/dl: 44 to 144 mg/dl in nondiabetic patients and 73 to 259 mg/dl in diabetic patients. there was no non-diabetic patient with a glucose level higher than 150 mg/dl at any occasion. only one scan was performed with 144 mg/dl of glucose. all other scans were performed with a glucose level less than 140 mg/dl. there were nine diabetic patients with glucose level less than 150 mg/dl prior to all of their scans and 17 diabetic patients with a glucose level higher than 150 mg/dl prior to pet at least on one occasion. conclusions: in all non-diabetic patients, blood glucose level was below the lower limit of the recommended range prior to all their fdg pet scans while this was not the case in diabetic patients. we conclude that measuring blood glucose level prior to fdg pet may be limited to diabetic patients.
low_testosterone	objective: the objectives of the study were to assess (1) if serum levels of testosterone differ between men with and those without st-elevation myocardial infarction, and (2) to determine the association of testosterone with the outcome of st-elevation myocardial infarction (stemi). methodology: this was hospital based case control study, conducted at coronary care unit of teaching hospital, karapitiya, galle, sri lanka from january 2010 to december 2011. two hundred and six males (103 patients with stemi and 103 controls without a history of cad) were studied. they were followed up for one year for the occurrence of clinically significant adverse cardiovascular events. serum total testosterone, lipids and plasma glucose were estimated. results: the basal serum total testosterone in patients was significantly lower compared to controls (11.47 +/- 3.3 vs. 18.15 +/- 7.2 nmol/l, p = 0.001). the results showed that total testosterone (p = 0.001; or = 0.75; 95 % ci = 0.66 - 0.85) was a significant independent predictor of stemi and it was a significant independent predictors of in-hospital complications (p = 0.003, or = 1.68, 95 % ci = 1.2 - 2.36). conclusion: men with stemi have significantly lower basal serum total testosterone compared to controls. low testosterone is a risk factor of stemi. testosterone was independently related to the development of in-hospital complications of stemi.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	clinical practice guidelines for the management of constipation in adults aim to generate recommendations on the optimal approach to chronic constipation in the primary care and specialized outpatient setting. their main objective is to provide healthcare professionals who care for patients with chronic constipation with a tool that allows them to make the best decisions about the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of this condition. they are intended for family physicians, primary care and specialist nurses, gastroenterologists and other health professionals involved in the treatment of these patients, as well as patients themselves. the guidelines have been developed in response to the high prevalence of chronic constipation, its impact on patient quality of life and recent advances in pharmacological management. the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation working group (grade) system has been used to classify the scientific evidence and strengthen the recommendations.

multiple_sclerosis	objective medullary streaks detected on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) imaging have been considered to be reflected ischemic regions in pediatric moyamoya disease. the purpose of this study was to evaluate these medullary streaks both clinically and radiologically and to discuss associated pathophysiological concerns. methods the authors retrospectively reviewed data from 14 consecutive pediatric patients with moyamoya disease treated between april 2009 and june 2016. clinical and radiological features and postoperative imaging changes were analyzed. in 4 patients, hyperintense medullary streaks on flair imaging (hmsf) at the level of the centrum semiovale were detected. results the hmsf were coincident with hyperintense medullary streaks on a t2-weighted image, though they were not completely coincident with the vasculature on either a t2*-weighted image or contrast-enhanced ct. analysis revealed significantly higher values in terms of mr angiography scores, number of flow voids of the basal ganglia, and the presence of the medullary artery in the group with hmsf than in those without. in contrast, the presence of white matter damage was significantly less frequent in the hmsf group. all hmsf disappeared after surgery, and the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at the same level was significantly reduced postoperatively. conclusions although hmsf should be associated with collateral circulation in moyamoya disease, other factors may be involved, including stagnated cerebrospinal fluid or vasogenic edema that is relevant to the impaired state of the white matter. findings in this study provide insight into the pathophysiological basis of the perivascular space in moyamoya disease.
cancer	rosmarinus officinalis l., a medicinal herb from the labiates family, has been reported to be of potential benefit in the treatment and prevention of several diseases. in particular its phenolics have demonstrated protective effects on various types of cancer through several mechanisms. the present study aimed to determine the effects of rosemary phenolic extracts on human cell functions, with particular regard to their anti-proliferative properties in three cell types u937, caco-2 and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the radical scavenging and ferric reducing abilities of the extracts have been assessed as well as their cyto-toxicity and effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. about 13 compounds were identified with dominance of rosmarinic acid in the methanolic extract and phenolic diterpens in the ethyl acetate fraction (carnosol, carnosic acid and methyl carnosate). the total polyphenolic content was important in the first extract with 2.5890.005 g/100g in gallic acid equivalent compared to 0.7630.005 g/100g. the methanolic fraction displayed higher antioxidant activity (dpphic50: 0.510mg/ml and frap: 1.7140.068 mmol fe2+/g) while ethyl acetate showed pronounced antiproliferative effects (ic50: 14.850.20g/ml and 14.952.32g/ml respectively for u937 and caco-2 cells). the anti-proliferative effect was associated with a cell cycle arrest in s phase for u937 (62% of the population at 5g/ml) with a concomitant decrease in g1 and g2/m phases. tested extracts displayed in addition early apoptotic effects in u937 and late apoptosis in caco-2 cells. the obtained data indicate that the identified phenolics are at least partially responsible for the observed cytotoxicity.
multiple_sclerosis	disease activity in multiple sclerosis (ms) has classically been defined by the occurrence of new neurological symptoms and the rate of relapses. definition of disease activity has become more refined with the use of clinical markers, evaluating ambulation, dexterity, and cognition. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) has become an important tool in the investigation of disease activity. number of lesions as well as brain atrophy have been used as surrogate outcome markers in several clinical trials, for which a reduction in these measures is appreciated in most treatment studies. with the increasing availability of new medications, the overall goal is to minimize inflammation to decrease relapse rate and ultimately prevent long-term disability. the aim of this review is to give an overview on commonly used clinical and imaging markers to monitor disease activity in ms, with emphasis on their use in clinical studies, and to give a recommendation on how to utilize these measures in clinical practice for the appropriate assessment of therapeutic response.
diabetes	background: this study aimed to examine the associations of age with the presence of complications and glycemic control in the northwest of iran. methods: a total of 649 people with diabetes who were >25 years old and had a caring record in diabetes clinics in two northwestern provinces of iran during 2014-15, were recruited in this cross-sectional study. general information including demographic, socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors were collected by trained interviewers. clinical information was retrieved from clinic 's record. univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to assess the predictors of diabetes outcome of interest as well as to clarify the role of age in relation to these outcomes. results: compared to the age group of7 years of disease record were 6 times more likely to have complications (oradj = 5.98 95% ci: 2.35-15.22). conclusion: although the prevalence of complications was higher among the older diabetic patients, they had a better glycemic control. the influential factors were variably associated with the two diabetes-related outcomes; therefore, a more comprehensive risk profiles assessment is needed for glycemic control.
low_testosterone	purpose: childhood cancer survivors (ccs) are at increased risk of primary gonadal insufficiency (pgi). this study evaluated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of pgi in ccs. methods: in this single-center, retrospective, observational, longitudinal study, we characterized ccs with pgi attending the oncology long-term follow-up (ltfu) clinic at an australian university hospital (january 2012-august 2014). from a cohort of 276 ccs, 54 (32 males) met criteria for pgi: elevated gonadotropins plus low estradiol/amenorrhoea (females) or low testosterone/small testicles for age (males). results: median age at primary diagnosis was 4.8 years (inter-quartile range [iqr] 3.0-9.7 years) and at ltfu, it was 22.3 years (iqr 18.2-25.7 years). fifty-three participants (98.1%) were treated with known highly gonadotoxic therapies: alkylating chemotherapy (96.3%), radiotherapy (70.3%), total body irradiation (29.6%), bone marrow transplantation (51.9%), or multimodal protocols (68.5%). at primary diagnosis, 86.7% participants were tanner stage i and at ltfu, 89.1% participants were tanner stage v. more females (95.5%; n=21) than males (40.6%; n=13) were treated with hormone development therapy (hdt) (p<0.01). of these, more than half (n=18; 7 males) required pubertal induction. there was no significant difference in serum luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone (lh/fsh), testosterone/estradiol between those untreated and those treated with hdt. among those on hdt, 60.7% had persistently elevated fshlh and 33.3% had low testosterone or estradiol. six males had semen analysis (five azoospermic, one oligospermic). psychological assessment was documented in 61.1% of participants, and two-thirds reported fertility concerns. conclusion: pgi is an evolving phenotype that is common in ccs. suboptimal treatment and non-adherence occur frequently. ongoing assessment is essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, adequate intervention and to promote hdt adherence.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: otilonium bromide (ob) is a spasmolytic agent acting as an l-type calcium channel antagonist in intestinal and colonic smooth muscle cells (smcs). we analyzed three independent clinical trials with homogeneous design on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). after 2 weeks receiving placebo, patients were randomized to receive ob (3 x 40 mg daily) or placebo for 15 weeks. we aimed to perform a pooled analysis of the data from these homogeneous clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of ob treatment on symptoms and global response of patients. methods: a total of 883 patients with ibs (69.8% women, mean age 46.2 years, 43.8% mixed type) were included, 442 treated with ob and 441 with placebo. the efficacy results from the three studies at weeks 5, 10 and 15 were pooled in an intention-to-treat (itt) strategy, analyzed with a logistic regression model and described by forest plots. results: despite a placebo effect in all efficacy variables, a significant therapeutic effect of ob was observed at weeks 10 and 15 with reference to: (a) intensity and frequency of abdominal pain; (b) rate of responders as evaluated by patients (71.8% at week 10 and 77.2% at week 15); (c) severity of bloating; (d) rate of responders as evaluated by physicians (55% at week 10 and 63.9% at week 15). no significant ob effect was observed in stool frequency and consistency. conclusions: ob is more effective than placebo in ibs treatment. therapeutic benefits are significant after 10 weeks and are maximal after 15 weeks of treatment.
cancer	introduction: differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) follow-up after thyroidectomy and radioiodine-ablation is performed mainly by thyroglobulin (tg), diagnostic iodine-131 whole body scan (dxwbs) and sonography. some patients with undetectable tg have thyroid-bed uptake after ablation in whom decision making regarding the need for retreatment is still controversial. methods: in this study, we enrolled dtc patients with undetectable tg but small thyroid residue in six-month-dxwbs following first radioiodine-ablation. patients with detectable tg, high tgab, suspicious neck lymphadenopathy in sonography and metastasis were excluded. ninety four patients were placed in two groups of cohort, i.e., radioiodine-retreatment group (n=36) versus observation (untreated) group (n=58). after six months, the clinical outcome was compared by evaluating dxwbs, tg, tgab and sonography. results: dxwbs showed sustained thyroid remnant in 47.2% of retreated patients while 34.5% of untreated group revealed negative dxwbs over the next period of follow-up. also, only 6 cases (16.7%) in retreatment group and 12 cases (20.7%) in observation group revealed an additional finding other than local faint rai uptake, including detectable serum tg, rising tgab or suspicious ultrasound finding, favoring no significant difference of the outcome as well as relative risk of new finding incidence between treated and untreated patients (ci 95% for relative risk: 0.58-2.41; p=0.630). conclusion: regarding sonologic and laboratory follow-up evidences, rai-retreatment shows no significant advantage over observation in dtc patients with tg negative, remnant positive dxwbs. in addition, residual thyroid tissue was completely disappeared in about one third of patients without retreatment.
hypothyroidism	the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (siadh) is reported as the most common cause of hyponatraemia. this retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated the diagnosis of siadh in 110 hospitalised patients in an australian tertiary hospital with reference to recently published clinical guidelines. investigation of siadh was incomplete in all but 20% of cases. adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism were not excluded in a significant number of cases.
diabetes	introduction: the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) in patients with type 2 diabetes (t2d) is high and it is associated with poor prognosis. hepatic steatosis results as a consequence of excessive hepatic lipid accumulation which correlates with insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, with subsequent oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis. areas covered: this article presents the main pathophysiologic mechanisms and currently available drugs evaluated for their therapeutic effects on nafld/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) and drugs under development that target relevant pathogenetic pathways. however, to date there is no particular drug approved for treatment of nafld in patients with t2d. expert commentary: early recognition and intervention are essential to ameliorate disease progression. specific recommendations are still needed for nafld/nash screening and diagnosis and therapeutic algorithm in patients with t2d. lifestyle optimization with significant weight loss is a key intervention in patients with nafld and t2d. pioglitazone, liraglutide, vitamin e, oca and pentoxifylline have proven some histological improvements in nash and omega 3-pufas were shown to decrease liver fat, but no specific recommendation can be made for treatment of nash. perhaps a combination of agents that target different pathogenic pathways are needed to better control disease progression, but more robust evidence for these agents is still needed.
hepatitis_c	purpose of review in the past few years, there have been important changes in the development of liver transplantation around the world. in particular, several emerging countries have rapidly developed transplant programs. there have also been important changes in liver allocation, utilization of donors by cardiac death, and living donors. a review of the practices in different countries around the world will help provide the reader with a better appreciation of their own program as well as the recognition of potential areas of improvement based on the experience of their colleagues. recent findings a recent series of articles has been published in the journal liver transplantation summarizing the practice of liver transplantation from representative countries around the world. summary the volume of liver transplant varies widely by country and there has been an important growth in volume in emerging countries. most liver transplant candidates are prioritized for surgery by the model for endstage liver disease score and with the exception of germany and the usa most patients are transplanted at model for endstage liver disease score from 18 to 20. hepatitis c is the most common indication for liver transplant with the notable exception of several european countries. innovative strategies to incentivize donation have been developed in several countries.
multiple_sclerosis	the role of human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) has been postulated as a trigger of systemic sclerosis (ssc). the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of antibodies against hcmv ul44 and ul57 antigens not tested in the past. sixty ssc patients, 40 multiple sclerosis and 17 normal controls (ncs), all anti-hcmv positive, were tested by immunoblotting. reactivity to hcmv antigens, expressed as arbitrary units (aus), was assessed for correlation with clinical and immunological parameters, including types of ssc-related autoantibodies. anti-ul44 and anti-ul57 hcmv antibodies were present in 3/60 (5%) and 58/60 (96.7%) ssc patients, respectively (p0.05) but strong anti-ul57 reactivity were more frequent in ssc compared to ncs (p = 0.007). anti-ul57 reactivity was not inhibited by ssc-specific autoantigens. anti-ul57 seropositivity did not correlate with demographic, clinical or immunological features of ssc. anti-hcmv ul57 antibodies are universally present in anti-hcmv-positive patients with ssc, while those against ul44 are rarely seen. because anti-ul57 lack disease specificity and are not involved in cross-reactive responses, their immunopathogenetic potential is to be questioned.
hepatitis_c	introduction: about one quarter of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected persons in serbia have also been found to be hepatitis c virus (hcv) co-infected. in the general population, hcv genotype 1 has been shown to be the most prevalent one. here, we present the first study on the distribution of hcv genotypes among hiv/hcv co-infected patients in serbia, in relation to epidemiological and clinical features. material and methods: the study included hiv/hcv co-infected and a group of hcv mono-infected patients in the period 1998-2012, with collection of epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data using a standardized questionnaire. the hcv genotyping to the level of pure genotype was performed by reverse hybridization. results: intravenous drug use (idu) was found to be significantly more prevalent among the co-infected patients (p < 0.01). hcv genotype 1 was detected in 87% of patients with mono-infection, compared to 46.3% of patients with co-infection (p < 0.01); genotypes 3 and 4 were significantly more common among co-infected patients (6% and 5%, vs. 27% and 25%, respectively). multivariate logistic regression confirmed idu, infection with non-1 hcv genotype and hcv viral load over 5 log to be predictors of hiv co-infection. conclusions: the hcv genotypes 3 and 4 were found to be significantly more prevalent among hiv/hcv co-infected patients in serbia, compared to hcv mono-infected patients, but also more prevalent compared to the european hiv/hcv co-infected cohort. history of idu represents an independent predictor of hcv genotypes 3 and 4 infection, with important implications for treatment.
multiple_sclerosis	helminth infections likely provide a protective influence against some immune-mediated and metabolic diseases because helminth infection dramatically decreased in developed countries shortly before the explosive rise in the prevalence of these diseases. the capacity of helminths to activate immune-regulatory circuits in their hosts and to modulate the composition of intestinal flora appears to be the mechanisms of protective action. animal models of disease show that various helminth species prevent and/or block inflammation in various organs in a diverse range of diseases. clinical trials have demonstrated that medicinal exposure to trichuris suis or small numbers of necator americanus is safe with minor, if any, reported adverse effects. this includes exposure of inflamed intestine to t.suis, asthmathic lung to n.americanus and in patients with atopy. efficacy has been suggested in some small studies, but is absent in others. factors that may have led to inconclusive results in some trials are discussed. to date, there have been no registered clinical trials using helminths to treat metabolic syndrome or its component conditions. however, the excellent safety profile of t.suis or n.americanus suggests that such studies should be possible.
birth_control	historical examples of demographic change, in china, italy, nigeria, utah, easter island, and elsewhere, together with simple mathematics and biological principles, show that stabilizing world population before it is limited by food supply will be more difficult than is generally appreciated. united nations population projections are wrong because they assume, in spite of the absence of necessary feedbacks, that all nations will converge rapidly to replacement-level fertility and thereafter remain at that level. education of women and provision of contraceptives have caused dramatic reductions in fertility, but many groups, including some that are well-educated, maintain high fertility. small groups with persistent high fertility can grow to supplant low-fertility groups, resulting in continued growth of the total population. the global average fertility rate could rise even if each country 's fertility rate is falling. in some low-fertility european countries where deaths exceed births, the population continues to grow because of immigration. producing more than two offspring is normal for all animal species with stable populations because their populations are limited by resources or predation rather than birth control. it may therefore be appropriate to view the growth of human population as the result not of excess fertility but rather of excess food.
skin_care	acne is a common skin condition with sebum overproduction, hyperkeratosis, propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) and staphylococcus aureus, and inflammation. punica granatum (pomegranate) is well-known for its anti-inflammatory effects; however, few studies have discussed the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. in this study, we found that pomegranate extract (pg-e) significantly reduced p. acnes-induced edema inwistar rat ears. therefore, an evaluation platform using multiple pathogenic mechanisms of acne was established to explore the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. results showed that pg-e inhibited bacterial growth and lipase activity. through a bioguided-fractionation-isolation system, four hydrolysable tannins, punicalagin (1), punicalin (2), strictinin a (3), and granatin b (4), were isolated. compounds 1 and 2 had greater anti-bacterial activities and anti-testosterone-induced hacat proliferative effects than the others. compounds 1, 3, and 4 displayed lipase inhibitory effects. compound 4 decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression and downregulated prostaglandin e-2 production in heat-killed p. acnes-treated raw 246.7 cells. in conclusion, pg-e is abundant in hydrolysable tannins that display multiple anti-acne capacities, including anti-bacterial, anti-lipase, anti-keratinocyte proliferation, and anti-inflammatory actions. hence, pg-e has great potential in the application of anti-acne and skin-care products, and punicalagin (1), the most effective component in pg-e, can be employed as a quality control marker.
low_testosterone	objective: to investigate the effects of mesterolone on prostate in patients treated for aging male syndrome. methods: the cross-sectional study was conducted from june to september, 2009, at endocrinology and metabolism department of yuzuncu yil university, van, turkey, and comprised patients with symptoms of aging male syndrome and/or low testosterone. they were given mesterolone 50mg/day per oral for two months. aging male symptoms and international prostate symptom score questionaires and prostate-related quality of life scores were completed and prostate ultrasonography (usg) was performed before and after the treatment. total testosterone, free testosterone, gonadotropins, estradiol, prolactin, sex-hormone binding globulin, as well as total and free prostate-specific antigen were also studied. results: of the 34 patients in the study, 22(64.70%) had their prostate volume increased, while 12(35.29%) had it decreased. the change, however, was not statistically significant (p<0.098). mesterolone significantly improved aging male symptoms, international prostate symptom and prostate-related quality of life scores (p<0.001). these improvements though significant were independent of the changes in prostate volume. total testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin andestradiol decreased, while free testosterone showed no change (p<0.002, p<0.001, p<0.024, p<0.337). the fraction of free testosterone increased (p<0.001), while total and free prostate-specific antigen did not change (p<0.368 and p<0.841) conclusion: mesterolone proved to be a safe alternative in the treatment of aging male syndrome. it also improved lower urinary tract symptoms and prostate-related quality of life.
hypothyroidism	background: in this study we evaluated whether vitamin b12 deficiency affects neonatal screening (ns) for congenital hypothyroidism (ch). methods: a cross-sectional study conducted from 2010 to 2011. a total of 10,740 infants were born in our hospital in this period. thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) was tested for ns and neonates with abnormal screening results (tsh >20 miu/l) were re-examined. two hundred and twenty-nine re-called subjects (re-call rate 2.3%) were compared to 77 randomly selected newborns with normal tsh screening among these term newborns in terms of serum tsh, free t4, vitamin b12 and homocysteine status. results: of the 229 re-called subjects, 11 infants with ch and 21 infants with transient tsh elevation were detected. in the normal tsh screening group, only two infants were diagnosed with transient tsh elevation. mean serum b12 levels were 126.4 +/- 48.7 pg/ml and 211.9 +/- 127.9 pg/ml in the positive tsh-screening group and the control group, respectively. there was a significant difference between positive and normal tsh-screening groups in regard to serum tsh, free t4, serum b12 and homocysteine levels. conclusions: we found a significant vitamin b12 deficiency in positive tsh-screening infants. beside the crucial role of vitamin b12 in newborns, deficiency seems to increase the recall rates of infants in an ns program for ch.
alzheimer's_disease	dysfunction of iron metabolism, which includes its uptake, storage, and release, plays a key role in neurodegenerative disorders, including parkinson 's disease (pd), alzheimer 's disease, and huntington 's disease. understanding how iron accumulates in the substantia nigra (sn) and why it specifically targets dopaminergic (daergic) neurons is particularly warranted for pd, as this knowledge may provide new therapeutic avenues for a more targeted neurotherapeutic strategy for this disease. in this review, we begin with a brief introduction describing brain iron metabolism and its regulation. we then provide a detailed description of how iron accumulates specifically in the sn and why daergic neurons are especially vulnerable to iron in pd. furthermore, we focus on the possible mechanisms involved in iron-induced cell death of daergic neurons in the sn. finally, we present evidence in support that iron chelation represents a plausable therapeutic strategy for pd.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	objectives:this study evaluates whether certain patient or parental characteristics are associated with gastroenterology (gi) referral versus primary pediatrics care for pediatric irritable bowel syndrome (ibs).methods:a retrospective clinical trial sample of patients meeting pediatric rome iii ibs criteria was assembled from a single metropolitan health care system. baseline socioeconomic status (ses) and clinical symptom measures were gathered. various instruments measured participant and parental psychosocial traits. study outcomes were stratified by gi referral versus primary pediatrics care. two separate analyses of ses measures and gi clinical symptoms and psychosocial measures identified key factors by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. for each analysis, identified factors were placed in unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression models to assess their impact in predicting gi referral.results:of the 239 participants, 152 were referred to pediatric gi, and 87 were managed in primary pediatrics care. of the ses and clinical symptom factors, child self-assessment of abdominal pain duration and lower percentage of people living in poverty were the strongest predictors of gi referral. among the psychosocial measures, parental assessment of their child 's functional disability was the sole predictor of gi referral. in multivariate logistic regression models, all selected factors continued to predict gi referral in each model.conclusions:socioeconomic environment, clinical symptoms, and functional disability are associated with gi referral. future interventions designed to ameliorate the effect of these identified factors could reduce unnecessary specialty consultations and health care overutilization for ibs.
emergency_contraception	the obesity 'epidemic' continues to increase, mostly but not only in developed countries. as overweight and obese women are at an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (vte) at baseline and at a much higher risk during pregnancy, it is essential to help these women to plan pregnancies carefully and to use contraceptives with a positive ratio of benefits versus risks. the expert group on hormonal and molecular contraception of the european society of contraception convened to review the existing evidence and propose recommendations to the prescribers in line with most recent studies and with the medical eligibility criteria of the world health organisation.
senior_health	mechanisms for the integration of social services with health have come to dominate the debate on providing a more seamless provision of health and social care. working together at the health and social care interface has been strongly promoted and endorsed in government documents since the late 1990s. moves towards integration have been treated with suspicion and scepticism in the academic literature, with many authors highlighting the many barriers and challenges presented by this method of working. yet these proposals do not represent a paradigm shift in culture in all parts of the united kingdom, as northern ireland has had an integrated health and social care system for over thirty years. based on an empirical study of senior health care professionals in northern ireland, this study identifies and discusses the key issues associated with integration. it concludes that the experiences in northern ireland have to date been overlooked or misrepresented and could prove extremely valuable in gaining an understanding of the challenges and benefits of integrated arrangements.
birth_control	objective: to examine the effect of selenium supplementation on cd4(+) t-cell counts, viral suppression, and time to antiretroviral therapy (art) initiation in art-naive hiv-infected patients in rwanda. methods: a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted. eligible patients were hiv-infected adults (>= 21 years) who had a cd4(+) cell count between 400 and 650 cells/mu l (art eligibility was >= 350 cells/mu l throughout the trial), and were willing to practice barrier methods of birth control. patients were randomized to receive once-daily 200mg selenium tablets or identical placebo. they were followed for 24 months with assessments every 6 months. declines in cd4(+) cell counts were modeled using linear regressions with generalized estimating equations and effect modification, and the composite outcome (art eligible or art initiation) using cox proportional-hazards regression, both conducted with intention to treat. results: of the 300 participants, 149 received selenium, 202 (67%) were women, and median age was 33.5 years. the rate of cd4(+) depletion was reduced by 43.8% [95% confidence interval (ci) 7.8-79.8% decrease] in the treatment arm - from mean 3.97 cells/ml per month to mean 2.23 cells/mu l per month. we observed 96 composite outcome events - 45 (47%) in the treatment arm. we found no treatment effect for the composite outcome (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% ci 0.66-1.54) or viral suppression (odds ratio 1.18,95% ci 0.71-1.94). the trial was under powered for the composite outcome due to a lower-than-anticipated event rate. adverse events were comparable throughout. conclusions: this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that 24-month selenium supplementation significantly reduces the rate of cd4(+) cell count decline among art-naive patients. copyright (c) 2015 wolters kluwer health, inc. all rights reserved.
birth_control	purpose. age-related macular degeneration (amd) is the leading cause of irreversible visual loss in developed countries. its etiology includes genetic and environmental factors. although vegfa variants are associated with amd, the joint action of variants within the vegf pathway and their interaction with nongenetic factors have not been investigated. methods. affymetrix 6.0 chipsets were used to genotype 668,238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in 1207 amd cases and 686 controls. environmental exposures were collected by questionnaire. a set-based test was conducted using the chi(2) statistic at each snp derived from kraft 's two degree of freedom (2df) joint test. pathway- and gene-based test statistics were calculated as the mean of all independent snp statistics. phenotype labels were permuted 10,000 times to generate an empirical p value. results. while a main effect of the vegf pathway was not identified, the pathway was associated with neovascular amd in women when accounting for birth control pill (bcp) use (p = 0.017). analysis of vegf 's subpathways showed that snps in the proliferation subpathway were associated with neovascular amd (p = 0.029) when accounting for bcp use. nominally significant genes within this subpathway were also observed. stratification by bcp use revealed novel significant genetic effects in women who had taken bcps. conclusions. these results illustrate that some amd genetic risk factors may be revealed only when complex relationships among risk factors are considered. this shows the utility of exploring pathways of previously associated genes to find novel effects. it also demonstrates the importance of incorporating environmental exposures in tests of genetic association at the snp, gene, or pathway level.
weight_loss	background & aims: nutritional therapy is a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of crohn disease (cd). therefore improving nutritional therapy would greatly benefit cd patients. the aim of this study was to define the anti-inflammatory properties of a novel nutritional polymeric formula (pf) in comparison to a currently available standard pe. methods: dextran sodium sulfate (dss) was utilized to induce colitis in c57bl/6 mice with mice randomized to receive either standard pf or novel pf in addition to control groups. changes in body weight were recorded and colonic damage was assessed histologically and biochemically. additional experiments were also included where the cytokine response of colonic biopsies from pediatric cd patients was measured following exposure to standard pf or novel pe. results: dss induced significant body weight loss, morphological changes in the colon, increased myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity and up-regulated colonic mrna expression of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-6, il-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (mcp)-1, as well as associated histological changes. other than histological damage, these inflammatory changes were reversed by both novel and standard pe however, the novel pf, but not standard pf, completely suppressed tnf-alpha, il-6 and il-8 levels from cultured biopsies. conclusions: newly developed nutritional formula reproducibly ameliorated dss-induced colitis in a murine model, although this response was not measurably different to standard pf. however, the novel pf was significantly superior in suppressing inflammatory cytokine release from cultured colonic biopsies. collectively, these findings support a possible role for novel pf in advancing nutritional therapy for cd patients. crown copyright (c) 2016 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
alzheimer's_disease	the colombian alzheimer 's prevention initiative (api) registry is a collaborative project among the neurosciences group of antioquia, the banner alzheimer 's institute, and genentech. the main goal is to provide a source of interested research participants and data to support the api-colombia autosomal dominant alzheimer 's disease trial and help find treatments to delay or prevent the clinical onset of alzheimer 's disease.
sports_injuries	the purpose of this case study was to describe the three-dimensional biomechanics of common ballet exercises in a ballet dancer with ischial tuberosity apophysitis. this was achieved by comparing kinematics between the symptomatic (i.e. ischial apophyseal symptoms) and contralateral lower limbs, as well as via reported pain. results suggest consistent differences in movement patterns in this dancer. these differences included: 1) decreased external rotation of contralateral hip, hence a decreased hip contribution to 'turn out'; 2) increased contralateral knee adduction and internal rotation; 3) an apparent synchronicity in the contralateral lower limb of the decreased hip external rotation and increased knee adduction; and 4) minimal use of ankle plantar/dorsiflexion movement for symptomatic side. pain related to the left ischial apophysitis was associated with reduced amplitudes especially in fast ballet movements that required large range of motion in flexion and adduction in the left hip joint. these findings suggest that ischial apophysitis may limit dancer 's ballet technique and performance.
alzheimer's_disease	cognitive decline is a major biomedical challenge as the global population ages. elevated levels of the longevity factor klotho suppress aging, enhance cognition, and promote synaptic plasticity and neural resilience against aging and alzheimer 's disease (ad)-related pathogenic proteins. here, we examined the relationship between human genetic variants of klotho and systemic klotho levels - and assessed neuroanatomic correlates of serum klotho in a cohort of healthy older adults. serum klotho levels were increased with kl-vs heterozygosity, as anticipated. we report, for the first time, that serum klotho levels were paradoxically decreased with kl-vs homozygosity. further, we found that higher serum klotho levels were associated with measures of greater intrinsic connectivity in key functional networks of the brain vulnerable to aging and ad such as the fronto-parietal and default mode networks. our findings suggest that elevated klotho promotes a resilient brain, possibly through increased network connectivity of critical brain regions.
sports_injuries	the research on an impact between a tennis ball and racket is very significant to improve the level of tennis and reduce the sports injuries. a preliminary study on an impact between a tennis ball and racket is carried out in this paper. it is composed of four parts: the reference of the existed dynamic model, the experimental set-up, the test system, the collection and analysis of experimental data. the preliminary experimental results are compared with the dynamic model, and the impact dynamic model can be improved after considering every effect on the impact. the preliminary results show that the model can be used to predict the tennis impact on the racket with different inbound velocity.
skin_care	the prime objective of current investigation was to develop a topical skin care cream (w/o) loaded with artemis comosta extract versus placebo control, and evaluated non-invasively for changes in skin barrier function i.e., epidermal hydration levels and transepidennal water loss (tewl), on healthy human volunteers. active cream carrying 2% extract of alamos consosits in the internal phase of w/o emulsion was prepared while placebo contained no extract. stability assessment of both creams was performed at various storage conditions 8, 25, 40 c, 40 c + 75% rh (relative humidity) and 50 degrees c. effects on epidermal hydration and tewl were observed by applying active cream at one side and placebo on the other side of face by 11 healthy human volunteers during 12 weeks period using comeometer mpa5 and tewameter mpa5. results indicated that both creams (active and placebo) remained stable at all storage conditions. all samples manifested non-newtonian, shear thinning behavior with increasing shear rate, whereas statistical interpretation indicated that effects of active cream were superior than placebo, as it significantly (p = 0.05) improves the epidermal hydration levels up to 56.74% and reduces tewl up to-73.19% at the end of study period compared to baseline value. the surface evaluation of living skin (sels) parameters ser, sesc, sestn. sew were also assessed and indicated a significant (p = (1.05) reduction. conclusively, creams loaded with 'inane 's comostis extract exhibit better physicochemical stability and represent a propitious improvement in skin barrier function, used as a functional moisturizing and anti-aging ingredient in topical skincare products.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate immune response through its direct and indirect actions. in addition, the dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes expression. in the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are mediated by melatonin receptors (mt2), serotonin (5-ht), and cholecystokinin b (cck2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. the levels of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10100 times the blood concentrations. also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the pineal gland. gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food intake. low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas high doses may decrease gut motility. melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), constipation-predominant ibs (ibs-c), diarrhea-predominant ibs (ibs-d), crohn 's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. the purpose of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially ibs, crohn 's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

skin_care	diabetes is a chronic systemic disease affecting 8.3% of the general population, thus constituting an important clinical and financial problem for healthcare systems throughout the world. complications of diabetes damage both many internal organs and skin. skin complications of diabetes can anticipate its clinical symptoms. diabetic skin, irritated and dry in many cases, is susceptible to skin infections. however, there is little known about molecular changes in skin in diabetes. many studies are concentrated on epidermal barrier damage, dysfunction of epidermis integrity and dysfunction of sebaceous glands. another complex problem is skin care in diabetic patients. a profound understanding of cellular-level processes in diabetes could lead to the discovery of new therapy efficacy markers and new skin care products.
overactive_bladder	the persistent genital arousal disorder (pgad) may coexist with restless legs syndrome and overactive bladder syndrome and share some similarities with these conditions. thus, the new term: restless genital syndrome (rgs) is proposed. the purpose of this paper is to present a case of pgad, including the description of the etiology, the diagnostics and the treatment of the disorder. the described patient meets the criteria for pgad. organic lesions within nervous and urogenital system were excluded and the psychogenic background of the syndrome was assumed in this case. the patient was diagnosed with personality disorder with a predominance of dependent personality traits and emotional lability. after the failure of pharmacological treatment, systemic psychotherapy with cognitive-behavioral elements was initiated with moderate effect.
weight_loss	background: calorie restriction (cr) retards aging and increases longevity in many animal models. however, it is unclear whether cr can be implemented in humans without adverse effects on body composition. objective: we evaluated the effect of a 2-y cr regimen on body composition including the influence of sex and body mass index (bmi; in kg/m(2)) among participants enrolled in calerie-2 (comprehensive assessment of long-term effects of reducing intake of energy), a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. design: participants were 218 nonobese (bmi: 21.9-28.0) adults aged 21-51 y who were randomly assigned to 25% cr (cr, n = 143) or ad libitum control (al, n = 75) in a 2: 1 ratio. measures at baseline and 12 and 24 mo included body weight, waist circumference, fat mass (fm), fat-free mass (ffm), and appendicular mass by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; activity-related energy expenditure (aree) by doubly labeled water; and dietary protein intake by self-report. values are expressed as means +/- sds. results: the cr group achieved 11.9% +/- 0.7% cr over 2-y and had significant decreases in weight (27.6 +/- 0.3 compared with 0.4 +/- 0.5 kg), waist circumference (-6.2 +/- 0.4 compared with 0.9 +/- 0.5 cm), fm (-5.4 +/- 0.3 compared with 0.5 +/- 0.4 kg), and ffm (-2.0 +/- 0.2 compared with -0.0 +/- 0.2 kg) at 24 mo relative to the al group (all between-group p < 0.001). moreover, ffm as a percentage of body weight at 24 mo was higher, and percentage of fm was lower in the cr group than in the al. aree, but not protein intake, predicted preservation of ffm during cr (p < 0.01). men in the cr group lost significantly more trunk fat (p = 0.03) and ffm expressed as a percentage of weight loss (p < 0.001) than women in the cr group. conclusions: two years of cr had broadly favorable effects on both whole-body and regional adiposity that could facilitate health span in humans. the decrements in ffm were commensurate with the reduced body mass; although men in the cr group lost more ffm than the women did, the percentage of ffm in the men in the cr group was higher than at baseline.
polycythemia_vera	introduction: primary myelofibrosis (pmf) is the least common but the most aggressive of the classic philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. survival is much shorter in pmf than in polycythemia vera (pv) or essential thrombocythemia (et). post-pv/et myelofibrosis (mf) is clinically indistinguishable from pmf and approached similarly. areas covered: current pharmacologic therapy of mf revolves around the janus kinase 1/2 (jak1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib, which dramatically improves constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly in the majority of patients, and improves overall survival (os). however, allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potential cure. other jak inhibitors continue to be developed for mf, and momelotinib and pacritinib are in phase iii clinical trials. anemia is common in mf, and initially worsened by ruxolitinib. momelotinib and pacritinib may prove advantageous in this regard. current strategies for managing anemia of mf include danazol, immunomodulatory drugs and erythroid stimulating agents, either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib. expert opinion: a number of other agents, representing diverse drug classes, are in various stages of development for mf. these include newer jak inhibitors, other signaling inhibitors, epigenetic modifiers, anti-fibrotic agents, telomerase inhibitors, and activin receptor ligand traps (for anemia). hopefully, these novel therapies will further extend the clinical benefits of ruxolitinib.
menopause	objective: the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (ms) and its components among pre- and postmenopausal women, as well as the association between menopausal status and ms. materials and methods: a retrospective study was conducted at a reference cardiology outpatient clinic in a city located in northwestern parana state, brazil. a total of 958 medical records of symptomatic climacteric women evaluated between 2010 and 2014 were analyzed. the study consisted of two groups: pre-and post-menopausal women. ms was characterized according to the criteria of the national cholesterol education program 's adult treatment panel iii - ncep-atp iii-2005. results: ms was observed in 18.5% of the total study population; 9.4% of the premenopausal women and 22.2% of the postmenopausal women displayed ms, corresponding to a relative risk of 2.75. in addition, the frequency of ms increased with age. regarding the components of ms, postmenopausal women were more likely to have high density lipoprotein (hdl-c) levels= 130 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure (dbp) values >= 85 mmhg; and fasting glucose levels >= 100 mg/dl. conclusion: ms was more prevalent among postmenopausal women than among premenopausal women.
skin_care	background although understanding the stratum corneum (sc) of infant skin is important to avoid skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, there has been no such investigation in indonesian infants to date. objective to obtain a basic knowledge of sc characteristics in indonesian infants in order to develop methods for infant-specific skin care and to prevent dermatitis and infection. methods seventy-two healthy, full term infants aged 1 to 24 months who were native indonesians residing in jakarta were enrolled in this study. some of the mothers were also enrolled in the study as adults (n=30). transepidermal water loss (tewl) and hydration of the sc (capacitance) on the thigh, buttock, and upper arm were measured after sufficient acclimation in an air-conditioned room, in both infants and mothers. results the sc hydration was significantly higher in infants than adults at all sites measured, including the buttocks, which is a diaper area. infant tewl values were also significantly higher than in adults at all sites. hydration of the sc and tewl values showed no significant correlation with age of infant for any site. the sc hydration and tewl values of indonesian infants did not decrease to adult values within 24 months, which indicates that the sc characteristics in infants continue to develop after 24 months of age. conclusion indonesian infants aged 0-24 months have significantly higher sc hydration and tewl values than indonesian mothers. however, infant age has no correlation to sc hydration or to tewl values.

sprains_and_strains	quatman, ce, myer, gd, khoury, j, wall, ej, and hewett, te. sex differences in ""weightlifting"" injuries presenting to united states emergency rooms. j strength cond res 23(7): 20612067, 2009-benefits of resistance training include improved muscle strength and sports performance and may include reduced injuries. however, few studies have examined sex differences in resistance training-related injuries. the objective of this investigation was to evaluate sex differences in injuries associated with strength training in adolescents and young adults by type (sprains and strains, fractures), mechanism (accidental, nonaccidental), and location (head, trunk, arm, hand, leg, foot) of injury. we hypothesized that there would be sex differences in type, mechanism, and location of strength training injuries. the u. s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) national electronic injury surveillance system (neiss) was queried from 2002 to 2005 using the cpsc code for ""weightlifting."" subjects between the ages of 14 and 30 years were included in the study. cpsc sampling weights were used to calculate national estimates from the sample of 3,713 patients (men = 3,102; women = 611). weighted chi-square analyses were used to compare differences in mechanism, type, and location of injury for men versus women. men had significantly more sprains and strains (p = 0.004), whereas women demonstrated increased accidental injuries compared to men (p < 0.001). the trunk was the most commonly injured body part for both men (36.9%) and women (27.4%). men had more trunk injuries than women (p < 0.001), whereas women had more foot (p < 0.001) and leg (p = 0.03) injuries than men (p < 0.001). the findings indicate that men may suffer more exertional-type resistance injuries during strength training (sprains and strains) compared to women, especially at the trunk. conversely, women may be more susceptible to lower-extremity injuries resulting from accidents during resistance training.
fungal_infection	fungal diseases have been emerging as an important public health problem worldwide with the increase in host predisposition factors due to immunological dysregulations, immunosuppressive and/or anticancer therapy. antifungal therapy for systemic mycosis is limited, most of times expensive and causes important toxic effects. nanotechnology has become an interesting strategy to improve efficacy of traditional antifungal drugs, which allows lower toxicity, better biodistribution, and drug targeting, with promising results in vitro and in vivo. in this review, we provide a discussion about conventional antifungal and nanoantifungal therapies for systemic mycosis.
overactive_bladder	in 2002, the international continence society defined the term overactive bladder (oab) as a symptom syndrome that is accompanied by urgency with or without urge incontinence, frequency and nocturia. a proven urinary tract infection or other obvious pathologies must be excluded. the pathophysiology of oab has not been clarified in detail and is the subject of ongoing research, so partially overlapping hypotheses exist. the urothelium-based hypothesis suggests functional changes of urothelial receptors as well as functional changes regarding the sensitivity and coupling of the suburothelial myofibroblasts, which ultimately lead to increasing activity of afferent signals and urgency. the myogenic hypothesis is based on the assumption that unstable detrusor contractions may be triggered by changes in their excitability and coupling with other myocytes or myofibroblasts. unstable detrusor contractions generate increased afferent activity followed by symptoms of overactive bladder. the hypothesis of abnormal processing of afferent signals assumes that damage to central inhibitory pathways and/or sensitisation of afferent nerves lead to the activation of the micturition reflex, which, in turn, induces unstable detrusor contractions. in addition, hormonal and psychological influences are discussed.
menopause	estradiol supplementation has been shown to enhance cognitive performance in old ovariectomized rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta). to determine if similar benefits could be achieved in perimenopausal animals using alternative hormonal supplements, we administered dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) to old ovary-intact female rhesus macaques for similar to 2.5months. using computerized touch screen memory tasks, including delayed response (dr) and delayed matching-to-sample (dms), we observed improved performance with time in all of the animals but failed to detect a significant effect of dhea. on the other hand, gene expression profiling disclosed a significant correlation between cognitive performance and the expression of several steroidogenic and steroid-responsive genes. the dr performance was positively correlated with hippocampal expression of akr1c3 and star and negatively correlated with the expression of sdrd5a1. a positive correlation was also found between dms performance and prefrontal cortical expression of akr1c3 and a negative correlation with star, as well as a negative correlation with the hippocampal expression of hsd11b1 and nr3c1. taken together, the results suggest that steroidogenic gene regulation within the brain may help to maintain cognitive function during the perimenopausal transition period, despite a decline in sex-steroid levels in the circulation.
headache	background: chronic subdural hematoma (csdh) after spinal anesthesia is a rare complication. we experienced a patient who developed csdh after postdural puncture headache (pdph) following combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (cse). case presentation: a 38-week-gestation parturient with a history of previous cesarean delivery underwent elective cesarean section under cse. she had been receiving aspirin therapy for kawasaki disease for many years. she developed a symptom of pdph 1 day after the surgery. fluid administration and analgesics were started. although the headache was relatively severe and persistent, it suddenly disappeared on the third postoperative day. aspirin administration was restarted on the third postoperative day, and the patient was discharged 1 week after the surgery. 2 weeks after being discharged, she was readmitted to our hospital for severe headache and was diagnosed as having csdh. an epidural blood patch was performed, resulting in resolution of the hematoma. conclusions: we experienced a case of csdh after pdph in a patient who was receiving aspirin therapy. aspirin therapy should be restarted after confirmation of the absence of headache. we should consider the possibility of unexpected disappearance of pdph in the postoperative period may be due to the development of csdh.
hepatitis_c	background: direct-acting antivirals (daas) dramatically improve the treatment of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections. however, the effects of daas on extra-hepatic manifestations such as hcv-associated glomerulonephritis, especially in cases with renal dysfunction, are not well elucidated. case presentation: a 69-year-old japanese woman was diagnosed as having chronic hepatitis c, genotype 1b at the age of 55. she presented with hypertension, microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, renal dysfunction, purpura, and arthralgia at the age of 61. she also had hypocomplementemia and cryoglobulinemia. renal biopsy revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (mpgn), and she was diagnosed as having hcv-associated cryoglobulinemic mpgn. she declined interferon therapy at the time and was treated with antihypertensive medications as well as oral corticosteroid that were effective in reducing proteinuria. however, when the corticosteroid dose was reduced, proteinuria worsened. she began antiviral treatment with daclatasvir/asunaprevir (dcv/asv). clearance of hcv-rna was obtained by 2 weeks and sustained, and liver function was normalized. in addition, microhematuria turned negative, proteinuria decreased, hypocomplementemia and estimated glomerular filtration rate were improved, whereas cryoglobulinemia persisted. she completed 24 weeks of therapy without significant adverse effects. conclusion: in a case of hcv-associated cryoglobulinemic mpgn with renal dysfunction, dcv/asv -based daas ameliorated microhematuria, proteinuria and renal function without significant side effects.
parenting	children with histories of maltreatment and disruptions in care are at elevated risk for impairments in early language development, which contribute to difficulties in other developmental domains across childhood. given research demonstrating associations between parent responsiveness and children 's early language development, we examined whether a parenting intervention administered in infancy improved preschool receptive language skills in children involved with the child welfare system. attachment and biobehavioral catch-up (abc) is a 10-session intervention that aims to enhance parent-child interactions. the follow-up results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that infants who received the abc intervention (n = 24) scored significantly higher on a test of receptive vocabulary at age 36 months than infants who received a control intervention (n = 28). these results provide evidence of the critical role of parental responsiveness in supporting optimal language development among young children with histories of child welfare involvement.
hypothyroidism	resistance to thyrotropin (tsh) (rtsh; defined by elevated tsh and a normal or hypoplastic thyroid gland) can be caused by mutations in genes encoding the tsh receptor and pax8, and it has been linked to a locus on chromosome 15. in two nonconsanguineous families with nongoitrous euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia, typical of the rtsh phenotype, exome analysis identified five rare duox2 gene variants (p.a649e, p.p1391a, p.r885l, p.g488r, and p.sf965-6sfsx29) found to be pathogenic. this form of nongoitrous dyshormonogenesis masquerades both clinically and biochemically as rtsh. accordingly, mutations in duox2 should be added to those of slc26a4 as causes of rtsh.
hepatitis_c	t-cell host immune response against hepatitis c virus (hcv) has been suggested to play an important role in determining hcv infection outcome. however, data from human studies are not available. this study examined the effect of primary t-cell deficiency along with other factors on the spontaneous clearance of hcv in a large population-based cohort in british columbia, canada. the bc hepatitis testers cohort includes all individuals tested for hcv in bc in 1990-2013 linked with data on their medical visits, hospitalizations and prescription drugs. hcv-positive individuals with at least one valid hcv pcr test on/after hcv diagnosis (n=46783) were included in this study. to examine factors associated with the spontaneous clearance of hcv, multivariable logistic regression was fitted on the full sample, and cox proportional hazards model on the hcv seroconverters. spontaneous clearance was observed in 25.1% (n=11737) of those tested for hcv. after adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of spontaneous clearance of hcv was lower in people with primary t-cell immunodeficiency (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 0.55, 95% ci: 0.32-0.94), and higher in females (aor: 1.61, 95% ci: 1.54-1.68) and in those coinfected with hbv (aor: 2.31, 95% ci: 1.93-2.77). similar results were observed in hcv seroconverters except hbv coinfection was not significant. in conclusion, primary t-cell immunodeficiency is associated with a lower spontaneous clearance of hcv while female sex and coinfection with hbv are associated with a higher spontaneous clearance.
overactive_bladder	aims: despite the efficacy of intravesical onabotulinumtoxina (botox) therapy for urgency, urgency incontinence, and daytime frequency, its value in treatment of nocturia remains unclear. the aim of the prospective observational study was to assess the effect of onabotulinumtoxina on night-time symptoms in women with overactive bladder (oab), including nocturia, night-time urgency incontinence, and nocturnal voided volume as end-points. methods: women with idiopathic oab (with at least one episode of urgency urinary incontinence (uui) per day, 8 micturitions per 24hr, and 2 nocturia episodes per night) were enrolled. patients with nocturnal polyuria were excluded. botox (100u) was administered in 20 intra-detrusor injections. post-void residual volumes (pvr) were checked at 2, 4, and 12weeks. participants completed a 3-day bladder diary and the king 's health questionnaire (khq) before and 12 weeks after treatment, and reported the efficacy of the treatment on visual analog scale (vas) at the final follow-up visit. results: seventy-six women completed the study. botox injections were effective in the reduction of nocturia episodes (mean -0.98; p<0.001) and night-time uui episodes (-0.37; p<0.001) compared to the baseline. the increase of mean voided volume of the night-time micturitions was 92.6ml (p<0.001). patients reported a mean 58 points of improvement on the vas. urinary retention, which required self-catheterization, was observed in three patients. conclusions: intravesical botox injection provides significant benefit for night-time symptoms in oab patients. our results are applicable for women without nocturnal polyuria, and should prove useful when counseling patients about the risks and benefits of botox. neurourol. urodynam. 36:648-652, 2017.

cancer	purpose: medulloblastoma is the most prevalent childhood brain cancer. children with medulloblastoma typically receive a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. the survival rate is high but survivors often have sequelae from radiotherapy of the entire developing brain and spinal cord. ongoing genetic studies have suggested that decreasing the dose of radiation might be possible among children with favorable molecular variants; however, this may result in an increased disease recurrence. as such, there is a need to investigate the nature of trade-offs that individuals are willing to make regarding the treatment of medulloblastoma. method: we used best-worst scaling to estimate the importance of attributes affecting the general public 's decision making around the treatment of medulloblastoma. after conducting focus groups, we selected three relevant attributes: (1) the accuracy of the genetic test; (2) the probability of serious adverse effects of the treatment(s); and (3) the survival rate. using the paired method, we applied a conditional logit model to estimate preferences. results: in total, 3,006 respondents (51.3% female) with an average age of 43 years answered the questionnaires. all coefficients were statistically significantly different from zero and the attribute levels of adverse effects and the survival rate had the most impact on individuals' stated decision making. conclusion: overall, respondents showed high sensitivity to children experiencing disability particularly in the setting of a good prognosis. however, among children with poor prognostic molecular variants, participants showed tolerance about having a child with mild and partial disability compared to a low rate of survival.
sprains_and_strains	wilkerson, gb, gupta, a, allen, jr, keith, cm, and colston, ma. utilization of practice session average inertial load to quantify college football injury risk. j strength cond res 30(9): 2369-2374, 2016relatively few studies have investigated the potential injury prevention value of data derived from recently developed wearable technology for measurement of body mass accelerations during the performance of sport-related activities. the available evidence has been derived from studies focused on avoidance of overtraining syndrome, which is believed to induce a chronically fatigued state that can be identified through monitoring of inertial load accumulation. reduced variability in movement patterns is also believed to be an important injury risk factor, but no evidence currently exists to guide interpretation of data derived from inertial measurement units (imus) in this regard. we retrospectively analyzed archived data for a cohort of 45 national collegiate athletic association division 1-football bowl subdivision football players who wore imus on the upper back during practice sessions to quantify any associations between average inertial load measured during practice sessions and occurrence of musculoskeletal sprains and strains. both the coefficient of variation for average inertial load and frequent exposure to game conditions were found to be strongly associated with injury occurrence. having either or both of the 2 risk factors provided strong discrimination between injured and noninjured players ((2) = 9.048; p = 0.004; odds ratio = 8.04; 90% ci: 2.39, 27.03). our findings may facilitate identification of individual football players who are likely to derive the greatest benefit from training activities designed to reduce injury risk through improved adaptability to rapidly changing environmental demands.
overactive_bladder	epidemiological studies demonstrated that patients suffering from overactive bladder often present with different mental problems, amongst which depression is the most frequently observed. the main goal of our study was to check if the repeated administration of corticosterone (cort) is able to evoke the depressive-like behaviour and detrusor overactivity (do) symptoms in rats. moreover, we investigated whether the acute administration of common antidepressants (imipramine, 30 mg/kg, and fluoxetine, 15 mg/kg), antimuscarinic (oxybutynin chloride, 0.5 mg/kg) or crf1 (sn 003, 1 mg/kg) antagonists has an impact on the cystometric parameters, behaviour in the porsolt test, and overall locomotor activity of animals exposed to cort. the experiments were carried out on female wistar rats. all applied surgical and histopathology procedures, cystometric investigations, locomotor activity and forced swim measurements have been fully described in the published literature. fourteen-day administration of cort may induce both depressive and do symptoms in rats, which are reversed by the inhibition of crf1 receptors. it seems that the crf1 receptor could be an interesting target for overactive bladder pharmacotherapy, particularly in patients with co-existing depression.
alzheimer's_disease	amyloid beta (a beta) fibrils and amorphous aggregates are found in the brain of patients with alzheimer 's disease (ad), and are implicated in the etiology of ad. the metal imbalance is also among leading causes of ad, owing to the fact that a beta aggregation takes place in the synaptic cleft where a beta, cu(ii) and fe(iii) are found in abnormally high concentrations. a beta 40 and a beta 42 are the main components of plaques found in afflicted brains. coordination of cu(ii) and fe(iii) ions to a beta peptides have been linked to a beta aggregation and production of reactive oxygen species, two key events in the development of ad pathology. metal chelation was proposed as a therapy for ad on the basis that it might prevent a beta aggregation. in this work, we first examined the formation of a beta 40 and a beta 42 aggregates in the presence of metal ions, i.e. fe(iii) and cu(ii), which were detected by fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. second, we studied the ability of the two chelators, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline (clioquinol), to investigate their effect on the availability of these metal ions to interact with a beta and thereby their effect on a beta accumulation. our findings show that fe(iii), but not cu(ii), promote aggregation of both a beta 40 and a beta 42. we also found that only clioquinol decreased significantly iron ion-induced aggregation of a beta 42. the presence of ions and/or chelators also affected the morphology of a beta aggregates.
diabetes	background: the interest in natural antioxidants, especially polyphenols, is growing more and more thanks to their positive contribution to human health. thus, the prevention from the harmful action of oxidative stress which has been involved in many diseases such as cancer, inflammation diabetes, and cardiovascular illness. recent research proved the bioactive compounds richness of date seeds which could be a good biological matrix of natural antioxidants. unfortunately, an important quantity of tunisian dates seed is discarded yearly. methods: in this study, different solvents extraction (water, methanol, absolute acetone and aqueous acetone 80%) were used and the evaluation of its effect on phytochemical level, in vitro antioxidant activities, in vitro hyperglycemia key enzymes inhibition and in vivo anti-inflammatory proprieties were established for tunisian date seeds. results: the result revealed that the polar solvent exhibited the highest amount of bioactive compounds. the correlation between polyphenol compounds and the antioxidant potentiality explains the powerful effect of used polar solvents on inflammation, tbars and hyperglycemia inhibition. furthermore, it showed its higher capacity to scavenge radicals. conclusions: therefore, this big waste of tunisian seeds could be used as cheap source of natural antioxidant compounds which are considered as a health challenge for the poor countries.
parenting	drawing upon both social-cognitive domain theory and self-determination theory, the goal of the present multi-informant study was to test whether the correlates of maternal prohibitions depend on what is prohibited (i.e., the content of the social domain involved), thereby contrasting moral with friendship prohibitions, as well on how the prohibition is communicated, thereby contrasting an autonomy-supportive with a controlling communication style. in a sample of adolescents (n = 196; mean age = 13.9 years; 63 % female) and their mothers (n = 185; mean age = 44 years), we first examined mean-level differences between the two domains in terms of mothers' degree and style of prohibition, as well as on a number of developmental outcomes (i.e., adolescents' legitimacy perceptions, internalization, and oppositional defiance). both adolescents and mothers reported more maternal involvement in the moral domain (e.g., higher scores for degree of prohibition and controlling communication style). in addition, adolescents reported greater perceived legitimacy and less oppositional defiance in the moral domain (as compared to the friendships domain). second, we tested whether associations between degree and style of prohibition and the developmental outcomes were moderated by social domain. whereas associations between degree of prohibition and developmental outcomes either were non-significant or moderated by domain, the associations with communication style were more domain-invariant, with an autonomy-supportive style generally yielding an adaptive pattern of correlates and with a controlling style relating to maladaptive outcomes. the discussion focuses on similarities and differences in the characteristics and correlates of both types of prohibitions.
emergency_contraception	purpose: we studied sexual and reproductive health among self-identified bisexual, lesbian, and heterosexual adolescent young women. prior research has suggested that bisexual and lesbian young women may be at greater risk for many negative health outcomes, including risky sexual and reproductive health behavior. methods: using data from the u.s. nationally representative 2006-2010 national survey of family growth (nsfg), we examined sexual and reproductive health among young women 15-20 years of age as a function of sexual orientation. we used logistic regression and ancova to examine differences in sexual and reproductive health across groups while controlling for demographic group differences. results: bisexual and lesbian young women reported elevated sexual and reproductive health risks. bisexual and lesbian participants reported being younger at heterosexual sexual debut, and having more male and female sexual partners, than did heterosexual participants. further, they were more likely than heterosexual young women to report having been forced to have sex by a male partner. bisexual young women reported the earliest sexual debut, highest numbers of male partners, greatest use of emergency contraception, and highest frequency of pregnancy termination. conclusions: overall, sexual minority young women-especially those who identified as bisexual-were at higher sexual and reproductive risk than their heterosexual peers.

sprains_and_strains	we studied the long-term sequelae of hand injuries as a result of playing volleyball. in a retrospective study, 226 patients with injuries of the hand who were seen over a 5-year period at our trauma department, were investigated. females accounted for 66 % of all injuries. the mean age was 26 years, with a peak in the age group of 15 to 29 years. sprains and strains were observed most frequently (39 %), followed by fractures (25 %) and contusions (16 %). the fingers were involved in 44 % of the cases. most injuries of the hand occurred in recreational players. recreational players had more left-sided injuries, whereas competition players had more right-sided injuries (p < 0.005), suggesting that lack of skill is an important determinant. left-handedness was associated with an increased risk of hand injury in recreational players. one third of the volleyball players did not go to work or school for a median of 4 weeks as a result of the injury. in a survey after a mean period of 5 years, a high percentage of patients had complaints: 28 % cited stiff and crooked fingers with limitations and tenderness in the movements as main inconveniences. we consider this incidence disturbingly high, regarding the seemingly innocent nature of these injuries.
sports_injuries	this article presents a current review of the risk of physical and psychological injury associated with participation in elite youth sport, and suggests strategies to ensure the physical and emotional health of these young athletes. although there is lack of epidemiological data, especially with regard to psychological injury, preliminary data suggest that the risk of injury is high in this population. while there is lack of incident and follow-up data, there is also concern regarding burnout, disordered eating, and the long-term consequences of injury. modifiable injury risk factors identified include postural control, competition anxiety, life events, previous injury, and volume of training. there are presently no studies designed to determine the effectiveness of injury prevention measures in elite youth sports. however, there is adequate evidence arising from injury prevention studies of youth sports participants - including neuromuscular training, protective equipment, mental training to enhance self-esteem, and sport rules modification - to prevent injuries in elite youth sports settings. although not tested, psychosocial prevention strategies such as adoption of task-oriented coping mechanisms, autonomous support from parents, and a proactive organizational approach also show promise in injury prevention.
emergency_contraception	the purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence undergraduate college student use of emergency contraception (ec) and their level of knowledge about the product, in order to assist in the development of intervention programmes to increase its use, which could lead to lower rates of unintended pregnancies in this population. a response rate of 98.4% included 1553 surveys from students at 11 midwestern universities. students were predominantly female (63.5%), white (75.3%) and aged 18-21 years (80%). they ranged from first-year students (23.8%) through to fourthyear students (13.8%), with second-year students comprising the largest group (32.6%). the majority of respondents reported being heterosexual (92.1%), and 34.1% of those completing the questionnaire reported being in a committed relationship. most respondents reported having had sexual intercourse at least once in their lifetime (78.9%). of the 8.4% of sexually active students who had experienced an unintended pregnancy, 18.1% had used ec in the past 12 months. knowledge of ec was not high; but as knowledge increased, the use of ec increased. the integrated behavioural model predicted 50% of the variance in intention. each construct contributed a portion of variance except experiential attitude, which was not statistically significant in the path analysis. the model could be used in any future interventions to increase ec use and decrease unintended pregnancies among college students.
allergies	the timing of introduction of solid food on the subsequent development of food allergy is under debate and the role of concurrent breastfeeding is unclear. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of solid food introduction whilst concurrently breastfeeding on food allergy outcome, with a specific focus on cows' milk allergy. prospectively collected infant feeding data from a birth cohort were analysed. participants with histories suggestive of food allergy underwent diagnostic food challenges. children with food allergy were matched to control participants for age and sex. mann-whitney u tests, chi(2), fisher exact tests and logistic regression calculations were undertaken. a total of thirty-nine food-allergic children and seventy-eight matched controls were identified, including twenty-two cows' milk-allergic children and forty-four matched controls. the control group introduced solid food earlier than the food-allergic group ( p < 0.05). there was no effect of concurrent breastfeeding alongside cows' milk introduction or other food allergens on the development of food allergy. due to small numbers, it was not possible to explore differences for food allergy phenotype. we have therefore found no evidence that introducing solids, or food allergens, whilst breastfeeding has an allergy-preventative effect; however, the results should be interpreted with caution due to sample size. recommendations regarding infant feeding and food allergy should be carefully considered. although breastfeeding should be promoted for many health reasons, larger studies looking at the introduction of food allergens on the development of food allergy are needed to make a final conclusion.
parenting	characteristic issues surrounding parents in youth sport include examples of negative verbal and non-verbal behaviour demonstrated during competition. numerous studies have done well to highlight while parents possess a great potential for positively influencing the sport experience, they can also exert a considerable negative influence by engaging in a range of non-preferred and inappropriate behaviours. there is certainly a need to further understand the nature of the sport-parenting paradigm given that encouraging and supportive parental involvement is a critical factor in promoting enjoyment and intrinsic motivation among participants. this is particularly important given that children 's preferred parental behaviours are temporally dependent. that is, different types of parental involvement are preferred before, during and after competitive sport. however, one aspect of parental involvement in youth sport which has been largely overlooked is the post-game setting. drawing on qualitative data derived from focus groups and individual interviews with 86 parents and children involved in junior australian football, this paper reveals an aspect of the sport-parenting role which can further enhance or undermine the youth sport experience. specifically, it reveals an intriguing insight into the way that parents engage in debriefing' children 's performancesrepresenting a challenge for parents who strive to engender a positive and supportive influence in youth sport. while the concept of sport-parenting receives much attention within the competitive setting, this paper argues that in order to enhance the quality of parental involvement in youth sport, much can be learnt from exploring what happens after the game'.
sports_injuries	background: the diagnosis of a sports-related concussion is often dependent on the athlete self-reporting their symptoms. it has been suggested that improving youth athlete knowledge and attitudes toward concussion may increase self-reporting behaviour. the objective of this study was to determine if a novel concussion-u educational program improves knowledge of and attitudes about concussion among a cohort of elite male bantam and midget aaa hockey players. methods: fifty-seven male bantam and midget aaa-level hockey players (mean age=14.521.13 years) were recruited from the local community. each participant completed a modified version of the rosenbaum concussion knowledge and attitudes survey-student version immediately before and after a concussion-u educational presentation. follow-up sessions were arranged 4 to 6 months after the presentation, and assessed retention of knowledge and attitude changes. results: forty-three players completed all three surveys. concussion knowledge and attitude scores significantly (p<0.01) increased from pre- to post-presentation by 12.79 and 8.41%, respectively. at long-term follow-up, knowledge levels remained significantly (p<0.01) higher than baseline by 8.49%. mean attitude scores were also increased at follow-up; however, this increase was not statistically significant. conclusions: a concussion-u educational program led to an immediate improvement in concussion knowledge and attitudes among elite male bantam and midget aaa hockey players. increased knowledge was maintained at long-term follow-up, but improved attitude was not. future studies should investigate whether similar educational programs influence symptom reporting and concussion incidence. in addition, they should focus on how to maintain improved concussion attitudes.
senior_health	introductionto determine current hospital practices and the opinions of senior health professionals working in western australian (wa) hospitals performing gynaecological procedures regarding pre-operative pregnancy testing. methodsanonymous questionnaire survey sent to all wa public and private hospitals' senior clinical staff (38 units where gynaecological surgery was performed in wa). resultssixty-one senior health professionals (heads of department, medical directors, theatre nurse managers), completed the survey (estimated response rate 71%). thirty-eight (68%) of respondents' units had guidelines for pre-operative pregnancy testing and 55% respondents worked in hospitals which tested all women of reproductive potential. nineteen (33%) respondents reported cases in which patients had presented for surgery unaware they were pregnant. forty-one (76%) respondents believed that all women of reproductive potential should have routine pre-operative pregnancy testing. fifty-four (89%) supported the introduction of national or statewide guidelines. discussionthere are inconsistent processes of pre-operative assessment of pregnancy status in wa hospitals performing gynaecological surgery potentially resulting in adverse incidents. the majority of senior clinical staff surveyed supported routine pre-operative testing and the need for national or statewide guidelines.
senior_health	this study identifies the informational factors and judgment processes involved in making two case management decisions within a consolidated long-term care program: evaluating risk of nursing home placement and choosing a care plan. a multidisciplinary case management team formulated these decisions for hypothetical clients described in vignettes (n = 1,507). the team used information about the client 's condition and the program 's available resources in judging risk of institutionalization, but only client-related information in selecting a care plan.
hepatitis_c	background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection causes hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and subtypes of non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl). associations with other cancers are not established. the authors systematically assessed associations between hcv infection and cancers in the us elderly population. methods: this was a registry-based case-control study using surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer)-medicare data in us adults aged >= 66 years. cases (n = 1,623,538) were patients who had first cancers identified in seer registries (1993-2011). controls (n = 200,000) were randomly selected, cancer-free individuals who were frequency-matched to cases on age, sex, race, and calendar year. associations with hcv (documented by medicare claims) were determined using logistic regression. results: hcv prevalence was higher in cases than in controls (0.7% vs 0.5%). hcv was positively associated with cancers of the liver (adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 31.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 29.0-34.3), intrahepatic bile duct (aor, 3.40; 95% ci, 2.52-4.58), extrahepatic bile duct (aor, 1.90; 95% ci, 1.41-2.57), pancreas (aor, 1.23; 95% ci, 1.09-1.40), and anus (aor, 1.97; 95% ci, 1.42-2.73); nonmelanoma nonepithelial skin cancer (aor, 1.53; 95% ci, 1.15-2.04); myelodysplastic syndrome (aor, 1.56; 95% ci, 1.33-1.83); and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (aor, 1.57; 95% ci, 1.34-1.84). specific skin cancers associated with hcv were merkel cell carcinoma (aor, 1.92; 95% ci, 1.30-2.85) and appendageal skin cancers (aor, 2.02; 95% ci, 1.29-3.16). inverse associations were observed with uterine cancer (aor, 0.64; 95% ci, 0.51-0.80) and prostate cancer (aor, 0.73; 95% ci, 0.66-0.82). associations were maintained in sensitivity analyses conducted among individuals without documented alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, or hepatitis b or human immunodeficiency virus infections and after adjustment for socioeconomic status. associations of hcv with other cancers were not observed. conclusions: hcv is associated with increased risk of cancers other than hcc in the us elderly population, notably bile duct cancers and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. these results support a possible etiologic role for hcv in an expanded group of cancers.

weight_loss	the measurement of weight loss after bariatric surgery is under constant review in order to obtain the ideal standard for reporting weight loss. several formulas have been proposed for this purpose. our goal is to analyse weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy, with or without antrum preservation through different measurement formulas. a prospective randomised study of 60 patients (30 patients with initial section at 3 cm from pylorus and 30 patients at 8 cm from the pylorus). we calculate the following variables at 3, 6 and 12 months from surgery: bmi, excess weight loss (%ewl), percentage of excess of bmi loss (%pebmil), expected bmi, % pebmil corrected by ebmi and percentage of total weight loss (%twl). weight evolution is similar in both groups, reaching a mean bmi of 33.62 +/- 4.35 and 34.48 +/- 4.23 kg/m(2) respectively 12 months after surgery, closer to expected bmi. twl follows the same trend, with losses exceeding 30%, although 3 cm group is above the tables of percentiles made with our series. regarding pebmil, the 3 cm group reaches 67.8% classified as excellent, while 8 cm group reaches 62.8% classified as a good result. ewl situates the best results for 3 cm group. group 3 cm obtained a lower percentage of suboptimal results using ewl. %twl places the 3 cm group in higher percentile than 8 cm group. through ebmi, both groups are equally effective. it is necessary to have standardised dynamic tables for each surgical technique, becoming essential elements to measure weight loss after surgery.
diabetes	backgroundpolymorphisms of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (rage) gene have been studied in various autoimmune disorders, but not in hashimoto 's thyroiditis. also, increased oxidative stress has been described in patients with hashimoto 's thyroiditis. the aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of two common rage polymorphisms (-429t>c, -374t>a) in hashimoto 's thyroiditis; in parallel, we studied oxidative stress levels. materials and methodsa total of 300 consecutive euthyroid women were examined and classified into three groups: hashimoto 's thyroiditis with treatment (n = 96), hashimoto 's thyroiditis without treatment (n = 109) and controls (n = 95). for a rough evaluation of oxidative stress, total lipid peroxide levels in serum were measured. the -429t>c alui and -374t>a mfei polymorphisms of rage were studied in genomic dna. resultssignificant association of the rage system with hashimoto 's thyroiditis was found only with regard to the prevalence of the -429t>c, but not with -374t>a polymorphism. the levels of oxidative stress were significantly elevated in hashimoto 's thyroiditis patients under treatment. further analysis demonstrated that an oxidative stress cut-off value of 590 mol/l is associated with an increased risk of progression of hashimoto 's thyroiditis from euthyroidism to hypothyroidism; this risk is further increased in carriers of the rage -429t>c polymorphism. conclusionsour findings indicate that both examined risk factors may be implicated in the occurrence of hashimoto 's thyroiditis, but this covers only a fraction of the pathophysiology of the disease.
parkinson's_disease	parkinson 's disease (pd) is a circuit-level disorder with clinically-determined motor subtypes. despite evidence suggesting each subtype may have different pathophysiology, few neuroimaging studies have examined levodopa-induced differences in neural activation between tremor dominant (td) and postural instability/ gait difficulty (pigd) subtype patients during a motor task. the goal of this functional mri (fmri) study was to examine task-induced activation and connectivity in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical motor circuit in healthy controls, td patients, and pigd patients before and after levodopa administration. fourteen td and 12 pigd cognitively-intact patients and 21 age-and sex-matched healthy controls completed a right-hand, paced tapping fmri paradigm. collectively, pd patients off medication (off) showed hypoactivation of the motor cortex relative to healthy controls, even when controlling for performance. after levodopa intake, the pigd patients had significantly increased activation in the left putamen compared with td patients and healthy controls. psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that levodopa increased effective connectivity between the posterior putamen and other areas of the motor circuit during tapping in td patients, but not in pigd patients. this novel, levodopa-induced difference in the neural responses between pd motor subtypes may have significant implications for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the distinct phenotypic manifestations and enabling the classification of motor subtypes objectively using fmri.
birth_control	the development of population policy and health legislation as a result of government, the need for more young, healthy, working and military active population, resulted in the education of all health workers including midwives, legal regulation of their work, increasing their number and training of midwifery profession. with the development of this profession conditions of women giving birth, pregnancy and birth control were gradually improved, and thus influenced the birth rate and mortality of the population and the natural growth. on the example of the town of brod na savi one can see that it was time-consuming and controlled development of the midwifery profession in the region, which have affected the poor socio-economic conditions, poor climatic conditions, and the presence of the border and the consequent large-scale migration of the population. it is important to note that the foundations for population policies and the observed midwifery profession enabled the development of the same in the coming period.
hepatitis_c	single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) within dna region containing interferon lambda 3 (ifnl3) and ifnl4 genes are prognostic factors of treatment response in chronic hepatitis c (chc). iron overload, frequently diagnosed in chc, is associated with unfavorable disease course and a risk of carcinogenesis. its etiology and relationship with the immune response in chc are not fully explained. our aim was to determine whether ifnl polymorphisms in chc patients associate with body iron indices, and whether they are linked with hepatic expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis and ifn signaling. for 192 chc patients, four snps within ifnl3-ifnl4 region (rs12979860, rs368234815, rs8099917, rs12980275) were genotyped. in 185 liver biopsies, histopathological analyses were performed. expression of five mrnas and three long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) was determined with qrt-pcr in 105 liver samples. rs12979860 tt or rs8099917 gg genotypes as well as markers of serum and hepatocyte iron overload associated with higher activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and liver steatosis. the presence of two minor alleles in any of the tested snps predisposed to abnormally high serum iron concentration and correlated with higher hepatic expression of lncrna nrir. on the other hand, homozygosity in any major allele associated with higher viral load. patients bearing rs12979860 cc genotype had lower hepatic expression of hepcidin (hamp; p = 0.03). hamp mrna level positively correlated with serum iron indices and degree of hepatocyte iron deposits. ifnl polymorphisms influence regulatory pathways of cellular response to ifn and affect body iron balance in chronic hepatitis c virus infection.
menopause	background: considering the limited cross protection offered by the current hpv vaccines, understanding the hpv genotype distribution among the different population is essential in predicting the efficacy of current vaccine and devising new vaccine strategy. the present work aimed at investigating the hpv genotypes distribution among women with and without cervical carcinoma in odisha, eastern india. methods: a total of 607 participants have been enrolled between january 2014 and june 2016. l1-pcr, sequencing, and e6/e7 nested multiplex type-specific pcr were performed for hpv detection and genotyping. cytological distribution of 440 cases includes invasive cervical carcinoma or icc (n = 210), inflammatory smear (n = 162), normal cytology (n = 68). statistical analyses were performed by using spss version 20.0 software and medical version 14.10.2(7). a p-value of45years, parity >= 3, low socio-economic condition, rural residential area and post menopause state were significantly associated with hpv infection. multiple infections did not have a significant association with any of the clinicopathological variables (stage, ln metastasis, cell type) except tumor size >= 2cm in icc cases. the impact of 2v, 4v, and 9v vaccines in preventing cervical cancer in odisha were 89.99, 91.65, and 92.16% respectively. conclusion: this data would help planning an appropriate strategy for disease monitoring and provides baseline data for post-vaccination surveillance in the region. the nonavalent vaccine would be significant in preventing cervical carcinoma in odisha. hence an effective vaccination program based on regional hpv epidemiological profile along with the cervical cancer screening is necessary to reduce the cervical cancer burden in india.
fungal_infection	rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a rapidly fatal fungal infection affecting mostly uncontrolled diabetics. multiple cranial nerves can be affected; however, palsy of the facial nerve has been rarely reported. three uncontrolled diabetic patients presented to our outpatient department with features of rapidly progressive sinusitis and unilateral facial nerve palsy which on further evaluation was proven to be mucormycosis. patients with uncontrolled diabetes and facial nerve palsy can have an underlying mucormycosis. this is important as early diagnosis and treatment is very prudent for a favorable treatment outcome in mucormycosis.
headache	sex differences in chronic pain are reported to emerge during adolescence, although it is unclear if this includes responses to treatment. we conducted a meta-analysis to examine whether sex differences were present on outcome variables at pretreatment and whether the efficacy of psychological therapies for pediatric chronic pain differs between boys and girls at posttreatment and follow-up time points. searches were conducted, extending 2 existing cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of psychological therapies for chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents. forty-six articles were eligible for inclusion, and data were extracted regarding pain, disability, anxiety, and depression in boys and girls at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up time points. no published study reported outcome data separately by sex, so authors of all studies were contacted and 17 studies provided data. twice as many girls (n=1760) were enrolled into clinical trials of psychological therapies for pediatric chronic pain than boys (n= 828). girls reported higher depression and anxiety at pretreatment than boys. girls with headache also reported significantly greater pretreatment pain severity. treatment gains were consistent across the sexes. one exception was for posttreatment disability in children with nonheadache pain conditions; girls exhibited a significant effect of treatment relative to control condition (standardized mean difference- -0.50 [-0.80,-0.20], p < 0.01), but no such effect was observed for boys (standardized mean difference = -0.08 [-0.44, 0.28], p =0.66). future research should examine whether mechanisms of treatment efficacy differ between boys and girls and consider the impact of pretreatment sex differences on response to treatment.
headache	aim: this study examined the change over 20 months in 178 participants with frequent episodic migraine under adequate treatment as usual, who had completed online behavioural training (obt) in migraine self-management either directly (group 1, n = 120) or after 10 months of watchful waiting (group 2, n = 58). methods: participants completed questionnaires and an online headache diary and migraine monitor following the international classification of headache disorders at t0 (baseline), t1 (post-training), t2 (6-month follow-up; extended baseline in group 2), t3 (post-training, group 2 only) and t4 (group 1: 16-month follow-up; group 2: 6-month follow-up). statistical analyses were conducted on the observed data without imputation of missing observations. results: both groups were highly comparable. the data over time revealed benefits in response to obt, with significant between-group differences in the change achieved in the training episodes t2-t0 (group 1) and t4-t2 (group 2). improved attack frequency (m = -23%) was higher in participants with more (i. e. 4-6) attacks per month at baseline, and the effects of obt were durable over 16 months of follow-up. conclusions: obt is beneficial in frequent episodic migraine, which deserves special efforts in care. self-management variants such as obt reach patients easily and supplement these efforts with durable results.
menopause	although most women with type 1 diabetes experience the normal transition to menopause, there is little information about the impact of hormone replacement therapy on their glycemic profiles. a 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with fulminant type 1 diabetes was admitted to our hospital due to diabetic ketoacidosis. she was treated with fluid replacement and a continuous insulin infusion. thereafter, her glycemic profile was well maintained by daily multiple insulin injections. however, her glycemic profiles immediately deteriorated following the administration of progesterone in hormone replacement therapy. this transient deterioration implies that external progesterone can lead to the deterioration of glycemic profiles in postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes.
weight_loss	in this work the performance of mussel shell as aggregate in plain concrete has been studied. the mussel shell used came from the cannery industry, which produces more than 1 million tonnes of shell by-product a year worldwide. the mussel shell has been heat-treated at 135 degrees c for 30 min and then crushed and sieved into sand and gravel. the new aggregates have been studied by x-ray diffraction (xrd), tga and sem microscopy. then two different conventional concretes were designed, a non-structural concrete (nsc) and a plain structural concrete (sc). in both of them the natural aggregates (sand, gravel, and both sand and gravel) were replaced with mussel shell aggregates at different percentages. all concretes were characterized in fresh and hardened states (microstructure, workable life progression, workability, compressive and splitting strength, longitudinal modulus of elasticity, weight loss and water permeability). the results lead to establishing that with this treatment, mussel shell replacement should be limited to 25% of fine or coarse aggregates, or 12.5% of both fine and coarse aggregates. with these percentages the nsc and the sc will display a correct behaviour.

hypothyroidism	background: congenital hypothyroidism (ch) is a common endocrine disease and an important cause of mental retardation. the purpose of this study was to investigate the probable role of season and climatic factors in the incidence of ch in kerman province, iran. methods: incidence data were collected from the ch screening program files from 2005 to 2011 in kerman province, a number of 288,437 infants were included in the study. climate data were collected from the meteorological office. the relations were tested by chi(2)-test, pearson correlation, and negative binomial regression. results: the overall incidence of ch in kerman province was 2.68 per 1000 births. there was a significant difference in both the monthly and seasonal incidence of ch (p < 0.05). there were a few significant, but weak correlation between some climatic factors and the incidence of ch in some regions, but the results were inconsistent. conclusions: it seems like there is no clear relation between ch incidence and climate factors, in kerman province. however, ch incidence was highest in october (autumn) and lowest in june (summer).
headache	objective: to assess prospectively the effectiveness of lacosamide (lcm) added to levetiracetam (lev) after down-titration of a concomitant sodium channel blocker (scb) among patients with focal epilepsy not adequately controlled on lev and scb. methods: in this open-label trial, lcm was initiated at 100 mg/day and up-titrated to 200-600 mg/day over 9 weeks; scb down-titration started when lcm dose reached 200 mg/day. patients remained on stable lcm/lev doses for 12 weeks' maintenance (21-week treatment period). the primary outcome was retention rate on lcm. results: due to recruitment challenges, fewer than the planned 300 patients participated in the trial, resulting in the trial being underpowered. overall, 120 patients (mean age 39.7 years) started and 93 completed the trial. the most frequently used scbs were lamotrigine (39.2%), carbamazepine (30.8%) and oxcarbazepine (27.5%). eighty-four patients adhered to protocol and discontinued their scb after cross-titration, but there was insufficient evidence for 36 patients. retention rate was 73.3% ( 88/120) for all patients and 83.3% (70/84) for those with evidence of scb discontinuation. seizure freedom for patients completing maintenance was 14.0% (13/93). discontinuation due to adverse events (6.7%) and lack of efficacy (3.3%) occurred primarily during cross-titration. most frequently reported adverse events during treatment were dizziness (23.3%), headache (15.0%) and fatigue (8.3%). conclusions: in patients with uncontrolled seizures on lev/scb, the lcm/lev combination appeared to be effective and well tolerated. a cross-titration schedule-flexible lcm up-titration, concomitant scb down-titration and stable background lev-could present a feasible and practical approach to initiating lcm while minimizing pharmacodynamic interactions with a scb.
overactive_bladder	purpose: we assessed the lower urinary tract symptoms (lutss) and clinical outcomes between diabetes mellitus (dm) patients and non-diabetic (non-dm) patients receiving transurethral resection of prostate (tur-p). methods: this analysis was a retrospective cohort study using 13 years (2000-2012) of claims data from taiwan 's national health insurance research database (nhird). a total of 4,887 patients who had persistent lutss and underwent tur-p for prostate enlargement (benign prostate enlargement [bpe]) were enrolled and divided into two groups: dm and non-dm groups. the patients' characteristics, postoperative clinical outcomes, and the medication records after tur-p were compared. chi-square test was used for categorical variables and independent samples t-test for continuous variables. multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to compare the risk of postoperative outcomes. finally, we estimated the medication-free survival rate after tur-p using kaplan-meier method and compared it between study groups using log-rank test. results: dm group patients had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. postoperatively, the dm group had lower rates of urinary tract infection (uti; odds ratio [or], 0.78; p=0.009) and higher rates of urinary retention requiring catheterization (or, 1.35; p=0.01) within 1 month after tur-p. a higher proportion of patients with dm took anti-muscarinics (or, 1.23; p=0.032) within the first 3 months and a-blockers (or, 1.18; p=0.049) during 3-12 months after receiving tur-p. overall, the dm group patients had a worse postoperative medicationfree survival compared to that of non-dm group patients (95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.14; p=0.005). conclusion: dm patients require higher rates of continuing medication after tur-p, especially anti-muscarinics in 3 months postoperatively and alpha-blocker after 3 months postoperatively. dm patients also had higher incidence of urine retention after surgery. dm patients had relatively poor treatment outcomes compared to dm-free patients.
hepatitis_c	background: beckman coulter has developed the veris hcv assay for use on the new fully automated dxn veris molecular diagnostic system((sic)) for hcv viral load monitoring. objectives: evaluate the clinical performance of the new quantitative veris hcv assay. study design: comparison was performed on 279 plasma specimens from hcv infected patients tested with the veris hcv assay and cobas (r) ampliprep/cobas (r) tagman (r) hcv test and 369 specimens tested with the veris hcv assay and realtime hcv assay. patient monitoring sample results from four time points were also compared. results: the average bias between the veris hcv assay and the cobas (r) ampliprep/cobas (r) tagman (r) hcv test was 0.04 log(10) iu/ml, while between the veris hcv assay and the realtime hcv assay average bias was 0.21 log(10) iu/ml. bias, however, was not consistent across the measuring range. analysis at the lower end of quantification levels 50, 100, and 1000 iu/ml showed a predicted bias for veris hcv assay versus cobas (r) ampliprep/cobas (r) tagman (r) hcv test between -0.42 and -0.22 log(10) iu/ml and for veris hcv assay versus realtime hcv assay between 0.00 and 0.13 log(10) iu/ml. patient monitoring of hcv viral load over time demonstrated similar levels between veris hcv assay results and cobas (r) ampliprep/cobas (r) tagman (r) hcv test (52 samples from 13 patients) and realtime hcv assay (112 samples from 28 patients). conclusions: veris hcv assay for use on the dxn veris molecular diagnostic system represents a reliable new tool for easy sample to result hcv rna viral load monitoring.

fungal_infection	breeding of rice cultivars with long-lasting resistance to the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae is difficult, and identification of new resistance genes is essential. most of the loci associated with blast resistance against m. oryzae in rice have been identified in controlled environments and with single isolates, and such loci may confer resistance to only a small faction of the m. oryzae strains. in the field, however, rice is commonly attacked by multiple strains. research is therefore needed to identify loci that confer resistance in the field, i.e., ""field blast resistance"". to identify loci associated with field blast resistance (lafbrs), we conducted a genome-wide association study (gwas) using the rice diversity panel 1 (rdp1) cultivars. these cultivars were evaluated in the field in three major rice production areas of china. gwas identified 16 lafbrs. among them, 13 are novel and the other three are co-localized with known blast resistance regions. seventy-four candidate genes are identified in the 16 lafbr regions, which encode receptor-like protein kinases, transcription factors, and other defense-related proteins. using the rice transcriptome data, compared with the rice-rice blast compatible interaction, we identified seven candidate genes that are significantly up-regulated and five genes that are significantly down-regulated in the incompatible interaction among the candidate genes. we identified 16 lafbrs involved in field resistance to m. oryzae and 20 cultivars that exhibit high levels of resistance in both the field and growth chamber. the resistant cultivars and the snp markers identified in this study should be useful for marker-assisted selection of new rice cultivars that confer high levels of resistance against m. oryzae field populations.
fungal_infection	this is the first study to assess fungal diversity and mycotoxigenic fungi in open recirculating cooling-tower (ct) water systems (biofilm and water phase). the production capability of mycotoxin from fungal isolates was also examined. the mean fungal count in 21 different water and biofilm samples was determined as 234 cfu/100 ml and 4 cfu/cm(2). a total of 32 species were identified by internal transcribed spacer (its) sequencing. the most common isolated fungi belonged to the genera aspergillus and penicillium, of which the most prevalent fungi were aspergillus versicolor, aspergillus niger, and penicillium dipodomyicola. from 42% of the surveyed cts, aflatoxigenic a. flavus isolates were identified. the detection of opportunistic pathogens and/or allergen species suggests that open recirculating cts are a possible source of fungal infection for both the public and for occupational workers via the inhalation of aerosols and/or skin contact.
cancer	to retrospectively review post-treatment (post-tx) fdg-pet/ct scans in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) and known p16 status, treated with definitive (chemo)radiation (rt). a total of 108 eligible patients had n2a or greater hnscc treated with chemort from august 1, 2008, to february 28, 2015, with post-tx pet/ct within 6 months after rt. kaplan-meier curves, log-rank statistics, and cox proportional hazards regression were used for statistical analysis. median follow-up was 2.38 years. sixty-eight (63.0%) patients had p16+ and 40 (37.0%) had p16- status. two-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival were 93.4% and 77.8%, respectively. the negative predictive value (npv) of pet/ct for local recurrence (lr) was 100%. the npv for regional recurrence (rr) was 96.5% for all patients, 100% for p16+ patients, and 88.5% for p16- patients. the positive predictive value (ppv) of pet/ct for recurrence was 77.3% for all patients, 50.0% for p16+, and 78.6% for p16-. the ppv for lr was 72.7% for all patients, 50.0% for p16+ patients, and 72.7% for p16- patients. the ppv for rr was 50.0% for all patients, 33% for p16+, and 66.6% for p16-. post-tx pet/ct and p16 status were independent predictors of recurrence-free survival (p < 0.01). post-tx pet/ct predicts treatment outcomes in both p16 + and p16- patients, and does so independently of p16 status. p16- patients with negative pet have a 10% risk of nodal recurrence, and closer follow-up in these patients is warranted.
sports_injuries	traumatic brain injury (tbi) is a common cause of death and disability in young adults with consequences ranging from physical disabilities to long-term cognitive, behavioral, psychological and social defects. recent data suggest that pituitary hormone deficiency is not infrequent among tbi survivors; the prevalence of reported hypopituitarism following tbi varies widely among published studies. the most common cause of tbi is motor vehicle accidents, including pedestrian-car and bicycle car encounters, falls, child abuse, violence and sports injuries. prevalence of hypopituitarism, from total to isolated pituitary deficiency, ranges from 5 to 90 %. the time interval between tbi and pituitary function evaluation is one of the major factors responsible for variations in the prevalence of hypopituitarism reported. endocrine dysfunction after tbi in children and adolescents is common. adolescence is a time of growth, freedom and adjustment, consequently tbi is also common in this group. sports-related tbi is an important public health concern, but many cases are unrecognized and unreported. sports that are associated with an increased risk of tbi include those involving contact and/or collisions such as boxing, football, soccer, ice hockey, rugby, and the martial arts, as well as high velocity sports such as cycling, motor racing, equestrian sports, skiing and roller skating. the aim of this paper is to summarize the best evidence of tbi as a cause of pituitary deficiency in children and adults.
multiple_sclerosis	multiple sclerosis (ms) is a chronic autoimmune disease, and the most common cause of nontraumatic disability in young people. the etiology of this disease is not well defined yet. cytoldnes play an important role in differentiation, maturation and survival of a wide range of cells, including cells of the immune system. suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) proteins are the most important regulators of this cytokine signaling pathway. the aim of present study was to compare the expression levels of socs1, socs2, socs3 and socs5 genes in the blood of 50 relapsing-remitting ms (rr-ms) patients and 50 healthy controls by taciman quantitative real-time pcr in patients and healthy control group. we observed that socs1 and socs5 expression was significantly down -regulated (p = 0.045 and p = 0.044, respectively); whereas, no significant difference was observed between ms patients and controls for socs2 and socs3 gene expression (p = 0.747 and p = 0.439, respectively). in addition, there was no significant correlation between the expression of socs1, socs2, socs3 and socs5 genes and clinical findings, such as the level of physical disability in the ms patients according to the kurtzke expanded disability status scale (edss) criterion and disease duration. however, a significant positive correlation was observed between expression levels of socs genes. this study shows that loss of balance among various members of the socs family proteins may contribute to pathophysiology of -multiple sclerosis.

overactive_bladder	urinary incontinence is a largely spread disfunction that affects more than 300 million people worldwide. at present, no technological solutions are able to restore continence in a minimally invasive and effective way. in this article the authors report the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel artificial endourethral urinary sphincter able to fully restore continence. the device can be inserted/retracted in a minimally invasive fashion without hospital admission, does not alter the body scheme and can be applied to both women and men. the device core is a unidirectional polymeric valve and a magnetically activated system able to modulate its opening pressure. bench tests and ex vivo tests on a human cadaver demonstrated that the device is able to fully restore continence and to allow urination when desired. overall, the proposed system shows a high potential as a technological solution able to restore a normal daily life in patients affected by urinary incontinence.
skin_care	very few exposure data are available for children in europe and worldwide. the aim of this study was to assess the exposure to cosmetic products used on children aged 0-3 years using recent consumption data generated for the french population. exposure was assessed using a probabilistic method for 24 products including cleanser, skin care, fragrance, solar and bottom products. the exposure data obtained in this study for children aged 0-3 years were higher than the values fixed by the sccs for all common products: liquid shampoo, face moisturizer cream, toothpaste, shower gel and body moisturizer cream. exposure was assessed for the first time for many products such as sunscreens, eau de toilette and massage products. these new french exposure values will be useful for safety assessors and for safety agencies.

emergency_contraception	objectives: to enhance public access to prophylaxis for lyme disease following an identified ixodes scapularis tick bite through pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy and to assess patient satisfaction with the pharmacy-based service provided. setting: independent community pharmacy in charlestown, ri, from may to october 2012. practice description: under a collaborative practice agreement, trained pharmacists at an independent pharmacy identified patients eligible for postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis following attachment and removal of an i. scapularis tick (commonly known as a deer tick) and dispensed two 100 mg tablets of doxycycline. patients were included if they were 18 years or older, provided informed consent, had an estimated time of tick attachment of 36 hours or more, had the tick removed within 72 hours of visit, denied contraindications to doxycycline therapy, and reported telephone access for follow-up. patients enrolled in the study protocol were given counseling related to doxycycline, signs and symptoms of lyme disease, and future tick prevention strategies. practice innovation: pharmacist initiation of doxycycline prophylaxis has not been described in the literature previously. successful pharmacist initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis may have broader implications for states with endemic lyme disease or other infectious disease public health concerns. main outcome measures: patient self-reported adverse outcomes and satisfaction with the pharmacy-based service. results: eight patients enrolled in the study and completed the follow-up survey. the results indicated a high level of satisfaction with the pharmacy services provided, with no reports of the subsequent development of lyme disease symptoms or major adverse events. conclusion: the project has expanded to three community pharmacy sites in southern rhode island based on this experience. similar pharmacy-based collaborative practice models should be considered in highly endemic lyme disease areas.
headache	background: chiropractic manipulation is a popular treatment for neck pain and headache, but may increase the risk of cervical artery dissection and stroke. patients with carotid artery dissection can present with neck pain and/ or headache before experiencing a stroke. these are common symptoms seen by both chiropractors and primary care physicians (pcps). we aimed to assess the risk of carotid artery stroke after chiropractic care by comparing association between chiropractic and pcp visits and subsequent stroke. methods: a population-based, case-crossover study was undertaken in ontario, canada. all incident cases of carotid artery stroke admitted to hospitals over a 9-year period were identified. cases served as their own controls. exposures to chiropractic and pcp services were determined from health billing records. results: we compared 15,523 cases to 62,092 control periods using exposure windows of 1, 3, 7, and 14 days prior to the stroke. positive associations were found for both chiropractic and pcp visits and subsequent stroke in patients less than 45 years of age. these associations tended to increase when analyses were limited to visits for neck pain and headache-related diagnoses. there was no significant difference between chiropractic and pcp risk estimates. we found no association between chiropractic visits and stroke in those 45 years of age or older. conclusions: we found no excess risk of carotid artery stroke after chiropractic care. associations between chiropractic and pcp visits and stroke were similar and likely due to patients with early dissection-related symptoms seeking care prior to developing their strokes.
low_testosterone	sex steroid hormones and inflammatory biomarkers are both associated with the development and progression of chronic diseases, but their interrelationship is relatively uncharacterized. we examined the association of sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg) with biomarkers of inflammation, c-reactive protein (crp) and white blood cell (wbc) count. the study included data from 809 adult men in the national health and nutrition examination survey 1999-2004. geometric means and 95% confidence intervals were estimated separately for crp and wbc concentrations by sex steroid hormones and shbg using weighted linear regression models. higher concentrations of total (slope per one quintile in concentration, -0.18; p-trend, 0.001) and calculated free (slope, -0.13; p-trend, 0.03) testosterone were statistically significantly associated with lower concentrations of crp, but not with wbc count. men in the bottom quintile of total testosterone (3.3ng/ml), who might be considered to have clinically low testosterone, were more likely to have elevated crp (3mg/l) compared with men in the top four quintiles (or, 1.61; 95% ci, 1.00-2.61). total and calculated free estradiol (e2) were positively associated with both crp (total e2: slope, 0.14; p-trend, <0.001; free e2: slope, 0.15; p-trend, <0.001) and wbc (total e2: slope, 0.02; p-trend, 0.08; free e2: slope, 0.02; p-trend, 0.02) concentrations. shbg concentrations were inversely associated with wbc count (slope, -0.03; p-trend, 0.04), but not with crp. these cross-sectional findings are consistent with the hypothesis that higher androgen and lower oestrogen concentrations may have an anti-inflammatory effect in men.
weight_loss	for the balanced consumption of rare-earth elements, cerium (ce) was partially used for ndfeb magnets instead of nd. the corrosion behaviour of the (nd,ce)feb magnet with different ce contents in 3.5% nacl solution was investigated by sem, xrd, eds and electrochemical tests. after immersion, the weight loss was calculated and the magnetic properties of the samples were measured. results showed that ce affected the corrosion of the (nd,ce)feb magnet. compared with the ndfeb magnet without ce but of the same grade as the magnetic energy product, (nd,ce)feb magnet showed better corrosion resistance. with increased ce content, the corrosion resistances and magnetic properties of (nd,ce)feb magnets were investigated.

cancer	alteration in expression of mirnas has been correlated with different cancer types, tumour stage and response to treatments. in this context, a structurally responsive oligonucleotide-based electrochemical impedimetric biosensor has been developed for the simple and sensitive detection of mirna-21. a highly specific biotinylated dna/lna molecular beacon (mb) probe was conjugated with gold nanoparticles (aunps) to create an integrated, dual function bio-label (biotin-mb-aunps) for both biorecognition and signal generation. in the presence of target mirna-21, hybridisation takes place resulting in the ""activation"" of the biotin-mb; this event makes the biotin group, which was previously ""protected"" by the steric hindrance of the mb stem-loop structure, accessible. the activated biotin-mb-aunps/mirna complexes become available for capture, via supramolecular interaction, onto a nentravidin-modified electrode for electrochemical transduction. the binding event results in a decrease of the charge transfer resistance at the working electrode/electrolyte interface. the biosensor responded linearly in the range 1-1000 pm of mirna-21, with a limit of detection of 0.3 pm, good reproducibility (relative standard deviation (rsd) =3.3%) and high selectivity over other mirnas (i.e. mirna221 and mirna-205) sequences. detection of mirna-21 in spiked serum samples at clinically relevant levels (low pm range) was also demonstrated, thus illustrating the potential of the biosensor for point-of-care clinical applications. the proposed biosensor design, based on the combination of a neutravidin transducing surface and the dual-function biotin-mb-aunps bio-label, provides a simple and robust approach for detection of short-length nucleic acid targets, such as mirnas.
emergency_contraception	to investigate the availability of youth-relevant community pharmacy services in new zealand (nz), and the opinions of pharmacy personnel on the appropriateness of these services for young people aged 12-24. pharmacist and pharmacy support staff (pss) questionnaires were developed collaboratively with a youth advisory group (yag) and were mailed to 500 randomly selected community pharmacies in nz. response rates for questionnaires were 50.5 % for pharmacists and 37.0 % for pss. the majority of community pharmacies in nz offer public health services relevant to youth health including emergency contraception, condoms, smoking cessation, weight management and harm reduction services for drug use. not all pharmacy personnel believed these services are appropriate for youth, particularly for those aged 16 or under. pss appeared less likely than pharmacists to feel services were appropriate. community pharmacies are offering an increasing range of youth-relevant health services, and may, therefore, be able to improve youth healthcare access. more research is required to investigate the barriers to young people accessing services from pharmacies, and also the challenges for pharmacy personnel in providing services to this age group.
multiple_sclerosis	purpose fatigue is common in end-stage renal disease patients receiving hemodialysis, reduces significantly their quality of life and is associated with all-cause and cardiac-related mortality. unfortunately, little is known about the course of fatigue in patients on chronic hemodialysis. methods the vitality subscale of the sf-36 (sf-36 vs), short-form health survey, was administered to 45 patients in january (t1), june (t2) and november (t3) 2015. results the score of the sf-36 vs did not differ significantly among t1, t2 and t3. similarly, the 1-year course of the sf-36 vitality subscale score did not differ significantly among t1, t2 and t3 after stratification of patients for sex, age, bmi, iadl and charlson. between t1 and t2, 21 out of 45 patients (46.6%) changed their fatigue status: 8 fatigued patients became not-fatigued and 13 not-fatigued patients became fatigued. between t2 and t3, 12 out of 45 (26.6%) patients changed their fatigue status: 5 fatigued patients became not-fatigued and 7 not-fatigued patients became fatigued. between t1 and t3, 19 out of 45 patients (42.2%) changed their fatigue status: 6 fatigued patients became not-fatigued and 13 not-fatigued became fatigued. conclusion the present study is the first to identify variations in fatigue status among patients on chronic hemodialysis during 1-year course. these findings suggest to frequently assess the presence and severity of fatigue in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
weight_loss	regulatory t cells (t-regs) have been recognized as central mediators for maintaining peripheral tolerance and limiting autoimmune diseases. the loss of t-regs or their function has been associated with exacerbation of autoimmune disease. however, the temporary loss of t-regs in the chronic spontaneous disease model has not been investigated. in this study, we evaluated the role of t-regs in a novel chronic spontaneous glomerulonephritis model of b cell lymphoma 2-interacting mediator (bim) knock-out mice by transient depleting t-regs. bim is a pro-apoptotic member of the b cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) family. bim knock-out (bim(-/-)) mice fail to delete autoreactive t cells in thymus, leading to chronic spontaneous autoimmune kidney disease. we found that t-reg depletion in bim(-/-) mice exacerbated the kidney injury with increased proteinuria, impaired kidney function, weight loss and greater histological injury compared with wild-type mice. there was a significant increase in interstitial infiltrate of inflammatory cells, antibody deposition and tubular damage. furthermore, the serum levels of cytokines interleukin (il)-2, il-4, il-6, il-10, il-17, interferon (ifn)- and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)- were increased significantly after t-reg depletion in bim(-/-) mice. this study demonstrates that transient depletion of t-regs leads to enhanced self-reactive t effector cell function followed by exacerbation of kidney disease in the chronic spontaneous kidney disease model of bim-deficient mice.
sports_injuries	training programmes incorporating isoinertial technology have contributed to a considerable improvement in developing muscle force and muscle power. objectives: to evaluate knee flexor and extensor muscle force in concentric and eccentric contractions. method: a 4-week training programme (3 sessions/week) using isoinertial technology was implemented, involving simultaneous flexion and extension of both knees. before and after the training programme, lower-body power was evaluated using ""versapulley"" isoinertial technology in separate knee extension and flexion exercises. data for power, velocity, force, work, repetition times etc. were recorded and monitored for both concentric and eccentric contractions. results: significant improvement (p=0.05) was recorded for both concentric and eccentric contractions in knee flexion and extension. conclusions: in the early stages of functional recovery, general exercise enhances adaptation between limbs, reducing the asymmetry prompted by sports injuries. in the course of physical recovery, the overload caused by working separately with the affected limb is diminished, thus shortening recovery time.
headache	purpose of review the purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between headaches and epilepsy as well as headaches and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (pnes). emphasis was placed on clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment. recent findings epilepsy and headaches are common disorders that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. there are some overlapping clinical features between migraine and epilepsy as well as evidence for shared underlying mechanisms. proposed theories for a shared etiology include ion channel dysfunction, glutamatergic mechanisms, and mitochondrial dysfunction. some, but not all, recent diagnostic classification systems have recognized the relationship between headaches and epilepsy. ictal headaches are rare and should raise suspicion for pnes. headaches in patients with epilepsy are undertreated despite evidence for efficacy of abortive headache medications. summary comorbid headaches and epilepsy are relatively common in the population presenting to a neurologist. patients who have headaches and epilepsy and/or pnes should receive appropriate treatment that often includes mutually beneficial preventative therapy and includes abortive headache treatment.
parkinson's_disease	in parkinson 's disease (pd) the prevalence of apraxia increases with disease severity implying that patients in early stages may already have subclinical deficits. the aim of this exploratory fmri study was to investigate if subclinical aberrations of the praxis network are already present in patients with early pd. in previous functional imaging literature only data on basal motor functions in pd exists. thirteen patients with mild parkinsonian symptoms and without clinically diagnosed apraxia and 14 healthy controls entered this study. during fmri participants performed a pantomime task in which they imitated the use of visually presented objects. patients were measured on and off dopaminergic therapy to evaluate a potential medication effect on praxis abilities and related brain functions. although none of the patients was apraxic according to de renzi ideomotor scores (range 62-72), patients off showed significantly lower praxis scores than controls. patients exhibited significant hyperactivation in left fronto-parietal core areas of the praxis network. frontal activations were clearly dominant in patients and were correlated with lower individual praxis scores. we conclude that early pd patients already show characteristic signs of praxis network dysfunctions and rely on specific hyperactivations to avoid clinically evident apraxic symptoms. subclinical apraxic deficits were shown to correlate with an activation shift from left parietal to left frontal areas implying a prospective individual imaging marker for incipient apraxia.
sports_injuries	objectives: there is a lack of epidemiological research in adolescent gaelic games, with previous research primarily focusing on elite adult males. this study aimed to prospectively capture the epidemiology of injury in male adolescent gaelic games over one year. design: prospective cohort study. methods: two hundred and ninety two (15.7 +/- 0.8 years) male adolescent gaelic footballers and hurlers took part in a one year prospective epidemiological study. injuries were assessed weekly by a certified athletic rehabilitation therapist and,an injury was defined as any injury sustained during training or competition resulting in restricted performance or time lost from play. an injury report form was utilised to standardise injury information. results: match injuries were more frequent in gaelic footballers (9.26 per 1000 h) and hurlers (11.11 per 1000 h) than training injuries (2.69 and 3.01 per 1000 h, respectively). over a quarter of injuries in adolescent gaelic footballers (26.7%) and hurlers (26.5%) were overuse in nature. recurrent injuries were also frequent, particularly in adolescent gaelic footballers (47.3%). lower limb injuries predominated (football 74.7%, hurling 58%), particularly in the knee (18.7%, 20.0%) and ankle (12.0%, 10.0%). hamstring injuries were more frequent in footballers (13.3%), with lower back injuries more common in hurlers (22.0%). minor injuries were common in hurling (61.7%), with moderate (20.8%) and severe (37.5%) injuries predominant in gaelic football. conclusions: injuries are frequent in adolescent gaelic games and this study sets the scene for the establishment of injury prevention strategies for this at risk population.

diabetes	growth hormone replacement therapy has benefits for patients with hypopituitarism. the safety profile in regard to tumor recurrence or progression, development of secondary malignancies, or cerebrovascular stroke is still an area of debate. a comprehensive search of multiple databases-medline, embase, cochrane central register of controlled trials, cochrane database of systematic reviews, and scopus was conducted through august 2015. eligible studies that evaluated long-term adverse events in adult patients with hypopituitarism treated with growth hormone replacement therapy and reported development of pituitary tumor recurrence or progression, secondary malignancies, or cerebrovascular stroke were selected following a predefined protocol. reviewers, independently and in duplicate, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals. we included 15 studies (published 1995-2015) that reported on 46,148 patients. compared to non-replacement, growth hormone replacement therapy in adults with hypopituitarism was not associated with statistically significant change in pituitary tumor progression or recurrence (relative risk, 0.77; 95 % confidence interval, 0.53-1.13) or development of secondary malignancy (relative risk, 0.99; 95 % confidence interval, 0.70-1.39). in two retrospective studies, there was higher risk of stroke in patients who did not receive replacement (relative risk, 2.07; 95 % confidence interval, 1.51-2.83). the quality of evidence is low due to study limitations and imprecision. this systematic review and meta-analysis supports the overall safety of growth hormone therapeutic use in adults with hypopituitarism with no clear evidence of increased risk of pituitary tumor recurrence, malignancy, or stroke.
allergies	background: specific ige (sige) antibody detection using the siemens immulite 3gallergytm (3gallergy) assay have not been sufficiently examined for the diagnosis of food allergy. the aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of measuring sige levels using the 3gallergy assay to diagnose allergic reactions to egg, milk, and wheat. methods: this retrospective study was conducted on patients with diagnosed or suspected allergies to egg, milk and wheat. patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical reactivity to these allergens based on oral food challenge outcomes and/or convincing histories of immediate reaction to causative food(s). the sige levels were measured using 3gallergy and immunocap. predicted probability curves were estimated using logistic regression analysis. results: we analyzed 1561 patients, ages 0-19 y (egg = 436, milk = 499, wheat = 626). the sige levels determined using 3gallergy correlated with those of immunocap, classifying 355 patients as symptomatic: egg = 149, milk = 123, wheat = 83. 3gallergy sige levels were significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (p < 0.0001). predictive probability for positive food allergy was significantly increased and correlated with increased sige levels. the cut-offs for allergic reaction with 95% predictive probability as determined by the 3gallergy probability curves were different from those of immunocap. conclusions: measurements of sige against egg, milk, and wheat as determined by 3gallergy may be used as a tool to facilitate the diagnosis of food allergy in subjects with suspected food allergies. however, these probability curves should not be applied interchangeably between different assays. copyright (c) 2016, japanese society of allergology. production and hosting by elsevier b.v.
parenting	purpose: we know very little about how transgender people create their families and the issues involved in these decisions. this qualitative study explored the parenting intentions and desires of 32 self-identified transgender individuals who want to become parents in the future. methods: data were collected using an open-ended survey with 32 transgender men and transgender women regarding when and how they want to become parents in the future. results: we found that transgender individuals expressed specific desires for parenthood, such as biological relatedness and barriers to parenthood, such as physical limitations or lack of legal protections, which influence how transgender individuals choose to become parents in the future. for example, many participants described wanting to be biologically related to a future child and how this can be complicated by being transgender due to hormonal treatments, surgeries, or not having the biological means of become a parent using ""traditional'' methods. conclusions: the barriers and desires discussed provide invaluable insight into the parenting intentions and reproductive health of transgender people. this study revealed numerous examples where healthcare professionals could benefit from this new knowledge, such as increasing communication with patients about these desires and issues related to treatment and reproduction.
emergency_contraception	background: lack of data in marginalized populations on knowledge, attitudes and practices (kap) hampers efforts to improve modern contraceptive practice. a mixed methods study to better understand family planning kap amongst refugee and migrant women on the thailand-myanmar border was conducted as part of an ongoing effort to improve reproductive health, particularly maternal mortality, through shoklo malaria research unit (smru) antenatal and birthing services. methods: cross-sectional surveys and focus group discussions (fgds) in currently pregnant women; and in-depth interviews (idis) in selected post-partum women with three children or more; were conducted. quantitative data were described with medians and proportions and compared using standard statistical tests. risk factors associated with high parity (>3) were identified using logistic regression analysis. qualitative data were coded and grouped and discussed using identified themes. results: in january-march 2015, 978 women participated in cross-sectional studies, 120 in fgd and 21 in idi. major positive findings were: >90 % of women knew about contraceptives for birth spacing, >60 % of women in the fgd and idi reported use of family planning (fp) in the past and nearly all women knew where they could obtain fp supplies. major gaps identified included: low uptake of long acting contraception (lac), lack of awareness of emergency contraception (>90 % of women), unreliable estimates of when child bearing years end, and misconceptions surrounding female sterilization. three was identified as the ideal number of children in the cross-sectional survey but less than half of the women with this parity or higher in the idi actually adopted lac leaving them at risk for unintended pregnancy. discussing basic female anatomy using a simple diagram was well received in fgd and idis. lac uptake has increased particularly the iud from 2013-2015. conclusion: definitive contextual issues were identified during this study and a significant range of action points have been implemented in fp services at smru as a result, particularly in regard to the iud. the importance of the role and attitudes of husbands were acknowledged by women and studies to investigate male perspectives in future may enhance fp practice in this area.
senior_health	background and aims: to evaluate the effect of interdisciplinary outpatient geriatrics on the use, cost, and quality of health services in a fee-for-service (ffs) environment of two networks of primary care clinics operated by a not-for-profit provider organization in dallas county, texas. methods: the senior health network (shn) provides interdisciplinary primary care to patients aged 55 years or older; the health texas provider network (htpn) provides ""usual"" primary care to patients of all ages. we conducted a two-year retrospective cohort study of 13,098 fee-for-service medicare beneficiaries who had 2+ visits to one of the networks in 2000. in the shn, interdisciplinary teams supplemented primary care with social services, specialized clinics, and health education. we compared the use, cost and quality of health services, as reflected by paid medicare claims, provided to eligible patients in the shn vs the htpn. results: medicare payments for hospital, skilled nursing facility, and home health care services were lower for shn patients than htpn patients (-32.7%, -19.8%, and -23.8%, respectively, p <= 0.05). shn patients had a lower likelihood of admission to hospitals for treatment of five ""ambulatory care sensitive conditions"" (aor 0.69, 95% ci 0.580.81), and they were less likely to receive several preventive services. total medicare payments for the two cohorts did not differ significantly. conclusions: interdisciplinary outpatient geriatric care in a ffs setting has the potential to avert hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions and to reduce medicare payments for hospital, skilled nursing facility, and home health care services.
overactive_bladder	objectives: to investigate safety, tolerability and efficacy of long-term (52 weeks) open-label treatment with mirabegron 50 mg, with an optional dose increase to 100 mg, in patients with overactive bladder (oab). methods: patients received mirabegron 50 mg once daily for 52 weeks. if efficacy was insufficient at week 8, the dose could be increased to 100 mg. safety was evaluated based on vital signs, adverse events (aes), laboratory findings, electrocardiogram and post-void residual volume. treatment efficacy was assessed with a 3-day micturition diary and the king 's health questionnaire (khq). results: two hundred and four patients were enrolled; mirabegron dose was maintained at 50mg in 153 patients and increased to 100 mg in 50 patients. mirabegron was well tolerated at both doses. incidences of aes and treatment-related aes were 91.4% and 33.6% in patients on 50 mg, and 100% and 30.0% in patients on 100 mg, respectively. time course changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were not considered clinically significant. at the end of treatment (eot), patients on 50mg and 100 mg showed improvement in frequency and urgency. improvements from baseline to eot in quality of life scores were observed for all khq domains. conclusions: there were no safety or tolerability concerns associated with mirabegron 50mg (with an optional dose increase to 100 mg) over 52 weeks. improvement in micturition variables was maintained with mirabegron 50mg from weeks 8 to 52.
parkinson's_disease	computer-aided diagnosis (cad) of parkinson 's disease (pd) using structural magnetic resonance imaging is an emerging research field for the pattern recognition community. the existing research works have utilized gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid tissues individually for diagnosis of pd and have ignored the intercorrelation among the three tissues. thus, there is a need to define a fused feature descriptor (ffd) which can capture information and intercorrelation of all the three tissues simultaneously, and to further enhance the performance of cad. the present study proposes a simple and efficient ffd, in terms of all the three tissues, for cad of pd, each brain volume is represented in terms of the ffd. then each fused volume is segmented into 118 brain regions. thereafter, features extraction is carried out from each brain region using 3d local binary pattern. then, a set of discriminating and uncorrelated features are identified using t-test in conjunction with minimum,redundancy maximum, relevance feature selection method. finally, support vector machine is utilized to build a decision model. volumetric 3d t1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging dataset (age & gender matched 30 pd and 30 healthy subjects) is acquired using 1.5t machine and is utilized to investigate the efficacy of the proposed method. the classification accuracy of 95% is achieved using leave-one-out cross-validation scheme which is superior to the existing methods. regions namely hippocampus.r, cingulum_mid_l, frontal_inf_tra, precentral_r, precentral_l, frontal_mid_l, frontal_mid_orb_l, cingulum_ant_l and hippocampus_l, are observed to be the most discriminative regions for diagnosis of pd. the notable performance of the proposed method suggests that instead of studying the three tissues independently, their intercorrelation should also be considered. further, the proposed method may be employed as a diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pd.

sprains_and_strains	background the rate of lost-time sprains and strains in private nursing homes is over three times the national average, and for back injuries, almost four times the national average. the ohio bureau of workers' compensation (bwc) has sponsored interventions that were preferentially promoted to nursing homes in 2000-2001, including training, consultation, and grants up to $40,000 for equipment purchases. methods this study evaluated the impact of bwc interventions on back injury claim rates using bwc data on claims, interventions, and employer payroll for all ohio nursing homes during 1995-2004 using poisson regression. a subset of nursing homes was analyzed with more detailed data that allowed estimation of the impact of staffing levels and resident acuity on claim rates. costs of interventions were compared to the associated savings in claim costs. results a $500 equipment purchase per nursing home worker was associated with a 21% reduction in back injury rate. assuming an equipment lift of 10 years, this translates to an estimated $768 reduction in claim costs per worker a present value of $495 with a 5% discount rate applied. results for training courses were equivocal. only those receiving below-median hours had a significant 19% reduction in claim rates. injury rates did not generally decline with consultation independent of equipment purchases, although possible confounding, misclassification, and bias due to non-random management participation clouds interpretation. in. nursing homes with available data, resident acuity was modestly associated with back injury risk, and the injury rate increased with resident-to-staff ratio (acting through three terms: rr = 1.50 for each additional resident per staff member;for the ratio alone, rr = 1.32, 95% ci = 1.18-1.48). in these nhs, an expenditure of $908 per resident care worker (equivalent to $500 per employee in the other model) was also associated with a 21% reduction in injury rate. however with a resident-to-staff ratio greater than 2.0, the same expenditure was associated with a $1,643 reduction in back claim costs over 10 years per employee, a present value of $1,062 with 5% discount rate. conclusions expenditures for ergonomic equipment in nursing homes by the ohio bwc were associated with fewer worker injuries and reductions in claim costs that were similar in magnitude to expenditures. un-estimated benefits and costs also need to be considered in assessing full health and financial impacts. am. j. ind. med. 52:683-697, 2009.

sports_injuries	study design: prospective cohort. objectives: to examine the relationship between summer training practices and risk of injury during the first month of a high school interscholastic cross-country season. background: several prospective studies have reported a high incidence of injury in adolescent cross-country runners. however, limited reports exist on the role of summer training practices and risk of injury among these runners. methods: four hundred twenty-one athletes (186 girls, 235 boys) who competed in interscholastic cross-country were followed during a cross-country season. at the start of the season, all participants completed a questionnaire regarding summer training routines. time-loss, running-related injuries were tracked during the subsequent season. logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for the risk of initial injury during the first month of the season associated with summer training variables. results: sixty-seven runners (15.9%) had a confirmed injury during the first month of the season, with a higher percent among girls (19.4%) than boys (13.2%) (p = .06). overall, 60.1% of the participants ran during the summer prior to the season, with a significantly higher percent among girls (71.5%) than boys (51.1%) (p<.0001). overall, no significant association (or = 0.9; 95% ci:0.5, 1.5; p = .90) was found between not running sometime during the preceding summer and increased risk of initial injury during the first month of the season. among only the runners who ran during the summer, after adjusting for sex and prior injury, first-month injuries were more common among those who did not frequently alternate short and long mileage on different days (or = 3.0; 95% ci: 1.4, 6.4; p = .005), and/or who ran 8 weeks or fewer (or = 2.7; 95% ci:1.2, 5,8; p = .01) during their summer training. running 8 weeks or fewer (p = .03), not frequently alternating mileage on different days (p = .01), and running a higher percentage of time on predominantly hill (p = .001) and irregular terrains (p = .004) were associated with increased risk of injury for girls. conclusion: these findings suggest that injuries during the first month of the high school cross-country season may be reduced if runners who participate in summer training activities run a greater number of weeks and frequently vary their daily running mileage during the summer. for girls, training programs that reduce mileage on hills and irregular terrains may help to minimize the occurrence of running-related injury.
diabetes	purpose: to demonstrate role of diffusion tensor imaging of the kidney in diabetic patients and to correlate renal fractional anisotropy (fa) and apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) of the renal cortex with urinary and serum biomarkers of diabetes. material and methods: prospective study was conducted upon 42 diabetic patients (28 males, 14 females; mean age = 33 years) and 17 age-and sex-matched volunteers. diabetic patients were micro-normoalbuminuric (n = 27) and macroalbuminuric (n = 15). patients and volunteers underwent diffusion tensor imaging of the kidney. the fa and adc of the renal cortex were calculated from 3 regions of interests of both kidneys. results: the mean fa and adc of the renal cortex in diabetic patients (0.36 +/- 0.10 and 1.74 +/- 0.16 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly different (p = 0.001) from that of volunteers (0.26 +/- 0.02 and 1.88 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). the cut-off renal fa and adc used to differentiate diabetic patients from volunteers were 0.28 and 1.89 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s with auc of 0.791 and 0.773 and accuracy of 71% and 76%. the fa and adc calculated in the renal cortex in patients with macroalbuminuria (0.43 +/- 0.10 and 1.63 +/- 0.19 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly different (p = 0.001) from that of patientswithmicro-normoalbuminuria (0.35 +/- 0.12 and 1.80 +/- 0.18 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). the fa and adc of the renal cortex in diabetic patients correlated with urinary albumin (r = 0.530; p = 0.001, r = -0.421; p = 0.006), urinarynag(r = 0.376; p = 0.014, r = -0.245; p = 0.01), urinary tgf-beta 1 (r = 0.287; p = 0.065, r = -0.214; p = 0.175), and serum creatinine (r = 0.381; p = 0.013, r = -0.349; p = 0.023). conclusion: the fa and adc of the renal cortex may help in differentiation of diabetic kidney from volunteers and prediction of the presence of macroalbuminuria in diabetic patients and correlated with some of the urinary and serum biomarkers of diabetes.
hypothyroidism	myo-inositol and phosphatidylinositol(s) play a pivotal function in many metabolic pathways that, if impaired, impact unfavorably on human health. this review analyzes several experimental and clinical investigations regarding the involvement of this class of molecules in physiological and pathological situations, with a major focus on thyroid. central issues are the relationship between phosphatidylinositol and thyrotropin (tsh) signaling on one hand, and phosphatydylinositol and autoimmunity on the other hand. other issues are the consequences of malfunction of some receptors, such as those ones for tsh (tshr), insulin (ir) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1r), or the connection between serum tsh concentrations and insulin resistance. also covered are insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and their allied disorders (diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome [pcos]), autoimmunity and certain malignancies, with their reciprocal links. myoinositol has promising therapeutic potential. appreciation of the inositol pathways involved in certain disorders, as mentioned in this review, may stimulate researchers to envisage additional therapeutic applications.
fungal_infection	in the present study we investigated activity of oleuropein, a complex phenol present in large quantities in olive tree products, against opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. oleuropein was found to have in vitro antifungal activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 12.5 mg.ml(-1). morphological changes in the nuclei after staining with fluorescent dna-binding dyes revealed that apoptosis was a primary mode of cell death in the analyzed samples treated with subinhibitory concentrations of oleuropein. our results suggest that this antifungal agent targets virulence factors essential for establishment of the fungal infection. we noticed that oleuropein modulates morphogenetic conversion and inhibits filamentation of c. albicans. the hydrophobicity assay showed that oleuropein in sub-mic values has significantly decreased, in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the cellular surface hydrophobicity (csh) of c. albicans, a factor associated with adhesion to epithelial cells. it was also demonstrated that the tested compound inhibits the activity of saps, cellular enzymes secreted by c. albicans, which are reported to be related to the pathogenicity of the fungi. additionally, we detected that oleuropein causes a reduction in total sterol content in the membrane of c. albicans cells, which might be involved in the mechanism of its antifungal activity.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	the gut microbiota provides a range of ecologic, metabolic, and immunomodulatory functions relevant to health and well-being. the gut microbiota not only responds quickly to changes in diet, but this dynamic equilibrium may be managed to prevent and/or treat acute and chronic diseases. this article provides a working definition of the term ""microbiome"" and uses two examples of dietary interventions for the treatment of large bowel conditions to emphasize the links between diet and microbiome. there remains a need to develop a better functional understanding of the microbiota, if its management for clinical utility is to be fully realized.
overactive_bladder	there are few long-term studies on the midurethral sling (mus) procedure in patients with preoperative detrusor overactivity (do) and there is debate regarding the usefulness of preoperative cystometry. this study was designed to provide long-term efficacy and safety data for the advantage mus and to compare the outcomes in patients with pure urodynamic stress incontinence (usi) with the outcomes in patients with mixed usi and do. this was a retrospective consecutive case series study of 100 patients with usi (usi-only group) matched to a consecutive group of a further 100 patients with preoperative usi and do (mixed group) treated with a retropubic mus. outcomes were assessed using the king 's health questionnaire and patient global impression of improvement questionnaire. after a mean follow up of 6 years more patients in the usi-only group described themselves as ""very much better"" or ""much better"" (86 % usi-only group vs. 57 % mixed group; p = 0.007). quality of life was improved at 6 years from baseline in both groups. patients in the mixed group were more likely to complain of urgency (69 % vs. 42 %; p = 0.0007) which was more likely to be severe (34 % vs. 10 %; p = 0.004). a repeat mus procedure was needed in 1 % of patients and 0.6 % needed surgical removal of the mus for persistent troublesome pain. this study suggests that the preoperative diagnosis of do affects the long-term patient-perceived outcome of the mus procedure. however, most patients have significant long-term improvement in quality of life.
multiple_sclerosis	application of multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (mmre) of the brain parenchyma in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (nmosd) compared to age matched healthy controls (hc). 15 nmosd patients and 17 age- and gender-matched hc were examined using mmre. two three-dimensional viscoelastic parameter maps, the magnitude |g*| and phase angle phi of the complex shear modulus were reconstructed by simultaneous inversion of full wave-field data in 1.9-mm isotropic resolution at 7 harmonic drive frequencies from 30 to 60 hz. in nmosd patients, a significant reduction of |g*| was observed within the white matter fraction (p = 0.017), predominantly within the thalamic regions (p = 0.003), compared to hc. these parameters exceeded the reduction in brain volume measured in patients versus hc (p = 0.02 whole-brain volume reduction). volumetric differences in white matter fraction and the thalami were not detectable between patients and hc. however, phase angle phi was decreased in patients within the white matter (p = 0.03) and both thalamic regions (p = 0.044). mmre reveals global tissue degeneration with accelerated softening of the brain parenchyma in patients with nmosd. the predominant reduction of stiffness is found within the thalamic region and related white matter tracts, presumably reflecting wallerian degeneration. aeuro cent magnetic resonance elastography reveals diffuse cerebral tissue changes in patients with nmosd. aeuro cent premature tissue softening in nmosd patients indicates tissue degeneration. aeuro cent hypothesis of a widespread cerebral neurodegeneration in form of diffuse tissue alteration.
sports_injuries	to review the current knowledge on anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injury prevention and acl rehabilitation in individuals who have not yet reached musculoskeletal maturity. this is a narrative review based on a targeted and systematic literature search for paediatric acl injury risk factors, injury prevention and rehabilitation. the search strategies resulted in 119 hits on risk factor studies, 57 hits on prevention and 37 hits on rehabilitation. modifiable risk factors for acl injury are largely unknown in the paediatric population. acl injury prevention using neuromuscular training is highly successful in the adolescent population, and existing injury prevention programmes are cost-effective. the efficacy of acl injury prevention programmes in children is, however, investigated to a markedly lesser degree. paediatric acl injury rehabilitation is poorly described, although supervised active rehabilitation progressed through phases with functional milestones is generally encouraged. although limited, current evidence supports implementation of injury prevention programmes in female football players from the age of 12. supervised active rehabilitation where progression is guided by functional milestones is also advocated. future identification of modifiable risk factors is needed to design prevention programmes for younger children. there is a need for international multicentre studies on treatment algorithms and rehabilitation to increase knowledge on the short- and long-term outcomes following existing algorithms. narrative review, level iii.
multiple_sclerosis	background: hiv-associated neurocognitive disorder (hand) remains common, despite antiretroviral therapy (art). hiv dysregulates iron metabolism, but cerebrospinal fluid (csf) levels of iron and iron-transport proteins in hiv-infected (hiv+) persons are largely unknown. the objectives of this study were to characterize csf iron-related biomarkers in hiv+ adults and explore their relationships to known predictors of hand. methods: we quantified total iron, transferrin and heavy-chain (h)-ferritin by immunoassay in csf sampled by lumbar puncture in 403 hiv+ participants in a multi-center, observational study and evaluated biomarker associations with demographic and hiv-related correlates of hand [e.g., age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, art, and detectable plasma virus and csf viral load (vl)] by multivariable regression. in a subset (n = 110) with existing csf: serum albumin -(q(alb)) measurements, -q(alb) and comorbidity severity were also included as covariates to account for variability in the blood-csf-barrier. results: among 403 individuals (median age 43 years, 19% women, 56% non-whites, median nadir cd4+ t cell count 180 cells/mu l, 46% with undetectable plasma virus), men had 25% higher csf transferrin (median 18.1 vs. 14.5 mu g/ml), and 71% higher h-ferritin (median 2.9 vs. 1.7 ng/ml) than women (both rho-values = 0.01). csf iron was 41% higher in self-reported hispanics and 27% higher in (non-hispanic) whites than in (non-hispanic) blacks (median 5.2 and 4.7 mu g/dl in hispanics and whites, respectively, vs. 3.7 mu g/dl in blacks, both p = 0.01); these findings persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and hiv-specific factors. median h-ferritin was 25% higher (p50 years) than in younger persons (age <= 35 years; both p < 0.01), but these findings lost statistical significance in subset analyses that adjusted for q(alb) and comorbidity. after these additional adjustments, associations were observed for csf iron and transferrin with race/ethnicity as well as csf vl, for transferrin with sex and art, and for h-ferritin with plasma virus detectability and significant comorbidity (all p < 0.05). conclusions: csf iron biomarkers are associated with demographic factors, art, and csf vl in hiv+ adults. future studies should investigate a role for cns iron dysregulation, to which an altered blood-csf barrier may contribute, in hand.
multiple_sclerosis	multiple sclerosis (ms) is a chronic disorder that affects the central nervous system myelin. however, a few radiological cases have documented an involvement of peripheral cranial nerves, within the subarachnoid space, in ms patients. we report the case of a 36-year-old female with a history of relapsing-remitting (rr) ms who consulted for a subacute complete paralysis of the right iii nerve. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) examination showed enhancement and thickening of the cisternal right iii nerve, in continuity with a linear, mesencephalic, acute demyelinating lesion. radiological involvement of the cisternal part of iii nerve has been reported only once in ms patients. radiological involvement of the cisternal part of v nerve occurs more frequently, in almost 3% of ms patients. in both situations, the presence of a central demyelinating lesion, in continuity with the enhancement of the peripheral nerve, suggests that peripheral nerve damage is a secondary process, rather than a primary target of demyelination.
allergies	background: the international classification of diseases (icd) has been grouping the allergic and hypersensitivity disorders involving the respiratory tract under topographic distribution, regardless of the underlying mechanisms, triggers or concepts currently in use for allergic and hypersensitivity conditions. in order to strengthen awareness and deliberate the creation of the new ""allergic or hypersensitivity disorders involving the respiratory tract"" section of the icd-11, we here propose make the building process public. methods: the new frame has been constructed to cover the gaps previously identified and was based on consensus academic reports and icd-11 principles. constant and bilateral discussion was kept with relevant groups representing specialties and resulted in proposals submission into the icd-11 online platform. results: the ""allergic or hypersensitivity disorders involving the respiratory tract"" section covers 64 entities distributed across five main categories. all the 79 proposals submitted resulted from an intensive collaboration of the allergy working group, relevant expert working groups and the who icd governance. conclusion: the establishment of the icd-11 ""allergic or hypersensitivity disorders involving the respiratory tract"" section will allow the dissemination of the updated concepts to be used in clinical practice by many different specialties and health professionals.
allergies	backgroundto consolidate the new classification model addressed to the allergic and hypersensitivity conditions according to the international classification of diseases (icd)-11 revision timeline, we here propose real-life application of quality assurance methodology to evaluate sensitivity and accuracy of the anaphylaxis' subsection. methodswe applied field-testing methodology by analysing all the consecutive inpatients' files documented as allergies from the university hospital of montpellier electronic database for the period of 1 year. the files clinically validated as being anaphylaxis were manually blind-coded under icd-10 and current icd-11 beta draft. the correspondence of coding and the impressions regarding sensibility were evaluated. resultsfrom all 2318 files related to allergic or hypersensitivity conditions, 673 had some of the anaphylaxis icd-10 codes; 309 files (46%) from 209 patients had anaphylaxis and allergic or hypersensitivity comorbidities description. the correspondence between the two coders was perfect for 162 codes from all 309 entities (52.4%) (cohen-kappa value 0.63) with the icd-10 and for 221 codes (71.5%) (cohen-kappa value 0.77) with the icd-11. there was a high agreement regarding sensibility of the icd-11 usability (cohen-kappa value 0.75). conclusionwe here propose the first attempt of real-life application to validate the new icd-11 anaphylaxis' subsection. clearer was the improvement in accuracy reaching 71.5% of agreement when icd-11 was used. by allowing all the relevant diagnostic terms for anaphylaxis to be included into the icd-11 framework, who has recognized their importance not only to clinicians but also to epidemiologists, statisticians, healthcare planners and other stakeholders.
low_testosterone	introduction testosterone deficiency syndrome (tds) is usually suspected on the basis of signs/symptoms. however, some men with low testosterone levels (low t) are asymptomatic or present mild, unnoticed symptoms. would they have the same cardiovascular risk as symptomatic men? aims this study aims to assess the relationship between presence/severity of low t-related symptoms and the likelihood of metabolic syndrome (mets). methods data were taken from a multicenter, cross-sectional study conducted in spain among men visiting men 's healthcare offices aged 45 with low t (total t <8nmol/l or <12nmol/l and calculated free t <250nmol/l). only subjects whose mets components and symptoms had been assessed were selected. data available included anthropometrics, toxic habits, comorbidities, and total testosterone (tt) levels. main outcome measures mets was defined using the harmonized definition. erectile dysfunction was classified using the international index of erectile function questionnaire. the ageing male symptoms (ams) scale assessed symptoms. symptom severity was classified as none/mild and moderate/severe. bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the effect of moderate/severe symptoms on the odds ratio (or) for mets. results mean age (sd) was 61.2 (8.1) years. erectile dysfunction (ed), ams, and mets prevalence were 97.4%, 94.9%, and 69.6%. prevalence of mets was higher in men with moderate/severe symptoms vs. men with no/mild ones (75.3% vs. 57.9%, p<0.001). age and prevalence of tt <8nmol/l, moderate/severe ed, and obesity were significantly higher in men with moderate/severe symptoms. multivariate analysis showed that besides obesity and moderate/severe ed, moderate/severe symptoms increased the likelihood of mets. this effect disappeared in men with severe ed and in the nonobese. three symptoms showed relationship with mets after adjusting for all confounding factors. conclusion severity of tds symptoms may indicate higher cardiovascular risk in men with low t. garcia-cruz e, leibar-tamayo a, romero-otero j, asiain i, carrion a, castaneda r, mateu l, luque p, cardenosa o, and alcaraz a. marked testosterone deficiency-related symptoms may be associated to higher metabolic risk in men with low testosterone levels. j sex med 2014;11:2292-2301.
emergency_contraception	background health risk behaviours are prominent in late adolescence and young adulthood, yet uk population-level research examining the relationship between drug or alcohol use and sexual health and behaviour among young people is scarce, despite public health calls for an integrated approach to health improvement. our objective was to further our understanding of the scale of and nature of any such relationship, using contemporary data from britain 's third national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (natsal-3). methods analyses of data from natsal-3, a stratified probability survey of 15162 men and women (3869 aged 16-24years), undertaken in 2010-2012, using computer-assisted personal interviewing, were carried out. logistic regression was used to explore associations between reporting (1) frequent binge drinking (weekly), (2) recent drug use (within past 4weeks) or (3) multiple (both types of) substance use, and key sexual risk behaviours and adverse sexual health outcomes. we then examined the sociodemographic profile, health behaviours and attitudes reported by risky' young people, defined as those reporting 1 type of substance use plus non-condom use at first sex with 1 new partner(s), last year. results men and women reporting frequent binge drinking or recent drug use were more likely to report: unprotected first sex with 1 new partner(s), last year; first sex with their last partner after only recently meeting; emergency contraception use (last year) and sexually transmitted infection diagnosis/es (past 5years). associations with sexual risk were frequently stronger for those reporting multiple substance use, particularly among men. the profile of risky' young people differed from that of other 16-24years old. conclusions in this nationally representative study, substance use was strongly associated with sexual risk and adverse sexual health outcomes among young people. qualitative or event-level research is needed to examine the context and motivations behind these associations to inform joined-up interventions to address these inter-related behaviours.
overactive_bladder	purpose: in this study, we investigated overactive bladder (oab) functions in male patients who used antidepressant drugs (ads) that were previously examined in female patients, based on conflicting data in literature regarding the effects of ad on oab and the differences between male and female urinary system physiologies (anatomical and hormonal). methods: the study included 202 male patients (a control group of 90 healthy subjects, and an experimental group of 112 patients taking ads for different disorders). all the patients completed the overactive bladder-validated 8 (oab-v8) questionnaire, the international consultation on incontinence questionnaire-short form (iciq-sf), and the beck depression inventory (bds). results: the oab-v8, iciq-sf, and bds scores for the antidepressant users were significantly higher than those of the control group. the highest prevalence of oab symptoms was observed in patients taking venlafaxine (68.2%), and the lowest prevalence was in patients taking sertraline (28.0%). moreover, the frequency of oab between the antidepressant groups was statistically significant. the univariate logistic regression analyses showed a significant relationship between the presence of oab, antidepressant usage, bds score, and the age of a patient. in the multivariate logistic regression analyses, the association between the presence of oab and antidepressant usage was statistically significant. conclusions: the present study showed that the incidence of oab and the severity of oab symptoms increased in males using antidepressants for various disorders. this may have been due to unique pharmacological effects, on a molecular or individual level, of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
alzheimer's_disease	significant progress has been made in characterizing the biological changes occurring in preclinical alzheimer 's disease (ad). cognitive dysfunction has been viewed, however, as a late-stage phenomenon, despite increasing evidence that changes may be detected in the decades preceding dementia. in the absence of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for preclinical cognitive assessment, longitudinal cohort and neuroimaging studies have been reviewed to determine the temporal order and brain biomarker correlates of specific cognitive functions. episodic memory decline was observed to be the most salient cognitive function, correlating with high levels of amyloid deposition and hypoconnectivity across large-scale brain networks. prospective studies point to early decline in both episodic and semantic memory processing as well as executive functions in the predementia period. the cognitive tests have, however, been principally those used to diagnose dementia. new procedures are required which target more finely the medial temporal lobe subregions first affected by clinically silent ad pathology.

emergency_contraception	objective: to summarize evidence regarding current demand for on-demand oral contraception. study design: we used medline and collegial contacts to find published and unpublished studies conducted or reported in the past 15 years with information assessing women 's interest in using any oral drug preparation, including emergency contraceptive pills, in a coitus-dependent manner either repeatedly or as a primary or planned pregnancy prevention method. results: we found 19 studies with relevant information. the studies were conducted in 16 countries. eight studies provided data on women 's attitudes regarding a coitus-dependent oral contraceptive; all suggested substantial interest in using it. nine studies assessed actual use of oral tablets on demand for primary contraception. in these studies, 9-97% of women in the analysis populations reported using the pills on demand as main method, although frequency and consistency of use varied. reported reasons for interest in or use of this contraceptive approach included convenience, ease of remembering, ability to conceal use, lack of coital interruption, and infrequent sexual activity. three studies were clinical trials of investigational on-demand oral contraceptives which reported pearl indices ranging from 6.8 to 53 pregnancies per 100 woman-years. conclusion: data from a variety of settings suggest that demand for an on-demand oral contraceptive may be widespread. the effectiveness of this potential method is not established, however. considering the seriousness of the unmet need for contraception, further development research into the public health benefits and risks of such a method would be worthwhile.

myelofibrosis	bone marrow examination (aspiration and biopsy) carried out in 30 cases having pancytopenia, had megaloblastic anemia as the commonest cause (46.6%) of pancytopenia. other common conditions presenting as pancytopenia were micro-normoblastic erythroid hyperplasia (16.6%), aplastic anaemia (13.3%). uncommon causes of pancytopenia were acute leukemia (al), myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), myelofibrosis (mf) and multiple myeloma (mm).
cancer	this work aims to characterize personal exposure of firefighters to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) in non-fire work environments (fire stations), and assesses the respective risks. eighteen pahs (16 considered by usepa as priority pollutants, dibenzo[a,l] pyrene and benzo[j] fluoranthene) were monitored in breathing zones of workers at five portuguese fire stations during a normal shift. the obtained levels of pahs fulfilled all existent occupational exposure limits as well as air quality guidelines with total concentrations (sigma pahs) in range of 46.8-155 ng m(-3). light compounds (2-3 rings) were the most predominant congeners (74-96% of sigma pahs) whereas pahs with 5-6 rings accounted 3-9% of sigma pahs. fuel and biomass combustions, vehicular traffic emissions, and use of lubricant oils were identified as the main sources of pahs exposure at the studied fire corporations. incremental lifetime cancer risks were below the recommend usepa guideline of 10(-6) and thus negligible for all the studied subjects, but who health-based guideline level of 10(-5) was exceeded (9-44 times) at all fire corporations. these results thus show that even during non-fire situations firefighters are exposed to pahs at levels that may promote some adverse health outcomes; therefore the respective occupational exposures to these compounds should be carefully controlled.

allergies	atopic eczema (synonymous with atopic dermatitis) is a common heterogeneous phenotype with a wide spectrum of severity, from mild transient disease to a severe chronic disorder with atopic and non-atopic comorbidities. eczema is a complex trait, resulting from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. the skin, as an organ that can be biopsied easily, provides opportunities for detailed molecular genetic analysis. strategies applied to the investigation of atopic eczema include candidate gene and genome-wide studies, extreme phenotypes, and comparative analysis of inflammatory skin diseases. genetic studies have identified a central role for skin barrier impairment in eczema predisposition and perpetuation; this has brought about a paradigm shift in understanding atopic disease, but specific molecular targets to improve skin barrier function remain elusive. the role of th2-mediated immune dysfunction is also central to atopic inflammation, and has proved to be a powerful target for biological therapy in atopic eczema. advances in understanding eczema pathogenesis have provided opportunities for patient stratification, primary prevention, and therapy development, but there remain considerable challenges in the application of this knowledge to optimize benefit for patients with atopic eczema in the era of personalized medicine. copyright (c) 2016 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
sports_injuries	injury is a major setback for both sportsmen and women, and more so for elite athletes. this has spurred research which is primarily focused on physical recovery and treatment where psychological resilience plays a crucial role in recovery. in order to assess the prevalence of injuries and strategies for coping with them used by elite athletes to recover from their injuries, 362 kayakists (226 men and 136 women) registered in the spanish national championship 2012 were assessed. participants answered a questionnaire on sports injuries and the athletic coping skills inventory (crocker, 1992). the results revealed that the probability of suffering a sports injury was significant (.376) and similar in all the different stages of training; athletes do not adopt just one coping style, but a combination of adaptive and maladaptive strategies; in the maintenance stage of performance gains athletes resort to fewer maladaptive strategies; and male kayakists use different strategies to female kayakists to cope with injury. these results lend support to the lazarus and folkman model (1984), and the implications for intervention are discussed.
cancer	the novel temperature-responsive poly(cholesteryl methacylate) (pchma) coatings derived from renewable sources were synthesized and characterized. temperature induced changes in wettability were accompanied by surface roughness modifications, traced with afm. topographies recorded for temperatures increasing from 5 to 25 degrees c showed a slight but noticeable increase of calculated root mean square (rms) roughness by a factor of 1.5, suggesting a horizontal rearrangement in the structure of pchma coatings. another structural reordering was observed in the 55-85 degrees c temperature range. the recorded topography changed noticeably from smooth at 55 c to very structured and rough at 60 c and returned eventually to relatively smooth at 85 c. in addition, temperature transitions of pchma molecules were revealed by dsc measurements. the biocompatibility of the pchma-grafted coatings was shown for cultures of granulosa cells and a non malignant bladder cancer cell (hcv29 line) culture.

birth_control	lacking of shelter and care from their children, chinese lost only-child elderly are impoverished and their mental state compared to older people in general are more fragile and sensitive. they have even united themselves for self-help, while their efforts have been often unhelpful. their scale has been increasingly expanding and risen to many serious social problems. appearance of lost only-child old man people and vulnerability of protection for those elderly is mainly due to the faultiness of birth control policy, lack of government finance and imperfect social security system. chinese government should establish a mechanism to increase and maintain the value of administrative compensations, strengthen administrative pay and protection of administrative contracts, broaden administrative relief channels for the elderly, and effectively protect the pension interests of the lost only-child elderly.
hepatitis_c	the emerging of hepatitis c virus (hcv) resistant strains has been considered as a main drawback of the available drugs. since hcv has a large inactive surface, we would like to hypothesis that the mutation occur in hcv is minimal and causing less resistance against inhibition. in this study, a short peptide inhibitor of hcv namely plectasin was identified by hcv ns3-4a serine protease assay. plectasin peptide showed considerable inhibition against hcv ns3-4a serine protease. enzymatic activity of the recombinant ns3-4apro was analysed by fluorescence release from several fluorogenic peptide substrates which resembling the dibasic cleavage site sequences of the flavivirus polyprotein precursor. of all amc-labelled peptides, pyr-rtkr-amc was the most efficiently cleaved substrate with the lowest km value of 20 a mu m. the kinetic assay showed that plectasin peptide inhibited ns3-4apro activity with an ic50 value of 4.3 mu m compared to the aprotinin as a standard proteases inhibitor with an ic50 of 6.1 mu m. from the results, plectasin peptide also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of hcv replication with a considerable reduction in rluc activity at 15 a mu m using hcv replicon- containing huh-7 cells. our study has identified a unique natural peptide that can be used to highlight novel structures for the development of drug derivatives with high efficacy of hcv ns3-4a protease inhibitors.
emergency_contraception	background: emergency contraceptive pills (ecp) are one of the 13 essential commodities addressed by the un commission on life-saving commodities for women and children. although ecp have been available for 20 years, a number of barriers still limit women 's access ecp in low and middle-income countries (lmic). the workforce who prescribe or dispense ecp are diverse reflecting the varied contexts where ecp are available across the health, commercial and justice sectors and in the community. no reviews currently exist that examine the roles and experiences of the workforce that provide ecp in lmic. method: we present a narrative synthesis of research to: identify provider factors that facilitate and constraint access to ecp; assess the effectiveness of associated interventions and; explore associated health system issues in lmic. a search of bibliographic databases, meta-indexes and websites was undertaken to retrieve peer reviewed and grey literature. literature was screened and identified documents examined to appraise quality. results: thirty-seven documents were included in the review. studies focused on formal health workers revealing knowledge gaps concerning the role of private sector and non-health providers who increasingly provide ecp. data from the findings section in the documents were coded under 4 themes: provider knowledge; provider attitudes and beliefs; provider practice and provider training. the analysis revealed provider knowledge gaps, less than favourable attitudes and practice issues. the findings provide limited insight into products prescribed and/or dispensed, the frequency of provision, and information and advice offered to consumers. pre and in-service training needs were noted. conclusion: as the provision of ecps shifts from the clinic-based health sector to increasing provision by the private sector, the limited understanding of provider performance and the practice gaps revealed in this review highlight the need to further examine provider performance to inform the development of appropriate workforce interventions. a standardized approach to assessing performance using agreed outcomes measures may serve to ensure a systematic way forward that is inclusive of the diverse workforce that deliver ecp. recommendations are outlined to enhance the performance of providers to improve access to ecp. a framework is offered to help guide this process with indicators.
weight_loss	background: exacerbations in copd are often accompanied by pulmonary and systemic inflammation, and associated with increased susceptibility to and prevalence of weight loss and muscle wasting. muscle mass loss during disease exacerbations may contribute to emphysema-associated muscle atrophy. however, whether pulmonary inflammation in presence of emphysema differentially affects skeletal muscle, including protein synthesis and degradation signaling pathways has not previously been addressed. the aims of this study were to 1) develop a mouse model of disease exacerbation-associated muscle wasting, 2) evaluate whether emphysema and muscle wasting can be monitored non-invasively and 3) assess alterations in muscle protein turnover regulation. methods: emphysema was induced by three, weekly intra-tracheal (it) elastase (e) or vehicle control (vc) instillations, followed by one single it-lps bolus (l) or vc instillation to mimic pulmonary inflammation-driven disease exacerbation. consequently, four experimental groups were defined: vc/vc ('c'), e/vc ('e'), vc/lps ('l'), e/lps ('e + l'). using micro cone-beam ct-scans, emphysema development and muscle mass changes were monitored, and correlated to muscle weight 48 h after lps instillation. protein turnover signaling was assessed in muscle tissue collected 24 h post lps instillation. results: micro-ct imaging correlated strongly with established invasive measurements of emphysema and muscle atrophy. pulmonary inflammation following lps instillation developed irrespective of emphysema and body and muscle weight were similarly reduced in the 'l' and 'e + l' groups. accordingly, mrna and protein expression levels of genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (ups) and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (alp) were upregulated in skeletal muscle following it-lps ('l' and 'e + l'). in contrast, mtor signaling, which controls alp and protein synthesis, was reduced by pulmonary inflammation ('l' and 'e + l') as well as emphysema as a single insult ('e') compared to control. conclusion: changes in lung tissue density and muscle mass can be monitored non-invasively to evaluate emphysema and muscle atrophy longitudinally. acute loss of muscle mass evoked by pulmonary inflammation is similar in control and emphysematous mice. although muscle atrophy cues in response to pulmonary inflammation are not altered by emphysema, emphysema itself affects protein synthesis and alp signaling, which may interfere with muscle mass recovery and impair maintenance of muscle mass in emphysema.
sports_injuries	judo is a combat sport with high risk of injury. we present a rare case of traumatic left posterior sternoclavicular (sc) joint dislocation, inflicted to a 12-year-old boy during a judo contest. an extensive literature review did not reveal any case of posterior sc joint dislocation in judo. the patient was treated with closed reduction under general anesthesia. at 2-year follow-up, his left upper extremity had full range of motion, and he did not complain of any residual symptoms. he decided to discontinue judo training; however, he participates in other physically demanding sports. although not often encountered, posterior sc joint dislocation is a challenging and critical medical problem that can be fatal if not promptly diagnosed and treated on time and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of trauma-related anterior chest pain.
birth_control	intra-uterine device (iud) is one of the birth control methods, which is available for nulliparous women, even though misconceptions still remain in medical or popular opinion. only 1.3 % of nulliparous have a iud as contraception in france while it is the second methods used by all women, after pill. the best contraception is the one chosen by women; however, the choice for a nulliparous of an iud may be really difficult, despite the increasing number of women wishing to use it. long-acting reversible contraceptives utilization, including iud, is probably one of the issues to decrease the unintended pregnancies. an exhaustive and clear information about iud is necessary to allow an informed and real choice. this prescription must consider contraindications and medical conditions for safe insertion, especially to avoid infection by screening std (chlamydia trachomatis and nesseria gonorrhoeae) in nulliparous women < 25 years old. insertion must be effected with usual precautions and short or sl iud preferred. even if side effects such as expulsion, pelvic pains or dysmenorrhea are more frequent by nulliparous, iud is a first intention choice for contraception to be consider, that women could obtain easily, including in emergency contraception situation.

irritable_bowel_syndrome	background & aims: there is evidence that food components beyond gluten cause symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity without celiac disease (nonceliac gluten sensitivity [ncgs]). we investigated the diets and nutritional characteristics of patients with ncgs. methods: we performed a prospective observational study of 29 patients with ncgs seen at the outpatient clinic for celiac disease and other food intolerances of the university of salerno in italy from september 2015 through april 2016. our study also included 37 control subjects. an experienced dietitian administered a validated food frequency questionnaire (from the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition) to collect information on amounts of common foods consumed. patients and control subjects also completed the eating attitudes test for diet-related disorders. patients with ncgs completed the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory 2-i questionnaire. differences in frequencies between patients and control subjects were calculated using chi-square test, whereas differences between continuous variables were calculated using student t test. all tests were 2-tailed with significance level set at p65 from the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory, indicating a high level of concern for their health. conclusions: in an observational study, we found that patients with ncgs eat different foods than healthy individuals; patients consume lower levels of proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. their diets should be routinely analyzed and possibly corrected to avoid nutritional deficiencies.
allergies	background: management of allergic patients in the population is becoming more difficult because of increases in both complexity and prevalence. although general practitioners (gps) are expected to play an important role in the care of allergic patients, they often feel ill-equipped for this task. therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an allergy management support system (amss) for primary care. methods: through literature review, interviewing and testing in secondary and primary care patients, an allergy history questionnaire was constructed by allergists, dermatologists, gps and researchers based on primary care and specialists' allergy guidelines and their clinical knowledge. patterns of amss questionnaire responses and specific immunoglobulin e (sige)-test outcomes were used to identify diagnostic categories and develop corresponding management recommendations. validity of the amss was investigated by comparing specialist (gold standard) and amss diagnostic categories. results: the two-page patient-completed amss questionnaire consists of 12 (mainly) multiple choice questions on symptoms, triggers, severity and medication. based on the amss questionnaires and sige-test outcome of 118 patients, approximately 150 diagnostic categories of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, food allergy, hymenoptera allergy and other allergies were identified, and the corresponding management recommendations were formulated. the agreement between the allergy specialists' assessments and the amss was 69.2% (ci 67.2-71.2). conclusion: using a systematic approach, it was possible to develop an amss that allows for the formulation of diagnostic and management recommendations for gps managing allergic patients. the amss thus holds promise for the improvement of the quality of primary care for this increasing group of patients.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundenvironmental stress affects the gut with dysmotility being a common consequence. although a variety of microbes or molecules may prevent the dysmotility, none reverse the dysmotility. methodswe have used a 1hour restraint stress mouse model to test for treatment effects of the neuroactive microbe, l.rhamnosus jb-1. motility of fluid-filled ex vivo gut segments in a perfusion organ bath was recorded by video and migrating motor complexes measured using spatiotemporal maps of diameter changes. key resultsstress reduced jejunal and increased colonic propagating contractile cluster velocities and frequencies, while increasing contraction amplitudes for both. luminal application of 10e8cfu/ml jb-1 restored motor complex variables to unstressed levels within minutes of application. l.salivarius or na.acetate had no treatment effects, while na.butyrate partially reversed stress effects on colonic frequency and amplitude. na.propionate reversed the stress effects for jejunum and colon except on jejunal amplitude. conclusions & inferencesour findings demonstrate, for the first time, a potential for certain beneficial microbes as treatment of stress-induced intestinal dysmotility and that the mechanism for restoration of function occurs within the intestine via a rapid drug-like action on the enteric nervous system.
alzheimer's_disease	amyloid beta-peptide (a beta) is now considered as a key predictor for preclinical diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease (ad), whose diagnosis is still hampered by the lack of early, sensitive, and convenient tools. herein, we propose a colorimetric sandwich immunosensor for a beta((1-42)) based on dual antibody-modified gold nanoparticles. bare aunps are successfully coated with n-terminal antibody of a beta((1-42))) (n-ab((1-42))aunp) and c-terminal antibody of a beta((1-42)) (c-ab((1-42)))-aunp), respectively. subsequently, a beta(142) can be simultaneously captured by the prepared aunps@c/n-ab((1-42))) (c-ab((1-42)))-aunp:n-ab((1)-(42))-aunp =1:1) owing to the specific binding of n- and c-terminal antibody with a beta((1-42)), and thus the aunps@c/nab((1-42)) are aggregated, accompanying with obvious color change from red to blue. by means of this colorimetric sandwich immunosensor system, a good linearity within a range from 7.5 nm to 350 nm is found, with a detection limit of 2.3 nm, which is equal to or better than other reported detection methods for a beta((1-42)). the newly colorimetric sandwich immunosensor system strikingly achieves specific, visual and simply detection of ail and can be exploited toward the determination of other similar biomarkers related to diseases in biological or biomedical diagnosis.

senior_health	decline in cognitive function in the elderly is common and represents a major clinical and public health concern. aspirin may reduce the decline in cognitive function by influencing multi-infarct dementia, but data are sparse. the east boston senior health project is a population-based cohort study that enrolled 3,809 community-dwelling residents aged 65 years and older in 1982-1983 and followed them with home visits every 3 years until 1988-1989. trained interviewers assessed cognitive function by using the short portable mental status questionnaire and assessed medication use, including over-the-counter drugs. response to the short portable mental status questionnaire was scored as high, medium, or low, and decline was defined as transition to a lower category. participants who used drugs containing aspirin in the 2 weeks prior to the interview were classified as aspirin users. multiple logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for decline of cognitive function. the estimating equation approach was used to adjust the standard errors for repeated measurements. aspirin users had an odds ratio for cognitive decline of 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.82-1.15). low frequency of aspirin use (less than daily) was associated with an odds ratio of 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.09). although no substantial effect was observed, the data are also compatible with a modest benefit of aspirin, especially with intermittent use, on decline of cognitive function. concern about small residual biases from self-selection or confounding suggests that randomized trials will be necessary to provide definitive data on this question.
myelofibrosis	objectives: mutations in calr (calreticulin) have been discovered in 50% to 80% of jak2 (janus kinase 2) and mpl (myeloproliferative leukemia protein) wild-type patients with philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpns). we evaluate the performance of a monoclonal antibody for immunohistochemical detection of calr mutations. methods: a computerized archival search was performed for cases of non-chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) mpns with available calr and jak2 v617f mutational analysis data. bone marrow biopsy specimens were stained with monoclonal antibody cal2, and the percentage of stained megakwyocytes was calculated. in select cases, double immunofluorescence staining was done with cal2 and each of the following: cd61, myeloperoxidase, cd34, and glycophorin a. results: we studied 38 bone marrow biopsy specimens of non-cml mpns (primal)) myelofibrosis, n = 21; essential thrombocythemia, n = 15; and n = 2 post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis) from 31 patients. all eight bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with mutant calr showed strong cytoplasmic staining of the megakaryocytes (83.5%; range, 50%-98%; median, 87%) with the cal2 antibody. double immunofluorescence staining of the small mononuclear cells seen in calr mutant cases revealed them to be myeloid blasts. conclusions: immunohistochemistry in routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens for mutated calr is feasible and accurately identifies mutated cases, including rare cases with additional driver mutations.
sports_injuries	purpose of review ankle sprains, which account for 40% of sports injuries in the usa, can lead to chronic ankle instability. chronic ankle instability can be classified as functional, mechanical, or a combination of both and is diagnosed using a combination of a physical exam, an mri, and stress radiographs. this review focuses on different approaches to treatment, including non-operative and operative techniques, of chronic ankle instability, including reviewing traditional procedures as well as more novel and newer techniques. recent findings based on existing literature, non-operative treatment should always precede operative treatment of chronic ankle instability. if rehabilitation fails, brostrom-gould type ankle stabilization has been the preferred surgical option. recent literature suggests that arthroscopic repair might reduce recovery time and improve outcomes in certain populations; however, there are higher rates of complication following these surgeries. in more high-risk populations, some literature reports that ligament repair with peroneus brevis transfer could be a more effective treatment option. summary currently, varying surgical techniques exist for the treatment of chronic ankle instability. while the more recently reported techniques show promise, it is important to note that there is little evidence showing they are more successful than traditional techniques. it is imperative that future studies focus on outcomes and complication rates of these newer procedures.
overactive_bladder	introduction: the study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of solifenacin in older patients with overactive bladder (oab). materials and methods: observational data on patients aged >= 70 years and the prescribed flexible dose of solifenacin for oab were collected at 294 offices of german general practitioners. baseline and week 12 data included type and severity of oab symptoms, adverse events, quality of life, and change in cognitive function per mini mental state examination (mmse). results: mean age of 774 patients was 78 +/- 6 years. a decrease was observed in all oab symptoms including a reduction of urinary urgency and micturition, each by 4 episodes per 24 h. no change in mean mmse scores was apparent at week 12. adverse events and treatment discontinuations were low at 5.8 and 0.5%, respectively. conclusion: solifenacin was well-tolerated while oab symptoms declined at week 12. no relevant effect of solifenacin on cognitive function was observed in this elderly population.

diabetes	synthetic insulin analogues with a long lifetime are current drug targets for the therapy of diabetic patients. the replacement of the interchain disulfide with a diselenide bridge, which is more resistant to reduction and internal bond rotation, can enhance the lifetime of insulin in the presence of the insulin-degrading enzyme (ide) without impairing the hormonal function. the [c7u(a), c7u(b)] variant of bovine pancreatic insulin (bpins) was successfully prepared by using two selenocysteine peptides (i.e., the c7u analogues of a-and b-chains, respectively). in a buffer solution at ph 10 they spontaneously assembled under thermodynamic control to the correct insulin fold. the selenoinsulin (se-ins) exhibited a bioactivity comparable to that of bpins. interestingly, degradation of se-ins with ide was significantly decelerated (t(1/2) approximate to 8 h vs. approximate to 1 h for bpins). the lifetime enhancement could be due to both the intrinsic stability of the diselenide bond and local conformational changes induced by the substitution.
allergies	background: grasses (poaceae) are one of the largest plant families and are distributed worldwide. grass pollen allergy is one of the most important pollen allergies affecting large parts of the population worldwide. the grass pollen season itself is special since it is caused by the flowering of various grass species that present unique profiles of allergenicity, which assumingly plays a significant role and impact on grass pollen sensitization profiles for the allergy sufferer. the aim of this study, conducted in vienna, 2014, was to analyze the possible contribution of prevalent grass species to the grass pollen season and to the symptom load of grass allergy sufferers. methods: this was the first study that combines phenological observations (i.e. grass species and their flowering periods) with aerobiological measurements (i.e. daily grass pollen concentrations) in concert with allergic symptoms from local users of the patient 's hayfever diary (symptom load index calculation). results: both the pollen concentrations and the symptom levels were higher in the first half of the main grass pollen season and therefore show the highest impact on pollen allergy sufferers. of important note were the following species that are widely distributed in vienna: kentucky bluegrass (poa pratensis), orchard grass (dactylis glomerata), false oat-grass (arrhenatherum elatius), fescue grass (festuca sp.) and perennial rye-grass (lolium perenne). conclusion: monitoring different grass species provided evidence for varying contribution in pollination across the main grass pollen season and highlighted the significance this impact may have on pollen allergy sufferers.

alzheimer's_disease	to perform a joint analysis of multivariate neuroimaging phenotypes and candidate genetic markers obtained from longitudinal studies, we develop a bayesian longitudinal low-rank regression (l2r2) model. the l2r2 model integrates three key methodologies: a low-rank matrix for approximating the high-dimensional regression coefficient matrices corresponding to the genetic main effects and their interactions with time, penalized splines for characterizing the overall time effect, and a sparse factor analysis model coupled with random effects for capturing within-subject spatio-temporal correlations of longitudinal phenotypes. posterior computation proceeds via an efficient markov chain monte carlo algorithm. simulations show that the l2r2 model outperforms several other competing methods. we apply the l2r2 model to investigate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) on the top 10 and top 40 previously reported alzheimer disease associated genes. we also identify associations between the interactions of these snps with patient age and the tissue volumes of 93 regions of interest from patients' brain images obtained from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative.
low_testosterone	introduction sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction (ed), is common in men with type 2 diabetes, occurring in up to 75% of cases. the prevalence of hypogonadism is also high in men with diabetes and low testosterone is associated with both sexual dysfunction and a reduced response to oral therapy for ed. aim this study aimed to determine the effect of testosterone replacement with long-acting testosterone undecanoate (tu) on sexual function, mood and quality of life vs. placebo over a treatment period of 30 weeks followed by 52 weeks of open-label medication. the study was conducted in a primary care population of men with type 2 diabetes attending their primary care physician for routine visits. methods the male diabetic populations of seven general practices were screened at routine diabetes visits to detect symptomatic men with total testosterone levels of 12nmol/l or less or with free testosterones of 250pmol/l or less. two hundred eleven men were screened. a double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in 199 men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism treated for 30 weeks with either 1,000mg of tu or matching placebo followed by 52-week open-label follow on. main outcome measures the primary outcome measure, international index of erectile function (iief), was used to evaluate sexual dysfunction, and the ageing male symptom (ams), hospital anxiety and depression scale, and global efficacy question were used as secondary outcome measures to assess mood and self-reported quality of life. results testosterone replacement therapy with long-acting tu improved all domains of sexual function at 30 weeks (erectile function [ef], p=0.005; intercourse satisfaction, p=0.015; sexual desire, p=0.001; overall satisfaction, p=0.05; and orgasm, p=0.04), with benefit as early as 6 weeks. improvements in ams score were significant in men without depression (p=0.02) and the presence of depression at baseline was associated with marked reduction in response to both sexual function and psychological scores. all responses in sexual function continued to improve significantly up to 18 months with an improvement in ef score of 4.31 from baseline. in a small cohort of 35 men taking phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, there was no change during the double-blind phase but a nine-point improvement in ef domain during 52-week open-label treatment. after 30 weeks, 46% vs. 17% of patients on active therapy vs. placebo felt that the treatment had improved their health, reaching 70% after open-label therapy. less obese and older patients responded better to testosterone therapy. there were no significant adverse events. conclusion tu significantly improved all domains of the iief and patient reported quality of life at 30 weeks and more significantly after 52-week open-label extension. improvement was most marked in less obese patient and those without coexisting depression. in men with type 2 diabetes, trials of therapy may need to be given for much longer than 3-6 months suggested in current guidelines.
emergency_contraception	introduction: several selective progesterone receptor modulators (sprms) show promise in several areas of medicine and this work has been summarized by us in 2008. areas covered: since the publication of our reviews, several developments have taken place in the field of reproductive medicine. the first is emergency contraception (ec). two sprms are clinically utilized today: mifepristone (mfp) and ulipristal acetate (upa). mfp is available for ec in up to 120 h following unprotected intercourse. a dose of 10 mg is significantly more effective than levonorgestrel (lng). in a metanalysis of the use of upa versus lng up to 72 h after unprotected intercourse, failure rates of 1.4 versus 2.2% were reported. the second is contraception. a daily dose of 2 mg mfp can block ovulation and several mfp regimens are being tested, including a vaginal ring releasing mfp. the third is the preoperative administration in women harboring leiomyomas, where clinical testing of several sprm has shown that they can decrease uterine leiomyomas' size and substantially reduce uterine bleeding. sprm can induce unusual, specific endometrial appearances. many believe that these changes should not cause concern, but the issue remains controversial. expert opinion: sprms are very effective in ec and for the preoperative treatment of uterine leiomyomas.
emergency_contraception	background: it is widely agreed that the practices of clinicians should be based on the best available research evidence, but too often this evidence is not reliably disseminated to people who can make use of it. this ""know-do"" gap leads to ineffective resource use and suboptimal provision of services, which is especially problematic in low-and middle-income countries (lmics) which face greater resource limitations. family planning, including intrauterine device (iud) use, represents an important area to evaluate clinicians' knowledge and practices in order to make improvements. methods: a questionnaire was developed, tested and administered to 438 individuals in china (n = 115), kazakhstan (n = 110), laos (n = 105), and mexico (n = 108). the participants responded to ten questions assessing knowledge and practices relating to contraception and iuds, and a series of questions used to determine their individual characteristics and working context. ordinal logistic regressions were conducted with knowledge and practices as dependent variables. results: overall, a 96 % response rate was achieved (n = 438/458). only 2.8 % of respondents were able to correctly answer all five knowledge-testing questions, and only 0.9 % self-reported ""often"" undertaking all four recommended clinical practices and ""never"" performing the one practice that was contrary to recommendation. statistically significant factors associated with knowledge scores included: 1) having a masters or doctorate degree; and 2) often reading scientific journals from high-income countries. significant factors associated with recommended practices included: 1) training in critically appraising systematic reviews; 2) training in the care of patients with iuds; 3) believing that research performed in their own country is above average or excellent in quality; 4) being based in a facility operated by an ngo; and 5) having the view that higher quality available research is important to improving their work. conclusions: this analysis supports previous work emphasizing the need for improved knowledge and practices among clinicians concerning the use of iuds for family planning. it also identifies areas in which targeted interventions may prove effective. assessing opportunities for increasing education and training programs for clinicians in research and iud provision could prove to be particularly effective.
low_testosterone	objective: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) has been claimed as a liver phenotype of metabolic syndrome, which in turn is associated with male hypogonadism. we assessed whether an independent association between nafld and androgen deficiency could be revealed in men with chronic spinal cord injury (sci), who exhibit a high prevalence of biochemical androgen deficiency and a combination of risk factors for metabolic syndrome. design: fifty-five consecutive men with chronic sci admitted to a rehabilitation program underwent clinical/biochemical evaluations and liver ultrasonography. results: nafld was diagnosed in 27 patients (49.1%). men with nafld were older and exhibited significantly higher body mass index, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase values, lower total and free testosterone levels and they were engaged in a significantly poorer weekly leisure time physical activity (ltpa). at the multiple logistic regression analysis, only total and free testosterone levels exhibited a significant independent association with nafld. the risk of having nafld increased indeed of 1% for each decrement of 1 ng/dl of total testosterone and of 3% for each decrement of 1 pg/ml of free testosterone, after adjustment for confounders. in men with total testosterone= 300 ng/dl, after adjustment for confounders. conclusion: the evidence of an independent association between nafld and low testosterone is strongly reinforced by its demonstration in men with chronic sci, in spite of the many confounders peculiar to this population.
parkinson's_disease	background: bowel dysfunction, including both slow transit constipation and defecatory dysfunction, is a frequent and often troubling nonmotor manifestation of parkinson 's disease (pd). a variety of agents are employed for the treatment of constipation in pd, but dissatisfaction with available treatment approaches is common. relamorelin is a synthetic ghrelin agonist that has demonstrated prokinetic properties within the gastrointestinal tract. methods: we carried out a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of relamorelin in patients with pd experiencing chronic, inadequately controlled constipation. results: only 18 of an intended 56 subjects completed the trial, in part because of the unexpected occurrence of multiple partially complete bowel movements in constipated pd patients, which made many subjects ineligible for participation. conclusions: although recruitment goals were not met, which precluded demonstration of any potential beneficial effect of relamorelin, unique and important insights with regard to the nature of constipation in pd were recognized, which hopefully will lead to more effective clinical trials in the future. it is clear that what pd patients understand as constipation may be more complex than previously realized and does not appear to be characterized by decreased stool frequency alone.

menopause	hypertension in male and aging female rodents is associated with glutamate-dependent plasticity in the hypothalamus, but existing models have failed to capture distinct transitional menopausal phases that could have a significant impact on the synaptic plasticity and emergent hypertension. in rodents, accelerated ovarian failure (aof) induced by systemic injection of 4-vinylcyclohexane diepoxide mimics the estrogen fluctuations seen in human menopause including the perimenopause transition (peri-aof) and postmenopause (post-aof). thus, we used the mouse aof model to determine the impact of slow-pressor angiotensin ii (ang ll) administration on blood pressure and on the subcellular distribution of obligatory n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor giun1 subunits in the paraventricular hypothalamic nu-cleus (pvn), a key estrogen-responsive cardiovascular regulatory area. estrogen-sensitive neuronal profiles were identified in mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein under the promoter for estrogen receptor (er) beta, a major er in the pvn. slow-pressor angll increased arterial blood pressure in mice at peri-and post-aof time points. in control oil-injected (nonhypertensive) mice, angll decreased the total number of giun1 in err-containing pvn dendrites. in contrast, angll resulted in a reapportionment of giun1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of er beta-containing pvn dendrites in peri-aof mice. moreover, in post-aof mice, angll increased total giun1, dendritic size and radical production in err-containing neurons. these results indicate that unique patterns of hypothalamic glutamate receptor plasticity and dendritic structure accompany the elevated blood pressure in peri-and post-aof time points. our findings suggest the possibility that distinct neurobiological processes are associated with the increased blood pressure during perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods.
menopause	benign intraperitoneal metastatic leiomyomatosis is a rare benign disease that is observed when a leiomyoma is present in the peritoneal surface. women who have undergone hysterectomy for leiomyomas are most commonly affected. patients are usually asymptomatic at presentation, being frequently an incidental finding in imaging studies. ultrasound and ct play an important role in the diagnosis. the lesions are histologically identical to their uterine counterparts. there are different theories about the pathogenesis of the disease, including peritoneal seeding after laparoscopic hysterectomy. others support the hypothesis of multiple independent foci of smooth muscle proliferation. treatment, as in uterine leiomyomatosis, is generally conservative. we report a 53-year-old hysterectomized woman with intraperitoneal leiomyomas detected in a routine physical examination as mobile abdominal masses who underwent successful laparoscopic resection.
hepatitis_c	intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) are constantly exposed to commensal flora and pathogen challenges. how iecs regulate their innate immune response to maintain gut homeostasis remains unclear. interferons (ifns) are cytokines produced during infections. while type i ifn receptors are ubiquitously expressed, type iii ifn receptors are expressed only on epithelial cells. this epithelium specificity strongly suggests exclusive functions at epithelial surfaces, but the relative roles of type i and iii ifns in the establishment of an antiviral innate immune response in human iecs are not clearly defined. here, we used mini-gut organoids to define the functions of types i and iii ifns to protect the human gut against viral infection. we show that primary non-transformed human iecs, upon viral challenge, upregulate the expression of both type i and type iii ifns at the transcriptional level but only secrete type iii ifn in the supernatant. however, human iecs respond to both type i and type iii ifns by producing ifn-stimulated genes that in turn induce an antiviral state. using genetic ablation of either type i or type iii ifn receptors, we show that either ifn can independently restrict virus infection in human iecs. importantly, we report, for the first time, differences in the mechanisms by which each ifn establishes the antiviral state. contrary to type i ifn, the antiviral activity induced by type iii ifn is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway, suggesting a pathway used by type iii ifns that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state. in conclusion, we demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells specifically regulate their innate immune response favoring type iii ifn-mediated signaling, which allows for efficient protection against pathogens without producing excessive inflammation. our results strongly suggest that type iii ifn constitutes the frontline of antiviral response in the human gut. we propose that mucosal surfaces, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, have evolved to favor type iii ifn-mediated response to pathogen infections as it allows for spatial segregation of signaling and moderate production of inflammatory signals which we propose are key to maintain gut homeostasis.
birth_control	in southern nigeria, the leaves of emilia coccinea (sims) g dons are used traditionally for birth control. this study was therefore aimed at evaluating the activities of the methanolic leaf extract of emilia coccinea (em) on parameters that affect reproduction as well as the acute toxic effects of the plant using nonpregnant female mice models. leaves of em were extracted by maceration with 99.8% methanol. oral acute toxicity profiles were examined. the effects of em on female reproductive cycle were determined after oral treatment with em at 1000 and 100 mg/kg/day daily for 6 days using stilbesterol (1 mg/kg/day) and normal saline as controls. the activities of em (1000 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day p. o) on reproductive hormones and organs were also studied using estradiol valerat (100 mg/kg/day p.o), progesterone (10 mg/kg/day s.c.), and normal saline as controls. the extract did not induce any observable toxic effect after 24 h. at 1000 mg/kg, the extract significantly shortened the estrus cycle (p < 0.05) while prolonging the estrus phase which were comparable to that observed with stilbesterol. the extract also increased uterine weight and altered the histology of uterine and ovarian tissues. the female reproductive hormones were additionally altered at 1000 mg/kg and the effects were comparable to that of estradiol valerat such as to indicate possible antifertility effects. lc-hrftms analysis showed 9 putatively identified compounds with pyrrolizidine alkaloid occurring at the highest intensity among the identified compounds. in conclusion, the leaf extracts of em has been shown in this study to exhibit antiovulatory and estrogenic activities which would support the traditional use of the plant in nigeria.
parenting	gender identities and family roles and relationships have an important but controversial and contested - place in the british asylum system. drawing on the experience of a refused asylum seeker, who i call martin, this article considers the various ways in which 'family' arose in the long course of his asylum claim: from the loss of his parents, to falling in love and creating new family ties in the uk. through martin 's narrative of his experiences of the immigration system, and the realities and aftermath of prison and immigration detention, the article considers the politics, tensions and hurdles of family ties for asylum seekers and those facing forced removal from the uk.
multiple_sclerosis	epstein-barr virus (ebv) primary infection is usually asymptomatic, but it sometimes progresses to infectious mononucleosis (im). occasionally, some people develop chronic active ebv infection (caebv) with underlying immunodeficiency, which belongs to a continuous spectrum of ebv-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (ebv+ lpd) with heterogeneous clinical presentations and high mortality. it has been well established that t cell-mediated immune response plays a critical role in the disease evolution of ebv infection. recently, high-throughput sequencing of the hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (cdr3) segments of the t cell receptor (t cell receptor beta (tcr beta)) has emerged as a sensitive approach to assess the t cell repertoire. in this study, we fully characterized the diversity of peripheral blood tcr beta repertoire in im (n = 6) and caebv patients (n = 5) and ebv-seropositive controls (n = 5). compared with the healthy ebv-seropositive controls, both im and caebv patients demonstrate a significant decrease in peripheral blood tcr beta repertoire diversity, basically, including narrowed repertoire breadth, highly expanded clones, and skewed cdr3 length distribution. however, there is no significant difference between im and caebv patients. furthermore, we observed some disease-related preferences in trbv/trbj usage and combinations, as well as lots of t cell clones shared by different groups (unique or overlapped) involved in public t cell responses, which provide more detailed insights into the divergent disease evolution.
menopause	this study intends to investigate the correlations of mir-124a and mir-30d with clinicopathological features of breast cancer (bc) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). a total of 72 bc patients with t2dm (diabetic group) and 144 bc patients without t2dm (non-diabetic group) were enrolled in this study. blood glucose was detected by glucose oxidase methods. glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. fasting insulin (fins) was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. automatic biochemical analyzer was used to detect triglyceride, total cholesterol (tc), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c). estradiol (e-2) was detected by radioimmunoassay. homeostasis model assessment was applied to assess the insulin resistance (homa-ir) and beta-cell insulin secretion (homa-is). the expressions of mir124a and mir-30d were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). there were significant differences in age, the ratio of menopause, body mass index (bmi), hdl-c, tc, 2-h plasma glucose (2hpg), fins, hba1c, homa-is and homa-ir between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups. the diabetic group had higher incidence of lymph node metastasis than non-diabetic group. the mir-124a expression was down-regulated while the mir-30d expression was up-regulated in bc patients with t2dm. the correlation analysis showed that mir124a expression was positively correlated with hdl-c, while it was negatively correlated with age, hba1c, ldl-c and e2. however, the mir-30d expression was negatively correlated with hdl-c but positively correlated with age, hba1c, ldl-c and e2. in conclusion, mir-124a and mir-30d may be correlated with clinicopathological features of bc patients with t2dm. the mir-124a and mir-30d could serve as novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of bc in patients with t2dm.
cancer	objective: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intraoperative frozen section (fs) and re-resection results to achieve r0 status are associated with different long-term outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. background: recent data have challenged the survival benefit of additional resection in patients with pancreatic cancer in case of positive fs to achieve clear pathological section (ps). methods: patients who underwent surgery for exocrine pancreatic malignancy with curative intent were identified from a prospective database. data were stratified by resection margin (group i: fs-r0 ->ps-r0; group ii: fs-r1 ->ps-r0; group iii: fs-r1 ->ps-r1). associations with survival were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. results: a total of 483 patients met the inclusion criteria. of these, 61 patients were excluded due to r2 or rx status. three hundred seventeen (75%) patients were allocated to margin group i, 32 (8%) to group ii, and 73 (17%) to group iii. median overall survival in group i, ii, and iii was 29, 36, and 12 months (p < 0.001). there was no significant difference in survival between patients in group i and ii (p = 0.849), whereas patients in group iii had significantly poorer outcome than group i (p < 0.001) and ii (p = 0.039). the prognostic value of margin group status was confirmed on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio = 1.694, 95% confidence interval 1.175-2.442). conclusions: fs analysis with intraoperative re-resection should be performed routinely in patients undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery with the aim to achieve a r0 resection.
cancer	purpose of review despite a limited understanding of the exact mechanism, corticosteroids are commonly employed for pain control in patients with bone metastases. the aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroid-mediated pain control in patients with bone metastases associated with solid cancers. recent findings a literature search was conducted using ovid medline and embase databases (from 1946 up to july 19, 2016). studies involving patients with bone metastases receiving corticosteroids as the primary means of pain control were included. screening and data extraction were conducted by paired reviewers, with consensus established by discussion, or a third adjudicator. a total of 12 studies were included. rates of pain relief achieved with corticosteroid use varied from 30 to 70%, but generally reflected moderate pain control. corticosteroid use significantly reduced the incidence of pain flare alongside radiotherapy, reportedly by almost half of baseline pain severity. adverse events were not documented consistently across studies, though grade two to three hyperglycemia was noted in approximately 2% of patients by some studies. summary recent evidence suggests that short-term corticosteroid use may provide moderate pain and pain flare control with radiotherapy for patients with bone metastases. the risk of developing adverse effects should be carefully considered prior to therapy initiation on a case-by-case basis.
headache	background: burning mouth syndrome (bms) is a chronic pain condition characterized by persistent intraoral burning without related objective findings and unknown etiology that affects elderly females mostly. there is no satisfactory treatment for bms. we aimed to observe the long-term efficacy of high velanfaxine doses combined with systemic and topical administered clonazepam in a particular subgroup of bms patients who do not respond to current clinical management. results: eight (66.1 +/- 6.2 years old females) out of 14 bms patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were treated with venlafaxine (300 mg/d) and clonazepam (5 mg/d) for 35.4 +/- 12.1 (mean +/- sd) months. the average duration of the symptoms at baseline was 4.3 +/- 1.4 years and the overall mean daily pain intensity score was 8.6 +/- 1.3 (vas); pain was in tongue and within the oral mucosa, accompanying by oral and facial dysesthesia. in five patients tasting was abnormal. all patients had positive history of concomitant primary headache. the average score of hamilton rating scale for anxiety and depression was 21 +/- 4.2, and 26.1 +/- 2.9, respectively. previous ineffective treatments include anticonvulsants and anti-depressants. all patients responded (more than 50% decrease in vas) after three months treatment (mean vas 3.2 +/- 2.2) with no remarkable adverse events. conclusion: bms deserves bottomless psychiatric evaluation and management when current available treatments fail. treatment with venlafaxine combined with topical and systemic clonazepam may be effective in refractory bms cases but further investigation in a large-scale controlled study is needed to confirm these results.
parenting	research suggests that temperamental approach-withdrawal is subject to parenting influences, but few studies have explored how specific parenting behaviors and contextual novelty contribute to the observed pattern of effects. the present study examined associations between infant temperamental approach, mother behavior while introducing novel objects (12 months) and temperamental approach withdrawal in toddlerhood (18 months) in a sample of 132 infants (68 males). maternal positive affect predicted more toddler approach-withdrawal for high-approach infants and maternal stimulation predicted less toddler approach-withdrawal for low-approach infants; however, these patterns varied with intensity of novelty in both parenting and toddler outcome contexts. thus, maternal behavior may lead to stronger associations between earlier and later measures of approach-withdrawal; however, these effects are tied to contexts of measurement.

birth_control	background: oral contraceptives (ocs) are the most widely used contraceptive method among women of reproductive age in the united states (us). routine download and use of health-related smartphone applications (apps) continues to increase. objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of english-language, smartphone-platform oc reminder apps currently available for download in the us. methods: during june-july 2013, official internet-based, mobile app platforms for the two major smartphone operating systems in the usdandroid (google play store) and iphone (itunes) dwere searched. ""birth control,"" ""the pill,"" and ""contraception"" were entered into the search-bar of each smartphone store. apps were assessed for the following: cost, health care professionals' involvement in app development, reminder mechanisms, and functionality. results: of the 39 unique oc reminder apps meeting inclusion criteria, 7 (18%) did not operate as intended when downloaded. most apps functioned without an internet connection (97%) and included pop-up notifications (84%). conclusions: certain app features overcome common causes of missing an alarm, and hypothetically, may minimize likelihood of an oc user missing a daily pill. health care providers should inform users of potential pitfalls and advise them that an oc reminder app should be not be used as a sole reminder method.

polycythemia_vera	extreme thrombocytosis (ext) has been associated with an increased bleeding risk in myeloproliferative neoplasm (mpn) patients and is included in the high risk category in treatment guidelines. treatment of patients with ext has not been studied in prospective trials. to study physicians' approaches to ext, we distributed a web based questionnaire with clinical case scenarios to 202 members of mpn working groups. cases included low thrombotic risk essential thrombocythemia (et) with either jak2v617f or calr mutation, polycythemia vera with ext either with or without leukocytosis, an et patient needing urgent orthopedic surgery, and a poorly controlled et patient with acute cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. responses were received from 90 physicians (45 %) and were variable in most case scenarios. country of practice had the most significant influence on physician response. the usa and israel physicians responded similarly in most cases and differently to the europe physicians. treatment of asymptomatic jak2v617f positive et and target platelet count on cytoreduction were significantly influenced by physician years of experience. responses were not influenced by the volume of mpn practice or by whether mpn was considered a major interest by the physician. our results show a lack of consensus on how to manage mpn patients with ext. randomized controlled trials properly designed to address these questions are needed.
weight_loss	laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (lsg) and laparoscopic greater curvature plication (lgcp) are two restrictive bariatric procedures. eight studies (three randomized, controlled trials, four retrospective studies, and one prospective study) with 536 patients on lsg and lgcp were included by searching pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library. the software review manager 5.3 was used to evaluate operation time, adverse events, percent excess weight loss (%ewl), resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, and postoperative hospital stay. despite the limitations, this meta-analysis suggests that lsg is superior to lgcp in terms of providing greater %ewl at the follow-up of 3, 6, and 12 months and 3 years. lsg gains shorter postoperative hospital stay than lgcp. no significant difference was found in operation time, adverse events, and the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities.
overactive_bladder	aimsprevious studies using isolated strips of human detrusor muscle identified adjustable preload tension, a novel mechanism that acutely regulates detrusor wall tension. the purpose of this investigation was to develop a method to identify a correlate measure of adjustable preload tension during urodynamics. methodspatients reporting urgency most or all of the time based on iciq-oab survey scores were prospectively enrolled in an extended repeat fill-and-empty urodynamics study designed to identify a correlate of adjustable preload tension which we now call dynamic elasticity. cystometric capacity was determined during initial fill. repeat fills to defined percentages of capacity with passive emptying (via syringe aspiration) were performed to strain soften the bladder. a complete fill with active voiding was included to determine whether human bladder exhibits reversible strain softening. resultsfive patients completed the extended urodynamics study. intravesical pressure (p(ves)) decreased with subsequent fills and was significantly lower during fill 3 compared to fill 1 (p=0.008), demonstrating strain softening. active voiding after fill 3 caused strain softening reversal, with p(ves) in fill 4 returning to the baseline measured during fill 1 (p=0.29). dynamic elasticity, the urodynamic correlate of adjustable preload tension, was calculated as the amount of strain softening (or its reversal) per %capacity (average p(ves) between fills/%capacity). dynamic elasticity was lost via repeat passive filling and emptying (strain softening) and regained after active voiding regulated the process (strain softening reversal). conclusionsimproved understanding of dynamic elasticity in the human bladder could lead to both improved sub-typing and novel treatments of overactive bladder. neurourol. urodynam. 36:1086-1090, 2017.

allergies	purpose of review food allergies (fas) are a growing epidemic in western countries with poorly defined etiology. defined as an adverse immune response to common food allergens, fas present heterogeneously as a single-or multiorgan response that ranges in severity from localized hives and angioedema to systemic anaphylaxis. recent findings current research focusing on epithelial-derived cytokines contends that temporal regulation by these factors impact initial sensitization and persistence of fa responses upon repeated food allergen exposure. mechanistic understanding of fa draws insight from a myriad of atopic conditions studied in humans and modeled in mice. summary in this review, we will highlight how epithelial-derived cytokines initiate and then potentiate fas. we will also review existing evidence of the contribution of other atopic diseases to fa pathogenesis and whether fa symptoms overlap with other atopic diseases.
sprains_and_strains	objective: to test the cumberland ankle instability tool (cait), a 9-item 30-point scale, for measuring severity of functional ankle instability. design: cross-sectional study. setting: general community. participants: volunteer sample of 236 subjects. interventions: not applicable. main outcome measures: concurrent validity by comparison with the lower extremity functional scale (lefs) and a visual analog scale (vas) of global perception of ankle instability by using the spearman p. construct validity and internal reliability with rasch analysis using goodness-of-fit statistics for items and subjects, separation of subjects, correlation of items to the total scale, and a cronbach a equivalent. discrimination score for functional ankle instability by maximizing the youden index and tested for sensitivity and specificity. test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient, model 2,1 (icc2,1). results: there were significant correlations between the cait and lefs (rho=.50, p <.01) and vas (rho=.76, p0.5; item reliability index, .99). the threshold cait score was 27.5 (youden index, 68.1); sensitivity was 82.9% and specificity was 74.7%. test-retest reliability was excellent (icc2.1 = .96). conclusions: cait is a simple, valid, and reliable tool to measure severity of functional ankle instability.
diabetes	previous studies have shown a relationship between uric acid concentration and progression of renal disease. here we studied causality between the serum uric acid concentration and progression of diabetic nephropathy in 3895 individuals with type 1 diabetes in the finndiane study. the renal status was assessed with the urinary albumin excretion rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) at baseline and at the end of the follow-up. based on previous genomewide association studies on serum uric acid concentration, 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) with good imputation quality were selected for the snp score. this score was used to assess the causality between serum uric acid and renal complications using a mendelian randomization approach. at baseline, the serum uric acid concentration was higher with worsening renal status. in multivariable cox regression analyses, baseline serum uric acid concentration was not independently associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy over a mean follow-up of 7 years. however, over the same period, baseline serum uric acid was independently associated with the decline in egfr. in the cross-sectional logistic regression analyses, the snp score was associated with the serum uric acid concentration. nevertheless, the mendelian randomization showed no causality between uric acid and diabetic nephropathy, egfr categories, or egfr as a continuous variable. thus, our results suggest that the serum uric acid concentration is not causally related to diabetic nephropathy but is a downstream marker of kidney damage.
parenting	background: parenting style may be an important determinant of an individual 's future weight status. however, reviews that evaluate the relationship between parenting style and weight-related outcomes have not focused on prospective studies. methods: we systematically searched pubmed, embase and psychinfo for studies published between 1995 and 2016 that evaluated the prospective relationship between parenting style experienced in childhood and subsequent weight outcomes. results: we identified 11 prospective cohort studies. among the eight studies that categorized parenting style into distinct groups (i.e. authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful), five provided evidence that authoritative parenting was associated with lower body mass index gains. among the six highest quality studies, four suggested a protective role of authoritative parenting style against adverse weight-related outcomes. however, only one study controlled for a comprehensive set of confounders, and the small number of studies conducted within certain age groups precluded our ability to ascertain critical periods when parenting style is most strongly related to child weight. conclusions: the present literature supports the idea that authoritative parenting may be protective against later overweight and obesity, although findings are mixed. more prospective cohort studies of longer durations, with more sophisticated methods that examine age-varying relationships, and that control for a comprehensive set of confounders, are needed.
low_testosterone	purpose: a growing body of evidence suggests that low testosterone can be an independent predictor of adverse clinicopathological features and worse prognosis in prostate cancer (pca) patients. however, this association is still incompletely understood and the results are divisive. the aim of this study was to analyze testosterone as a predictor of aggressive disease in subjects with clinically localized pca. materials and methods: a cohort was conducted including the patients submitted to radical prostatectomy in our institution during a period of four years. the patients had clinically localized disease and their total testosterone (tt) was routinely measured pre-operatively in the morning before surgery. they were stratified in groups with low (= 300 ng/dl). tumor aggressiveness was inferred based on preoperative psa levels, pathological gleason score (lower, equal or greater than 7), tnm stage and surgical margins status. results: after analyzing 164 patients we found a significant association between mean preoperative tt and extraprostatic disease (379 for pt3 vs. 421 ng/for pt2 - p0.99). conversely, men with high gleason score had similar mean tt compared to those with lower scores. preoperative low tt (defined as tt < 300 ng/dl) could not be statistically correlated with either preoperative psa levels, pathological gleason score, extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margins or seminal vesicles involvement. conclusions: this study indicates that testosterone may be a useful predictive tool once pathological extraprostatic extension was somewhat signaled by lower tt levels preoperatively. however, it does not consolidate a clear association between aggressive tumor biology and hypogonadism.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	previous meta-analyses have shown that psychotherapy improves gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs); however, the impact on functioning in daily activities is unknown. meta-analysis was used to estimate the effect of psychotherapy on mental health and daily functioning in adults with ibs. an extensive literature search located 28 eligible randomized controlled trials (rcts) providing outcome data for mental health and 18 rcts providing data for daily functioning. compared to a mixed group of control conditions, psychotherapy produced significantly greater improvements to mental health ((d) over bar = 0.41) and daily functioning ((d) over bar = 0.43). cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) was evaluated in the largest number of trials (21 trials), followed by hypnosis (4 trials), psychodynamic (3 trials), and relaxation (2 trials). the psychotherapeutic modalities were comparable with respect to their effect on mental health. cbt produced the greatest improvements to daily functioning, and this effect was significantly larger than that produced by relaxation therapy. these results have important clinical implications for treatment of adults with ibs.

parkinson's_disease	the objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (danio rerio) central nervous system (cns) following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. zebrafish were fed pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8 mu g/g dieldrin for 21 days. behavioral analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to anxiety. transcriptional networks for t-cell aggregation and selection were decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin, consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. processes related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by dieldrin. quantitative proteomics (itraq) using a hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. these proteins included atp synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 which were decreased and nadh dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. thus, proteins affected were functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis implicated parkinson 's disease (pd) and huntington 's disease as diseases associated with altered proteins. molecular networks related to mitochondrial dysfunction and t-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association between dieldrin and pd. these data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative diseases. biological significance: dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as parkinson 's disease. dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 u.s. agency for toxic substances and disease registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for human health. transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (itraq) were employed to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. we found that transcriptional and protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and parkinson 's disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. the study provides new insight into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration. these data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework for pesticide induced neurotoxicity.

sprains_and_strains	objective - this study focuses on the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders in children presented in general practice. known epidemiological studies addressing musculoskeletal diseases in childhood are scarce and based on a low number of episodes. design and setting - prospective study of all patient contacts in general practice. a total number of 161 general practitioners participated, divided into four groups, registering during four consecutive three-month periods. patients - all children younger than 15 years of age who visited their gp during the registration period. all diagnoses and working hypotheses concerning musculoskeletal disorders were selected. results - the total number of children in the study was 64 198. disorders of the musculoskeletal system accounted for 3 699 (7.5%) of all 49 309 contacts and for 3046 (7.5%) of all 40 340 episodes. of the 3 046 episodes registered for icpc-chapter l (musculoskeletal), 2 562 (84%) were new episodes, i.e. not presented to the gp before. fifty-four percent of all new episodes were acute injuries. in 22% of the new episodes the general practitioner made a symptom diagnosis. differences by age and sex were found for a limited number of diagnosis categories. conclusion - children present disorders of the musculoskeletal system less often than adults; they also present different disorders to their general practitioners. the majority of disorders presented by children are acute injuries, mostly sprains and strains.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome are chronic gastrointestinal disorders which are associated with a lifelong therapeutic need. the disease results in physical, psychological, and social problems with an impact on partnership, sexuality, education, and career. thus, the number of patients and health care professionals relying on traditional and complementary medicines and especially phytotherapy for the treatment of these chronic conditions is increasing over recent years. one traditional herbal medicinal product consisting of chamomile flower, myrrh, and coffee charcoal has been widely used in clinical practice within this indication area. long-term experience and an increasing understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms substantiate its application and clinical effectiveness. mainly the spasmolytic and anti-inflammatory effects provide a rationale for its therapeutic application. in addition, synergistic effects between the herbal components contribute to the overall effect of this medication.
emergency_contraception	the provision of contraception to adolescents requires specific attention. adolescents require contraceptive methods which are safe, effective and simple to use. while long-acting reversible contraceptive methods are preferable, they should have a choice and not be forced or mandated especially in situations where this may compromise safety. after counselling they should have the ability to choose any method of contraception. under the appropriate circumstances, each method of contraception may have a place. this chapter will be devoted to evaluating the most current scientific rationale for the indication for use of each method of contraception in adolescents.

parenting	purpose: childhood cancer is stressful for the entire family. preoccupation and anxiety surrounding the child 's illness may result in parents of children with cancer being overprotective or less emotionally responsive toward their children. such parenting in response to a negative life event like childhood cancer may cause survivors to be more insecurely attached than healthy peers, which could have downstream effects on survivors' romantic relationships later in life. therefore, we examined survivors' perspectives on parent behaviors, adult attachment, and marital status among adult survivors of childhood cancer relative to controls. methods: one hundred forty-nine young adult survivors and 149 matched controls (m-age=28, range 20-40) indicated their relationship status (single vs. partnered) and completed standardized questionnaires assessing memories of upbringing (warmth, overprotection, rejection) and adult attachment (avoidance, anxiety). results: adult survivors of childhood cancer remembered mothers and fathers as emotionally warmer (d=0.53/0.30), and mothers as less rejecting than controls (d=0.30). adult attachment was overall similar between survivors and controls, but partnered survivors reported particularly low attachment-related anxiety. childhood cancer was related to higher mother and father warmth, which were associated with lower attachment-related avoidance and in turn with a greater likelihood of being in a relationship. conclusion: adult childhood cancer survivors did not remember their parents as overprotective, but reported more positive parenting relative to controls; and similar adult attachment and relationship status. the results were unexpected, but offer novel insights for future prospective studies, which are necessary to better understand psychosocial late effects of childhood cancer.
menopause	objective: physical inactivity increases postmenopausal and possibly premenopausal breast cancer risk, although different biologic mechanisms are proposed. our primary objective was to estimate breast cancer risk associated with high versus low levels of moderate-vigorous recreational activity, separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. methods: we conducted a systematic review of literature published to july 2015. included reports were cohort or case-control studies relating moderate-vigorous recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent >= 3.0) to breast cancer incidence, exclusively (>= 90%) in premenopausal or postmenopausal women. we appraised study quality and performed meta-analyses using random effects modeling. subgroup meta-analyses were based on tumor subtype, race, body mass index, parity, hormone therapy use, family history of cancer, and statistical adjustment for body fatness. dose-response relations were examined. results: pooled relative risks (rrs, 95% ci) for women with higher versus lower levels of moderate-vigorous recreational activity were rr = 0.80 (0.74-0.87) and rr = 0.79 (0.74-0.84) for premenopausal (43 studies) and postmenopausal (58 studies) breast cancer, respectively, with high heterogeneity. inverse associations were weaker among postmenopausal cohort studies (rr = 0.90 [0.85-0.95]) and studies that statistically adjusted for nonrecreational (eg, occupational, household) activity (rr = 0.91 [0.77-1.06] premenopausal, rr = 0.96 [0.86-1.08] postmenopausal). risk estimates with versus without body fatness adjustment did not vary by menopause status, although other subgroup effects were menopause-dependent. among studies of overweight/obese women, there was an inverse association with postmenopausal but not premenopausal breast cancer (rr = 0.88 [0.82-0.95] and rr = 0.99 [0.98-1.00], respectively). dose-response curves were generally nonlinear. conclusions: although risk estimates may be similar for premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer, subgroup effects may be menopause-dependent.
parenting	gatekeeping has been used as a theory and a measure to describe and assess family dynamics within the context of separation and divorce. in this article, we explore adaptive and maladaptive gatekeeping behaviors and attitudes that can affect the other parent 's relationship with the child. implications are presented for connecting adaptive and maladaptive gatekeeping responses to child outcomes of safety, well-being, and positive parent-child relationships following separation and divorce. we build on the recent attention to gatekeeping as a potential framework within the child custody context. key points for the family court community: gatekeeping is a useful framework for assessing parental behaviors and attitudes that can facilitate, protect, or restrict the involvement of the other parent with the child. gatekeeping originally focused on maternal behaviors that facilitate or restrict the involvement of fathers with the children, attention has shifted toward a more gender-neutral framework for assessing how parents' attitudes and actions affect the involvement and quality of the relationship between the other parent and child. rather than a set of hardline rules that govern behaviors, gatekeeping requires working hypotheses to consider the various factors that may contribute to both adaptive and maladaptive gatekeeping responses.
parenting	aims and objectives: to critically appraise the available literature and summarise the evidence relating to adolescent mothers' use of social networking sites in terms of any social support and social capital they may provide and to identify areas for future exploration. background: social networking sites have been demonstrated to provide social support to marginalised individuals and provide psycho-social benefits to members of such groups. adolescent mothers are at risk of; social marginalisation; anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms; and poorer health and educational outcomes for their children. social support has been shown to benefit adolescent mothers thus online mechanisms require consideration. design: a review of original research articles method: key terms and boolean operators identified research reports across a 20-year timeframe pertaining to the area of enquiry in: cinahl, cochrane library, medline, scopus, eric, proquest, psychinfo, web of science, health collection (informit) and google scholar databases. eight original research articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. findings: studies demonstrate that adolescent mothers actively search for health information using the internet and social networking sites, and that social support and social capital can be attributed to their use of specifically created online groups from within targeted health interventions. use of a message board forum for pregnant and parenting adolescents also demonstrates elements of social support. there are no studies to date pertaining to adolescent mothers' use of globally accessible social networking sites in terms of social support provision and related outcomes. conclusions: further investigation is warranted to explore the potential benefits of adolescent mothers' use of globally accessible social networking sites in terms of any social support provision and social capital they may provide.
sprains_and_strains	background and objectives: dislocations, sprains and strains are common childhood musculoskeletal injuries, requiring medical attention. we investigated the characteristics associated with using traditional chinese medicine (tcm) for children suffering from these injuries. methods: from a nationwide representative insurance database of taiwan, this cross-sectional study identified 50,769 children with dislocations, sprains and strains under 18 years of age, newly diagnosed between 1999 and 2009, without previous tcm experience. children who initiated treatment with tcm (n = 24,063, 47.4%) were defined as tcm users, others were in the non-tcm group. multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ors) of tcm use. results: girls and children living in central taiwan (vs. northern) were associated with higher tcm use. the adjusted ors (95% confidence interval (ci)) of tcm uses were 1.60 (1.42-1.79) for patients of 3-5 years, 2.20 (1.99-2.42) of 6-12 years and 1.82 (1.64-2.01) of 13-17 years, compared with those of the <2 years group. tcm users were less likely to have outpatient visits for western medicine care and hospitalizations in the previous year. the tcm group was nearly twice more likely than the non-user group to receive treatments at local clinics (99.1% vs. 53.3%, p < 0.001). conclusions: this study reveals important demographic and medical factors associated with tcm uses for children with dislocations, sprains and strains. interestingly, local clinics are the main healthcare facilities providing tcm services. further studies are needed to evaluate the outcomes of tcm treatment for these musculoskeletal injuries.
overactive_bladder	background: bladder disorders associated with interstitial cystitis are frequently characterized by increased contractility and pain. the purposes of this study were to examine (1) the effects of blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) on the exaggerated bladder activity and pain evoked by cystitis and (2) the underlying mechanisms responsible for the role of mtor in regulating cystic sensory activity. results: the expression of p-mtor, mtor-mediated phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal s6 protein kinase 1 (p-s6k1), 4 e-binding protein 4 (p-4 e-bp1), as well as phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (p-pi3k) pathway were amplified in cyclophosphamide rats as compared with control rats. blocking mtor by intrathecal infusion of rapamycin attenuated bladder hyperactivity and pain. in addition, blocking pi3k signal pathway attenuated activities of mtor, which was accompanied with decreasing bladder hyperactivity and pain. inhibition of either mtor or pi3k blunted the enhanced spinal substance p and calcitonin gene-related peptide in cyclophosphamide rats. conclusions: the data for the first time revealed specific signaling pathways leading to cyclophosphamide-induced bladder hyperactivity and pain, including the activation of mtor and pi3k. inhibition of these pathways alleviates cystic pain. targeting one or more of these signaling molecules may present new opportunities for treatment and management of overactive bladder and pain often observed in cystitis.
cancer	one electron transfer oxidation has long been proposed as a route to the ultimate electrophilic and carcinogenic metabolites of both methylated and non-methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah). the carcinogenic hydrocarbon 3-methylcholanthrene (3-mc) has a methyl-analogous function at its meso-anthracenic center in the form of a dimethylene bridge, and treatment of this compound with the one electron transfer oxidizing reagent ferric ferricyanide,fe-iii(fe-iii(cn)(6)), in mixed aqueous-organic media generated multiple oxygenated species, many of which duplicate those found in mammalian metabolism including known carcinogens 1-hydroxy-3mc and 1-keto-3mc. these results are in agreement with a unified theory for pah carcinogenicity which predicts in vivo generation of a proximate benzylic alcohol metabolite from the 3-mc procarcinogen and conjugation with a moiety such as sulfate intended for rapid urinary excretion. the sulfate instead acts as a leaving group and generates an electrophilic carbocation capable of reacting with sensitive nucleophiles such as dna in cellular nuclei. the products of one electron transfer oxidation align well with predictions of the unified theory since in many cases these products provide substrates or precursors for conjugation reactions.

sports_injuries	the objective of the present study was to clarify the features of otological complications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot) and the risk factors for these complications. we enrolled 1115 patients (776 males and 339 females; age 5-89 years) who underwent hbot. all otological symptoms experienced during hbot sessions were evaluated, and risk factors were analysed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. otoscopic findings and interventions for otological complications were assessed in 58 symptomatic patients who visited the otolaryngology department. otological symptoms were experienced by 165 (14.8 %) of the 1115 patients. the multivariate logistic regression analysis identified ages of >60 years and female sex as independent risk factors, whereas patients with sports injuries were at lower risk than those with other primary diseases, except for severe infectious disease. eighty-two patients (49.7 %) suffered from symptoms at the first hbot session. the most prevalent symptoms were otalgia (157/165), followed by ear fullness (13/165), hearing loss (12/165) and tinnitus (3/165). one patient experienced vertigo and deterioration of the bone-conduction pure-tone thresholds, suggesting inner ear barotrauma. in 116 ears of the 58 symptomatic patients, abnormal otoscopic findings were recognized in 58 ears (50.0 %). twenty-seven of the 58 ears required myringotomy or tube insertion, and hbot was stopped in eight ears in four patients. of the remaining 58 ears with normal otoscopic findings, 51 received no treatment. physicians should be aware of both middle and inner ear barotrauma as potential complications of hbot.
overactive_bladder	this large dose-ranging study explored the benefits of different combinations of mirabegron and solifenacin on health-related quality of life (hrqol), based on patient-reported outcomes (pros), and patients ( 'responders') achieving clinically meaningful improvements in efficacy and hrqol. symphony (nct01340027) was a phase ii, placebo- and monotherapy-controlled, dose-ranging, 12-week trial. adult patients with overactive bladder (oab) for ae3 months were randomized to 1 of 12 groups: 6 combination (solifenacin 2.5/5/10 mg + mirabegron 25/50 mg), 5 monotherapy (solifenacin 2.5/5/10 mg, or mirabegron 25/50 mg), or placebo. change from baseline to end of treatment was assessed, versus placebo and solifenacin 5 mg in: pros (oab-q [symptom bother/total hrqol] and patient perception of bladder condition score), and responders achieving minimally important differences (mids) in pros and predetermined clinically meaningful improvements in efficacy (e.g. < 8 micturitions/24 h). changes in pros and responders were analysed using an ancova model and logistic regression, respectively. the full analysis set included 1278 patients. combination therapy of solifenacin 5/10 mg + mirabegron 25/50 mg significantly improved pros versus solifenacin 5 mg and placebo, and significantly more responders achieved mids in pros and efficacy. micturition frequency normalization was approximately twofold greater with 10 + 25 mg (or 2.06 [95 % ci 1.11, 3.84; p = 0.023]) and 5 + 50 mg (or 1.91 [95 % ci 1.14, 3.21; p = 0.015]) versus solifenacin 5 mg. combining mirabegron 25/50 mg and solifenacin 5/10 mg improves objective and subjective efficacy outcomes compared with placebo or solifenacin 5 mg.
cancer	background: childhood cancer survivorship issues represent an established public health challenge. most late adverse effects (laes) have been demonstrated to be time and treatment dependent. the petale study is a multidisciplinary research project aiming to comprehensively characterize laes and identify associated predictive biomarkers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (call) survivors. methods: call survivors treated at sainte-justine university health center with dana-farber cancer institution-all protocols 87-01 through 2005-01 were eligible. during phase i of the study, the participants underwent comprehensive clinical, biologic, and psychosocial investigation targetingmetabolic syndrome, cardiotoxicity, bone morbidity, neurocognitive problems, and quality of life issues. whole-exome sequencing was performed for all participants. subjects identified with an extreme phenotype during phase i were recalled for additional testing (phase ii). results: phase i included 246 survivors (recall rate 71.9%). of those, 85 participants completed phase ii (recall rate 88.5%). survivors agreeing to participate in phase i (n = 251) were similar to those who refused (n = 31) in terms of relapse risk profile, radiotherapy exposure, and age at the time of study. participants, however, tended to be slightly older at diagnosis (6.1 vs. 4.7 years old, p = 0.08), with a higher proportion of female agreeing to participate compared with males (93.2 vs. 86.5%, p = 0.07). conclusion: the petale study will contribute to comprehensively characterize clinical, psychosocial, biologic, and genomic features of call survivors using an integrated approach. expected outcomes include lae early detection biomarkers, long-term follow-up guidelines, and recommendations for physicians and health professionals.
multiple_sclerosis	introduction: the discovery and development of therapeutic strategies for the treatments of parkinson 's disease (pd) and other synucleinopathies are limited by a lack of understanding of the pathomechanisms and their connection with different diseases such as cancers.areas covered: the hallmarks of these diseases are frequently multifunctional disordered proteins displaying moonlighting and/or chameleon features, which are challenging drug targets. a representative of these proteins is the disordered tubulin polymerization promoting protein (tppp/p25) expressed specifically in oligodendrocytes (olgs) in normal brain. its non-physiological level is tightly related to the etiology of pd and multiple system atrophy (tppp/p25 enrichment in inclusions of neurons and olgs, respectively), multiple sclerosis (tppp/p25-positive olg destruction), as well as glioma (loss of tppp/p25 expression). the established anti-proliferative potency of tppp/p25 may raise its influence in cancer development. the recognition that whereas too much tppp/p25 could kill neurons in pd, but its loss keeps cells alive in cancer could contribute to our understanding of the interrelationship of tppp/p25 diseases'.expert commentary: the knowledge accumulated so far underlines the key roles of the multifunctional tppp/p25 in both physiological and diverse pathological processes, consequently its validation as drug target sorely needs a new innovative strategy that is briefly reviewed here.
headache	migraine is the third most prevalent disease on the planet, yet our understanding of its mechanisms and pathophysiology is surprisingly incomplete. recent studies have built upon decades of evidence that adenosine, a purine nucleoside that can act as a neuromodulator, is involved in pain transmission and sensitization. clinical evidence and rodent studies have suggested that adenosine signaling also plays a critical role in migraine headache. this is further supported by the widespread use of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, in several headache treatments. in this review, we highlight evidence that supports the involvement of adenosine signaling in different forms of headache, headache triggers, and basic headache physiology. this evidence supports adenosine a(2a) receptors as a critical adenosine receptor subtype involved in headache pain. adenosine a(2a) receptor signaling may contribute to headache via the modulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) production or 5' amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) activity in neurons and glia to affect glutamatergic synaptic transmission within the brainstem. this evidence supports the further study of adenosine signaling in headache and potentially illuminates it as a novel therapeutic target for migraine.
myelofibrosis	protein tyrosine kinases belonging to the janus kinase (jak) family are associated with many cytokine receptors, which, on ligand binding, regulate important cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. the protective effects of jak inhibitors on fibrotic diseases such as myelofibrosis and bone marrow fibrosis have been demonstrated in previous studies. the jak inhibitor shr0302 is a synthetic molecule that potently inhibits all members of the jak family, particularly jak1. however, its effect on hepatic fibrosis has not been investigated to date, to the best of our knowledge. in the present study, the effects of shr0302 on the activation, proliferation, migration and apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells (hscs) as well as hsc collagen production were investigated. our data demonstrated that treatment with shr0302 (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l) exerted an inhibitory effect on the activation, proliferation and migration of hscs. in addition, the expression of collagen i and collagen iii were significantly decreased following treatment with shr0302. furthermore, shr0302 induced the apoptosis of hscs, which was demonstrated by annexin v/pi staining. shr0302 significantly increased the activation of caspase-3 and bax in hscs whereas it decreased the expression of bcl-2. shr0302 also inhibited the activation of akt signaling pathway. the pharmacological inhibition of the jak1/signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)3 pathway led to the disruption of functions essential for hsc growth. taken together, these findings provide evidence that shr0302 may have the potential to alleviate hepatic fibrosis by targeting hsc functions.
fungal_infection	background: onychomycosis is a widespread public health problem, in which t. rubrum and t. mentagrophytes is the commenest causative organisms. current medical therapy has many drawbacks and side effects. methylene blue (m.b) photodynamic therapy (pdt) proved efficacy but with lengthy sessions. objectives: optimizing methylene blue photodynamic therapy by combination of methylene blue photosensitizer and gold nanoparticles (aunps) in a composite as gold nanoparticles are efficient delivery systems and efficient enhancers of photosensitizers for antifungal photodynamic therapy. materials and methods: eighty newzealand rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus) were used and categorized in eight equal groups as follows; healthy and infection control, composite photodynamic therapy and five comparative groups. photodynamic therapy was initiated at day three to five post inoculation, for four sessions forty eight hours apart. each group divided and light exposure at two fluencies; 80j and 100 j. all groups were investigated macroscopically and microscopically (histopathology and scanning electron microscope) also flowcytometry assessment for cell death and x-ray analysis for gold nanoparticles accumulation in brain and liver tissues were determined. results: recovery from infection approaching 96% in gold nanoparticles+light group, around 40% in methylene blue photodynamic therapy and 34% in composite photodynamic therapy. the observed findings confirmed by apparent decrease of apoptosis, however small amounts of gold nanoparticles detected in brain and liver. conclusion: light stimulated gold nanoparticles is a promising tool in treatment of onychomycosis.

parenting	newborns and infants are highly depending on successfully communicating their needs; e.g., through crying and facial expressions. although there is a growing interest in the mechanisms of and possible influences on the recognition of facial expressions in infants, heretofore there exists no validated database of emotional infant faces. in the present article we introduce a standardized and freely available face database containing caucasian infant face images from 18 infants 4 to 12 months old. the development and validation of the tromso infant faces (tif) database is presented in study 1. over 700 adults categorized the photographs by seven emotion categories (happy, sad, disgusted, angry, afraid, surprised, neutral) and rated intensity, clarity and their valance. in order to examine the relevance of tif, we then present its first application in study 2, investigating differences in emotion recognition across different stages of parenthood. we found a small gender effect in terms of women giving higher intensity and clarity ratings than men. moreover, parents of young children rated the images as clearer than all the other groups, and parents rated ""neutral"" expressions as more clearly and more intense. our results suggest that caretaking experience provides an implicit advantage in the processing of emotional expressions in infant faces, especially for the more difficult, ambiguous expressions.
fungal_infection	background. amphibians are declining at an alarming rate, and one of the major causes of decline is the infectious disease chytridiomycosis. parasitic fungal sporangia occur within epidermal cells causing epidermal disruption, but these changes have not been well characterised. apoptosis (planned cell death) can be a damaging response to the host but may alternatively be a mechanism of pathogen removal for some intracellular infections. methods. in this study we experimentally infected two endangered amphibian species pseudophryne corroboree and litoria verreauxii alpina with the causal agent of chytridiomycosis. we quantified cell death in the epidermis through two assays: terminal transferase-mediated dutp nick end-labelling (tunel) and caspase 3/7. results. cell death was positively associated with infection load and morbidity of clinically infected animals. in infected amphibians, tunel positive cells were concentrated in epidermal layers, correlating to the localisation of infection within the skin. caspase activity was stable and low in early infection, where pathogen loads were light but increasing. in animals that recovered from infection, caspase activity gradually returned to normal as the infection cleared. whereas, in amphibians that did not recover, caspase activity increased dramatically when infection loads peaked. discussion. increased cell death may be a pathology of the fungal parasite, likely contributing to loss of skin homeostatic functions, but it is also possible that apoptosis suppression may be used initially by the pathogen to help establish infection. further research should explore the specific mechanisms of cell death and more specifically apoptosis regulation during fungal infection.
diabetes	backgrounddiets reduced or low in carbohydrates are becoming increasingly popular. the replacement foods and their accompanying nutrients determine the health effects of such diets. however, little is known about the dietary intake of people consuming reduced or low carbohydrate diets. methodsin this cross-sectional study, the dietary and nutrient intake of individuals aged 16-75 years consuming less than 40% of energy from carbohydrate (n = 430) was compared with individuals consuming equal to or more than 40% energy from carbohydrate (n = 1833) using the uk national diet and nutrition survey. resultsthose consuming less than 40% of total energy from carbohydrate reported a higher consumption of red and processed meat, butter, oily fish and vegetables, as well as a lower consumption of soft drinks and pulses, than those with a normal carbohydrate intake. after adjusting for socio-economic status, only red meat intake was different between the groups, and reached the maximum recommended daily intake daily intake. there were no significant differences in micronutrient intakes between the groups, although magnesium, selenium and potassium, along with fibre, were lower than recommended amounts across the cohort. conclusionsindividuals consuming reduced or low carbohydrate diets could benefit from replacing some red meats with white meats and vegetable sources of protein, and increasing vegetable intake.
fungal_infection	the diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis is difficult and less than 10% of cases are diagnosed at the initial presentation. actinomycosis is always poly-microbial flora infection in human. on the other hand, candida parapsilosis is an emerging fungal pathogen especially in immuno-compromised patients. combined bacterial-fungal infection increases frequency and severity of the disease. this report is a case of a candida parapsilosis co-infection in a 23-year-old male patient having pulmonary actinomycosis. this thereby could guide the clinicians towards an appropriate therapy.
skin_care	background: in choma district, southern zambia, the neonatal mortality rate is approximately 40 per 1000 live births and, although the rate is decreasing, many deliveries take place outside of formal facilities. understanding local practices during the postnatal period is essential for optimizing newborn care programs. methods: we conducted 36 in-depth interviews, five focus groups and eight observational sessions with recently-delivered women, traditional birth attendants, and clinic and hospital staff from three sites, focusing on skin, thermal and cord care practices for newborns in the home. results: newborns were generally kept warm by application of hats and layers of clothing. while thermal protection is provided for preterm and small newborns, the practice of nighttime bathing with cold water was common. the vernix was considered important for the preterm newborn but dangerous for hiv-exposed infants. mothers applied various substances to the skin and umbilical cord, with special practices for preterm infants. applied substances included petroleum jelly, commercial baby lotion, cooking oil and breastmilk. the most common substances applied to the umbilical cord were powders made of roots, burnt gourds or ash. to ward off malevolent spirits, similar powders were reportedly placed directly into dermal incisions, especially in ill children. conclusions: thermal care for newborns is commonly practiced but co-exists with harmful practices. locally appropriate behavior change interventions should aim to promote chlorhexidine in place of commonly-reported application of harmful substances to the skin and umbilical cord, reduce bathing of newborns at night, and address the immediate bathing of hiv-infected newborns.
emergency_contraception	objectives: the aim of the study was to evaluate the association between physicians' understanding of the mechanism of action of the emergency contraceptive pill (ecp), their personal use of it, and their practice in informing their patients about the method and in prescribing it. methods: the study was carried out in a sample of 3337 obstetrician-gynaecologists who responded to a mailed questionnaire. bivariate analysis was used to test the association between physicians' personal use of the ecp, their understanding of its mechanism of action, and their practice in informing their patients about the method and in prescribing it. multiple poisson regression analysis was carried out to identify variables independently associated with the two dependent variables. results: multiple regression analysis showed that the percentage of physicians who had informed their patients about the ecp was significantly lower among those who had needed it themselves but had not used it and among those living in the northeast of brazil. a significantly higher percentage of female than male physicians had provided information on the ecp. the percentage of physicians who had prescribed the ecp was significantly lower among those who had needed it themselves but had not used it and among those who believed that it caused a mini-abortion. the proportion of physicians who had ever-prescribed the ecp was greater among those who worked exclusively in private practice and among those who worked in a state capital. conclusions: the misconception that emergency contraception could cause a mini-abortion was associated with its denial to potential users, while physicians' personal experience of needing to use it favoured the likelihood of their informing potential users about it and prescribing it.
sports_injuries	this paper presents the project ireport sportsinjuries, which is a system with a focus on a web application directed to sport health professionals, supporting the acquisition, analysis and dissemination of sports injuries information. this software will allow health professionals register and analyze sports injuries among sports populations. the application provides a reporting module that includes tables and charts to individually analyze injuries of a specific sports organization, a specific sport across organizations or a specific athlete, independently of where s/he practices. the system also offers a module for a global analysis, which allows the ireport sportsinjuries to obtain the incidence and prevalence values, besides the socioeconomics costs, regarding sports injuries at a national level. in order to offer these features, it is based on a global sports injuries model with the goal of standardizing data related to the sports injuries subject.
fungal_infection	we report a case of cryptococcal sinusitis, a rare presentation of cryptococcus neoformans infection in a patient with multiple myeloma. the objective of this case report is to highlight the utility of structural and functional imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis of sinonasal soft tissue masses in the immunocompromised patient population. pet-ct was the first imaging modality in this patient, who presented for routine follow-up staging of multiple myeloma, and was asymptomatic at the time of his presentation. pet-ct findings prompted further evaluation with mri, to aid in the differential diagnosis with respect to a neoplastic versus infectious etiology. ultimately, surgical excision with histopathology was required to provide definitive diagnosis. final histopathology displayed yeast-organism staining consistent with cryptococcus neoformans/gatti. the patient subsequently underwent treatment for this infection, along continued treatment for multiple myeloma. to our knowledge this is the first known case of cryptococcal sinusitis in a patient with neoplastic disease. imaging represents an important tool to differentiate fungal infection from neoplasm in the immunocompromised patient population. as the population of immunocompromised patients continues to grow, the relevance of this diagnosis as well as the use of alternative imaging modalities is becoming more important in clinical practice.

headache	purpose idiopathic intracranial hypertension (iih) is a disorder of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any known causative factor. sinus stenosis is common in these patients. stenting of stenotic dural sinuses has gained popularity as a treatment option, since these stenoses may contribute to an obstruction of the venous return, and, thereby may contribute to iih via an increase in venous sinus pressure. we evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment in iih with venous sinus stenosis. methods fifty-one patients with iih underwent stenting. median age was 40 years. clinical manifestation was headache in 74.5% of the patients and visual obscurations in 78.5%. papilledema was present in 50/51 patients (98%), and lumbar puncture documented elevated csf opening pressure in all but one patient (98%). sinus stenoses were observed in all patients. results endovascular treatment was successfully performed in all patients. there were no major complications encountered (i.e., live threatening or causing a deterioration of a patient 's condition equivalent to mrs 3-6). improvement or resolution of papilledema was observed in 88% of the patients, and 84% reported improvement or resolution of the headache. follow-up angiographies were performed in 48 patients at a median interval of 49 months and demonstrated in stent-stenosis or a de novo stenosis in 12 patients, eight of them needed re-treatment. conclusion venous sinus stenting is a safe and effective alternative to other invasive treatments (e.g., optic nerve sheath fenestration, csf diversion) in patients with iih. the majority of patients have a persistent clinical benefit.
low_testosterone	androgen deprivation therapy (adt) is frequently used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. adt is associated with numerous side effects related to its mode of action, namely the suppression of testosterone to castrate levels. recently, several large retrospective studies have also reported an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men receiving adt, although these risks have not been confirmed by prospective randomized trials. we review the literature to consider the risk, of cardiovascular disease with different forms of adt and examine in detail potential mechanisms by which any such risk could be mediated. mechanisms discussed include the metabolic syndrome resulting from low testosterone level and the potential roles of testosterone flare, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors outside the pituitary gland, and altered levels of follicle-stimulating hormone. finally, the clinical implications for men prescribed adt for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer are considered.

headache	aim: to evaluate the retinal vessel diameters in patients with migraine by optical coherence tomography (oct). methods: in this cross-sectional study, 124 eyes of 62 patients with a diagnosis of unilateral migraine during attack-free period and 42 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included. migraine patients were divided into the 52 migraine attacks per month group and the >= 5 migraine attacks per month group. all subjects underwent complete ophthalmological and neurological examinations before measurements. retinal vessel diameters and choroidal thickness were examined with the spectralis oct. results: the mean diameters of the arteries in the eyes on the headache side of control group, >= 5 migraine attacks per month and 52 migraine attacks per month group at 480 pm from the optic disk (raster 3) were 119.54 +/- 46.69, 136.68 +/- 25.93 and 119.34 +/- 31.75 pm respectively with a steady decline to 105.57 +/- 32.15, 118.18 +/- 31.87 and 108.05 +/- 38.77 pm at 1440 pm (raster 7), the last measurement point, respectively. the retinal artery diameter measurements were significantly increased in >= 5 migraine attacks per month patients at four out of five measured points compared to control group (p= 5 migraine attacks per month patients at all measured points compared to control group (p= 5 migraine attacks per month patients compared to control group.
menopause	background: uterine fibroids (uf) affect 77% of women by menopause, and account for $ 9.4 billion in annual healthcare costs. type-2-diabetes (t2d) has inconsistently associated with protection from ufs in prior studies. to further evaluate the relationship between t2d and ufs we tested for association between t2d and uf risk in a large clinical population as well as the potential differences due to t2d medications and interaction with race. methods: this nested case-control study is derived from a clinical cohort. our outcome was uf case-control status and our exposure was t2d. uf outcomes and t2d exposure were classified using validated electronic medical record (emr) algorithms. logistic regression, adjusted for covariates, was used to model the association between t2d diagnosis and uf risk. secondary analyses were performed evaluating the interaction between t2d exposure and race and stratifying t2d exposed subjects by t2d medication being taken. results: we identified 3,789 subjects with uf outcomes (608 uf cases and 3,181 controls), 714 were diabetic and 3,075 were non-diabetic. we observed a nominally significant interaction between t2d exposure and race in adjusted models (interaction p = 0.083). race stratified analyses demonstrated more protection by t2d exposure on uf risk among european americans (adjusted odds ratio [ aor] = 0.50, 95% ci 0.35 to 0.72) than african americans (aor = 0.76, 95% ci 0.50 to 1.17). we also observed a protective effect by t2d regardless of type of t2d medication being taken, with slightly more protection among subjects on insulin treatments (european americans aor = 0.42, 95% ci 0.26 to 0.68; african americans aor = 0.60, 95% ci 0.36 to 1.01). conclusions: these data, conducted in a large population of uf cases and controls, support prior studies that have found a protective association between diabetes presence and uf risk and is further modified by race. protection from ufs by t2d exposure was observed regardless of medication type with slightly more protection among insulin users. further mechanistic research in larger cohorts is necessary to reconcile the potential role of t2d in uf risk.
hypothyroidism	objective: to investigate the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and preterm contractions. methods: prospective observational study among women at 23+0/7 and 34+6/7 weeks of gestation, with no known thyroid function abnormality, and preterm uterine contractions (ptc). all patients underwent laboratory evaluation of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) and free thyroxin (ft4). patients with and without ptc were compared. results: no association was found between ptc and subclinical hypothyroidism. rate of spontaneous preterm delivery (ptd) was comparable between women with abnormal and normal thyroid function tests. excluding indicated ptd, patients in the study group had a higher rate of spontaneous ptd (24.7% versus 9.6%, p = 0.03). patients with past ptd and preterm contractions had higher rates of hypothyroxinemia compared with patients without past ptd (54.6% versus 19.0% and 31.2%, p = 0.001), and patients with past ptd (regardless of the presence or absence of ptc) had higher rate of subclinical hypothyroidism compared with patients with ptc and without ptd (59.1% and 66.7% versus 31.6%, p = 0.017). conclusions: no association was found between ptc and subclinical hypothyroidism in the entire cohort, except for patients with preterm contractions and a history of past ptd. this specific group of patients might benefit from thyroid function evaluation.
menopause	we demonstrated the ivf-icsi results, perinatal outcomes and cost-effectivity of the patients with advanced age at a tertiary centre. a total of 456 patients categorised into two groups according to age: group 1 (n = 158) (39 years) and group 2 (n = 298) (< 39 years) were analysed retrospectively. in addition, subgroup analysis was performed according to the 40 years cut-off. clinical pregnancy rate was significantly different between the groups (p < .001). preterm delivery (< 37 gestational week) and low birth weight (< 2500 g) were significantly higher in advanced aged women than youngsters (p < .001). mean expense per cycle for hormonal stimulation of ivf-icsi was 1058.9 and 723.5 usd in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < .001). mean expense per pregnancy was 9294.7 and 1874.8 usd in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < .001). our study showed that perinatal outcomes and cost-effectivity might be adversely affected with increasing age.
skin_care	acne vulgaris is the most common skin diseases that people experience during their lives. thirteen rhizosphere isolates were screened against propionibacterium acnes. the bacterium exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes was identified as bacillus methylotrophicus yml008 by 16s rrna gene sequencing. scanning electron microscopy was used to assess the changes in morphology of p. acnes. preliminary studies on the antimicrobial substance demonstrated the hydrophilic nature of compound with mic of 0.17mg/ml and mbc of 0.3mg/ml. the cytotoxic effect of the extract was least (80% survival) as compared to benzyperoxide (40% survival). these results suggest yml008 as a promising bioresource and may be useful as a lead bacterium to develop a new type of anti-acne skin care prep to cure or prevent acne. further, mechanism of action and proper clinical trials may be promising for this research.
sports_injuries	the present investigation was carried out to examine the incidence and pattern of injuries in adolescent multisport athletes from youth sports academy. injury data were prospectively collected from 166 athletes during the seasons from 2009 to 2014. a total of 643 injuries were identified, 559 (87.0%) were time-loss injuries. the overall injury incidence was 5.5 (95% confidence interval ci: 5.1-6.0), the incidence of time-loss injuries was 4.8 (95% ci: 4.4-5.2), the incidence of growth conditions was 1.2 (95% ci: 1.0-1.4) and incidence of serious injuries was 0.6 (95% ci: 0.5-0.8) per 1000h of exposure. the prevalence of overuse injuries was 50.3%. growth conditions represented 20.0%. most of the injuries (67.0%) involved the lower extremities, and both foot and ankle were the most predominant injured body parts (22.0%). knee injuries were mostly from overuse (50 vs. 23, p=.02), whereas foot and ankle injuries resulted from an acute mechanism (94 vs. 31, p<.0001). minor and moderate injuries accounted for 87.0%. muscle, tendon and osteochondrosis injuries accounted for 52.0% of all injuries. comparing groups, squash sport was having the highest injury incidence (8.5 injuries per athlete). higher exposure was associated with greater overuse relative risk (rr=1.03, 95% ci: 1.01-1.014, p<.001). in conclusion, the results of this study identified a high incidence of injuries in this youth sports population. striking was the prevalence of overuse injuries of 50%, which suggests the need for injury prevention protocols for adolescent highly trained athletes.
weight_loss	postgastrectomy syndromes result from altered form and function of the stomach. gastrectomy disrupts reservoir capacity, mechanical digestion and gastric emptying. early recognition of symptoms with prompt evaluation and treatment is essential. many syndromes resolve with minimal intervention or dietary modifications. re-operation is not common but often warranted for afferent and efferent loop syndromes and bile reflux gastritis. preoperative nutritional assessment and treatment of common vitamin and mineral deficiencies after gastrectomy can reduce the incidence of chronic complications. an integrated team approach to risk assessment, patient education, and postoperative management is critical to optimal care of patients with gastric cancer.
sprains_and_strains	background: the potent anti-inflammatory pharmacologic effects of the corticosteroids (cortisone and synthetic derivatives) has led to their extensive usage in the management of rheumatologic diseases and athletic musculoskeletal injuries. the efficacy and risks of locally injected or systemically administered corticosteroids in the treatment of athletic injuries are unclear. objective: to review critically the medical literature and determine complications and risks associated with corticosteroid treatment of athletic injuries. data sources: a search of 3 databases-medline, cinahl, and cochrane clinical trial register-was performed using the ovid interface for all years between 1966 and 2003. the search first combined all references under the medical subject headings adrenal cortex hormones, glucocorticoids, and glucocorticoids, synthetic. a second search combined all references under the medical subject headings athletic injuries, sprains and strains, tendon injuries, shoulder injuries, rotator cuff disease, tennis elbow, and lateral epicondylitis. the references identified by these 2 searches were intersected and limited to human only to produce 130 articles. relevant review articles were scanned, references reviewed, and additional articles retrieved for consideration of inclusion. study selection: for inclusion in this critical review, articles must meet the following criteria: (1) subjects were human, (2) subjects had athletic-related injuries, and (3) subjects received corticosteroid treatment. ultimately, 43 studies met inclusion criteria. data extraction and synthesis: selected articles were then categorized as to whether the primary focus was usage/efficacy of corticosteroid injection therapy, occurrence of complications of corticosteroid injection therapy, or usage or complications of systemic corticosteroid therapy. main results: twenty-five selected studies primarily examined the usage/efficacy of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of various athletic injuries. of the 983 total subjects who received corticosteroid injections among these studies, only minor complications of treatment were reported. eighteen selected studies primarily described complications of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of athletic injuries. of these, tendon and fascial ruptures were the predominant complications reported. the search identified no articles that addressed the usage of or complications of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of athletic injuries, although tibial stress fracture and multifocal osteonecrosis occurred in individuals being treated for nonathletic injury conditions. conclusions: this critical review reveals that the existing medical literature does not provide precise estimates for complication rates following the therapeutic use of injected or systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of athletic injuries. tendon and fascial ruptures are often reported complications of injected corticosteroids, whereas tibial stress fractures and multifocal osteonecrosis were described with systemic corticosteroids.
low_testosterone	objective: low testosterone levels may be a signal of poor health. this study aimed to investigate the effects of age and abnormal metabolism on sex hormones in chinese male. methods: three hundred and thirty-seven elder men were enrolled into this single-center, cross-sectional study, and their sex hormone levels and metabolic parameters were assessed. results: serum follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), luteinizing hormone (lh) and sex-hormone-binding globulin (shbg) concentrations increased with age, while free testosterone index (fti), testosterone secretion index (tsi), estradiol (e2)/shbg and progestin (prog) decreased. abnormal metabolisms were related to androgen indices (tt, ft, bt, fti, tsi, t/e2), shbg and e2/shbg even after adjusting by age and macrovascular disease. obesity and overweight, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia were the most important abnormal metabolism that related to decreased androgen indices. including shbg in the stepwise regression increased the explanation effect of tt and bt by 32.7% and 28.5%, respectively, and all metabolic indices were excluded. abnormal metabolism indies (bmi and pbg) were correlated to the decrease in shbg levels, while age and lh was positively correlated to shbg levels. conclusions: age and abnormal metabolism were independently important factors associated with the sex hormone levels in elderly chinese men,. which were all mediated by shbg.
diabetes	background & aimslittle is known about aetiology and morbidity and clinical characteristics of pyogenic liver abscess caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. methodsan analysis between pyogenic liver abscess patients caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates and those caused by non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae was performed. resultsamong 817 pyogenic liver abscess patients, there were 176 patients (21.5%) with pyogenic liver abscess of biliary origin, and 67 pyogenic liver abscess patients (8.2%) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates (mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae). of 176 pyogenic liver abscess patients related to biliary disorders, there were 48 pyogenic liver abscess patients (27.3%) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. within 67 pyogenic liver abscess patients caused by enterobacteriaceae expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the occurrences of 48 pyogenic liver abscess patients (71.6%) were associated with biliary disorders. when compared with pyogenic liver abscess patients caused by non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, there were significantly greater incidences of polymicrobial infections, bacteremia, pulmonary infection, recurrence and death in pyogenic liver abscess patients caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. carbapenems remain mainstay drugs against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e.coli and k.pneumoniae. independent risk factors for occurrence of pyogenic liver abscess caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae were biliary disorders including extra- and intrahepatic cholangiolithiasis and an abnormal bilioenteric communication between bile and gut, a treatment history of malignancy such as operation and chemotherapy, pulmonary infection, and diabetes mellitus. conclusionspyogenic liver abscess caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates mainly occurs in patients with biliary disorders or with a treatment history of malignancy. the mainstay of treatment remains carbapenems in combination with adequate aspiration or drainage.
emergency_contraception	introduction: few studies have described the inequalities in hormonal emergency contraception (hec) use in developing countries. thus, the main aim of this manuscript is to study socio-demographic inequalities in hec use among nicaraguan women, and to study if inequalities in hec use arise from exposure to different forms of intimate partner violence (ipv). methods: data from a national cross-sectional study conducted from 2006 to 2007 was used. this study included data from 8284 ever partnered, non-sterilized women. separate multivariate logistic regressions with each form of ipv were conducted to study how different forms of ipv were associated with hec. women 's age, residency, education, socioeconomic status, parity, and current use of reversible contraception were included in the multivariate logistic regressions to obtain adjusted odds ratios showing inequalities in hec use. results: six percent of the women had ever used hec (95% ci 5.1-6.9). multivariate analyses showed that urban residency, higher education, and higher socioeconomic status were significantly associated with higher odds of ever using hec, and age was associated with decreased odds of hec use. a key finding of this study is that after controlling for socio-demographic factors, the odds of using hec were higher for those women ever exposed to emotional ipv (aor 1.58, 95% ci 1.16-2.00), physical ipv (aor 1.82, 95% ci 1.30-2.55), sexual ipv (aor 1.63, 95% ci 1.06-2.52), and controlling behavior by partner (aor 1.51 95% ci 1.13-2.00) than those not exposed. conclusions: this study provides sound evidence supporting the hypothesis that there are inequalities in hec use even in countries where inequalities in use to other forms of contraceptive technology has been reduced. hec use among nicaraguan women is strongly influenced by individual factors such as age, residency, educational level, socioeconomic status, and exposure to different forms of ipv. it is paramount that actions are taken to diminish these gaps.
weight_loss	new tri- or tetraphenylethylene-substituted phenylcarbazole derivatives exhibiting aggregation-induced emission were synthesized by the synthetic route including pd-catalyzed suzuki or buchwald-hartwig coupling and heck reactions. the results of evaluation of the thermal, optical, electrochemical, photo physical, and charge-transporting properties of the synthesized derivatives are presented. the compounds possess high thermal stabilities with 5% weight loss temperatures exceeding 350 degrees c. some of the synthesized compounds form glasses with glass transition temperature ranging from 77 to 114 degrees c. their maximum fluorescence intensity wavelengths are in the range of 472-498 nm. the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 43.9% was observed for the solid sample of 2-(4-(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl) phenylethenyl)phenyl)-9-ethylcarbazole. the electron photoemission spectra of the films of the synthesized compounds revealed ionization potentials of 5.49-5.74 ev. hole drift mobilities in the layers of 9-phenylcarbazole para-substituted with tri- or tetraphenylethylene moities reached 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1) at moderate electric fields, as established by the time-of-flight technique.
alzheimer's_disease	background: glutaminase 1 is a phosphate-activated metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of glutaminolysis, which converts glutamine into glutamate. glutamate is the major neurotransmitter of excitatory synapses, executing important physiological functions in the central nervous system. there are two isoforms of glutaminase 1, kga and gac, both of which are generated through alternative splicing from the same gene. kga and gac both transcribe 1-14 exons in the n-terminal, but each has its unique c-terminal in the coding sequence. we have previously identified that kga and gac are differentially regulated during inflammatory stimulation and hiv infection. furthermore, glutaminase 1 has been linked to brain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alzheimer 's disease, and hepatic encephalopathy. core enzyme structure of kga and gac has been published recently. however, how other coding sequences affect their functional enzyme activity remains unclear. methods: we cloned and performed serial deletions of human full-length kga and gac from the n-terminal and the c-terminal at an interval of approximately 100 amino acids (aas). prokaryotic expressions of the mutant glutaminase 1 protein and a glutaminase enzyme activity assay were used to determine if kga and gac have similar efficiency and efficacy to convert glutamine into glutamate. results: when 110 aas or 218 aas were deleted from the n-terminal or when the unique portions of kga and gac that are beyond the 550 aa were deleted from the c-terminal, kga and gac retained enzyme activity comparable to the full length proteins. in contrast, deletion of 310 aas or more from n-terminal or deletion of 450 aas or more from c-terminal resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity for kga/gac. consistently, when both nand c-terminal of the kga and gac were removed, creating a truncated protein that expressed the central 219 aa -550 aa, the protein retained enzyme activity. furthermore, expression of the core 219 aa -550 aa coding sequence in cells increased extracellular glutamate concentrations to levels comparable to those of full-length kga and gac expressions, suggesting that the core enzyme activity of the protein lies within the central 219 aa -550 aa. full-length kga and gac retained enzyme activities when kept at 4 degrees c. in contrast, 219 aa - 550 aa truncated protein lost glutaminase activities more readily compared with full-length kga and gac, suggesting that the n-terminal and c-terminal coding regions are required for the stability kga and gac. conclusions: glutaminase isoforms kga and gac have similar efficacy to catalyze the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. the core enzyme activity of glutaminase 1 protein is within the central 219 aa - 550 aa. the n-terminal and c-terminal coding regions of kga and gac help maintain the long-term activities of the enzymes.
sprains_and_strains	aim. the aim of this study was to determine the injury rates of a men 's varsity ice hockey team over six-years. data on ice hockey injury rates and profile continue to increase in the hope of assisting with injury prevention. methods. the university of british columbia men 's varsity team has been followed prospectively over a six-year period. all student-athletes completed a preseason medical examinations and physiological assessments. the team physician evaluated each injury and the team therapist completed the injury report forms and the attendance records for each player. results. a total of 46 215 player exposures were recorded. the combined injury rate was 3.70 injuries/1 000 player game and practice exposures. a statistically significantly higher risk of injury was observed during games and the greatest risk of injury was observed during the second period. forwards sustained greater percentage of injuries compared to defensemen and goalies. sprains and strains accounted for 40% of all injuries, followed by concussions (13%). non-contact injuries were most common, while the anatomy sustaining the most injuries was the head/neck/face region. a high percent-age of the recorded injuries required less than seven days to return to full activity. conclusion. the risk of injury for university ice hockey players is greater during games and is dependant on playing position. players are prone to sprains and strains, which may not involve any contact. concussion and knee joint injury rates continue to cause concern.
fungal_infection	oropharyngeal candidiasis is the most common fungal infection in hospitalized patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). its progression results in invasive infections, which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. this study aimed to quickly and accurately identify candida spp. from oral mucosa of aids patients recruited at presidente vargas hospital, in sao luis city, brazil and to evaluate the sensitivity profile of these fungi to antifungals by using an automated system. isolates were collected from oropharyngeal mucosa of 52 hospitalized aids patients, under anti-viral and antifungal therapies. patients were included in research if they were hiv-positive, above 18 years of age and after obtaining their written consent. chromagar (r) candida and the automatedvitek-2 (r) system were used to isolate and identify candida spp., respectively. antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the vitek-2 (r) system, complemented with the etest (r), using the drugs amphotericin b, fluconazole, flucytosine, and voriconazole. oropharyngeal candidiasis had a high prevalence in these hospitalized aids patients (83%), and the most prevalent species was candida albicans (56%). antifungal susceptibility test showed that 64.7% of the candida spp. were susceptible, 11.8% were dose-dependent sensitive, and 23.5% were resistant. all the candida krusei and candida famata isolates and two of candida glabrata were resistant to fluconazole. most of aids patients presented oropharyngeal candidiasis and c. albicans was the most frequently isolated species. the results showed high variability in resistance among isolated species and indicates the need to identify the candida spp. involved in the infection and the need to test antifungal susceptibility as a guide in drug therapy in patients hospitalized with aids. this is the first relate about aids patients monitoring in a public hospital in sao luis concerning the precise identification and establishing of antifungal profile of candida spp..
overactive_bladder	objectives: to evaluate whether the sling position is associated with particular types of complications in patients undergoing suburethral sling placement for stress urinary incontinence. methods: data from 100 women diagnosed at the evangelical hospital hagen-haspe with complications after suburethral sling insertion were analyzed. all patients underwent pelvic floor ultrasound to assess: urethral length, sling location in relation to the urethral length (%) and the sling distance to the longitudinal smooth muscle complex of the urethra (the sling-longitudinal smooth muscle distance). results: the shortest median sling-longitudinal smooth muscle distance was observed in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary retention and overactive bladder: 0.9, 1.1 and 1.75 mm, respectively (p < 0.05). in women with persistent stress urinary incontinence and sling erosion, the sling-longitudinal smooth muscle distance was 3.6 and 4.6 mm, respectively (p < 0.05). persistent stress urinary incontinence was connected with the position of the sling in relation to the bladder neck -in these patients, the sling was closer to the bladder neck. conclusions: sling location plays a pivotal role in the occurrence of certain complications. the sling position in the proximal part of the urethra or between the middle and proximal urethra appears to be connected with a high rate of unsuccessful stress urinary incontinence treatment. a sling-longitudinal smooth muscle distance below 2 mm is often connected with sling complications, such as overactive bladder, urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infections.
headache	one of the main effects of the endocannabinoid system in the brain is stress adaptation with presynaptic endocannabinoid receptor 1 (cb1 receptors) playing a major role. in the present study, we investigated whether the effect of the cb1 receptor coding cnr1 gene on migraine and its symptoms is conditional on life stress. in a cross- sectional european population (n= 2426), recruited from manchester and budapest, we used the id- migraine questionnaire for migraine screening, the life threatening experiences questionnaire to measure recent negative life events (rle), and covered the cnr1 gene with 11 snps. the main genetic effects and the cnr1xrle interaction with age and sex as covariates were tested. none of the snps showed main genetic effects on possible migraine or its symptoms, but 5 snps showed nominally significant interaction with rle on headache with nausea using logistic regression models. the effect of rs806366 remained significant after correction for multiple testing and replicated in the subpopulations. this effect was independent from depression- and anxiety- related phenotypes. in addition, a bayesian systems- based analysis demonstrated that in the development of headache with nausea all snps were more relevant with higher a posteriori probability in those who experienced recent life stress. in summary, the cnr1 gene in interaction with life stress increased the risk of headache with nausea suggesting a specific pathological mechanism to develop migraine, and indicating that a subgroup of migraine patients, who suffer from life stress triggered migraine with frequent nausea, may benefit from therapies that increase the endocannabinoid tone.
polycythemia_vera	pulmonary vein thrombosis (pvt) is a rarely encountered disease entity with varied clinical presentations. it is usually associated with lung carcinoma, lung surgeries and as a complication of the radiofrequency catheter ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation. its clinical manifestations can vary from mild hemoptysis to lung infarction with hemodynamic compromise. a 76-year-old male presented with a 2-d history of pleuritic left sided chest pain. his past medical history included polycythemia vera, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension. chest radiograph was normal, troponins were normal and the 12-lead electrocardiogram did not show any ischemic changes. a computerized tomography pulmonary angiogram revealed a filling defect in the left lower lobe pulmonary vein. he was treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin and his symptoms improved. this case highlights a rare etiology of chest pain and the first reported case of the association of polycythemia vera and pulmonary vein thrombosis. a high index of suspicion is required for appropriate diagnostic work up. pvt can mimic pulmonary embolism. the diagnostic work up and treatment strategies depend on acuity of presentation.
weight_loss	floating leaf blades of waterlilies fulfill several functions in wetland ecosystems by production, decomposition and turnover as well as exchange processes. production and turnover rates of floating leaf blades of three waterlily species, nuphar lutea (l.) sm., nymphaea alba l. and nymphaea candida presl, were studied in three freshwater bodies, differing in trophic status, ph and alkalinity. length and percentages of leaf loss of marked leaf blades were measured weekly during the growing season. area and biomass were calculated based on leaf length and were used to calculate the turnover rate of floating leaf blades. seasonal changes in floating leaf production showed that values decreased in the order: nymphaea alba, nuphar lutea, nymphaea candida. the highest production was reached for nuphar lutea and nymphaea alba in alkaline, eutrophic water bodies. the production per leaf was relatively high for both species in the acid water body. nymphaea candida showed a very short vegetation period and low turnover rates. the ratio total potential leaf biomass/maximum potential leaf biomass (p/b-max) of the three species ranged from 1.35-2.25. the ratio vegetation period (period with floating leaves)/mean leaf life span ranged from 2.94-4.63, the ratio growth period (period with appearance of new floating leaves)/vegetation period from 0.53-0.73. the clear differences between nymphaea candida versus nuphar lutea and nymphaea alba, may be due to adaptations of nymphaea candida to an euro-siberic climate with short-lasting summer conditions.
hypothyroidism	we herein report a 31-year-old japanese woman with evolving hypopituitarism due to pituitary stalk transection syndrome. she had a history of short stature treated with growth hormone (gh) in childhood and had hypothyroidism and primary amenorrhea at 20 years old. levothyroxine replacement and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone-human chorionic gonadotropin (fsh-hcg) therapy for ovulation induction were started. gh replacement therapy (ghrt) was resumed when she was 26 years old. she developed mild adrenocortical insufficiency at 31 years old. she succeeded in becoming pregnant and delivered twice. ghrt was partially continued during pregnancy and stopped at the end of the second trimester without any complications.
hepatitis_c	upon recognition of specific molecular patterns on microbes, host cells trigger an innate immune response, which culminates in the production of type i interferons, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and restricts pathogen replication and spread within the host. at each stage of this response, there are stimulatory and inhibitory signals that regulate the magnitude, quality, and character of the response. positive regulation promotes an antiviral state to control and eventually clear infection, whereas negative regulation dampens inflammation and prevents immune-mediated tissue damage. an overexuberant innate response can lead to cell and tissue destruction, and the development of spontaneous autoimmunity. the retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i)-like receptors (rlrs), rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda5), belong to a family of cytosolic host rna helicases that recognize distinct nonself rna signatures and trigger innate immune responses against several rna viruses by signaling through the essential adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling (mavs). the rlr signaling pathway is tightly regulated to maximize antiviral immunity and minimize immune-mediated pathology. this review highlights contemporary findings on negative regulators of the rlr signaling pathway, with specific focus on the proteins and biological processes that directly regulate rig-i, mda5 and mavs signaling function.
sports_injuries	background: the risk of injury associated with american football is significant, with recent reports indicating that football has one of the highest rates of all-cause injury, including concussion, of all major sports. there are limited studies examining risk factors for injuries in the national football league (nfl). purpose: to identify risk factors for nfl concussions and musculoskeletal injuries. study design: case-control study; level of evidence, 3. methods: injury report data were collected prospectively for each week over the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 regular seasons for all 32 teams. poisson regression models were used to identify the relationship between predetermined variables and the risk of the 5 most frequent injuries (knee, ankle, hamstring, shoulder, and concussion). results: a total of 480 games or 960 team games (tgs) from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 regular seasons were included in this study. a trend to an increasing risk of concussion and tg ankle injury with decreasing mean game-day temperature was observed. the risk of tg concussion (incidence rate ratio [irr], 2.16; 95% ci, 1.35-3.45; p = .001) and tg ankle injury (irr, 1.48; 95% ci, 1.10-1.98; p = .01) was significantly greater for tgs played at a mean game-day temperature of 9.7 degrees c (49.5 degrees f) compared with a mean game-day temperature of 21.0 degrees c (69.8 degrees f). the risk of tg shoulder injury was significantly increased for tgs played on grass surfaces (irr, 1.36; 95% ci, 1.02-1.81; p = .038) compared with synthetic surfaces. the risk of tg injury was not associated with time in season, altitude, time zone change prior to game, or distance traveled to a game. conclusion: this study evaluated extrinsic risk factors for injury in the nfl. a hazardous association was identified for risk of concussion and ankle injury with colder game-day temperature. further research should be conducted to substantiate this relationship and its potential implication for injury prevention initiatives.
allergies	aim: it is unknown whether food allergies have greater impact on quality of life than respiratory allergies. this study compared health-related quality of life (hrqol) in children allergic to wheat or grass. methods: we surveyed 63 children with wheat allergies (median age of five) and 72 with grass allergies (median age 12), with their parents. the child health questionnaires for parents (chq-pf28) and children (chq-cf87) were applied. results: the parents of children in the wheat group recorded significantly lower chq-pf28 scores for the impact of their child 's allergy on general behaviour, general health perceptions, parental impact of emotions and time and family activities, than the parents of children with grass allergies (p values <= 0.001). however, parents in the grass group recorded lower scores for the change in health item than the parents of children with wheat allergies (p = 0.020). in the grass group, children and parents reported similar scores for the different questions, but there was poorer correlation between parents and children in the wheat allergy group. conclusion: hrqol was lower in children with wheat than grass allergies according to parental reports, with more consistent perceptions of hrqol among parents and children in the grass allergy than wheat allergy group.
cancer	in this study, we investigate the potential of moricandia arvensis methanol leaf extract (meohl) on calpain activity, melanin biosynthesis and dna mutagenicity. cytotoxic effect and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ros) induced by lucigenin in colorectal cells (be) were also determined. in addition, the chemical analysis of the extract was also studied and the chemical profile illustrates its content in para-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-hba), a glycosylated kampferol (gk), a glycosylated kampferol with rhamnose (gkr) and 19 amino acids (aas). our results showed that meohl extract enhanced a significant cytotoxic (max of ip = 89.23%) and antioxidant (max of ip= 100%) activities. furthermore, the tested extract stimulated calpain activity and significantly increased the production of intra (46 mu g/ml cells) and extracellular melanin content (12.5 mu g/ml). using ames assay, the extract exhibits a significant inhibition of mutagenicity induced by methy-methane-sulfonate (mms) (76.32%) as well as 2-aminoanthracene (2-aa) (91%) in the salmonella thyphimurium ta104 assay system.
fungal_infection	the detection of fungal elements and their characterization in patient specimens provides fundamental information. on histological sections fungi are most frequently seen on skin or mucosal surfaces or as mycotic thrombi or emboli that can occlude both arteries and veins in surgical specimen from immunocompromised patients or tissues obtained from autopsies. microbial culture continues to be the central method for diagnosing fungal infection but is complemented by histomorphology using specific stains capable of identifying previously unsuspected fungal infections or for evaluating tissue invasion. these stains employ oxidizing reagents to create aldehyde binding sites on polysaccharides (1,2-glycol groups) of fungal cell walls for either schiff 's reagent or silver ions. gomori methenamine silver (gms) and periodic acid-schiff (pas) or their modifications are the most commonly used for tissue sections and in cytology specimens.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background: blastocystis is one of the most common parasites, reported from both human and animals. this parasite is more prevalent in regions with low levels of hygiene, close contact with animal and unsuitable disposal systems. the aim of the study was to subtype blastocystis sp., isolated from diarrheic and non-diarrheic patients using sequencing of 18s ribosomal dna. methods: totally, 300 stool samples were collected from diarrheic and non-diarrheic patients referred to imam reza hospital, tehran from apr to aug 2015. all samples were concentrated using conventional formalin - ether technique and recognized under light microscope. the fresh stool samples were also cultivated in clotted fetal bovine medium and examined for growing of blastocystis every 48 h with direct smear slides for 10 d. dna extraction was performed on all positive samples. amplified dna fragment of 18s rdna was sequenced and compared with reference genes, previously deposited in genbank database. results: the number of diarrheic and non-diarrheic patients participated in the study was 134 (44.66%) and 166 (55.34%), respectively. three subtypes 1, 2, 3 were identified from positive samples. subtype 2 was the most prevalent (36.5%) followed by subtype 1 (33.3%) and subtype 3 (30.2%). there were no mixed subtypes. furthermore, the most prevalent subtypes in diarrheic and non-diarrheic patients were subtype 2 (39.28%) and subtype 1 (37.14%), respectively. conclusion: blastocystis sp., is one of the most prevalent unicellular parasites among diarrheic and non-diarrheic patients. indeed, st2 was the most prevalent subtype particularly in those samples collected from diarrheic patients.
allergies	background: unconfirmed beta-lactam allergy is a significant public health problem because of the limitations it imposes in drug selection. in this study, we aimed to evaluate patients referred for beta-lactam allergy to determine the frequency of confirmed beta-lactam allergy and identify some risk factors. methods: in a prospective cohort study, all referred patients to immunology, asthma and allergy research institute in tehran university of medical sciences (between 2007 2009) who suspected to have beta-lactam allergy were entered into this study based on having the inclusion criteria. follow-up was performed 6 8 years after the final diagnosis. diagnosis of beta-lactam allergy relies on thorough history and specific ige measurements (immunocap), skin prick testing (spt), intradermal testing (idt), patch testing, and oral drug challenge test. results: fifty-one patients with mean age of 24.5 (+/- 18.5) years were enrolled in this study. based on workups, beta-iactam allergy was confirmed in 16 (31.4%) patients, suspicious in 22 (43.1%) patients and ruled out in 13 (25.5%) patients. during the follow-up, 3 patients with suspicious drug allergy consumed the culprit drug with no reaction so allergy was finally ruled out in 16 (31.4%) patients. age, sex, atopy and family history of drug allergies were not significantly different between the patients with confirmed or ruled-out diagnosis of penicillin and amoxicillin allergy. conclusion: at least up to one-third of patients with a history of beta-lactam allergy are proven to be safe using the drug. also, a clear protocol consists of serum sige assay and spt can be helpful to the physicians in the health care system.
fungal_infection	background: pediatric patients on chemotherapy are vulnerable to invasive fungal infection especially candida spices. resistance to antifungal agents has increased in candida spp., especially in non-albicans species. this study aims to assess the susceptibility of candida spp. strains isolated from children with acute leukemia less than 18 years. materials and methods: this prospective cross-sectional study was conducted during march 2011 to march 2012. participants were 188 children aging from 1 month to 18 years, who had acute leukemia, were admitted in amir oncology hospital affiliated to shiraz university of medical science, shiraz, iran. identification of candida strains was performed using germ tube and chlamydospore production tests on an application programming interface (api) 20 c aux yeast identification system. susceptibility testing for 7 antifungal agents was performed by the agar-based e-test method. fungal cultures were carried out from nose, oropharynx, stool, and urine specimens. results: a total of 229 yeasts were isolated. c. albicans was the most common species found, followed by c. krusei, c. parapsilosis, c. glabrata, and other candida species. candida glabrata was the most highly resistant of the yeasts isolated, being 100% resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, 88% to posaconazole, and 75% to amphotericin b and ketoconazole. conclusion: in this study, caspofungin was the most effective antifungal agent against the colonized candida spp. found, followed by conventional amphotericin b. knowledge about susceptibility patterns of colonized candida spp. can be of help to clinicians managing pediatric patients on chemotherapy.
hypothyroidism	objective: the objective of the present study was to analyze the surgical safety of retaining the glands in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mptc). patients and methods: 156 cases of mptc were retrospectively reviewed and divided into four groups according to the treatment: group a (conservative follow-up group, 30 cases), group b (total resection of unilateral gland combined with isthmic resection, 48 cases), group c (total resection of unilateral gland combined with subtotal resection of contralateral gland, 47 cases), and group d (total resection of bilateral glands, 31 cases). the average follow-up time was 34.5 months. results: the occurrence rate of hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and total occurrence rate in the group b were significantly lower than in the group c and group d, and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). the 75% survival time was 33 months in group a, 35 months in group b, and 34 months in group d. the survival time of group a was significantly less than in the other groups, and the difference was statistically significant (p0.05). conclusions: the total resection of the unilateral gland combined with isthmic resection, which conserves gland functionality, reduces complications and maintains survival time. it is, therefore, worthy of further clinical application.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	background the purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of a dual-coated probiotic supplement (duolac care) on symptoms of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a randomized double-blind clinical trial. methods fifty subjects with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome were randomly assigned to either the non-coating group or the dual- coating group in order to receive two capsules per day of multi-species probiotics containing 5 billion bacteria per capsule for 4 weeks. data from an adequate relief questionnaire were used in assessment of primary outcome. daily records of stool frequencies and the bristol stool scale, a weekly symptom diary using 100-mm visual analog scale, and beck depression inventories were collected. blood tests including blood cell counts, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factoralpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and regulatory t cells-cd4 + cd25 (high) + t cells, cd4 + lap + t cells and cd25 (high) + lap + t cells-were analyzed before and after the study. the shift of gut microbiota was investigated using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. results responses to the adequate relief questionnaire indicated significant improvement in overall discomfort in the dual-coating group and the ratio of normal stools to hard or watery stools had a better effect from dual-coated probiotics compared to non-coated probiotics. this may be due to a shift of intestinal microbiota, as our correlation analysis showed significant negative correlation between bifidobacterium and urgency of defecation. conclusions our result implies that dual-coating layers of probiotic supplement can be a candidate for treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
headache	background: malaria is a big problem of public health in many tropical countries where socioeconomic development is deficient. four species of plasmodium are capable of infecting human: p. falciparum, p. malaria, p. vivax, p. ovale. southeastern corner of iran, including sistan and baluchestan, hormozgan and the tropical part of kerman province, are endemic region of malaria. this study aimed to find out clinical findings in malaria caused by various plasmodium species in moderate transmission area of southern kerman province. methods: this study was conducted in health centers of kahnooj, manujan, ghale-ganj, roudbar and fariab in south of kerman province, southeastern iran during 2005-2009. three hundred and thirty patients with positive malaria parasite slides entered the study. frequencies of several malaria clinical presentations were investigated in four plasmodium species. results: 54.2% of considered patients were male. mean age of patients was 22.8 +/- 17.8 yr. younger and older patient were 6 months and 80 yr, respectively. ten patients were infected with p. falciparum, 314 with plasmodium vivax and 6 with mixed infection. the symptoms of fever, chills and sweating were present in 74.6% of subjects. other complaints were joint pain, headache, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. splenomegaly was detected in 17.57% of the individuals. conclusion: malaria should be considered in differential diagnosis of all acutely febrile patients in endemic area. classic symptoms of fever, chills and sweating may not present in all of patients.
diabetes	diverticulosis is defined by the presence of diverticula due to herniation of mucosa and muscularis mucosa through the muscularis propria at sites of vascular penetration in the colon and is asymptomatic in the vast majority affected. there are global differences of distribution, in western industrialized societies, the most common site is in the left colon, but in asia right sided diverticulosis predominates. whilst present in 17.5% of a general population and 42% of all comers at endoscopy it is seen in 71% of those aged >= 80 years. diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis, which may have an absence of macroscopically overt colitis and in true diverticulitis there is macroscopic inflammation of diverticula with related acute or chronic complications. whilst overall, diverticulitis affects only 4% of those with diverticulosis, in younger patients ( aged 40-49 years) this peaks at 11%. diverticulosis is one of the most common chronic diseases, yet research in this field on pathogenesis has lagged behind other common conditions such as diabetes mellitus. however, in the last decade there have been major advances in taxonomy that can be used to relate to patients' outcome and treatment in both medicine and surgery. it has been shown there is an association with age, diet, drugs and smoking. genetic studies have shown a familial association and a specific gene, tnfsf 15 may predict severity of disease. the role of the microbiome has been explored and microbial and metabolomic signatures are also important in predicting disease severity. that diverticulosis is a chronic disease is shown by mucosal pathology with subtle chronic inflammation present in those with asymptomatic diverticulosis and inflammation may lead to muscular hypertrophy, enteric nerve remodeling with disordered motility. the diverticulitis quality of life instrument shows that this condition impacts markedly on patients' well-being and prevention and amelioration of complications should be the aim of treatment and further research to attain this goal is needed.
parenting	parental practices and beliefs have been recognized as having an important influence on the development of children 's self-regulation. using a mixed methods approach, the present study explored how parental practices and beliefs influence low-income mexican american children 's (n = 44) self-regulation during the fall of preschool. quantitative results indicated that the family learning environment and parental control were significantly related to stronger self-regulation in mexican american children from low-income families. qualitative interviews indicated that ""respect"" and ""being well educated"" emerged as key factors guiding parents' expectations of children 's behaviors and discipline. additionally, these results indicated that parents struggled to provide additional educational materials to enrich the home learning environment of their children. this study highlights the importance of understanding the parental practices and beliefs of low-income mexican american parents and their influence on children 's self-regulation to better serve the needs of mexican american parents and their children.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	goals: the goals of the study were to investigate in both postprandial distress syndrome (pds) and epigastric pain syndrome (eps) the gastric electrical activity and the gastric emptying (ge) time together with the circulating concentrations of motilin, somatostatin, corticotrophin-releasing factor, and neurotensin, and to establish whether the genetic variability in the neurotensin system genes differs between these 2 categories of functional dyspepsia (fd). background: the current fd classification is based on symptoms and it has been proven not to be completely satisfying because of a high degree of symptom overlap between subgroups. study: gastric electrical activity was evaluated by cutaneous electrogastrography: the ge time by c-13-octanoic acid breast test. circulating concentrations of gut peptides were measured by a radioimmunoassay. nts 479 a/g and ntsr1 rs6090453 snps were evaluated by pcr and endonuclease digestion. results: fifty-four fd patients (50 female/4 male) were studied. using a symptom questionnaire, 42 patients were classified as pds and 12 as eps, although an overlap between the symptom profiles of the 2 subgroups was recorded. the electrogastrographic parameters (the postprandial instability coefficient of dominant frequency, the dominant power, and the power ratio) were significantly different between the subgroups, whereas the ge time did not differ significantly. in addition, eps was characterized by a different gut peptide profile compared with pds. finally, neurotensin polymorphism was shown to be associated with neurotensin levels. this evidence deserves further studies in consideration of an analgesic role of neurotensin. conclusions: analysis of gut peptide profiles could represent an interesting tool to enhance fd diagnosis and overcome limitations due to a distinction based solely on symptoms.
diabetes	background: heart failure (hf) is a disease of neurohumoral dysfunction and current pharmacological therapies for hf have not improved mortality rates, thus requiring additional new strategies. waon therapy for hf patients may be a complementary strategy with peripheral vasodilation via nitric oxide. we hypothesized that waon therapy would improve neurohumoral factors, such as natriuretic peptides (np) and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) in hf. methods and results: plasma samples were collected from patients enrolled in the waon-chf study (waon therapy (n=77) or control (n=73)) before and after the treatment. b-type np (bnp), c-type np (cnp), and aldosterone (aldo) levels were measured by respective specific radioimmunoassays. although clinical parameters significantly improved in the waon group compared with the control group, bnp, aldo, and cnp levels were not statistically different between groups. on subanalysis with patient variables, bnp levels were improved in the waon group treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker or spironolactone. in addition, aldo levels were improved in the waon group patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and inotrope use, and cnp levels were improved in waon group patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). these changes were not observed in the control group. conclusions: waon therapy may accelerate the favorable actions of raas modulators in hf. (waon-chf study: umin000006705)
irritable_bowel_syndrome	aim: the goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between gastrointestinal complaints (dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome) and hematological parameters among recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) patients. material and method: forty-four ras patients with a diagnosis of recurrent oral ulcers in oral mucosa were included in this study. they answered a questionnaire concerning oral aphthous properties, dyspepsia problems, and irritable bowel syndrome. routine hematological screening and hemoglobin, vitamin b12, folic acid, and tsh were analyzed retrospectively. data analyses were performed using spss. results: constipation complaints by females were statistically more frequent than those of males (59.3% vs. 11.8%; p< 0.05). there was a positive, statistically moderate and significant correlation between the time passed without having an aphtha (r= 0.343; p= 0.026) and lymphocyte level (r= 0.383; p= 0.028). however, there was no association between the time passed without having an aphtha and age (r= 0.112; p= 0.473), aphtha recurrence frequency (r= 0.05; p= 0.738), vitamin b12 (r= 0.019; p= 0.929), and hb levels (r= 0.047; p= 0.781). discussion: it was determined that there was positive correlation between aphtha size and lymphocyte level. further studies should be designed in light of the association of ras and gastrointestinal system disease.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundpatients with posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) often share co-morbidity with chronic pain conditions. recent studies suggest a role of p2x3 receptors and atp signaling in pain conditions. however, the underlying mechanisms of visceral hyperalgesia following exposure to ptsd-like stress conditions remain unclarified. methodsthe behavior and hormones relevant for ptsd were studied. visceromotor responses (vmr) and the abdominal withdrawal reflexes (awr) to colorectal distention (crd) were recorded to determine p2x3-receptor-mediated alteration of hyperalgesia following single-prolonged stress (sps) exposure. immunofluorescence, western blotting, and patch-clamp were used. key resultsthe escape latency, adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol were increased on days 7-14. visceromotor responses and awr was reduced at day 1 in sps rats but increased to higher levels than in controls after exposure to day 7. intrathecal administration of the p2x3-receptor antagonist tnp-atp abolished the crd response. based on immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis, sps-treated rats exhibited reduced p2x3 expression in dorsal root ganglia (drg) after day 1 compared with controls. p2x3 expression in drg was enhanced on day 7 after sps and the increase of the p2x3 expression was maintained on day 14 and 21 compared with controls. the p2x3-receptor agonist ,-me atp (10m) induced a fast desensitizing inward current in drg neurons of both control and sps-treated rats. the average peak current densities in sps-treated group were increased 3.6-fold. tnp-atp (100nm) markedly blocked all fast ,-me atp-induced inward currents in the drg neurons both in control and sps-treated rats. conclusions & inferencesthe data indicate an important role of p2x3 signaling in visceral hyperalgesia following ptsd-like stress.
parkinson's_disease	barad 's diffractive methodology was used to explore one man 's encounter with parkinson 's disease after long exposure to pesticides in home maintenance. the study moved from a realist account of relevant studies in toxicology, entomology, and neurology toward an onto-ethico-epistemological enquiry that asked how humans and insects live and work within the shared mattering of minerals, water, and time. constructed memories of my father 's later life were explored within masculine discourses about protection of the family from invading insects and an intra-active reconsideration of the contradictions involved in the use of poison as both care and harm. new materialist theorizing took the focus from an exploration of the difference experienced by one fragile body toward a larger engagement with material and discursive forces, ending with questions about u.s. modernism and the tenaciousness of human subjectivities in a time of changing climate and movement of species around the globe.
alzheimer's_disease	background: the intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid (a beta) in mice allows the investigation of acute effects on cognitive function and cellular pathology. the aim of this investigation was to further characterize the time course of a beta-induced cognitive and behavioural changes and to detect potential molecular mechanisms. methods: cannulas were implanted in the lateral cerebral ventricle. 14 days after surgery the mice were injected with a beta 1-42 or phosphate buffered saline (pbs). starting 2, 4 or 8 (pbs only 4) days after injection we evaluated cognitive and behavioural performance using the modified hole board test (mhbt). we determined tumour-necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) and caspase 3 by western blotting, on days 10, 12 and 16. data were analysed using general linear modelling, kruskall-wallis and mann-whitney-u test. results: a beta induced a decline in cognitive performance represented as an increased total number of wrong choices during the testing period from day 2-15 (p < 0.05). behavioural parameters were comparable between mice treated with a beta and pbs. there was no difference regarding tnf alpha levels between the groups. compared to day 16 caspase 3 levels were increased on day 10 (p = 0.004). conclusions: application of a beta in the lateral ventricle of mice is associated with cognitive impairment of declarative memory in the mhbt. there is no interference caused by altered behaviour. therefore, it represents a valid model for acute a beta-mediated neurotoxic effects. although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, changes in levels of caspase 3 suggest apoptosis as an important factor for the development of cognitive dysfunction.(c) 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights
skin_care	the amount of physical pressure plays an important role in complex decongestive therapy (cdt). as a function of pressure, microcirculation takes place between blood vessels and tissue. as part of the total lymphatic system, lymphatic vessels transport the lymphatic load from the interstitial space to the blood stream. the lymphatic vessel system, characterized by specific anatomical conditions like initial lymphatic vessels, precollectors, collectors, and lymphatic strains, is the therapeutic target of complex decongestive therapy. components of cdt include manual lymphatic drainage, compression therapy, decongestive kinesitherapy, and good skin care, which increase the transport capacity of the lymphatic vessel system. currently, cdt is acknowledged as the main conservative treatment of lymphedema of primary and secondary genesis, lipolymphedema, and phlebolymphedema. in clinical practice, we are increasingly confronted with edema of multifactorial genesis requiring a critical discussion and stocktaking of comprehensive clinical findings in terms of the indication for cdt. therapeutic success depends on a joint application of all cdt components and patient compliance. to an increasing extent, medical research tries to combine successfully cdt with adjunct treatment options.
allergies	there is a growing recognition that urban trees provide various valuable benefits and services such as enhanced human wellbeing. however, they also have a cost in terms of public health either directly (allergies) or by harboring species representing health risk for humans. this paper focuses on such a forest insect species, the pine processionary moth thaumetopoea pityocampa. its caterpillars develop gregariously during winter in a conspicuous silk nest in coniferous hosts. when disturbed, the larvae release urticating hairs that cause human or animal serious health problems. the purpose of our survey was to (1) inventory all individual trees belonging to potential host species and estimate the density of t. pityocampa (2) assess the spatial pattern of the insect population at the city scale. we conducted an exhaustive inventory of potential coniferous host trees in five municipalities (ca. 5000 ha) in the north of orleans, france. each tree was identified, geo-referenced and the number of moth nests it hosted was counted. a total of 9321 urban trees representing 11 coniferous taxonomic units were investigated. the distribution of t. pityocampa exhibited a marked spatial structure citywide. geostatistics allowed to draw risk maps revealing strong patchiness. we provide the first estimate of t. pityocampa host tree preference in an urban context and found that pinus nigra, p. pinaster and p. sylvestris were the most attacked trees. we also report numerous cases of t. pityocampa occurrence on the exotic ornamental himalayan cedar cedrus deodara. the management implications of our findings are two-fold: (1) risk maps constitute a useful framework for communication and public information, and can help developing control strategies; (2) some species frequently used for ornamental purposes are poor quality hosts regarding t. pityocampa and should therefore be preferred in public place usually frequented by vulnerable people (schools, nurseries, hospitals).

overactive_bladder	the isolated bladder shows autonomous micromotions, which increase with bladder distension, generate sensory nerve activity, and are altered in models of urinary dysfunction. intravesical pressure resulting from autonomous activity putatively reflects three key variables; the extent of micromotion initiation, distances over which micromotions propagate, and overall bladder tone. in vivo, these variables are subordinate to the efferent drive of the central nervous system. in the micturition cycle storage phase, efferent inhibition keeps autonomous activity generally at a low level, where it may signal 'state of fullness', whilst maintaining compliance. in the voiding phase, mass efferent excitation elicits generalised contraction (global motility initiation). in lower urinary tract dysfunction, efferent control of the bladder can be impaired, for example due to peripheral 'patchy' denervation. in this case, loss of efferent inhibition may enable unregulated micromotility, and afferent stimulation, predisposing to urinary urgency. if denervation is relatively slight, the detrimental impact on voiding may be low, as the adjacent innervated areas may be able to initiate micromotility synchronous with the efferent nerve drive, so that even denervated areas can contribute to the voiding contraction. this would become increasingly inefficient the more severe the denervation, such that ability of triggered micromotility to propagate sufficiently to engage the denervated areas in voiding declines, so the voiding contraction increasingly develops the characteristics of underactivity. in summary, reduced peripheral coverage by the dual efferent innervation (inhibitory and excitatory) impairs regulation of micromotility initiation and propagation, potentially allowing emergence of overactive bladder and, with progression, detrusor underactivity.
allergies	background: prevalence of allergic diseases and impaired pulmonary function may be high in children born prematurely. this study aimed to assess pulmonary function and prevalence of asthma, atopic diseases and allergic sensitisation in these patients. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted with children aged 6-14 years who were born prematurely with birth weight <2000 g from january 2008 to may 2011. exclusion criteria were: major malformations, or acute respiratory disorders. the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood questionnaire was applied followed by allergic skin prick test and spirometry. results: the study included 84 children aged 9.3 +/- 2.3 years born at mean gestational age of 31.8 +/- 2.4 weeks. the prevalence of current asthma was 25%, more severe asthma was 15.5%; rhinitis was 38.1%; flexural eczema was 8.3%; and a positive skin-prick test was 69.6%. frequencies of children with values <80% of predicted were: fvc (8.3%), fev1 (22.6%), and fev1/fvc ratio (16.7%). prevalence of children with fef25-75% <70% of the predicted value was 32.4%, positive bronchodilator response was observed in 20.5% of cases, and altered pulmonary function in 42.9%. factors associated with altered pulmonary function were oxygen dependency at 28 days of life (or: 4.213, p=0.021), the presence of wheezing in childhood (or: 5.979, p=0.014) and infant 's height (or: 0.945, p=0.005). conclusions: there was a high prevalence of severe asthma, allergic sensitisation, and altered pulmonary function among children and adolescents born prematurely. bronchopulmonary dysplasia and a history of wheezing were risk factors for altered pulmonary function.

fungal_infection	heat shock protein 83 (hsp83) is homologous to the chaperone hsp90. it has pleiotropic functions in drosophila melanogaster, including the control of longevity and fecundity, and facilitates morphological evolution by buffering cryptic deleterious mutations in wild populations. in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, hsp83 expression is moderately induced by bacterial infection but upregulated more strongly in response to heat stress and fungal infection. stress-inducible heat shock proteins are of considerable evolutionary and ecological importance because they are known to buffer environmental variation and to influence fitness under non-optimal conditions. to investigate the functions of hsp83 in viviparous aphids, we used rna interference to attenuate its expression and studied the impact on complex parameters. the rna interference (rnai)-mediated depletion of hsp83 expression in a. pisum reduced both longevity and fecundity, suggesting this chaperone has an evolutionarily conserved function in insects. surprisingly, hsp83 depletion reduced the number of viviparous offspring while simultaneously increasing the number of premature nymphs developing in the ovaries, suggesting an unexpected role in aphid embryogenesis and eclosion. the present study indicates that reduced hsp83 expression in a. pisum reveals both functional similarities and differences compared with its reported roles in holometabolous insects. its impact on aphid lifespan, fecundity, and embryogenesis suggests a function that determines their fitness. this could be achieved by targeting different client proteins, recruiting distinct co-chaperones or transposon activation.
alzheimer's_disease	background: the aims of this study were (1) to describe and compare the performance of illiterate and low-educated older adults, without evidence of cognitive impairment, on different versions of the boston naming test (bnt) original, brazilian adapted, abbreviated 30-item (even and odd) and 15-item from the cerad (consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer 's disease) battery; (2) to compare performance on the original versus adapted versions of the bnt. methods: a total of 180 healthy older adults (60 years or older) were stratified according to educational level (0, 1-2, and 3-4 years), and age (60-69, 70-79, and 80 years). the protocol comprised the following instruments: mini-mental state examination (mmse), brief cognitive screening battery (bcsb), functional activities questionnaire (faq), geriatric depression scale (gds), and the bnt. results: the illiterate participants had poorer performance than the educated participants. the performance of the two educated groups was similar on all versions of the bnt. a higher number of correct responses were observed on the adapted bnt than on the original bnt in all three education groups. conclusions: the adapted bnt appears to be the most suitable for use in the low-educated brazilian population. the present study provided normative data for low-educated elderly on several different versions of the bnt, which may be helpful in diagnosing naming deficits among elderly in these strata of the population.
alzheimer's_disease	in the last two decades adiponectin, member of the adipokines family, gained attention because of its unique antidiabetic effects. however, the presence in the brain of adiponectin receptors and adiponectin itself raised interest because of the possible association with neuropsychiatric diseases. indeed, clinical studies found altered concentration of adiponectin both in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in several pathologies including depression, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer ' s disease and stroke. moreover, recent preclinical studies also suggest its involvement in different physiological functions. despite this evidence very few studies attempted to elucidate the functional role of adiponectin at the synapse. to address this question, here we investigated the effect of adiporon, an agonist of both adiponectin receptors on synaptic transmission and ltp at schaffer-collateral ca1 pathway. surprisingly, increasing concentration of adiporon correlated with lower ca1-ltp levels and paired-pulse ratio, whereas basal transmission was always preserved. collectively, our data show that the adiponectin system, beyond its involvement in metabolic diseases, plays also a critical role in synaptic activity thereby representing a putative target for the treatment of synaptic pathologies.
hypothyroidism	safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of bexarotene, a novel retinoid x receptor (rxr)-selective retinoid, were evaluated in japanese patients with stage iib-ivb and relapsed/refractory stage ib-iia cutaneous t-cell lymphomas (ctcl). this study was conducted as a multicenter, open-label, historically controlled, single-arm phase i/ii study. bexarotene was p.o. administrated once daily at a dose of 300 mg/m(2) for 24 weeks in 13 patients, following an evaluation of safety and tolerability for 4 weeks at a dose of 150 mg/m(2) in three patients. eight of 13 patients (61.5%) with an initial dose of 300 mg/m(2) met the response criteria using the modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mswat) at 24 weeks or discontinuation. dose-limiting toxic effects (dlt) were present in four of 13 patients (31%) at a dose of 300 mg/m(2): two neutropenia, one abnormal hepatic function and one hypertriglyceridemia. no dlt was observed in patients received 150 mg/m(2) bexarotene. in the 13 patients at 300 mg/m(2), common drug-related adverse events (ae) included hypothyroidism (92%), hypercholesterolemia (77%), leukopenia or neutropenia (39%), nasopharyngitis or anemia (31%). the treatment-related grade 3 ae included hypertriglyceridemia (4/16 patients, 25%), increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, dyslipidaemia, leukopenia and neutropenia (1/16 patients, 6%), and one of 16 patients experienced grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia. no patients discontinued bexarotene due to the ae during the study, but dose reduction or suspension was required. bexarotene was shown to be well tolerated at 300 mg/m(2) once daily and effective in japanese patients with ctcl.
overactive_bladder	purpose: nocturia is associated with poor sleep quality; however, little is known about the relationship between nocturia and sleep quality across different workforce-relevant age groups of adults. this has implications for developing new treatment strategies that are well tolerated across populations. methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study involving merged data from the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 waves of the national health and nutrition examination survey. participants responded to validated questions on nocturia frequency and sleep from the functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire general productivity subscale (fosq-gp, range 1-4). analyses included multivariable linear regression with stratification by gender to examine associations between nocturia frequency (higher worse) and the fosq-gp scores (lower scores indicating worse daytime function related to sleep disturbance). findings: of 10,512 adults aged-2.0 years who completed the survey, 9148 (87%) had complete nocturia and fosq-gp data. the population age-adjusted prevalence of nocturia at least twice nightly was 21.1% among men and 26.6% among women (p < 0.001), and nocturia increased with age (p65 years) with greater nocturia frequency reported worse fosq-gp scores compared with younger adults with similar nocturia frequency (p < 0.001 among men and women). implications: in a population-based sample of community-dwelling men and women, the association between nocturia and worsened functional outcomes of sleep was greater among adults older than 65 years a group more vulnerable to drug side effects, and in whom nocturia is typically multifactorial. additionally, these analyses found that the association between nocturia and functional outcomes of sleep is stronger with increasing age among men. effective treatment strategies that are well tolerated by older adults, such as multicomponent treatments that simultaneously address the combined effects of lower urinary tract and sleep dysfunction, are needed. published by elsevier hs journals, inc.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	consumption of ""gluten-containing"" diet causes disease for a significant minority of people who consume foods derived from wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oat. the fact is, however, that in several types of diseases related to the consumption of ""gluten-containing"" cereals, the trigger compounds are not components of gluten. the current view of medical experts is that, excluding people suffering from celiac disease, the majority of individuals who are feeling better on the ""wheat-free"" or ""gluten-free"" diet could select a food containing much healthier, low level of fermentable oligosaccharides (often called as fodmap). to satisfy the specific health related demands of certain consumer groups, the challenge is in front of cereal breeding to develop new, ""healthier"" germplasms, suitable to produce such products by the food industry. this report aims to give an overview of some aspects of recent developments in this booming area, (i) summarizing the up-to-date knowledge on cereals-related health disorders; (ii) reporting on the status of developing celiac-safe cereals, and finally (iii) highlighting the potential of developing ""healthier"" spelt-based cereal products through the progress in an ongoing spelt breeding program.
skin_care	fatty acids containing a c18 alkyl chain such as stearic acid (c18:0 fatty acid), oleic acid (c18:1 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (c18:2 fatty acid) are common emulsifiers in skin-care products and cosmetics and are also used in skin cleansers. in this study, we prepared calcium salts (ca salts) of the above fatty acids to determine the effect of the degree of unsaturation of the alkyl chain. scanning electron microscopy images and x-ray diffraction patterns show that c18:0 and c18:1 fatty acid ca salts are plate-shaped, lamellar-crystalline powder, while c18:2 fatty acid ca salt is amorphous powder. therefore, c18:2 fatty acid ca salt exhibits a lower lubrication ability than do c18:0 and c18:1 fatty acid ca salts. in addition, the bactericidal ability against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes improved with increasing degree of unsaturation. these findings suggest that ca salts of unsaturated fatty acids have potential applications in cleansing and cosmetic products.
headache	unruptured vertebral arteries dissecting aneurysms have a benign clinical course. the most common symptoms compromise headache, neck pain, dizziness and vomiting. the optimal endovascular treatment option remains controversial. reconstructive techniques have many advantages over deconstructive ones since the advent of flow diverters such as the pipeline embolization device (ped). here, we present a case successfully treated with a ped through a combination of the radial access and advancement of the marksman catheter into the contralateral vertebral artery due to the special angio-architecture of the patient.
headache	objective: in this review we attempt to characterize the acute and chronic role of 5-ht2b receptors with regard to meningeal nociception in animal experiments and clinical data targeting migraine therapy. background: migraine is a common disabling neurovascular primary headache disease, the pathomechanism of which is still unclear. serotonin (5-ht) and its receptors might play an important role in some aspects of migraine pathogenesis. the ability of the unselective 5-ht2b receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine to induce migraine attacks in migraine sufferers, the high affinity of prophylactic antimigraine drugs to this receptor and its expression in migraine-relevant structures like the dura mater argue for a role of 5-ht2b receptors in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. methods: for this review, the relevant databases such as pubmed, medline (r), cochrane library and embase, respectively, were searched to december 2015 using the keywords ""migraine, 5-ht2, trigeminal, neurogenic inflammation, nitric oxide, nitroxyl, vasodilatation, plasma protein extravasation"" and combinations thereof. conclusion: our literature review suggests an important role of 5-ht2b receptor activation in meningeal nociception and the generation of migraine pain.
hypothyroidism	background: the aim of this study was to investigate the national prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in spain and its association with various clinical, environmental, and demographic variables. methods: the study included 4554 subjects (42.4% men) with a mean age of 50 years (range 18-93 years), who were participants in a national, cross-sectional, population-based survey conducted in 2009-2010. data gathered included clinical and demographic characteristics, physical examination, and blood sampling. thyrotropin, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and thyroid peroxidase antibody (tpoab) concentrations were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence. urinary iodine (ui) levels were measured in an isolated urine sample. results: the prevalence of treated hypothyroidism, untreated subclinical hypothyroidism, and untreated clinical hypothyroidism was 4.2% [confidence interval (ci) 3.6-4.9%], 4.6% [ci 4.0-5.2%], and 0.3% [ci 0.1-0.5%], respectively. the prevalence of total hypothyroidism (including all fractions) was 9.1% [ci 8.2-10.0%]. the prevalence of total hyperthyroidism was 0.8% [ci 0.6-1.1]. a total of 7.5% [ci 6.7-8.3%] of the population tested positive for tpoabs (>= 50 iu/ml). in multivariate logistic regression models, tpoabs were strongly associated with both hypothyroidism (p200 mu g/g creatinine) were associated with hypothyroidism (p < 0.001). the positive association between ui and hypothyroidism remained for both treated (p < 0.001) and untreated (p < 0.05) hypothyroidism, whereas it was especially significant for non-autoimmune (tpoabs negative) forms (p= 200 mu g/g, there was a positive correlation between ui and thyrotropin levels (beta = 0.152, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation between ui and free triiodothyronine levels (beta=-0.134, p = 0.001). conclusion: according to the data, a large proportion (10%) of the spanish population has some evidence of thyroid dysfunction. high tpoab concentrations were associated with both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, whereas high ui concentrations were associated with hypothyroidism.
multiple_sclerosis	we investigated the effect of 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) on experimental autoimmune neuritis (ean) using a 4-ap treated group in which 4-ap was administered in the diet, and a control group (n = 10 per group). electrophysiological and pathological assessment was performed in the sciatic nerve. the ean clinical scores were significantly lower in the 4-ap-treated group than in the control group (p < 0.05):the motor conductance velocity two weeks post-immunization was significantly higher in the 4-ap-treated group (p < 0.05). finally, 4-ap did not lead to pathological changes. thus, 4-ap might be a potential therapeutic agent in demyelinating neuropathy.

heart_disease	we report a case of rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral stenosis having cyanosis and low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. the findings of clinical examination and low values on pulse oximetry were inconsistent with the findings of normal partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation on arterial blood gas analysis, leading to diagnostic dilemma. in such clinical scenario, the anesthesiologist should be aware and vigilant about the differential diagnosis of low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry.
parenting	backgroundchildren of parents with intellectual impairment are thought to be at risk for poor social-emotional well-being. this study investigated the relationship between maternal intellectual impairment and poor child social-emotional well-being. methodsecondary analysis of data from waves 2-4 of the millennium cohort study (uk). social-emotional well-being was measured by maternal report at waves 2-4, with teacher and child self-report at wave 4. bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. resultsunadjusted, maternal intellectual impairment was associated with an elevated risk of overall poor social-emotional well-being at ages 3 and 5, but not at age 7. after controlling for individual, family and environmental characteristics, no statistically significant association was found between maternal intellectual impairment and poor child social-emotional well-being. conclusionschildren of mothers with intellectual impairment are more likely than their peers to be exposed to adverse living conditions. these living conditions may explain, at least in part, why these children face a heightened risk of poor social-emotional well-being at ages 3 and 5. improving the living conditions of mothers with intellectual impairment may offer a pathway to child social-emotional well-being.
parenting	we investigated the degree to which toddlers' observed emotional states, toddlers' temperamental traits, and their interaction accounted for variance in mothers' and fathers' parenting. main effects of two emotional states (positive emotion and negative emotion), three temperamental traits (negative affectivity, effortful control, and surgency) as well as state-by-trait interactions, were examined in relation to parental sensitivity, positive affect, and negative affect. the hypothesis that toddlers' temperamental traits would moderate the association between their observed emotional states and parenting was partially supported. significant state-by-trait interactions were found in models predicting the probability that mothers and fathers expressed negative affect toward their toddlers. for parental sensitivity and positive affect, only main effects of temperament and/or emotion expression accounted for variance in parenting.

diabetes	this study was conducted to evaluate the hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant properties of mentha spicata (labiateae) leaves aqueous extract (msla) in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. in this study, hyperglycemia was induced in male rats by intraperitoneal injection of alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg). the aqueous extract of m. spicata was orally administered at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight to diabetic rats for 21 days and the effects were compared with glibenclamid (2 mg/kg). fasing blood sugar (fbs), body weight, lipid profile and serum malondialdehyde (mda) were monitored at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days after induction of diabetes. total phenol contents (tp) and reducing power (rp) were also evaluated. tp and rp of aqueous extract were 2.763 +/- 0.39 mg galic acid/gr and 0.026 +/- 0.001 ec50 mg/ml, respectively. the ld50 of the extract was found to be. 1500 mg/kg. the administration of m. spicata aqueous extract produced a significant reduction (p. 0.01) in fbs, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and mda (101.83 +/- 4.33, 95.66 +/- 4.75, 89.83 +/- 5.26, 26.20 +/- 5.10 mg/dl and 1.53 +/- 0.61 mumol/l, respectively) in diabetic rats. these effects were comparable with the effects of standard antidiabetic drug (glibenclamide). the results of the investigation indicated that m. spicata leaf aqueous extract possess hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant properties in diabetic rats. therefore, this study suggest a promising use of it for treatment of diabetes.
hypothyroidism	thyroid hormones (th) play a fundamental role in diverse processes, including cellular movement. cell migration requires the integration of events that induce changes in cell structure towards the direction of migration. these actions are driven by actin remodeling and stabilized by the development of adhesion sites to extracellular matrix via transmembrane receptors linked to the actin cytoskeleton. focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes cell migration and invasion through the control of focal adhesion turnover. in this work, we demonstrate that the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (t3) regulates actin remodeling and cell movement in breast cancer t-47d cells through the recruitment of fak. t3 controls fak phosphorylation and translocation at sites where focal adhesion complexes are assembled. this process is triggered via rapid signaling to integrin alpha v/beta 3, src, phosphatidylinositol 3-oh kinase (pi3k), and fak. in addition, we established a cellular model with different concentration of t3 levels: normal, absence, and excess in t-47d breast cancer cells. we found that the expression of src, fak, and pi3k remained at normal levels in the excess of t3 model, while it was significantly reduced in the absence model. in conclusion, these results suggest a novel role for t3 as an important modulator of cell migration, providing a starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment.
skin_care	objective: personal care products and cosmetics are substances that have various chemical contents whose reliability is not exactly known. there is not enough study to demonstrate the safety of their use in pregnancy. the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the usage frequency of personal care products and cosmetics. methods: in this cross-sectional study, a pre-prepared questionnaire was filled out by 179 pregnant women. in this questionnaire, the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and the usage frequency of cosmetics/personal care products were evaluated in 26 different categories. results: in our study, the most frequently used products in pregnancy were general hygiene products such as toothpaste, shampoo, and soap. hand cream, wet wipes, shower gel, hair conditioner, and moisturizer use were following these products, respectively. when evaluated according to the education levels, it was found that the usage of hair dye, powder and foundation in primary school graduates were significantly higher than university graduates. the use of sun protection products in fair skin types was found significantly higher than in dark ones. conclusion: our study reveals which personal care products and cosmetics are used more often during pregnancy. our data will provide the exposure studies associated with cosmetic use in pregnancy to be planned more accurately.
hypothyroidism	this phase i b study evaluated the safety and anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab in japanese patients with advanced melanoma. pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) was given every 3 weeks (q3w) for up to 2 years or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. the tumor response was assessed as per the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (recist v1.1) by both investigator review and central review. forty-two patients with advanced melanoma received pembrolizumab. a primary cutaneous histology was observed in 34 patients (81.0%), while a primary mucosal histology was observed in 8 patients (19.0%). thirty-four patients (81.0%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (aes). the most common treatment-related aes were pruritus, maculopapular rash, malaise, and hypothyroidism. grade 3-5 treatment-related aes occurred in 8 patients (19.0%). the only grade 3-5 treatment-related ae reported in at least two patients was anemia. there were two treatment-related deaths (unknown cause and cerebral hemorrhage). among the 37 evaluable patients, the confirmed overall response rates (orrs) determined by central review were 24.1% (95% ci 10.3-43.5) for cutaneous melanoma and 25.0% (95% ci 3.2-65.1) for mucosal melanoma. the responses were durable, and the median duration of response was not reached in either population. the median overall survival (os) was not reached, with a 12-month os of 82.7% for cutaneous melanoma and 51.4% for mucosal melanoma. the safety profile of pembrolizumab in japanese patients was similar to that reported in the previous clinical studies. pembrolizumab provided promising anti-tumor activity in japanese patients with advanced melanoma.
alzheimer's_disease	there has been increasing interest in developing more powerful and flexible statistical tests to detect genetic associations with multiple traits, as arising from neuroimaging genetic studies. most of existing methods treat a single trait or multiple traits as response while treating an snp as a predictor coded under an additive inheritance mode. in this paper, we follow an earlier approach in treating an snp as an ordinal response while treating traits as predictors in a proportional odds model (pom). in this way, it is not only easier to handle mixed types of traits, e.g., some quantitative and some binary, but it is also potentially more robust to the commonly adopted additive inheritance mode. more importantly, we develop an adaptive test in a pom so that it can maintain high power across many possible situations. compared to the existing methods treating multiple traits as responses, e.g., in a generalized estimating equation (gee) approach, the proposed method can be applied to a high dimensional setting where the number of phenotypes (p) can be larger than the sample size (n), in addition to a usual small p setting. the promising performance of the proposed method was demonstrated with applications to the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative (adni) data, in which either structural mri driven phenotypes or resting-state functional mri (rs-fmri) derived brain functional connectivity measures were used as phenotypes. the applications led to the identification of several top snps of biological interest. furthermore, simulation studies showed competitive performance of the new method, especially for p>n.
overactive_bladder	objectivesto evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron compared with imidafenacin for the treatment of female patients with overactive bladder. methodspatients (n = 89) were randomized to receive 0.1 mg imidafenacin twice daily (n = 47) or 50 mg mirabegron once daily (n = 42) for 12 weeks. the primary efficacy end-point was change in total overactive bladder symptom score. secondary efficacy end-points included change in overactive bladder symptom score, 3-day micturition diary, international prostate symptom score and overactive bladder questionnaire. safety assessments included adverse events, vital signs, post-void residual volume and patient-reported incidence, and severity of distinctive symptoms related to adverse events. resultsthe mirabegron group showed a significantly reduced mean total overactive bladder symptom score from baseline, but no significant differences were noted in change of total overactive bladder symptom score compared with the imidafenacin group. significant improvements in secondary efficacy end-points were observed regarding the mean number of micturitions/24 h, mean number of urgency episodes/24 h, mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h, mean volume voided/micturition, total international prostate symptom score and quality of life in both groups, with no significant differences between the groups. the overall incidence of adverse events and the incidence of dry mouth were significantly higher in the imidafenacin group than in the mirabegron group. patient-reported incidence and the severity of dry mouth were significantly exacerbated in the imidafenacin group. conclusionstreatment with 50 mg mirabegron once daily effectively relieves overactive bladder symptoms in women with fewer adverse events than treatment with antimuscarinics.
diabetes	backgroundit is unclear whether cardiovascular risk factor modification influences the development of renal disease in people with type 2 diabetes identified through screening. we determined predictors of albuminuria 5years after a diagnosis of screen-detected diabetes within the addition-europe study, a pragmatic cardiovascular outcome trial of multifactorial cardiovascular risk management. methodsin 1826 participants with newly diagnosed, screen-detected diabetes without albuminuria, we explored associations between risk of new albuminuria (2.5mgmmol(-1) for males and 3.5mgmmol(-1) for females) and (1) baseline cardio-metabolic risk factors and (2) changes from baseline to 1year in systolic blood pressure (sbp) and glycated haemoglobin (hba(1c)) using logistic regression. resultsalbuminuria developed in 268 (15%) participants; baseline body mass index and active smoking were independently associated with new onset albuminuria in 5years after detection of diabetes. in a model adjusted for age, gender, baseline hba(1c) and blood pressure, a 1% decrease in hba(1c) and 5-mmhg decrease in sbp during the first year were independently associated with lower risks of albuminuria (odds ratio), 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.62 to 0.91 and 0.94, 0.88 to 1.01, respectively. further adjustment did not materially change these estimates. there was no interaction between sbp and hba(1c) in relation to albuminuria risk, suggesting likely additive effects on renal microvascular disease. conclusionsbaseline measurements and changes in hba(1c) and sbp a year after diagnosis of diabetes through screening independently associate with new onset albuminuria 4years later. established multifactorial treatment for diabetes applies to cases identified through screening.
alzheimer's_disease	the unique biology of rna binding proteins is altering our view of the genesis of protein misfolding diseases. these proteins use aggregation of low complexity domains (lcds) as a means to regulate the localization and utilization of rna by forming rna granules, such as stress granules, transport granules and p-bodies. the reliance on reversible aggregation as a mechanism for biological regulation renders this family of proteins highly vulnerable to promoting diseases of protein misfolding. mutations in rna binding proteins are associated with many neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (ftld). the biology of rna binding proteins also extends to microtubule associated protein tau. tau is normally an axonal protein, but in stress it translocates to the somatodendritic arbor where it takes on a new function promoting formation of stress granules. the interaction of tau with stress granules also promotes tau aggregation, accelerating formation of the tau pathology that we associate with diseases such as alzheimer 's disease (ad).
sprains_and_strains	background fall injuries constitute a significant problem in commercial fishing and such injuries have hitherto not been the subject of closer analysis. methods the distribution and the characteristics of 582 occupational injuries among commercial fishermen are described by using data from an emergency department for the period 1990-1997, recorded in a special registration system. results consistent with other investigations, injuries from falls made up 25% of all injuries; they were the cause of 28% of all contusions, 32% of all fractures, 61% of all sprains and strains, 40% of all injuries to lower extremities, and 62% of all injuries to the chest. the proportion of fall injuries in different age groups was u-shaped and constitutes around 40% for men both under 20 years and over 50 years of age, and around 20% for those between these ages. frequent types of injury mechanisms other than falls and slips were: getting caught (22%), contact with objects or persons (28%), foreign body (9%), and cuts (9%). conclusions use of proportionate data gave a detailed description of injuries from falls and slips, showing important areas for prevention. to avoid a possible misclassification of fall injuries in future studies, it is recommended to include an extra specific variable: whether falling or slipping preceded the crash phase of the injury or not.

emergency_contraception	objective: to compare contraceptive knowledge and use among women seeking emergency contraception (ec) before and after an inner-city clinic began providing structured counseling and offering same-day intrauterine device (iud) or implant placement to all women seeking ec. study design: for 8 months before and 21 months after this change in clinic policy, women aged 15-45 who wanted to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months were asked to complete surveys immediately, 3 and 12 months after their clinic visit. in addition, we abstracted electronic medical record (emr) data on all women who sought ec (n=328) during this period. we used chi-squared tests to assess pre/post differences in survey and emr data. results: surveys were completed by 186 women. after the clinic began offering structured counseling, more women had accurate knowledge of the effectiveness of iuds, immediately and 3 months after their clinic visit. in addition, more women initiated iud or implant use (survey: 40% vs. 17% preintervention, p=0.04; emr: 22% vs. 10% preintervention, p=0.01), and fewer had no contraceptive use (survey: 3% vs. 17% preintervention, p<0.01; emr: 32% vs. 68%, p<0.01) in the 3 months after seeking ec. emr data indicate that when same-day placement was offered, 11.0% of women received a same-day iud. of those who received a same-day iud, 88% (23/26) reported iud use at 3-months and 80% (12/15) at 12 months. conclusions: routine provision of structured counseling with the offer of same-day iud placement increases knowledge and use of iuds 3 months after women seek ec. implications: women seeking ec from family planning clinics should be offered counseling about highly effective reversible contraceptives with the option of same-day contraceptive placement.

allergies	background: maternal allergic disease history and impaired regulatory t-cells (tregs) are critical risk factors for allergy development in children. however, the mechanisms that underlie these risk factors remain poorly defined. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether maternal allergies affect the tregs of offspring and lead to allergy development in childhood. methods: a total of 332 mothers of healthy newborns (234 from no allergic mothers, 98 from allergic mothers) were recruited to this study. detailed questionnaires were administered yearly to determine the allergy status of the mothers and the newborns from birth to 3 years of age. cord blood samples obtained at the time of birth were analysed for treg counts, as well treg activity, based on their response to toll-like receptor (tlr) stimuli such as lipid a (lpa) and peptidoglycans (ppg). surface markers, associated genes, suppressive capacity, and cytokine levels of tregs were also measured. possible correlations between treg activity and maternal or neonate allergies were assessed. in addition, environmental microbial content and other known risk factors for allergies were measured. results: cord blood mononuclear cells (cbmcs) from offspring with allergic mothers showed fewer cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+)t cells, lower expression levels of associated genes, and reduced cytokine production of interleukin (il)-10 and interferon-gamma (p < 0.05), especially via the ppg-tlr2 pathway. suppression of effector t cells by tregs from children of mothers with allergies was impaired, especially il-13 production by type 2 t helper (th2) cells (p = 0.026). children who developed allergies in the first 3 years of life had lower numbers of cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) t cells and reduced foxp3 expression and il-10 production as newborns (p < 0.05). maternal allergic background was identified as a risk factor for allergy development in the children (odds ratio (or) = 2.46, 95 % ci = 1.05-5.79); while declining treg numbers, il-10 production, and foxp3 expression in neonates (ppg and lpa stimulated) were identified as independent risk factors for allergic diseases in offspring at 3 years of age after adjusting for maternal allergic history and environmental factors (p < 0.05). conclusion: maternal allergy correlated with impaired tregs in neonates, and this could enhance the susceptibility of offspring to allergic diseases in early childhood due to an imbalance of th1 and th2 cells.
myelofibrosis	lenalidomide, with or without prednisone, is an active therapy for patients with myelofibrosis (mf). we provide an update of a phase ii study of lenalidomide plus prednisone in patients with mf, after median follow up of 9 years. forty patients were enrolled in the study and all patients were evaluable for response. response to the treatment was reevaluated using iwg response criteria published in 2013: quality of response improved over time and overall response rate was 35%. response in splenomegaly was seen in 39% of patients and anemia response in 32%. the median time to treatment failure (ttf) in all patients was 8.2 months and the median duration of response was 34.6 months. response was highly durable in some patients: six patients (15%) had ttf for more than 60 months (5 years) and three patients are still on the treatment beyond 109 months (9 years). complete and partial responses were seen in one and five patients, respectively, but achieving deeper response was not necessary for the response to be durable. new clinical studies are needed to explore safe and well tolerated lenalidomide-based combination strategies for patients with mf.

hypothyroidism	background: in definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, clinically uninvolved cervical lymph nodes are irradiated with a so-called `elective dose' in order to achieve control of clinically occult metastases. as a consequence of high-resolution diagnostic imaging, occult tumor volume has significantly decreased in the last decades. since the elective dose is dependent on occult tumor volume, the currently used elective dose may be higher than necessary. because bilateral irradiation of the neck contributes to dysphagia, xerostomia and hypothyroidism in a dose dependent way, dose de-escalation to these regions can open a window of opportunity to reduce toxicity and improve quality of life after treatment. methods: upgrade-rt is a multicenter, phase iii, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. patients to be treated with definitive radiation therapy for a newly diagnosed stage t2-4 n0-2 m-0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx are eligible. exclusion criteria are recurrent disease, oncologic surgery to the head and neck area, concomitant chemotherapy or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. in total, 300 patients will be randomized in a 2: 1 ratio to a treatment arm with or without de-escalation of the elective radiation dose and introduction of an intermediate dose-level for selected lymph nodes. radiation therapy planning fdg-pet/ct-scans will be acquired to guide risk assessment of borderline-sized cervical nodes that can be treated with the intermediate dose level. treatment will be given with intensity-modulated radiation therapy or volumetric arc therapy with simultaneous-integrated boost using an accelerated fractionation schedule, 33 fractions in 5 weeks. the primary endpoint is `normalcy of diet' at 1 year after treatment (toxicity). the secondary endpoint is the actuarial rate of recurrence in electively irradiated lymph nodes at 2 years after treatment (safety). discussion: the objective of the upgrade-rt trial is to investigate whether de-escalation of elective radiation dose and the introduction of an intermediate dose-level for borderline sized lymph nodes in the treatment of head and neck cancer will result in less radiation sequelae and improved quality of life after treatment without compromising the recurrence rate in the electively treated neck.
weight_loss	recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of osteocalcin (ocn) on glucose homeostasis and metabolic dysregulation. however, its role in body composition and vascular function remains unknown. this study was designed to examine changes in metabolic parameters and body composition as well as arterial stiffness after ocn treatment in type 2 diabetic rats. adult male sprague dawley (sd) rats were fed chow or high fat diet (hfd) for 8 weeks, and then diabetes was induced with an injection of low-dose streptozotocin (stz) and treated daily with intraperitoneal injections of ocn for 12 weeks. our data showed that ocn treatment improved glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. further analysis revealed that ocn treatment resulted in increased insulin sensitivity. in addition, untreated diabetic rats experienced significant weight loss, whereas ocn-treated rats better maintained body weight (300.75 +/- 38.14 g vs. 335.50 +/- 23.70, p = 0.005). ocn also changed body composition, as evidenced by reduced body fat mass, specifically abdominal fat mass. ocn-treated diabetic rats also demonstrated decreased pulse-wave velocity, indicating of improved arterial stiffness. taken together, our findings in the current study revealed that ocn therapy prevents arteriosclerosis in an induced diabetic rat model by exerting beneficial effects on glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolites, and body composition changes.
myelofibrosis	background: although philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (ph-mpn) are usually not aggressive, the type and the number of molecular lesions impact greatly on leukemic transformation. indeed, the molecular background underlying progression is still largely unexplored even though asxl1, idh1/2, srsf2, and tp53 mutations, together with adverse karyotypic changes, place the patient at high risk of leukemic transformation. case presentation: our patient, a 64-year old man with a diagnosis of jak2(v617f) primary myelofibrosis (pmf) had an unusually rapid leukemic transformation. genomic profiling showed that tet2 and srsf2 mutations were also present. at leukemic transformation, the patient developed a complex chromosome rearrangement producing a ewsr1-myb fusion. remarkably, the expression of myb and of its target bcl2 was, respectively, >= 4.7 and >= 2.8 fold higher at leukemic transformation than after chemotherapy, when the patient obtained the hematological remission. at this time point, the ewsr1-myb fusion disappeared while jak2(v617f), tet2, and srsf2 mutations, as well as pmf morphological features persisted. conclusions: rapid leukemic transformation of jak2(v617f) pmf was closely linked to a previously undescribed putative ewsr1-myb transcription factor which was detected only at disease evolution. we hypothesize that the ewsr1-myb contributed to leukemia transformation through at least two mechanisms: 1) it sustained myb expression, and consequently deregulated its target bcl2, a putative onco-suppressor gene; and 2) ectopic ewsr1-myb expression probably fulfilled its own oncogenic potential as demonstrated for other myb-fusions. as our study confirmed that myb is recurrently involved in chronic as well as leukemic transformation of pmf, it appears to be a valid molecular marker for tailored treatments.
polycythemia_vera	aim: in recent years, a few cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) have been reported with both bcr-abl and jak2v617f mutations. moreover, mutations in the additional sex comb-like 1 (asxl1) gene were recently shown in various myeloid malignancies. there were no previous studies investigating the incidence of the asxl1 and jak2v617f mutations in iranian patients with cml. consequently, this study focuses on the analysis of these mutations in patients with cml. methods: in total, 66 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cml were examined at the time of diagnosis. thirty healthy subjects were checked as controls. exon 12 of asxl1 was amplified from genomic dna and bidirectionally sequenced. we also performed jak2v617f screening by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. results: mutations in the asxl1 gene were found in five out of 66 cml patients (7.6%). we identified a novel variant (c.1968g >a, p.asp656asn) in one of the patients that has not been reported before. we also identified bcr-abl and jak2v617f mutations simultaneously in four patients (6%). conclusion: our demonstration of asxl1 mutation, a putative tumor suppressor gene, represents an important molecular abnormality in cml. we also showed that concomitant detection of bcr-abl and jak2v617f mutations has a relatively high incidence in iranian patients.
heart_disease	background: all countries face significant challenges from complex manifestations of malnutrition, which affects one in three people globally. systematic reviews provide ready-to-use syntheses of quality-appraised evidence to inform decision-making for actions. to enhance the utility and quality of future cochrane nutrition evidence, we described the scope and quality of all nutrition systematic reviews in the cochrane database of systematic reviews (cdsr). methods: we screened all active cdsr records (31 july 2015) to identify reviews and protocols using pre-specified eligibility criteria and definitions. duplicate, independent data extraction included criteria for inclusion of studies in completed reviews (picos). we assessed methodological quality (amstar), use of grade, mapped reviews against 2013 global burden of disease data, and categorised the paradigm (medical, lifestyle and socio-ecological) of the review question. we analysed our results using descriptive statistics. results: we screened 8484 records, and included 470 (8%) completed reviews (in 45 cochrane review groups (crgs)) and 169 (7%) protocols (in 41 crgs) published by 47 of 53 crgs with reviews. most completed reviews were produced by the pregnancy and childbirth (n = 73), neonatal (n = 64), metabolic and endocrine disorders (n = 33), developmental, psychosocial and learning problems (n = 26), kidney and transplant (n = 18) and heart (n = 18) crgs. only 27% (n = 129) of reviews had searches for new studies in 2013 or thereafter. supplementation/supplement interventions were most common (50%; n = 235; majority with micronutrients; 73%, n = 173), followed by food interventions (20%; n = 95). all reviews included randomised controlled trials; about 5% included other designs; 25% used grade; the median amstar score was 9 (interquartile range: 7 to 10), 51% were high (amstar 9-11) and 49% moderate (amstar 5-8) quality. more than 80% framed questions using a medical paradigm. for top causes of years-of-life-lost, most reviews addressed preterm birth, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease; for leading risk factors for disability-adjusted-life-years, most targeted childhood undernutrition and high body mass index. conclusions: nutrition reviews comprised 8% of active cdsr records, were widely distributed across nearly all crgs and reflected the double nutrition burden. this analysis presents a comprehensive description of the scope and quality of cochrane nutrition reviews, and identifies gaps for future activities to support actions to address the nutrition burden, in line with the current nutrition agenda and impetus.
hypothyroidism	background. thyroid dysfunction and hypertension (htn) have been sporadically reported with sunitinib (sun) and sorafenib (sor). determination of the side effect incidence will enhance monitoring and management recommendations. methods. an observational cohort study was performed using deidentified pharmacy claims data from a 3-year period to evaluate patients prescribed sun, sor, or capecitabine (cap; comparison group). the primary outcome was time to first prescription for thyroid replacement or htn treatment. hazard ratios (hrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were estimated by cox proportional hazards models. results. a total of 20,061 patients were eligible for evaluation of thyroid replacement therapy, which was initiated in 11.6% of those receiving sun (hr, 16.77; 95% ci, 13.54-20.76), 2.6% of those receiving sor (hr, 3.47; 95% ci, 2.46-4.98), and 1% of those receiving cap, with median time to initiation of 4 months (range, 1-35 months). a total of 14,468 patients were eligible for evaluation of htn therapy, which was initiated in 21% of sun recipients (hr, 4.91; 95% ci, 4.19-5.74), 14% of sor recipients (hr, 3.25; 95% ci, 2.69-3.91), and 5% of cap recipients, with median time to initiation of 1 month (range, 1-18 months) for sor and 2 months (range, 1-25 months) for sun. conclusion. sun and sor significantly increased the risk for clinically relevant hypothyroidism; the risk was at least 4 times greater with sun than with sor. patients receiving sun and sor had a similar elevated risk for clinically relevant htn. these data provide robust measures of the incidence and time to onset of these clinically actionable adverse events.
alzheimer's_disease	objectivesto understand the range of symptoms that present to family caregivers of community-dwelling persons with alzheimer 's disease and related dementias (adrd). designsix-month longitudinal prospective study to identify the incidence of new or worsening symptoms and their association with acute care medical service use. settingcommunity-based sample of volunteers from multiple states. participantsa total of 136 patient-caregiver dyads with a range of dementia severity. measurementsforty four symptoms and signs common in older persons and/or persons with dementia; frequency of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death; and associations between reported symptoms and acute medical care. resultsduring a mean of 5.7 months' follow-up, new or worsening organ-specific (90% of participants), nonspecific (89%), and behavioral (88%) symptoms were common, with the average caregiver reporting seven new or worsening symptoms. most common were worsening confusion (74%), decreased activity (64%), agitation (57%), hallucinations/delusions (45%), voice and speaking problems (45%), not eating or drinking (44%), and stress/anxiety (41%). hospitalization and emergency department use occurred respectively in 19% and 20% of participants, and were associated with organ-specific symptoms (or 3.15, p = .02), less so with nonspecific symptoms (or 2.27, p = .07), and very little with behavioral symptoms (or 1.44, p = .38). within each symptom category, certain symptoms were significantly associated with acute medical service use. conclusionfamily caregivers of persons with adrd must respond to a variety of medical, nonspecific, and behavioral symptoms. the high incidence of new or worsening symptoms and of acute medical care use suggests a need to better target symptom evaluation and management in caregiver education.
fungal_infection	background: immunosuppressive therapy places pediatric patients at risk of developing life-threatening sinonasal infections. diagnosis and treatment are challenging owing to nonspecific signs and symptoms. the aim of this study was to present our department 's experience with the surgical management of acute rhinosinusitis in immunosuppressed children. methods: the records of all children with a hematologic or oncologic disease who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ess) for acute rhinosinusitis from january 2005 to may 2014 were reviewed. data were retrospectively collected on demographics, clinical and imaging characteristics, microbiology, pathology, treatment and outcome. results: thirty-four-immunosuppressed children underwent ess for acute rhinosinusitis. most patients had a fungal infection. nineteen patients died at the end of follow-up; 10 deaths were infection-related. facial swelling was the only symptom that correlated with death of infection. relapse of the underlying disease, bone marrow transplantation, and long duration of neutropenia correlated with infection-related mortality. fungal infection, and specifically aspergillus, correlated with death from infection. conclusions: ess is a safe and efficient procedure for diagnosing and treating immunosuppressed pediatric patients with acute rhinosinusitis. early detection and aggressive medical and surgical treatment, with control of underlying risk factors, are crucial to improve outcome.
alzheimer's_disease	we investigate whether there is any association between the braak neurofibrillary tangle (nft) stage and clinical and mri features in definite primary age-related tauopathy (part). we analysed 52 cases with a braak nft tangle stage >0 and <= iv, and a thal phase of 0 (no beta-amyloid present). twenty-nine (56%) were female. median age at death was 88 years (iqr 82-92 years). fifteen (29%) were tdp-positive (75% tdp stage i), 16 (31%) had argyrophilic grain disease and three (6%) had alpha-synuclein-positive lewy bodies. tdp-43 inclusion when present were rare and predominantly perivascular. of the 15 with tdp-43, three showed a moderate number of inclusions and also had hippocampal sclerosis, neuronal intranuclear inclusions and fine neurites of the ca1 region of the hippocampus. four cases (8%) had an apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (apoe4) allele. there was a significant correlation between age at death and braak nft stage (r = 0.32, p = 0.02). after accounting for age at clinical examination, there were significant associations between braak nft stage, and wais-r block design and trail making tests a and b, with higher braak stage associated with poorer performances. thirty of the 52 cases had completed an antemortem volumetric head mri. two separate mri analyses revealed an association between higher braak nft stage and grey matter atrophy in the head of the left hippocampus. there were no significant clinical or radiologic associations with tdp-43. findings from this study demonstrate that aggregated tau distribution is associated with poorer cognitive performance, as well as atrophy, in the absence of beta-amyloid. these findings support the parcellation of definite part as a useful construct. the relatively low frequencies of apoe4, tdp-43, lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis, and the rarity and morphology of tdp-43 lesions are noted contrasts to what is typically observed in alzheimer 's disease of the old.
hypothyroidism	the mccune-albright syndrome (mas) is a triad of cafe-au-lait skin pigmentation, precocious puberty (pp), and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone (fd). in general, fd seems to be the most common component of mas but very rarely precocious puberty can be found in association with cafe-au-lait skin pigmentation in the absence of fd (about 1% of the cases). therefore, a more clinically relevant definition of mas is fibrous dysplasia of bone (fd) and at least one of the typical hyperfunctioning endocrinopathy and/or cafe-au-lait spots, with almost any combination possible. bone scan can be the modality of choice to look for bone disease burden of fibrous dysplasia in most patients of mas and may change the management accordingly. most of the cases of mas reported worldwide are associated with hyperthyroidism, up to best of our knowledge on the basis of literature search in pubmed and google; no case was reported with hypothyroidism. herein, we report a 12-year-old girl diagnosed with mas and associated hypothyroidism. we have also reviewed the mas related literature.
myelofibrosis	the efficient treatment of hematological malignancies as acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia, requires the elimination of cancer-initiating cells and the prevention of disease relapse through targeting pathways that stimulate generation and maintenance of these cells. in mammals, inhibition of smoothened, the key mediator of the hedgehog signaling pathway, reduces chronic myeloid leukemia progression and propagation. these findings make smo a candidate target to inhibit maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells. in drosophila melanogaster the same pathway maintains the hematopoietic precursor cells of the lymph gland, the hematopoietic organ that develops in the larva. using drosophila as an in vivo model, we investigated the mode of action of pf-04449913, a small-molecule inhibitor of the human smo protein. drosophila larvae fed with pf-04449913 showed traits of altered hematopoietic homeostasis. these include the development of melanotic nodules, increase of circulating hemocytes, the size increase of the lymph gland and accelerated differentiation of blood cells likely due to the exit of multi-potent precursors from quiescence. importantly, the smo inhibition can lead to the complete loss of hematopoietic precursors. we conclude that pf-04449913 inhibits drosophila smo blocking the hh signaling pathway and causing the loss of hematopoietic precursor cells. interestingly, this is the effect expected in patients treated with pf-04449913: number decrease of cancer initiating cells in the bone marrow to reduce the risk of leukemia relapse. altogether our results indicate that drosophila comprises a model system for the in vivo study of molecules that target evolutionary conserved pathways implicated in human hematological malignancies.
fungal_infection	peroxisomes are involved in various metabolic processes and are important for virulence in different pathogenic fungi. how peroxisomes rapidly emerge in the appressorium during fungal infection is poorly understood. here, we describe a gene, pef1, which can regulate peroxisome formation in the appressorium by controlling peroxisomal fission, and is required for plant infection in the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae. targeted deletion of pef1 resulted in a reduction in virulence and a delay in penetration and invasive growth in host cells. pef1 was particularly expressed during appressorial development, and its encoding protein was co-localized with peroxisomes during appressorial development. compared with the massive vesicle-shaped peroxisomes formed in the wild-type appressorium, the delta pef1 mutant could only form stringy linked immature peroxisomes, suggesting that pef1 was involved in peroxisomal fission during appressorium formation. we also found that the delta pef1 mutant could not utilize fatty acids efficiently, which can improve significantly the expression level of pef1 and induce peroxisomal fission. as expected, the delta pef1 mutant showed reduced intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ros) during appressorium formation and induced ros accumulation in host cells during infection. taken together, pef1-mediated peroxisomal fission is important for fungal infection by controlling the number of peroxisomes in the appressorium.
cancer	assay technologies capable of detecting biomarker concentrations in unprocessed whole blood samples are fundamental for applications in medical diagnostics. sers nano-tags integrated fiber-optic biosensor (fob) was realized for the first time for in situ immunoassay in whole blood. the reliability and sensitivity of this method rely, in a large extent, on the quality and properties of the sers nano-tags. the constructed silica coated ag sers nano-tags as labels were used in a rapid and specific in situ fob immune sensor to detect alpha fetoprotein (afp) in unprocessed blood samples. preliminary results of in vivo and in situ dynamic observation of afp of whole blood in wistar rat highlight the power of this new method.
