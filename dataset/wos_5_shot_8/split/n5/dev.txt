green_building	appropriate site planning and design (spd) is a key solution for effective land use on construction sites. a green building rating tool (gbrt) includes systematic assessment criteria to evaluate whether a building is ""green"" or not. the effectiveness of gbrts have been explored in energy use, waste management, and indoor air quality in green buildings. however, no investigation has been made to evaluate the effectiveness of gbrts in site planning and design aspects. in this research, five international gbrts were selected for a comparative analysis, to better understand the measures that help improve spd in green buildings. content analysis was applied to record and compare the relevant significance of spd-related items in the selected gbrts. the comparative study revealed that in terms of spd, building environmental assessment method (beam) plus allocates the highest importance while green mark (gm) allocates the lowest. each gbrt emphasizes different aspects of spd in green buildings, and beam plus involves the most spd related items. in addition, the main variables for effective spd were identified and a theoretical framework was further proposed. the proposed theoretical framework can serve as a foundation for successful spd in green buildings. the application and potential limitations of the theoretical framework were also discussed.

green_building	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to investigate the whole-life costs of non-residential green-rated building developments in singapore to derive useful information for research and practice. when industry stakeholders like building owners, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, builders and facility managers have detailed information about the initial and operating costs of different types of buildings, they will be able to apply whole-life costing to their existing or new projects with the intention of achieving value for money, as well as environmental sustainability. the developed index is useful to green policymakers and building owners. design/methodology/approach - data are collected from building projects certified by the building and construction authority (bca) of singapore under the green mark scheme, starting from 2005. statistical analysis is performed on the collected data to generate the information required to build the index as well as cost database. the paasche price index method is used to produce a weighted composite index for singapore 's non-residential building sector. findings - the results show the classification of whole-life costs components by two main groups ""development and construction costs"", and ""operating and maintenance costs"". there are a total of 68 cost significant items selected from 13 construction work categories. comparing the weights for three non-residential building types, the highest is obtained for industrial building, which is followed by institutional and commercial buildings. research limitations/implications - without data, the description of the research has primarily dealt with the formulation of the proposed index because designing an appropriate methodology is key to ensure widespread acceptance and use. practical implications - prospective users have to be aware that the index cannot provide information about change in absolute terms and is not very accurate as such in reflecting the actual level of costs or prices of the variable of interest. however, it is a good indicator of the relative change over time in the level of costs or prices. originality/value - it is expected that this method contributes additional information to bca 's existing tender price index about a building 's operating costs as well since the proposed index is a measure of change in the average whole life-cycle costs of buildings over time.
green_building	the recent rise in the use of third-party standards and rating systems to evaluate the sustainability or greenness of urban programs and policies includes their explicit incorporation into municipal policy in the case of certified green buildings. in this paper the theoretical framework of performativity is used to explain how multiple forms of city activity interlock through policy to name, repeat, and recount the city as a leader-which, in this particular discursive formation, means being green. by performing greenness to their peers, city staff and elected officials work on the city 's identity as an innovator and leader. furthermore, the internal performance of greenness to residents and businesspeople indicates the appropriate role of local government in relation to private sector activity and protecting citizens, including taking on the risks of new technologies and practices to ease the way for private capital.
green_building	the construction industry has significant environmental, social and economic impacts on the society. as a result, the last decades have witnessed the rapid growth of the green building sector in order to mitigate the negative impacts associated with construction related activities. similar to conventional building projects, green building projects have a variety of objectives that may not necessary be compatible. these include upfront cost vs. ongoing savings; and energy savings vs. building users' health and wellbeing. in china, it has been reported that some green buildings consume 26% less energy compared to conventional buildings. however, due to the incremental cost, it is not uncommon that enterprises and governments in china are unwilling to bear this kind of risk. this has presented significant challenges to industry practitioners as they are also facing extra demands related to sustain ability. this research aims to investigate the conflicts amongst various objectives of green building developments. a theoretical framework was established to depict the potential conflicts amongst various objectives of green building projects across its life cycle. this theoretical framework was tested with empirical data collected via semi-structured interviews. rough set theory was employed to investigate the conflict degree amongst various project objectives from stakeholder 's point of view. implications were discussed and recommended to resolve these conflicts.

green_building	(d)ecreasing of energy consumption and environmentally friendly energy resources are the issues in the foreground nowadays. as the electric energy consumed for the illumination is high, long-lasting and low-consumption led (light-emitting diode) technology gets prominent. there have been made much reseacrh regarding the use of photovoltaic sytems in meeting the energy demand in housing and industry. however, there is need for more research with regards to photovoltaic sytems' integration with energy efficiency sytems. in this study, for the environments which have different lighting levels due to daylight factor, there has been proposed a low-cost pv (photovoltaics) based and distributed sensor smart led illuminating system and there has been acquired 72.075% more energy saving in comparison with conventional led illuminating system.

water_pollution	the el sancho reservoir is located in the odiel river basin, which crosses the iberian pyrite belt. the reservoir receives acid mine drainage (amd) from the meca river, a tributary of the odiel river. two multi-parameter probes, one placed at the tail (up-gradient) end of the reservoir, where the contaminants enter, and another close to the reservoir dam were used to characterize acidity migration through the sancho reservoir. the probes both measured ph and conductivity every 30 min. two different levels of contamination were found, due to dilution that takes place within the reservoir and changes in the amd composition. the cross-correlation function allowed quantification of the migration process from tail to dam. for both ph and conductivity, the maximum correlation occurred 17 days after sampling, indicating a mean transit time of 17 days. since the distance between the two sampling points was 14,500 m, the contaminant transit speed was 0.0098 m/s.
water_pollution	problems of high turbidity, sedimentation, water pollution and siltation occur at limboto lake, gorontalo, indonesia. the objective of this study was to analyze the rainfall-discharge relationship and its implications for water quality conditions. secchi disk (water transparency), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and total organic matter (tom) were measured in may 2012, september 2012 and march 2013 at three sites of the lake (l-1, l-2 and l-3) to observe the impacts on the surrounding catchment. based on representative stations for rainfall data from 2004 to 2013, monthly averages of rainfall in march-may (166.7 mm) and september (76.4 mm) were used to represent the wet and dry period, respectively. moreover, sediment traps at these three sites were installed in september 2012. based on the analysis it is suggested that rainfall magnitude and land use change at the alopohu river catchment influenced the amount of materials flowing into the lake, degrading the water quality. specifically, the higher average rainfall in may (184.5 mm) gave a higher average total sediment load (4.41 g/l/day). in addition, water transparency decreased with increasing chl-a. this indicates that the concentrations of sediment and nutrients, reflected by the high amount of chl-a, influenced the water quality conditions.
water_pollution	the bivalve mollusks are among the aquatic bioindicators that are commonly used in monitoring water pollution studies, thanks to their behavior and metabolism. they are directly affected by the level of pollution in a given site. during this research, the study of the biological response in gills, hepatopancreas and muscles of indigenous mussels mytilus galloprovincialis were used for monitoring, emissary 's pollution in four polluted sites in the coastal environment of casablanca. seasonal variations of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes, catalase (cat), glutathione s-transferase (gst), as well as lipid peroxidation (lp) were measured as biomarkers within a one year period and compared to mussels from an unpolluted sampling site. this study was completed by analysing a series of abiotic factors (temperature, ph and conductivity) and chemicals (heavy metals; hg, pb, cu) into seawater. our result showed that the availability of metallic contamination and the environmental stress conditions causes relatively an oxidative stress in this species at each station studied. while the pollution 's level clearly varies according to the sampling campaign. furthermore, they revealed a significant increase in gst activities and lp concentrations and significant decrease in cat activities in mussels collected in sites with industrial contamination. this negative correlation suggested that the organisms at this location are exposed to a relatively higher level of oxidative stress. this first study in the area confirm that variations of antioxidant defence enzymes activities and lp concentrations in mussels could be used as prospective biomarkers of toxicity in environmental monitoring programs.

water_pollution	much attention has been paid to burden shifting of co2 emissions from developed regions to developing regions through trade. however, less discussed is that trade also acts as a mechanism enabling wealthy consumers to shift water quantity and quality stress to their trading partners. in this study, we investigate how shanghai, the largest megacity in china, draws water resources from all over china and outsources its pollution through virtual quantity and quality water flows associated with trade. the results show that shanghai 's consumption of goods and services in 2007 led to 11.6 billion m(3) of freshwater consumption, 796 thousand tons of cod, and 16.2 thousand tons of nh3-n in discharged wastewater. of this, 79% of freshwater consumption, 82.9% of cod and 82.5% of nh3-n occurred in other chinese provinces which provide goods and services to shanghai. thirteen provinces with severe and extreme water quantity stress accounted for 60% of net virtual water import to shanghai, while 19 provinces experiencing water quality stress endured 79% of net cod outsourcing and 75.5% of net nh3-n outsourcing from shanghai. in accordance with the three redlines recently put forward by the chinese central government to control water pollution and cap total water use in all provinces, we suggest that shanghai should share its responsibility for reducing water quantity and quality stress in its trading partners through taking measures at provincial, industrial, and consumer levels. in the meantime, shanghai needs to enhance demand side management by promoting low water intensity consumption.
water_pollution	a real-time, rapid emergency control (ec) model is proposed to cope with sudden water pollution accidents in long-distance water transfer projects. the ec model outputs the method of ec based on pollutant properties. a generalized form of ec model is proposed and tested with a demonstrative project. the rapid prediction formulas of emergency control parameters (ecps) are proposed under different states of water diversion. the closing times of check gates and the pollution range are calculated by the rapid prediction formulas of ecps. a case study is examined under the scenario of a sucrose spill in a demonstrative project conducted in the fangshui to puyang channel of the beijing-shijiazhuang emergency water supply project in the middle route of the south-to-north water transfer project. the relative errors of peak concentration and arrival time of peak concentration are less than 20%. however, we could not use an actual toxic soluble pollutant to validate the ec model, so we performed the experiment with sucrose to test the ec model based on its concentration variation. the final result shows that the model is able to play a fundamental role in the decisions involved in the emergency environmental decision support system.
smart_material	monodispersed titanium oxide nanospheres were synthesized via the controlled hydrolysis method in this study firstly. then the rapid mixing method was used to in situ oxidation polymerize aniline, which can modify the surface of titanium oxide nanospheres to form a core/shell nanostructure. scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), x-ray diffraction (xrd) and rotational viscometer were used to investigate its structure, morphology and properties. the different type and dosage of surfactants, different acids, crystal forms of titanium oxide and different dosages of aniline were studied to analysis the impact on the tio2/pani nanocomposites. the suitable type and dosage of surfactants, the ratio of aniline to titania were the key to synthesize the nanocomposite, which can include nanoring, nanofiber or nanoparticles core/shell composite depending the synthesis condition. the titania/polyaniline composite showed typical electrorheological (er) behavior, which demonstrated its potential applications as an er smart material.

smart_material	tropoelastin dominates the physical performance of human elastic tissue as it is assembled to make elastin. tropoelastin is increasingly appreciated as a protein monomer with a defined solution shape comprising modular, bridged regions that specialize in elasticity and cell attachment, which collectively participate in macromolecular assembly. this modular, multifaceted molecule is being exploited to enhance the physical performance and biological presentation of engineered constructs to augment and repair human tissues. these tissues include skin and vasculature, and emphasize how growing knowledge of tropoelastin can be powerfully adapted to add value to pre-existing devices like stents and novel, multi-featured biological implants.

smart_material	carbon nanofibers are an emerging smart material that are promising for use as a biosensor and a biofuel cell transducer material due to their morphological and electrochemical characteristics. in particular, graphitized carbon nanofibers possess unique structures of graphite-like edges within their high surface area that provide a large active site for enzyme attachment. for a specific application such as a biofuel cell, which requires highly stable electrical communication and electricity generation, non-covalent enzyme immobilization using bifunctional molecule is suggested as an appropriate approach because it does not change the carbon hybridization from sp(2) to sp(3) as covalent immobilization by acid treatment does. graphitized carbon-nanofiber paper (gcnfp) electrode were fabricated through dispersion-filtration method in which glucose oxidase as model enzyme were immobilized by a bifunctional molecule that forms pi-pi stacking of the pyrene moiety with the nanofiber wall coupled by a reactive end-amine reaction. this system provides a practical enzyme-electrode hybrid that facilitates comparatively faster enzyme-electrode electrical communication than other system using similar material, as calculated from the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (k-s) which was 5.45 s(-1).
smart_material	in recent years, ""smart structures"" experienced significant popularity in civil engineering. such structures, referred to as intelligent structures, are built with combination of smart and conventional materials and have intelligent systems that cannot only gather information and perform tasks, but also sense variation in conditions of the materials and adapt accordingly. conductive hot mix asphalt (hma) mixtures are constructed by modifying with electrically conductive materials. conductive hma mixtures would potentially make many technologies applicable to pavements including, but not limited to; thermal electric de-icing of airport runways or highways, cathodic protection of concrete bridge decks, pavement damage sensing, truck weigh-in-motion, and so forth. dispersing carbon nanofibers (cnf) in hma mixtures makes it a smart material as it develops a piezoresistive effect. the main objective of the study is to develop a smart hma mixture by using electrically conductive material such as carbon nanofibers (cnf). the cnf modified hma mixtures would have the ability to respond to loading. an exploratory investigation for piezoresistive response of cnf modified hma mixtures under various types of loading, frequencies, and temperatures were evaluated. stress strain response due to applied load and its relationship with the change in resistivity was discussed. it was found that out of two type of cnf used in the study one provide better piezoresistive response of hma. it was determined that embedment of copper wire electrodes is the most effective method to achieve smooth and consistent electrical response. furthermore, polymer modified binders showed promising piezoresistive effect for medium to high temperature range.

smart_material	this chapter reviews smart and high performance materials that are currently used in protective textiles or are being investigated by researchers for protective applications. fibres with high strength, heat resistance, chemical resistance, and electrical conductivity are discussed. materials with piezoelectric properties for sensing and actuation, phase change materials that absorb and release heat, and shear thickening fluids are briefly covered. protective films and electrospun nanofibre membranes and their methods of manufacture are described, as are nanofibres derived from natural sources. applications of carbon nanotubes are reviewed and some discussion is given of why the outstanding properties of individual nanotubes are not yet fully exploited in macroscopic assemblies as pure nanotube fibres or as composites with a polymer resin.
ambient_intelligence	intelligent (or smart) environments are usually developed for indoor applications, like ambient assisted independent living of seniors or handicapped persons in their homes, but users would appreciate intelligent support of various human activities also in outdoor spaces, e.g., in streets, forests, or elsewhere in open nature. extensive usage of wireless sensor networks combined with cloud-based services and possible wearable equipment seems to be usable and efficient there. the purpose of the paper is to sketch a vision of an intelligent, knowledge rich outdoor environment, illustrated on the example of a ski resort. such a knowledge rich outdoor environment (e.g., ski resort, or sea resort, among others) could be based on exploitation of sophisticated wireless sensor networks sending the data to an appropriate cloud with mobile access to all the necessary information.
ambient_intelligence	intelligent (or smart) environments are usually developed for various indoor applications, capable, e.g., of supporting independent living of seniors or handicapped people. taking into account recent achievements in ambient intelligence, wearable technologies, and wireless sensor networks, especially focused on the area of environmental monitoring, a need for intelligent support of various human activities also in outdoor environment is evident. such solutions, focused on intelligent support of human activities in natural outdoor environment, have been still very rarely developed and published. a way to useful outdoor applications may lead through exploitation of ""large-scale ambient intelligence"" approaches respecting the distributed character of outdoor applications. here also cloud - based solutions seem to be naturally utilizable. the purpose of the paper is, after reviewing several existing solutions in related areas, to discuss possibilities for cloud-based solutions in intelligent environments oriented on human activities support in outdoor spaces. the approach is illustrated using scenario-based explanation.
ambient_intelligence	ambient intelligence (ami) deals with a new world of ubiquitous computing devices, where physical environments interact intelligently and unobtrusively with people. ami environments can be diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, vehicles, tourist attractions, stores, sports facilities, and music devices. in this paper, we present the design and implementation of a testbed for ami using raspberry pi mounted on raspbian os. we analyze the performance of optimized link state routing (olsr) and wired equivalent privacy (wep) protocol in an indoor scenario. for evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics. the experimental results show that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly.
ambient_intelligence	following the concept of ubiquity further on, ambient intelligence (ami) is focused on technologies and approaches for development of intelligent environments aiming at supporting their users. architectures of these environments are usually modeled by multi-agent systems, facilitating thus investigation of various processes enabling the environments' functionalities. in this scope, it is challenging to study decision processes used by individual components (agents) of the environment in mutual cooperation for creating decisions about ways how and when to support particular users activities adequately. a recent project de-pies ""decision processes in intelligent environments"", supported by the czech scientific foundation in the period of 2015 to 2017, is oriented on investigation of various decision processes that could appear in various types of intelligent environments, modeled by adequate multi-agent architectures. this paper aims at presenting information about the project goals, its methodology and approaches used as well as intended to be used in near future. a special part of the paper is devoted to possibilities of modeling and simulation of decision processes using the anylogic multimethod simulation tool.
ambient_intelligence	in this panel, 6 of 13 contributors to a recent book on ethics and pervasive information and communication technologies, or pict [1], will make short presentations on their areas of expertise. about half of the panel 's time will be reserved for open discussion. pervasive ict is similar to ubiquitous computing (or ubicomp), pervasive computing, everyware, and ambient intelligence (ami); it includes many different concrete artifacts, including tabs, pads, and boards [2]; dust, skin, and clay[3]; and, of course, smartphones. three characteristics distinguish pict: it is, or could be, anywhere and everywhere - buildings, billboards, floors, restrooms, purses, pockets, coffee makers, pacemakers, eyeglasses, and the kitchen sink. it detects, collects, organizes, acts upon, and transmits information, often wirelessly on the internet. its presence and operation is often undetected by casual users, whether hidden physically (e.g., computer chips embedded in automobiles) or functionally. functional invisibility occurs when a function of use of the technology is not announced (e.g., tracking online behavior), announced in a cryptic fashion (as in most terms of use), or becomes ambient through a process of familiarization, such as when smartphones become as ordinary as wallets and facebook becomes a way of life. ethical challenges posed by pict are new and emerging, as are the technologies themselves. the book and this panel are exercises in anticipatory ethics - ""ethical analysis aimed at influencing the development of new technologies"" [4]. the panel will be organized as follows: 1. introduction to the panel-pimple 2. ""gaps and lags: ethics and regulation of ehealth""-seelman 3. ""vulnerable and marginalized populations and pict""-jones 4. ""the sum is greater than its parts: emergent failure modes in interconnected automated systems""-searing 5. ""values levers: practices that encourage ethics in design""-shilton 6.

construction_management	dealing with the renovation and restoration of historical building heritage often means facing several difficulties which not only concern ways of representing the ancient building and the design ideas, but also the phases of on-site interventions. the designers must always take into account a range of possible and compatible solutions that avoid endangering the cultural significance of the historical building. traditional methods are often time-consuming and barely efficient, because they are related to the exchange of two-dimensional and paper-based support information. building information modelling (bim) may represent an answer to these problems, allowing users to model the three-dimensional compounds of the building and to link a variety of information to it. the aim of this article is to propose an innovative approach to the construction management of historical building interventions, based on bim technologies, and explore different issues such as: parametric modelling of historical buildings, starting with laser scanner survey: lod (level of detail) definition and measurement accuracy, with relation to modelling procedures; parametric modelling of the site and the several phases of restoration work in a fixed schedule (4d dimension); 3d graphic representation of safety procedures and related tools. the subject of the case study is the ss. nome di maria church (italy), built in 1748, which was seriously damaged during the earthquake that occurred in italy in 2012.

construction_management	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyze actual developments within ppp-projects, and the influences of business-cultures in the management-processes of such international ppp-projects. the paper focusses especially on the procurement, during which potential project-partners are being selected. design/methodology/approach - the researcher adopted a recent model from literature for analyzing business-cultures within construction processes; especially the so called ""3c-model"" was used, earlier developed and published within construction-management literature. based on analysis of literature and comparable situations, conclusions and recommendations have been made for managing international ppp-projects, especially in the project-partners selection phase. findings - actual approaches within international ppp-projects do need a more structured approach during the selection of the project-partners. it is suggested to use more past-performance information, not only based on financials and/or organizational data/experiences, but also on behavioral (businessculture) data/experiences. this information needs to be structured in a proper way. suggestions are given focussing on discussion and future-outlook. research limitations/implications - it would be useful to test the findings on further actual cases, testing the further implications of the outcome. practical implications - a better understanding of business-cultures' influences increases the awareness of project-participants for the advantage of the suggested extra selection-criteria. this might reduce the risk for conflicts during the project-execution in the total project life-cycle. social implications - when improving the actual practices of selection suitable parties for actual and future ppp-projects, it is of great value to be as effective as possible within this selection process. especially, because this approach can prevent for several unpleasant situations afterwards during the operation-time (life-cycle) of the ppp-project. in this way, a proper handling of business-culture 's influence can save clients and other stakeholders involved (society) a large amount of possible conflicts (claims, etc.) afterwards. originality/value - the proposed approach contributes to a better understanding of project-processes and its stakeholders (i.e. especially the -foreseen -project-participants). current selection-processes still do not adopt a structured approach for incorporating past-performance behavioral data/experiences; so structuring and using them properly can result in more successful ppp-projects within a fast growing international ppp-market.
construction_management	as construction projects have become larger and more complex, they develop different features than smaller or traditional projects, which characterize them as complex systems. still, construction engineering and management (cem) researchers have mostly relied on traditional approaches to investigate complex management problems, which might produce misleading results. this paper introduces agent-based modeling and simulation (abms) as a research method, and addresses how it could be applied to cem research. with an illustrative example of the application of abms to cem research, the theoretical background as well as the design, development, and test processes of abms are presented. we then made a recommendation on the promising research subjects in cem area to which abms could be suitably applied.
construction_management	automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. such information extraction (ie) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. natural language processing (nlp) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. this paper proposes a semantic, rule-based nlp approach for automated ie from construction regulatory documents. the proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based ie rules and conflict resolution (cr) rules in ie. a variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the ie and cr rules. phrase structure grammar (psg)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. an ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). the proposed ie algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 international building code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.

construction_management	one of the ways of making pavements with high quality is making some amendments in consumption bitumen so that the final asphalt mixture would have a higher quality in order to use in the tropics. the aim of this study is study on sbs polymer in order to modify of the properties of polymer modified bitumen has been to sbs bitumen characteristics. the lack of bitumen qualifications modification led to procedural failures caused by the heat of the tropics regions. obviously, bitumen characteristics modification cause to produce higher quality asphalts in order to use of pavement in tropical regions. with producing this kind of asphalts, maintenance costs of highways will be reduced. in this research, was attempted various methods to remove these drawbacks. technical assessment to evaluate the effect of sbs polymer on bitumen properties include two types of tests bitumen tests and asphalt tests. in this research comparison the effects of the polymer amount on penetration, softness and density degree of bitumen and also asphalt was examined. since it is currently challenging to perfectly achieve all expected polymer modified bitumen properties at the same time, some compromised recommendations are given in this paper, among which greatly enhancing the properties with an acceptably high cost, significantly reducing the cost with relatively poor properties and their combinations.

suspension_bridge	objectives-to assess the prevalence of sonographic visualization of the rotator cable in patients with symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears and asymptomatic controls and to correlate rotator cable visualization with tear size, muscular fatty infiltration and atrophy, and the functional outcome in the patients with rotator cuff tears. methods-fifty-seven patients with rotator cuff tears and 30 asymptomatic volunteers underwent shoulder sonography for prospective assessment of the rotator cable and rotator cuff tear and responded to 2 functional outcome questionnaires (shortened disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand [quickdash] and constant). in the patients with rotator cuff tears, appropriate tests were used to correlate rotator cable visualization with the tear size, functional outcome, muscular fatty infiltration, and atrophy. results-the patients with rotator cuff tears included 25 women and 32 men (mean age, 57 years; range, 39-67 years), and the volunteers included 13 women and 17 men (mean age, 56 years; range, 35-64 years). the rotator cable was identified in 77% (23 of 30) of controls and 23% (13 of 57) of patients with rotator cuff tears. in the patients, nonvisualization of the rotator cable correlated with larger tears (p < 0.001) and higher grades of supraspinatus atrophy (p = .049) and fatty infiltration (p = .022). there was no significant correlation with functional outcome scores (quickdash, p = .989; constant, p = .073) or infraspinatus fatty infiltration (p = .065). conclusions-nonvisualization of the rotator cable was more prevalent in patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tears than asymptomatic controls and was associated with a larger tear size and greater supraspinatus fatty infiltration and atrophy. diligent assessment of the supraspinatus muscle should be done in patients with rotator cuff tears without a visible rotator cable, as the integrity of these anatomic structures may be interdependent.
suspension_bridge	higher-mode vertical vortex-induced vibrations (viv) have been observed on several steel box-girder suspension bridges where different vertical modes are selectively excited in turn with wind velocity in accordance with the strouhal law. understanding the relationship of viv amplitudes for different modes of vibration is very important for wind-resistant design of long-span box-girder suspension bridges. in this study, the basic rectangular cross-section with side ratio of b/d=6 is used to investigate the effect of different modes on viv amplitudes by section model tests. the section model is flexibly mounted in wind tunnel with a variety of spring constants for simulating different modes of vibration and the non-dimensional vertical amplitudes are determined as a function of reduced velocity u/fd. two 'lock-in' ranges are observed at the same onset reduced velocities of approximately 4.8 and 9.4 for all cases. the second 'lock-in' range, which is induced by the conventional vortex shedding, consistently gives larger responses than the first one and the sc-normalized maximum non-dimensional responses are almost the same for different spring constants. the first 'lock-in' range where the vibration frequency is approximately two times the vortex shedding frequency is probably a result of super-harmonic resonance or the ""frequency demultiplication"". the main conclusion drawn from the section model study, central to the higher-mode viv of suspension bridges, is that the viv amplitude for different modes is the same provided that the sc number for these modes is identical.
suspension_bridge	combining the substructure finite element model updating method with the response surface model updating method, one novelty finite element model updating method of bridge structure is proposed for updating the finite element model of a certain combined cable-stayed suspension model bridge. in light of specific configurations and mechanical features for combined cable-stayed suspension bridge, substructures are partitioned and the updating design parameters which need to be updated are preselected. on the basis of the variance analysis, the updating parameters are determined by the parameter significance test. samples of updating parameters are obtained by the homogeneous design method, and the corresponding structural responses are obtained by finite element analysis, finally the response surface model for each updating parameter is fitted and verified. the jointed objective function with the linear combination of fitness functions based on the natural frequency and the static displacement are introduced, and experimental data of the static and dynamic testing for the model bridge is adopted to update the design parameters by the genetic algorithm, then the minimization of the discrepancies between the measurements and the finite element model updating results are achieved. the experimental results show that the updated parameters obtained from the proposed method are reasonable and having a clear physical meaning, and the finite element model of bridge structure can be updated effectively by the proposed finite element model updating method.

suspension_bridge	precast hollow core slabs (hcs) are technically advanced products in the precast concrete industry, widely used in the last years due to their versatility, their multipurpose potential and their low cost. using three dimensional fem (finite element method) elements, this study focuses on the stresses induced by the prestressing of steel. in particular the investigation of the spalling crack formation that takes place during prestressing is carried out, since it is important to assure the appropriate necessary margins concerning such stresses. in fact, spalling cracks may spread rapidly towards the web, leading to the detachment of the lower part of the slab. a parametric study takes place, capable of evaluating the influence of the tendon position and of the web width on the spalling stress. consequently, after an extensive literature review on the topic of soft computing, an optimization of the hcs is performed by means of genetic algorithms coupled with 3-d fem models.
suspension_bridge	with global climate and environment deterioration, the desertification is getting worse and the phenomenon of wind-sand flow frequently occurs in many areas. hangers of suspension bridges may suffer the impact from wind-sand flow and be damaged. in this study, the riding-type hangers with four strands which are the commonly used hanger of long-span suspension bridges are taken as an example to investigate the influence of wind-sand flow on the hangers. the aerodynamic interference effect can occur among the four strands under the action of wind-sand flow. in order to explore the influence of wind-sand flow on the hangers, the wind-sand flow field around the riding-type hangers of a long-span suspension bridge is simulated within the fluent software on the basis of the numerical simulation of computational fluid dynamics. the pressure and velocity contour, aerostatic coefficients and forces produced by the wind-sand flow under different wind attack angle and volume fractions of sand phase are analyzed from the simulation. results indicate that the forces exerted by the wind-sand flow on riding-type hangers are greater than the forces exerted only by wind. in the wind and wind-sand flow field, the drag and lift coefficients of the front two strands of hangers exhibit minor changes with increasing wind attack angle, whereas those of the back two strands increase first and then decrease to a small value. the volume fraction of the sand phase has an insignificant effect on the drag and lift coefficients, but has a significant effect on the force exerted on the hanger, and the force exerted on the hangers multiplies when the volume fraction of the sand phase multiplies. the results lay a theoretical foundation for the corrosion fatigue analysis of riding-type hangers for large-span suspension bridges under the action of wind-sand flow.
geotextile	frictionless plain bearing for post-tensioned slab on ground a new method for building large concrete slabs on ground on a frictionless support was developed at vienna university of technology. an austrian patent for this method was granted and an international patent application has been filed. the feasibility of this new method has been demonstrated in large field tests on concrete slab strips with a length of 60 m, a width of 1.0 m and a thickness of 30 cm. the frictionless support is obtained by first placing an air-tight membrane, then a geotextile and at last a second air-tight membrane on the ground where the concrete slab is to be built. in the next step the membranes are sealed at the boundary. after casting the slab on top of the second membrane, low air pressure is applied in the clearance between the two membranes. this clearance is created by the geotextile. shortening of the slab due to the loss of hydration heat, early shrinkage and post-tensioning is possible without causing friction forces between slab and subsoil because the self-weight of the slab is balanced by the applied air pressure.
geotextile	the water chemistry and economics of a commercial-scale inland marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (imta) system was investigated. the system used a combination of a constructed wetland, sand filter followed by a constructed wetland, and geotextile bags to treat solids waste. this study is a demonstration of a zero-discharge system where commercial nursery production of wetland plants was combined with a marine ras to treat saline solid waste. total suspended solids (tss), chemical oxygen demand (cod), total nitrogen (tn), and total phosphorus (tp) concentrations were measured. plant and soil samples were analyzed for tn and tp. a significant (p < 0.05) difference in the effluent concentrations was not found. the variability inherent in a commercial-scale system made it difficult to isolate the individual efficiencies of the three treatment systems. production of wetland plants was critical for aiding nutrient removal by facilitating aggregation of solids and providing conditions for denitrification. on average the nitrate concentration decreased over time due to the denitrification occurring in the plant beds. water samples were analyzed for dissolved metals: mn, ni, se, sr, cd, li, hg, mo, fe, b, cu, pb, zn, la, ca, k, and mg; mn and fe showed a gradual increase in concentration over time. this imta system successfully produced florida pompano, and the fish waste and uneaten feed provided enough nutrients to produce multiple cohorts of wetland plants over a two-year period. an economic analysis indicated that after one year of production the system would produce a profit, but the production of florida pompano alone would not result in a positive net return. the sales of wetland plants were necessary for the system to break-even and ultimately produce a profit for the production facility in sarasota, fl.

geotextile	polyacrylamide-based conditioners have become an essential component of the geotextile tube dewatering processes. these conditioners act as flocculants, binding fine sediments through charge neutralisation and particle bridging, resulting in faster dewatering rates and greater retention of fine sediments. recently, however, momentum has begun to shift towards the use of sustainable materials. natural flocculants, such as starch and chitosan, are increasingly being tested as an attractive alternative to synthetic polymers. researchers have identified a number of natural flocculants, polysaccharides and polysaccharide derivatives in particular, as candidates for dewatering applications. in this study, the dewatering performance of four soils (sand, silt, kaolin, and natural organic soil) was evaluated with synthetic and starch-based flocculants. dewatering performance of five cationic starch-based polymers with charge densities ranging from 0.38 to 0.94 meq/g and molecular weights ranging from 5 x 10(4) g/mol to 5 x 10(5) g/mol were compared with five cationic acrylamide-based polymers with charge densities that ranged from 1 to 3.05 meq/g and molecular weights that ranged from 10 x 10(6) to 20 x 10(6) /mol. the cationic polyacrylamides and cationic starches were selected with a wide range of charge densities and molecular weights in order to study the effect of flocculant properties on the flocculation and dewatering performance of the used soils. the optimum dose of each flocculant was determined using the jar test. additionally, pressure filtration tests were performed to determine the dewatering rates and filter cake properties. test results showed that the flocculants' properties, especially charge density, have a significant effect on the optimum dose. the optimum doses of the cationic starch flocculants were two to four times higher than the cationic polyacrylamide polymers. additionally, it was found that the cationic starches were more effective in minimising the turbidity of the natural organic soils than the cationic polyacrylamides. finally, the cationic starches allowed for a 900% increase in dewatering rate in comparison with the soil samples that were tested without flocculants.
geotextile	the benefit of using stone columns in low strength soil has been proved as an efficient method to improve load-carrying characteristics of shallow footings. the stone column bearing capacity mainly depends on circumferential confinement providing by native soft soils. in this paper, some large body laboratory tests were performed on stone columns with diameters of 60, 80, and 100 mm and a length to diameter of 5. both unreinforced and encased geotextile reinforced stone columns were tested. vertical encased stone column (vesc) have been considered to investigate the effect of reinforcement on the footing load-carrying characteristics. the main objective of this research is to compare the effectiveness of vertical encapsulating of stone columns in the same conditions for various stone column diameters. in addition, tests on groups of stone columns with 60 mm diameter were carried out to investigate the effect of presence of neighboring columns on the reference loaded stone column. results show that the stone column bearing capacity increases by using vertical reinforcing material. with increasing the length and strength of reinforcement in vesc, the stone column bearing capacity increases. in addition, the stress concentration ratio of columns also increases. moreover, the lateral bulging decreases by using geotextiles. numerical analysis based on finite element method (fem) was also conducted to study scale effects on small stone columns tested and how to expand reinforcement effectiveness to large reinforced stone columns.

stealth_technology	polyaniline powder in nanosize has been synthesized by chemical oxidative route. xrd, ftir, and tem were used to characterize the polyaniline powder. crytallite size was estimated from xrd profile and also ascertained by tem in the range of 15 to 20 nm. the composite absorbers have been prepared by mixing different ratios of polyaniline into procured polyurethane (pu) binder. the complex permittivity (epsilon'-j epsilon"") and complex permeability (mu'-j mu '') were measured in x-band (8.2-12.4 ghz) using agilent network analyzer (model pna e8364b) and its software module 85071 (version 'e'). measured values of these parameters were used to determine the reflection loss at different frequencies and sample thicknesses, based on a model of a single layered plane wave absorber backed by a perfect conductor. an optimized polyaniline/pu ratio of 3:1 has given a minimum reflection loss of -30 db (99.9% power absorption) at the central frequency 10 ghz and the bandwidth (full width at half minimum) of 4.2 ghz over whole x-band (8.2 to 12.4 ghz) in a sample thickness of 3.0 mm. the prepared composites can be fruitfully utilized for suppression of electromagnetic interference (emi) and reduction of radar signatures (stealth technology).
stealth_technology	blends of ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (epdm) and polyaniline (pani) doped with dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid were prepared by mechanical mixing in an internal mixer at various compositions and times. reflectivity characteristics of the blends in the 8-12-ghz range were investigated with the naval research laboratory arch method. the microwave absorption behavior was affected by the processing time and blend composition. the correlation of reflectivity measurements with morphology observations made with scanning electron microscopy suggested that the distribution and concentration of the pani phase within the epdm matrix altered the wave-matter interactions. the radar-absorbing materials prepared in this work showed broadband behavior with microwave radiation absorption of up to 90%.

stealth_technology	in this paper, we propose a three-dimensional metamaterial absorber based on tailored resistive film patch array. the numerical results show that a broadband abs orption more than 90% can be achieved from 58.6 to 91.4 ghz for either transverse electric or magnetic polarization wave at normal incidence. and the e-field, surface current and power loss density distributions in the absorber are investigated to explain the physical mechanism of high absorption. in addition, the absorption efficiency of oblique incidence is also elucidated. according to the analysis of the e-field and power loss density distributions, we explain the absorption differences between te and tm mode at oblique incidence. the proposed metamaterial absorber will pave the way for practical applications, such as sensing, imaging and stealth technology. importantly, the design idea has the ability to be extended to terahertz, infrared and optical region.

stealth_technology	this band electromagnetic hybrid absorber (ha) for the radar cross section (rcs) reduction of antennas. the proposed ha is based on the design of a metamaterial structure coated with the synthesized dielectric absorber material. the dielectric filler based composite absorber is fabricated by optimizing weight percentage of graphite and glass microballoon powders mixed into an epoxy medium. the proposed ha shows minimum-10 db reflection loss (rl) in the 6-12 ghz frequency region having maximum absorption of 99.56% (-20 db rl) at 9.26 ghz. the proposed ha is ultimately loaded onto a wide band antenna in order to reduce the in-band rcs of the antenna. the simulated and the experimental results show remarkable rcs reduction of the antenna over the full operating frequency range. it is also observed that the antenna characteristics, e.g., the gain and the radiation pattern remain almost preserved after loading the antenna with ha. the significant rcs reduction capability of the proposed ha shows that it has the potential applications for rf stealth technology.
stealth_technology	a low-emissive pigment of al/sio2/fe2o3/feo/fe-4[fe(cn)(6)](3)/cr2o3/cr (mas) was prepared by chemical deposition method. the camouflage characteristics of the coated fabric with paint mixed with mas, binder and other auxiliary in the thermal infrared (ir 8 similar to 14 mu m) and the optical (0.38 similar to 1.2 mu m) region, was studied by emissivity tester, visible light camera and thermal infrared imager. the results show that the mas pigment has low emissivity and optical camouflage effectiveness compared with the al/sio2 pigment. particularly, the mas pigment is in green by depositing metal oxide, ferrocyanide and pure metal on the surface of al/sio2. the optical reflectance spectrum of coated fabric was similar to the natural grass. furthermore, the surface emissivity of the coated fabric reached 0.51 in the ir region. the thermography of the coated fabric with 4 wt% mas was similar to the natural grass. it can conclude that the coated fabric can perfectly imitate grass background.
solar_energy	the transition metal-oxide thin films of wo3 have been prepared by thermal evaporation at a low deposition rate. the material characterization shows that the thin films have stoichiometric composition and the tungsten ions were fully oxidised into w6+. the surface of the wo3 thin films became smoother when the thickness increased. the results show that the deposition of wo3 thin film follows island growth. the flatband voltage of wo3/si was extracted. the values on n-si and p-si were about 0.75 ev and 0 ev, respectively. it was also found that large amounts of negative charges were accumulated at the interface of wo3/n-si because of electron transfer.

solar_energy	aerodynamic and aeroelastic flutter-driven triboelectric nanogenerators are successfully used to harvest broadband airflow energy. the unit component of the flutter membrane consists of thin, free-standing al foil electrodes covered on both sides with electrospun poly(vinyl chloride) nanofiber-structured mats, which provide advantageous tribo-surfaces specifically to increase the friction area. the airflow-induced triboelectric power generation from a single unit of the flutter-membrane-based triboelectric nanogenerator (fm-teng) was up to 0.33 mu w under a mild airflow condition. the use of a multi-layered triboelectric nanogenerator, fabricated by simply stacking the single units, can improve the output performance of the device. in a separate configuration, we designed a novel fm-teng structure by mounting an aeroelastic flutter-belt adapted for use with a fluttermembrane energy-harvester. a rubber belt, which was sandwiched between the flutter membranes, created a rapid periodic vibrational mode via aeroelastic fluttering, synergistically harvesting triboelectric energy with the application of a constant air stream through the closed channel of the fm-teng. thus, our flutter-membranebased approach creates a sustainable and cost-efficient energy harvesting system for collecting broadband airflow energy. furthermore, the aerodynamic and aeroelastic fm-teng have great potential to be used in numerous areas of self-powered electronic systems and in-situ wireless sensor applications for automobiles or aircraft.
solar_energy	the structure of cobalt oxide (coox) nanoparticles dispersed on rutile tio2 (r-tio2) was characterized by x-ray diffraction, uv-vis-nir diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. the coox, nanoparticles were loaded onto r-tio2 by an impregnation method from an aqueous solution containing co(no3)(2)center dot 6h(2)o followed by heating in air. modification of the r-tio2 with 2.0 wt % co followed by heating at 423 k for 1 h resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity with good reproducibility. structural analyses revealed that the activity of this photocatalyst depended strongly on the generation of co3o4 nanoclusters with an optimal distribution. these nanoclusters are thought to interact with the r-tio2 surface, resulting in visible light absorption and active sites for water oxidation.
solar_energy	besides their application in photovoltaics, semiconductor solar-energy-materials can be directly employed as photocatalysts of hydrogen fuel production using sunlight and water feedstock. in this paper, through a facile hydrothermal route, we synthesized a cuo-zno pn junction nanocomposite in the absence and presence of carbon nanotube (cnt), and applied them in a water photosplitting setup to evolve hydrogen gas. the investigation revealed that in the presence of cnt, the photocatalyst performance increases significantly becomes approximately twice. the superior activity witnessed here for the ternary nanocomposite (cuo-zno/ cnt) was explained in terms of the ability of cnt to enlarge the photocatalyst surface area, enhance the absorption of photons, and prohibit the recombination of photogenerated e/h pairs. finally, quantum yield and energy efficiency analyses were performed on both binary and ternary nanocomposite materials as well as on their semiconductor components, and the results were discussed in detail from physicochemical viewpoint.
solar_energy	adsorption-based cooling systems are becoming increasingly popular due to a continuous rise in the worldwide demand for refrigeration and air-conditioning. this study aims to enhance the cooling performance of a solar-powered adsorption chiller using a novel multi-walled carbon nanotube (mwcnt)/mil-100(fe) composite adsorbent. a numerically validated modeling approach has been employed to evaluate the coefficient of performance (cop) and specific cooling power (scp) for the two-bed adsorption chiller. for solar energy input, a flat-plate solar collector has been employed with three different configurations of glaze (a) single-glazed cover, (b) double-glazed cover, and (c) single-glazed cover with transparent insulation material. it has been observed that the mwcnt/mil-100(fe) composite adsorbent containing 6.1% mwcnts results in a maximum achievable cooling power of 455 wkri for the adsorption chiller. the proposed mwcnt/mil-100(fe) composite adsorbent can be considered as a successful potential replacement of the traditionally used silica gel- and zeolite-based adsorbents for use in the next generation of high-performance solar adsorption chillers.

remote_sensing	frequent human activity and rapid urbanization have led to an assortment of environmental issues. monitoring land-cover change is critical to efficient environmental management and urban planning. the current study had two objectives. the first was to compare pixel-based random forest (rf) and decision tree (dt) classifier methods and a support vector machine (svm) algorithm both in pixel-based and object-based approaches for classification of land-cover in a heterogeneous landscape for 2010. the second was to examine spatio-temporal land-cover change over the last two decades (1990-2010) using landsat data. this study found that the object-based svm classifier is the most accurate with an overall classification accuracy of 93.54% and a kappa value of 0.88. a post-classification change detection algorithm was used to determine the trend of change between land-cover classes. the most significant change from 1990 to 2010 was caused by the expansion of built-up areas. in addition to the net changes, the rate of annual change for each phenomenon was calculated to obtain a better understanding of the process of change. between 1990 and 2010, an average of 4.53% of lands turned to the built-up annually and there was an annual decrease of about 0.81% in natural land. if the current trend of change continues, regardless of the actions of sustainable development, drastic declines in natural areas will ensue. the results of this study can be a valuable baseline for land-cover managers in the region to better understand the current situation and adopt appropriate strategies for management of land-cover.
remote_sensing	detecting surface coal mining areas (scmas) using remote sensing data in a timely and an accurate manner is necessary for coal industry management and environmental assessment. we developed an approach to effectively extract scmas from remote sensing imagery based on object-oriented decision trees (oodt). this oodt approach involves three main steps: object-oriented segmentation, calculation of spectral characteristics, and extraction of scmas. the advantage of this approach lies in its effective integration of the spectral and spatial characteristics of scmas so as to distinguish the mining areas (i.e., the extracting areas, stripped areas, and dumping areas) from other areas that exhibit similar spectral features (e.g., bare soils and built-up areas). we implemented this method to extract scmas in the eastern part of ordos city in inner mongolia, china. our results had an overall accuracy of 97.07% and a kappa coefficient of 0.80. as compared with three other spectral information-based methods, our oodt approach is more accurate in quantifying the amount and spatial pattern of scmas in dryland regions.

remote_sensing	deformable-part-based model (dpm) has shown great success in object detection in recent years. however, its performance will degrade on partially occluded objects and is even worse on largely occluded objects in real remote sensing applications. to address this problem, a novel partial configuration object model (pcm) is developed in this paper. compared to conventional single-layer dpms, an extra partial configuration layer, which is composed of partial configurations defined according to possible occlusion patterns, is introduced in pcm to block the transmission of occlusion impact. during detection, each hypothesis from a partial configuration layer will infer the entire object based on spatial interrelationship and final detection results are obtained from the fusion of these possible entire objects using a weighted continuous clustering method. as pcm makes a better compromise between the deformation modeling flexibility of small parts and the discriminative shape-capturing capability of large dpm, its performance on occluded object detection will be improved. moreover, occlusion states of detected objects can be inferred with the intermediate results of our model. experimental results on multiple high-resolution remote sensing image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
remote_sensing	purpose of review the rapid development of remote sensing technology hasmade dense 3d data available from airborne laser scanning and recently also photogrammetric point clouds. this paper reviews methods for extraction of individual trees from 3d data and their applications in forestry and ecology. recent findings methods for analysis of 3d data at tree level have been developed since the turn of the century. the first algorithms were based on 2d surface models of the upper contours of tree crowns. these methods are robust and provide information about the trees in the top-most canopy. there are also methods that use the complete 3d data. however, development of these 3d methods is still needed to include use of geometric properties. to detect a large fraction of the tallest trees, a surface model method generally gives the best results, but detection of smaller trees below the top-most canopy requires methods utilizing the whole point cloud. several new sensors are now available with capability to describe the upper part of the canopy, which can be used to frequently update vegetation maps. highly sensitive laser photo detectors have become available for civilian applications, which will enable acquisition of high-resolution 3d laser data for large areas to much lower costs. summary methods for itc delineation from 3d data provide information about a large fraction of the trees, but there is still a challenge to make optimal use of the information from whole point cloud. newly developed sensors might make itc methods cheaper and feasible for large areas.
remote_sensing	edge extraction from high spatial resolution (hsr) remotely sensed images is one of the essential tasks for image segmentation and object identification. we present an optimal gabor-based edge detection method which mainly focuses on selecting optimal parameters, including central frequency and spectrum scale, for gabor filter. the central frequency is automatically optimized by phase randomization and the human visual system-based structure similarity index. next, the optimal spectrum scale is determined based on two-dimensional power spectrum density. the edge detection method is comprehensively discussed in the analysis of parameter sensitivity, overall performance, and comparative tests with several widely used methods. qualitative and quantitative experimental studies, performed on six test images with various spatial resolution, show that the proposed method provides a promising solution to edge detection from hsr remotely sensed images.

rainwater_harvesting	microcatchment is a technique for collecting, storing and conserving local surface runoff in order to grow trees/shrubs. in this system, runoff water is generated on a plot and stored in the soil during runoff events, and trees/shrubs may utilize this water during the next dry season. microcatchments have relatively small runoff generation areas (from dozens to hundreds sq. m) and are cheap and simple to implement their collection area is usually a small depression located nearby the runoff generating area in which one or a few trees/shrubs may be planted due to the short overland flow path runoff generation is efficient and even short low intensity storms may generate runoff. the drawback is however that due to the small size of the generating area small volumes of water are conveyed to the storage plots. another drawback is susceptibility of the augmented water to evaporation. the main objective of present research presented hereafter was to estimate the effect the depth of the depression has on the efficiency of the water conservation in the soil profile. in the present study the storage plots were circular pits and the effect their depth had on evaporative losses and water distribution were studied. the results clearly show that the depth of the pit significantly affects evaporative water losses. the losses were separately computed for the soil cylinder whose upper surface is the bottom of the pit and for the surrounding shell. no differences between treatments were evident for losses from the inner cylinder. significant differences in water losses were however observed for the surrounding shell where the shallow pits losing as much as six times more than the deeper pits.

rainwater_harvesting	even though drought is one of the most common features affecting rainfed agriculture, it is necessary to consider it as an extreme climatological event that requires different types of alleviating strategies for overcoming it. the risk involved in successful cultivation of crops depends on the nature of drought (chronic and contingent), its probable duration, and frequency of occurrence within the season. these aberrations are expected to further increase in future. a significant fall in food production is often noticed with increase in intensity or extension in duration of drought prevalence. drought affects not only the food production at farm level but also the national economy and overall food security. location-specific rainfed technologies are available to cope with different drought situations. much of the research done in rainfed agriculture in india relates to conservation of soil & rainwater and to drought proofing. the key technologies for drought mitigation are in situ moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting and recycling, resilient crops and cropping systems including contingency crop plans, foliar sprays, and integrated farming systems. however, drought preparedness and real time implementation of contingency measures at field level needs well structured institutional support for farmers with strong government policy and convergence among various institutions. ministry, of agriculture, government of india, needs to facilitate the convergence process of various government schemes such as mgnrega, rkvy, mega seed project, nfsm, nhm, iwmp, soil health schemes etc. for drought preparedness. national mission for sustainable agriculture (nmsa), one among the missions under the prime minister national action plan for climate change (napcc) may take a lead role in implementation of contingency, by inclusion of this activity in state action plans (sap) with a dedicated nodal institution/officers and budget provision.
rainwater_harvesting	rainwater retention tank systems are designed to capture rainwater from roof surfaces and store it as an effective water supply for later use. such systems are known as rsd (rainfall-storage-discharge) systems because they involve three processes: rainfall, storage, and discharge. here we develop a design method for each process and use the water balance for the tank to estimate the control effect for a given volume of rainwater tank retention. we also develop an algorithm for calculating the nonlinear behavior of the stored water volume in the rainwater tank and the simulated flow variation of the tank. the simulated results are represented in the form of tank capacity-peak outflow curves. in the case that a storage tank of 10 m(3) per 100-m(2) area is installed for the roof surface of all buildings in a small area, the results show that the peak flow and total outflow are reduced by up to 20% and 18%, respectively. thus, rsd systems are useful for controlling runoff from rooftops and effective in reducing the final discharge rate of an urban drainage system.
rainwater_harvesting	water reuse schemes in urban water system are assessed in this paper against a number of hydraulic performance indicators. a city metabolism model, watermet2, is used to evaluate the performance of water reuse schemes. a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is employed to identify pareto optimal solutions for the following three objectives: resilience, reliability and total cost. the demonstration of the suggested approach on a real-world case study show the importance of using the resilience index for determining the appropriate schemes. the results suggest, in the case analysed here, the rainwater-harvesting scheme plays a significant role for improvement of resilience index.
