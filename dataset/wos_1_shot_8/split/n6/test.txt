attention	the use of information and communication technologies (icts) in developing regions has gained momentum due to their increasing affordability, particularly in rural areas where other ict infrastructures for information management are often non-existent. giving potential technology users, the opportunity to actively engage and contribute to the design of an artefact increases adoption and sustainable use. in this paper, we illustrate our application of community-based codesign (cbcd) that led to the development of an ict intervention to support water management in three rural communities in uganda. the community-based system helps water managers to track water users, payments and expenditures in a bid to improve transparency, accountability and trust. we present research learnings of the method and how engagement with rural communities can be improved through the use of intermediaries and paying more attention to community values as well as exercising ethics of reciprocity in community-based ict initiatives.
prenatal_development	objective. the objective of our study was to retrospectively determine the prevalence and image findings of extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition with os sustentaculum, a type of talocalcaneal coalition that does not appear in current classification systems, in patients with an imaging diagnosis of foot coalition. materials and methods. this study was performed using a database query of radiology reports of ankle and foot ct or mri examinations performed from august 2001 to november 2013. eighty-one patients were identified through a keyword search of the database for ""talocalcaneal coalition,"" ""tarsal coalition,"" ""coalition,"" or ""os sustentaculum."" imaging features of ct or mri findings were evaluated. chart review was used to identify demographic information. results. extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition with os sustentaculum was diagnosed in 13 patients (nine men, four women), which represents a prevalence of 16.0% (13/81) in all foot coalitions and 24.1% (13/54) in all talocalcaneal coalitions. four of 13 patients underwent surgical resection, and histology was obtained in three patients. nine patients who had no history of trauma were symptomatic and all patients with bone marrow edema at the coalition sites on mri (n = 5) were also symptomatic. coexisting extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition with os sustentaculum and intraarticular talocalcaneal coalition were observed in 11 of 13 patients. conclusion. the os sustentaculum is a component of extraarticular talocalcaneal coalitions and as such is usually related to the presence of symptoms. if a patient with an os sustentaculum has symptoms in the medial talocalcaneal joint area, an extraarticular talocalcaneal coalition related to the os sustentaculum should be considered.
eating_disorders	previous research exploring cognitive biases in bulimia nervosa suggests that attentional biases occur for both food-related and body-related cues. individuals with bulimia were compared to non-bulimic controls on an emotional-stroop task which contained both food-related and body-related cues. results indicated that bulimics (but not controls) demonstrated a cognitive bias for both food-related and body related cues. however, a discrepancy between the two cue-types was observed with body-related cognitive biases showing the most robust effects and food-related cognitive biases being the most strongly associated with the severity of the disorder. the results may have implications for clinical practice as bulimics with an increased cognitive bias for food-related cues indicated increased bulimic disorder severity.

media_violence	several longitudinal studies and meta-analytic reviews have demonstrated that exposure to violent media is linked to aggression over time. however, evidence on effective interventions to reduce the use of violent media and promote critical viewing skills is limited. the current study examined the efficacy of an intervention designed to reduce the use of media violence and aggression in adolescence, covering a total period of about 12 months. a sample of 683 7th and 8th graders in germany (50.1% girls) were assigned to two conditions: a 5-week intervention and a no-intervention control group. measures of exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior were obtained about 3 months prior to the intervention (t1) and about 7 months post-intervention (t2). the intervention group showed a significantly larger decrease in the use of violent media from t1 to t2 than the control group. participants in the intervention group also scored significantly lower on self-reported aggressive behavior (physical aggression and relational aggression) at t2 than those in the control group, but the effect was limited to those with high levels of initial aggression. this effect was mediated by an intervention-induced decrease in the normative acceptance of aggression. no gender differences in program efficacy were found. the results show that a 5-week school-based intervention can produce changes in the use of media violence, aggressive norms, and behaviors sustained over several months.
social_cognition	we examined 261 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds' (147 in hong kong, 114 in the usa) evaluations of hypothetical scenarios where mothers sought to control personal domain events by prohibiting, persuading, or shaming the child. the scenarios also varied in their description of personal events as either essential or peripheral to the self. compliance was endorsed least (and emotions attributed to actors were most positive) when mothers gently persuaded and endorsed most (with emotion attributions most negative) when mothers prohibited personal choices. evaluations of compliance and associated emotions for shaming fell in-between. when mothers were described as gently persuading, young children (and chinese children) gave priority to personal choices more when acts were described as essential rather than peripheral to the self, based on personal reasons. when mothers were described as shaming, noncompliance increased with age, along with pragmatic justifications for choices, particularly when events were essentialized. positive emotions in response to shaming also increased with age, but differentially for chinese and american children.
child_abuse	background: the texas department of family and protective services (dfps) created a statewide network of child abuse pediatricians working at 6 academic centers in 2006. methods: case data for the period 9/1/2012-8/31/2014 were reviewed for child demographics, risk factors, physician determinations, injury descriptors, and information made available to the physician. results: 8061 of 410,315 dfps cases (2%) were referred during the period. network utilization rates ranged from 7.5% in counties served by san antonio to 1.4% in austin-served counties. cases from outlying counties were less likely to involve older children. african american children were over-represented in referrals, and caucasian and asian children were underrepresented. prevalent risk factors included prior dfps history, single parent-household, mental illness, substance abuse, and domestic violence. network providers found no or only nonspecific evidence for maltreatment in 45% of cases. determinations were hindered by poor quality photographs in 188 cases and inadequate skeletal surveys in 121. insufficient information precluded case completion for 65 cases of children <2 years. conclusions: our data indicate that child abuse centers in texas are underutilized, and there are practice differences with respect to medical referrals across different regions. our findings concerning ethnic differences and risk factors are consistent with national trends. the problems of inadequate photographs and case information may improve with better training of workers; the issue of poor quality skeletal surveys requires further study. standard dfps criteria for referrals to child abuse pediatricians should mitigate some of the problems identified by this study.

schizophrenia	schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder that affects about 1 % of the population. dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (dtnbp1 or dysbindin) is one of the research domain constructs (rdoc) associated with cognition and is significantly reduced in the brain of schizophrenia patients. to further understand the molecular underpinnings of pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we have performed microarray analyses of the hippocampi from dysbindin knockout mice, and found that genes involved in the lipogenic pathway are suppressed. moreover, we discovered that maturation of a master transcriptional regulator for lipid synthesis, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp1) is induced by neuronal activity, and is required for induction of the immediate early gene arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein), necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory. we found that nuclear srebp1 is dramatically reduced in dysbindin-1 knockout mice and postmortem brain tissues from human patients with schizophrenia. furthermore, activity-dependent maturation of srebp1 as well as arc expression were attenuated in dysbindin-1 knockout mice, and these deficits were restored by an atypical antipsychotic drug, clozapine. together, results indicate an important role of dysbindin-1 in neuronal activity induced srebp1 and arc, which could be related to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
attention	the recent development in nanotechnology resulted in growing of various nanoplate like structures. high attention was devoted to graphene sheet nanostructure, which enforced the scientist to start developing various theoretical models to investigate its physical properties. magnetic field effects on nanoplates, especially graphene sheets, have also attracted a considerable attention of the scientific community. here, by using the nonlocal theory, we examine the influence of in-plane magnetic field on the viscoelastic orthotropic multi-nanoplate system (vomnps) embedded in a viscoelastic medium. we derive the system of m partial differential equations describing the free transverse vibration of vomnps under the uniaxial in-plane magnetic field using the eringen 's nonlocal elasticity and kirchhoffs plate theory considering the viscoelastic and orthotropic material properties of nanoplates. closed form solutions for complex natural frequencies are derived by applying the navier 's and trigonometric method for the case of simply supported nanoplates. the results obtained with analytical method are validated with the results obtained by using the numerical method. in addition, numerical examples are given to show the effects of nonlocal parameter, internal damping, damping and stiffness of viscoelastic medium, rotary inertia and uniaxial in-plane magnetic force on the real and the imaginary parts of complex natural frequencies of vomnps. this study can be useful as a starting point for the research and design of nanoelectromechanical devices based on graphene sheets.

person_perception	psychological models of forming impressions about other people assume that this process is strictly connected with social categorization. therefore, it is clear that the results of many studies show that the evaluations of other people are based on two crucial and separable criteria: morality and competence. obviously morality and competence are two fundamental and distinct dimensions of the perception of politicians. these dimensions substantially influence voters' behavior toward politicians and are clearly visible both in the preelection polls as well as in the scientific analyses concerning forming the images of politicians. the evaluations of politicians on the morality and competence dimensions are central in forming the interpersonal attitudes in which the dominant elements are affect and respect toward the evaluated person. consequently, affect and respect are crucial factors in establishing the support of candidates for political offices. the morality and competence dimensions trigger the causal structures in the voter 's mind in which formed attitude creates affect and respect, which determine voting behavior.
prenatal_development	study question: is first trimester phthalate exposure associated with anogenital distance (agd), a biomarker of prenatal androgen exposure, in newborns? summary answer: concentrations of diethylhexyl phthalate (dehp) metabolites in first trimester maternal urine samples are inversely associated with agd in male, but not female, newborns. what is known already: agd is a sexually dimorphic measure reflecting prenatal androgen exposure. prenatal phthalate exposure has been associated with shorter male agd in multiple animal studies. prior human studies, which have been limited by small sample size and imprecise timing of exposure and/or outcome, have reported conflicting results. study design, size, duration: the infant development and the environment study (tides) is a prospective cohort study of pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in san francisco, ca, minneapolis, mn, rochester, ny and seattle, wa in 2010-2012. participants delivered 787 infants; 753 with complete data are included in this analysis. participants/materials, setting, methods: any woman over 18 years old who was able to read and write english (or spanish in ca), who was,13 weeks pregnant, whose pregnancy was not medically threatened and who planned to deliver in a study hospital was eligible to participate. analyses include all infants whose mothers provided a first trimester urine sample and who were examined at or shortly after birth. specific gravity (spg) adjusted concentrations of phthalate metabolites in first trimester urine samples were examined in relation to genital measurements. in boys (n = 366), we obtained two measures of anogenital distance (agd) (anoscrotal distance, or agd(as) and anopenile distance, agd(ap)) as well as penile width (pw). in girls (n = 373), we measured anofourchette distance (agd(af)) and anoclitoral distance (agd(ac)). we used multivariable regression models that adjusted for the infant 's age at exam, gestational age, weight-for-length z-score, time of day of urine collection, maternal age and study center. main results and the role of chance: three metabolites of dehp were significantly and inversely associated with both measures of boys' agd. associations (beta, 95% confidence interval (ci)) between agd(as) and (log(10)) spg-adjusted phthalate concentrations were: -1.12 (-2.16, -0.07) for mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (mehp), -1.43, (-2.49, -0.38) for mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (meohp), and -1.28 (-2.29,-0.27) for mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl (mehhp). associations were of similar magnitude for agd(ap). associations were weaker and not statistically significant for pw. no other phthalate metabolites were associated with any genital measurement in boys. nophthalate metabolites were associated with either agd measure in girls. limitations, reasons for caution: exposure assessment was based on a single first trimester urine sample, which may have introduced exposure misclassification. in addition, significant between-center differences suggest that this measurement is difficult to standardize. wider implications of the findings: our findings are consistent with multiple rodent studies and most human studies which were far smaller. the data we report here suggest that even at current low levels, environmental exposure to dehp can adversely affect male genital development resulting in reproductive tract changes that may impact reproductive health later in life. these findings have important implications for public policy since most pregnant women are exposed to this ubiquitous chemical.
depression	the intercalation of l-phenylalanate (lp) into the interlayer gallery of zinc layered hydroxide (zlh) has been successfully executed using a simple direct reaction method. the synthesised intercalation compound, zinc layered hydroxide-l-phenylalanate (zlh-lp), was characterised using pxrd, ftir, chns, icp-oes, tga/dtg, fesem and tem. the pxrd patterns of the intercalation compound demonstrate an intense and symmetrical peak, indicating a well-ordered crystalline layered structure. the appearance of an intercalation peak at a low angle of 20 with a basal spacing of 16.3 a, signifies the successful intercalation of the l-phenylalanate anion into the interlayer gallery of the host. the intercalation is also validated by ftir spectroscopy and chns elemental analysis. thermogravimetric analysis confirms that the zlh-lp intercalation compound has higher thermal stability than the pristine l-phenylalanine. the observed percentage of l-phenylalanate accumulated release varies in each release media, with 84.5%, 79.8%, 63.8% and 61.8% release in phosphate buffer saline (pbs) solution at ph 4.8, deionised water, pbs solution at ph 7.4 and naci solution, respectively. the release behaviour of lp from its intercalation compounds in deionised water and pbs solution at ph 4.8 follows pseudo second order, whereas in nacl solution and pbs solution at ph 7.4, it follows the parabolic diffusion model. this study shows that the synthesised zlh-lp intercalation compound can be used for the formation of a new generation of materials for targeted drug release with controlled release properties.
person_perception	ample research demonstrated that empathizing with someone in need promotes helping that person. two studies examined whether this effect of empathy on helping behavior holds across different emotional reactions expressed by a target in need. results of study 1 indicate that perspective taking with a sad needy target increased empathic concern which, in turn, fostered helping the individual. this relation was not found for participants taking the perspective of angry or disgusted needy targets. study 2 provides further support for the underlying mechanism of the results of study 1. perspective taking with a sad needy target increased empathizers' empathic concern because perception of target neediness was increased. again, this pattern was not found for perspective taking with an angry needy target. the findings correspond to theorizing on the role of emotions in person perception. hence, the current research provides insights regarding the boundary conditions of the empathy-helping association.
depression	this study investigated baseline client characteristics that predicted long-term treatment outcomes among adolescents referred from school and community sources and enrolled in usual care for conduct and substance use problems. predictor effects for multiple demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity), clinical (baseline symptom severity, comorbidity, family discord), and developmental psychopathology (behavioral dysregulation, depression, peer delinquency) characteristics were examined. participants were 205 adolescents (52 % male; mean age 15.7 years) from diverse backgrounds (59 % hispanic american, 21 % african american, 15 % multiracial, 6 % other) residing in a large inner-city area. as expected, characteristics from all three predictor categories were related to various aspects of change in externalizing problems, delinquent acts, and substance use at one-year follow-up. the strongest predictive effect was found for baseline symptom severity: youth with greater severity showed greater clinical gains. higher levels of co-occurring developmental psychopathology characteristics likewise predicted better outcomes. exploratory analyses showed that change over time in developmental psychopathology characteristics (peer delinquency, depression) was related to change in delinquent acts and substance use. implications for serving multiproblem adolescents and tailoring treatment plans in routine care are discussed.
prosocial_behavior	emotion regulation (er)one of the most important developmental tasks in early adolescencehas been proposed to mediate the relation between parenting and adolescents' psychosocial adjustment. the aim of this study was to examine the influence of parental psychological control and autonomy support on adolescents' problem and prosocial behavior (strengths and difficulties questionnaire), as well as to examine the mediating role of adolescents' anger regulation and the moderating effect of gender. we collected three-year longitudinal questionnaire data from n=923 parents and their (at first assessment) 9- to 13-year-old children. path-analysis results mainly support the mediating role of adolescents' adaptive and maladaptive anger regulation and suggest parental autonomy support to be beneficial for regulatory abilities and psychosocial adjustment, whereas the opposite was found for psychological control. gender differences were found for parent report data, but not for adolescent report data. practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
false_memories	psychologists have long assumed a connection between traumatic experience and psychological dissociation. this hypothesis is referred to as the trauma model of dissociation. in the past decade, a series of papers have been published that question this traditional causal link, proposing an alternative fantasy model of dissociation. in the present research, the relationship among dissociation, suggestibility, and fantasy proneness was examined. suggestibility was measured through the gudjonsson scale of interrogative suggestibility (gss) as well as an autobiographically based version of this measure based on the events of september 11, 2001. consistent with prior research and with the trauma model, dissociation correlated positively with trauma severity (r = .32, p < .01) and fantasy proneness (r = .60, p < .01). inconsistent with the fantasy model, dissociation did not correlate with the neutral form of the gss and correlated negatively (r = -.24, p < .05) with the trauma-focused form of this suggestibility measure. although some participants did become quite emotional during the procedure, the risk/benefit ratio was perceived by almost all participants to be positive, with more reactive individuals evaluating the procedure more positively. the results consistently support the trauma model of dissociation and fail to support the fantasy model of dissociation.
antisocial_personality_disorder	inmates with serious mental illness (smi) or antisocial personality disorder (apd) average higher rates of disciplinary infractions than inmates without these conditions. this study builds upon these lines of research by examining the relationships among smi and various types of prison misconduct, and whether these relationships are moderated by the presence of apd. smi was observed significantly related to annual rates of both violent and serious nonviolent misconduct. apd moderated the relationship between smi and serious nonviolent charges but not the relationship between smi and violent charges. implications for inmate management and classification practices aimed at ameliorating misconduct are discussed.
eating_disorders	background: individuals with restrictive eating disorders present with co-morbid psychiatric disorders and many attempt to control symptoms using strenuous exercises that increase caloric expenditure. yoga offers a safe avenue for the engagement in physical activity while providing an outlet for disease-associated symptoms. this study sought to examine use of yoga practice in an outpatient setting and its impact on anxiety, depression and body image disturbance in adolescents with eating disorders. methods: twenty adolescent girls were recruited from an urban eating disorders clinic who participated in weekly yoga classes at a local studio, in addition to standard multidisciplinary care. yoga instructors underwent training regarding this patient population. participants completed questionnaires focused on anxiety, depression and body image disturbance prior to the first class, and following completion of 6 and 12 classes. results: in participants who completed the study, a statistically significant decrease in anxiety, depression, and body image disturbance was seen, including: spielberger state anxiety mean scores decreased after the completion of 7-12 yoga classes [47 (95% ci 42-52) to 42 (95% ci 37-47), adj. p = 0.0316]; as did the anorexia nervosa scale [10 (95% ci 7-12) vs. 6 (95% ci 4-8), adj. p = .0004], scores on beck depression scales [18 (95% ci 15-22) to 10 (95% ci 614), adj. p =.0001], and weight and shape concern scores [16 (95% ci 12-20) to 12 (95% ci 8-16), adj. p = 0.0120] and [31 (95% ci 25-37) to 20 (95% ci 13-27), adj. p = 0.0034], respectively. no significant changes in body mass index were seen throughout the trial. conclusions: yoga practice combined with outpatient eating disorder treatment were shown to decrease anxiety, depression, and body image disturbance without negatively impacting weight. these preliminary results suggest yoga to be a promising adjunct treatment strategy, along with standard multidisciplinary care. however, whether yoga should be endorsed as a standard component of outpatient eating disorder treatment merits further study.
attention	natural gas direct injection (ngdi) engines have attracted attention of engine manufacturers because of low pollutant emissions and high efficiency. the jet structure and injector properties are control parameters for optimal mixture formation and stable combustion. here, the jet characteristics are investigated experimentally. the natural gas jet, injected through a multi-hole injector, is visualized using schlieren photography. the effects of injection and chamber pressures on macroscopic jet characteristics are examined. new correlations for tip speed and tip penetration are presented. results show that reducing chamber pressure is more effective than injection pressure for increasing the jet axial penetration. moreover, the linear relation between non-dimensional tip penetration and time is dependent on the chamber-toinjected gas density ratio.

borderline_personality_disorder	background: several computerized adaptive tests (cats) have been proposed to facilitate assessments in mental health. these tests are built in a standard way, disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of cats, such as the history of suicide attempts. methods: using the items of a previously developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard cat and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. we included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of patients in the decision tree. results: the decision tree needed an average of four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard cat with nine items. the accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4%. a shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients was developed. conclusion: cats can be very useful tools for the assessment of suicidal risk. however, standard cats do not use all the information that is available. a decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they are constructed using a priori information.

prenatal_development	variants in the gene encoding the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase like 1 (gadl1) have been associated with response to lithium therapy. both gadl1 and the related enzyme cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (csad) have been proposed to be involved in the pyridoxa1-5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent biosynthesis of taurine. in the present study, we compared the catalytic properties, inhibitor sensitivity and expression profiles of gadl1 and csad in brain tissue. in mouse and human brain we observed distinct patterns of expression of the plp-dependent decarboxylases csad, gadl1 and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (gad67). csad levels were highest during prenatal and early postnatal development; gadl1 peaked early in prenatal development, while gad67 increased rapidly after birth. both csad and gadl1 are being expressed in neurons, whereas only csad mrna was detected in astrocytes. cysteine sulfinic acid was the preferred substrate for both mouse csad and gadl1, although both enzymes also decarboxylated cysteic acid and aspartate. in silica screening and molecular docking using the crystal structure of csad and in vitro assays led to the discovery of eight new enzyme inhibitors with partial selectivity for either csad or gadl1. lithium had minimal effect on their enzyme activities. in conclusion, taurine biosynthesis in vertebrates involves two structurally related plp-dependent decarboxylases (csad and gadl1) that have partially overlapping catalytic properties but different tissue distribution, indicating divergent physiological roles. development of selective enzyme inhibitors targeting these enzymes is important to further dissect their (patho)physiological roles.

person_perception	surprisingly, until now there has never been an empirical study of ""creepiness."" an international sample of 1341 individuals responded to an online survey. males were perceived as being more likely to be creepy than females, and females were more likely to associate sexual threat with creepiness. unusual nonverbal behavior and characteristics associated with unpredictability were also predictors of creepiness, as were some occupations and hobbies. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that being ""creeped out"" is an evolved adaptive emotional response to ambiguity about the presence of threat that enables us to maintain vigilance during times of uncertainty.

attention	although species traits have the potential to disentangle long-term effects of multiple, potentially confounded drivers in ecosystems, this issue has received very little attention in the literature. we aimed at filling this gap by assessing the relative effects of hydroclimatic and water quality factors on the trait composition of invertebrate assemblages over 30 years in the middle loire river (france). using a priori predictions on the long-term variation of trait-based adaptations over the three decades, we evaluated the ability of invertebrate traits to indicate the effects of warming, discharge reduction and water quality improvement. hydroclimatic and water quality factors contributed to up to 65% of the variation in trait composition. more than 70% of the initial trait response predictions made according to observed long-term hydroclimatic changes were confirmed. they supported a general climate-induced trend involving adapted resistance and resilience strategies. a partial confounding effect of water quality improvement acting on trophic processes was also highlighted, indicating that improved water quality management can significantly help to reduce some adverse effects of climate change. this trait-based approach can have wider implications for investigating long-term changes driven by multiple, potentially confounded factors, as frequently encountered in the context of global change.
depression	background: high levels of distress are expected shortly after the diagnosis breast cancer. the distress thermometer (dt) is commonly used to screen for distress, using a cutoff score of 4 or 5; however, this score might not be appropriate for detecting distress in women with recently diagnosed breast cancer. objectives: the aims of this study were to establish the optimal dt cutoff score for detecting high distress shortly after breast cancer diagnosis and to correlate this score with the reported problems. methods: we selected for this study dutch women who completed the dt and the hospital anxiety and depression scale within 1 month after breast cancer diagnosis. receiver operating characteristic analysis of dt scores was performed, with the hospital anxiety and depression scale being used as the criterion standard for the level of distress. the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each dt score were calculated. results: in total, 181 women participated in the study. the optimal dt cutoff score for detecting distress was 7 with a sensitivity of 0.73, specificity of 0.84, positive predictive value of 69%, and negative predictive value of 87%. emotional problems were the most frequently reported concerns. conclusion: we consider a cutoff score of 7, shortly after breast cancer is diagnosed, optimal to identify those women with high distress and therefore at risk of chronic distress. implications for practice: the findings are clinically important because they can enable healthcare professionals to direct their time and resources to those most in need of their assistance.
child_abuse	we sought to identify relationship and individual psychological factors that related to four profiles of intimate partner violence (ipv) among pregnant adolescent couples: no ipv, male ipv victim only, female ipv victim only, mutual ipv, and how associations differ by sex. using data from a longitudinal study of pregnant adolescents and partners (n = 291 couples), we used a multivariate profile analysis using multivariate analysis of covariance with between and within-subjects effects to compare ipv groups and sex on relationship and psychological factors. analyses were conducted at the couple level, with ipv groups as a between-subjects couple level variable and sex as a within-subjects variable that allowed us to model and compare the outcomes of both partners while controlling for the correlated nature of the data. analyses controlled for age, race, income, relationship duration, and gestational age. among couples, 64% had no ipv; 23% male ipv victim only; 7% mutual ipv; 5% female ipv victim only. relationship (f = 3.61, p < .001) and psychological (f = 3.17, p < .001) factors differed by ipv group, overall. attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, relationship equity, perceived partner infidelity, depression, stress, and hostility each differed by ipv profile (all p < .01). attachment anxiety, equity, depression and stress had a significant ipv profile by sex interaction (all p < .05). couples with mutual ipv had the least healthy relationship and psychological characteristics; couples with no ipv had the healthiest characteristics. females in mutually violent relationships were at particularly high risk. couple-level interventions focused on relational issues might protect young families from developing ipv behaviors.

social_cognition	introduction: emotion recognition, a social cognition domain, is impaired in people with schizophrenia and contributes to social dysfunction. whether impaired emotion recognition emerges as a manifestation of illness or predates symptoms is unclear. findings from studies of emotion recognition impairments in first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia are mixed and, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the link between emotion recognition and social functioning in that population.methods: this study examined facial affect recognition and social skills in 16 offspring of parents with schizophrenia (familial high-risk/fhr) compared to 34 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (hc), ages 7-19.results: as hypothesised, fhr children exhibited impaired overall accuracy, accuracy in identifying fearful faces, and overall recognition speed relative to controls. age-adjusted facial affect recognition accuracy scores predicted parent 's overall rating of their child 's social skills for both groups.conclusions: this study supports the presence of facial affect recognition deficits in fhr children. importantly, as the first known study to suggest the presence of these deficits in young, asymptomatic fhr children, it extends findings to a developmental stage predating symptoms. further, findings point to a relationship between early emotion recognition and social skills. improved characterisation of deficits in fhr children could inform early intervention.
attention	objective. conventional, multi-channel scalp electroencephalography (eeg) allows the identification of the attended speaker in concurrent-listening ('cocktail party') scenarios. this implies that eeg might provide valuable information to complement hearing aids with some form of eeg and to install a level of neuro-feedback. approach. to investigate whether a listener 's attentional focus can be detected from single-channel hearing-aid-compatible eeg configurations, we recorded eeg from three electrodes inside the ear canal ('in-ear-eeg') and additionally from 64 electrodes on the scalp. in two different, concurrent listening tasks, participants (n = 7) were fitted with individualized in-ear-eeg pieces and were either asked to attend to one of two dichotically-presented, concurrent tone streams or to one of two diotically-presented, concurrent audiobooks. a forward encoding model was trained to predict the eeg response at single eeg channels. main results. each individual participants' attentional focus could be detected from single-channel eeg response recorded from short-distance configurations consisting only of a single in-ear-eeg electrode and an adjacent scalp-eeg electrode. the differences in neural responses to attended and ignored stimuli were consistent in morphology (i.e. polarity and latency of components) across subjects. significance. in sum, our findings show that the eeg response from a single-channel, hearing-aid-compatible configuration provides valuable information to identify a listener 's focus of attention.
attention	bulk strain solitons in solids attract considerable attention in applications due to their very small decay, permanent bell shape and the wave parameter dependence on waveguide elasticity and geometry. one of the reasons of an evident gap between theory and numerical simulation of strain solitons propagation in various waveguides and comparatively rare experimental verification of rigorous results lies in extensive variability of physical constants data available for polymers. we show how a dramatic improvement of experimental setup provides new opportunities in solitary wave observation and its parameters measurements. digital holography based on high-speed registration cameras allowed us to refine the accuracy of measurements, and precise pulse synchronization provided direct measurements of bulk strain soliton velocity with proper accuracy. it confirms the fact that the soliton parameters depend rather on the waveguide geometry and material, not on an initial pulse, which power provides either a single soliton or a soliton train.

antisocial_personality_disorder	background/aim: in prevailing opinion, a strong relation exists between lack of empathy and antisocial personality disorder (aspd). however, recent data fail to wholly clarify this relation, especially in consideration of empathy dimensions. in this study our aim was to address aspd and social functionality from a contextual behavioral science viewpoint. materials and methods: the present study was conducted with a sample of 34 individuals with aspd and 32 healthy individuals as the control group. the participants were assessed with a sociodemographic form, structured clinical interviews for dsm i and ii (scid-i and scid-ii), social functioning scale (sfs), acceptance and action questionnaire-ii for measuring experiential avoidance, interpersonal reactivity index for measuring empathy dimensions, and the state-trait anger scale for anger-related attitudes. results: experiential avoidance, dysfunctional anger regulation patterns, and lack of perspective-taking levels were higher in the aspd group than in the control group. experiential avoidance and perspective-taking processes were related with social functioning in aspd. conclusion: these findings may provide initial data for understanding aspd clinical features and related social interaction problems. further relations between scales and social functionality also analyzed and discussed.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: the relationship between bipolar disorder (bd) and borderline personality disorder (bpd) has been controversial and widely debated. specifically, the comorbidity between both disorders has yielded a plethora of research, but there are no comprehensive reviews on this issue. objective: to determine the empirical evidence regarding the comorbidity between bd and bpd based on prevalence data, explanatory theories for their co-occurrence, and clinical impact of one disorder in the other. method: a comprehensive search of databases (pubmed and psycinfo) was performed. published manuscripts between january 1985 and august 2015 were identified. overall, 70 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. results: over a fifth of subjects showed comorbidity between bpd and bd. empirical evidence from common underlying factors was inconclusive, but bpd appears to be a risk factor for bd. data also indicated that the negative impact of bpd in bd (e.g., suicidality, worse mood course) was greater than vice verse. conclusions: given the high prevalence of comorbidity between bd and bpd and the negative effects of bpd in subjects with bd, further studies are needed to clarify the factor associated with the comorbidity between these two disorders. this information is important to develop appropriate treatments for subjects with both disorders, improve their clinical course, and prevent the increased risk of suicidality commonly found in these subjects.

attention	to further the understanding of climate change adaptation processes, more attention needs to be paid to the various contextual factors that shape whether and how climate-related knowledge and information is received and acted upon by actors involved. this study sets out to examine the characteristics of forest owners' in sweden, the information and knowledge-sharing networks they draw upon for decision-making, and their perceptions of climate risks, their forests' resilience, the need for adaptation, and perceived adaptive capacity. by applying the concept of ego-network analysis, the empirical data was generated by a quantitative survey distributed to 3000 private forest owners' in sweden in 2014 with a response rate of 31%. the results show that there is a positive correlation, even though it is generally weak, between forest owner climate perceptions and (i) network features, i.e. network size and heterogeneity, and (ii) presence of certain alter groups (i.e. network members or actors). results indicate that forest owners' social networks currently serve only a minimal function of sharing knowledge of climate change and adaptation. moreover, considering the fairly infrequent contact between respondents and alter groups, the timing of knowledge sharing is important. in conclusion we suggest those actors that forest owners' most frequently communicate with, especially forestry experts providing advisory services (e.g. forest owner associations, companies, and authorities) have a clear role to communicate both the risks of climate change and opportunities for adaptation. peers are valuable in connecting information about climate risks and adaptation to the actual forest property.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: studies in adults show associations between the hypofunctional seven-repeat allele (7r) of the dopamine-4 receptor gene (drd4), increased eating behaviour and/or obesity, particularly in females. we examined whether 7r is associated with total caloric intake and/or food choices in pre-schoolers. methods: 150 four-year-old children taking part in a birth cohort study in canada were administered a snack test meal in a laboratory setting. mothers also filled out a food frequency questionnaire to address childrens' habitual food consumption. total caloric and individual macronutrient intakes during the snack meal and specific types of foods as reported in the food diaries were compared across 7r allele carriers vs. non-carriers, using current bmi as a co-variate. results: we found significant sex by genotype interactions for fat and protein intake during the snack test. post hoc testing revealed that in girls, but not boys, 7r carriers ate more fat and protein than did non-carriers. based on the food diaries, across both sexes, 7r carriers consumed more portions of ice cream and less vegetables, eggs, nuts and whole bread, suggesting a less healthy pattern of habitual food consumption. conclusion: the 7r allele of drd4 influences macronutrient intakes and specific food choices as early as four years of age. the specific pattern of results further suggests that prior associations between the 7r allele and adult overeating/obesity may originate in food choices observable in the preschool years. longitudinal follow-up of these children will help establish the relevance of these findings for obesity risk and prevention.

gender_roles	it is known that some of the new religious movements (nrms), which have accepted in various segments of the society by arising with different beliefs and rituals, different lifestyles and different values, emerged in the periods when normative gender roles were questioned. thus, ""women 's rights movement"" which occurred in mid-nineteenth century and struggled in order that women achieved civil and political rights, contributed directly or indirectly to emergence of some nrms. additionally it is a fact that some nrms, which promoted the women 's rights and the social reforms and even offered the leadership opportunity for them, attracted women who suffered oppression and placed in a secondary positions. in this paper which focuses on the relationship between new religious movements and women, it is examined the basic matters such as the effect of gender on participation in nrms, the status and roles of women and men in nrms, the issue of women 's leadership and whether the women are abused by nrms.
person_perception	although there has been considerable research investigating the ability to identify sexual orientation from static images, or ""gaydar,"" few studies have considered the role of female sexual orientation or sexual interest (for example, sociosexual orientation) in judgment accuracy. in two studies, we investigated the sexuality detection ability, and masculinity and femininity as cues used in judgment. in study 1, we recruited heterosexual (n = 55) and homosexual (n = 71) women to rate the sexual orientation of homosexual and heterosexual male and female targets (n = 80: 20 heterosexual men, 20 homosexual men, 20 heterosexual women, and 20 homosexual women). we found that detection accuracy was better than chance levels for both male and female targets and that male targets were more likely to be falsely labeled as homosexual than female targets were. overall, female faces were more accurately identified as heterosexual or homosexual than male faces and homosexual female raters were biased towards labeling targets as homosexual. sociosexuality did not influence the accuracy with which targets were identified as heterosexual or homosexual. in study 2, 100 heterosexual and 20 homosexual women rated the stimulus for masculinity and femininity. heterosexual women were rated as more feminine and less masculine than homosexual women and homosexual men were rated as more feminine and less masculine than heterosexual men. sexual orientation of the judges did not affect the ratings. the results were discussed with a reference to evolutionary and cultural influences affecting sexual orientation judgment accuracy.
false_memories	two experiments investigated the cognitive skills that underlie children 's susceptibility to semantic and phonological false memories in the deese/roediger-mcdermott procedure (deese, 1959; roediger & mcdermott, 1995). in experiment 1, performance on the verbal similarities subtest of the british ability scales (bas) ii (elliott, smith, & mcculloch, 1997) predicted correct and false recall of semantic lures. in experiment 2, performance on the yopp-singer test of phonemic segmentation (yopp, 1988) did not predict correct recall, but inversely predicted the false recall of phonological lures. auditory short-term memory was a negative predictor of false recall in experiment 1, but not in experiment 2. the findings are discussed in terms of the formation of gist and verbatim traces as proposed by fuzzy trace theory (reyna & brainerd, 1998) and the increasing automaticity of associations as proposed by associative activation theory (howe, wimmer, gagnon, & plumpton, 2009).

eating_disorders	this correlational descriptive study aimed to validate the predictive model of risk of developing eating behavior disorder in young people based on the measurement of variables such as eating behavior, body image dissatisfaction, body mass index, family functioning, and the use of criticism toward young people about their weight and the shape of their body, in young people and parents. the non-randomized sample of convenience included 208 participants, 104 of them were adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years, studying in different high schools, and 104 family members considered to be significant by the teenagers. eat-26, eca, family apgar, feics, and bmi were applied, all validated for the colombian population. as a result of the multivariate analysis, it was found that the high risk of developing behavioral disorders in young people is related to high risk in their relatives; the article concludes that parents, in addition to playing a protective role, may represent a risk factor for the eating behavior of their children, given that children model their behavior on their parents from early childhood.
leadership	globally, there is increasing pressure on schools to enact change, and the literature indicates that transformational leadership is positively associated with school leaders' effectiveness at implementing positive reforms. here, we report on a study conducted in the united arab emirates (uae) within the current context of intense educational restructuring in the k-12 system. the purpose was to investigate whether school principals in the uae practise transformational leadership, and whether they and their teachers perceived principals' leadership styles differently to their western counterparts. this study adopted a mixed methodology, and revealed variation in perceptions between principals and teachers related to whether principals were practising transformational leadership. however, when analysed using hofstede 's cultural framework, this variation may be related to cultural differences between the western orientation of the leadership model adapted by emirati principals and the islamic orientation of the population. therefore, a new model of transformational leadership is proposed, based on a paradigm that may be more appropriate for middle eastern/islamic contexts. this modified transformational model may be useful to those leaders who wish to adopt transformational leadership with cultural accommodations.
antisocial_personality_disorder	objective: children with adhd have an increased risk of later developing personality disorders and criminal behavior. the object of the present review is to analyze the associations between adhd and antisocial personality disorder (aspd). method: a review of literature was done using embase, psycinfo, and medline databases. results: eighteen prospective studies (n = 5,501) showed that adhd with and without comorbid conduct disorder (cd) is a strong predictor for the risk of later development of antisocial personality disorder (aspd). some of the 13 cross-sectional/retrospective studies (n = 2,451) suggested that adhd and cd might be a separate subtype of adhd, that especially impulsivity in adhd is a predictor for later development of aspd, or that callous-unemotional traits in the adhd children are called for a risk factor for later aspd. conclusion: there is an increased risk for children with adhd with or without comorbid cd to develop later onset of antisocial personality disorder.
social_cognition	objectives: emotion recognition impairments have been demonstrated in schizophrenia (sz), but are less consistent and lesser in magnitude in bipolar disorder (bd). this may be related to the extent to which different face processing strategies are engaged during emotion recognition in each of these disorders. we recently showed that sz patients had impairments in the use of both featural and configural face processing strategies, whereas bd patients were impaired only in the use of the latter. here we examine the influence that these impairments have on facial emotion recognition in these cohorts. methods: twenty-eight individuals with sz, 28 individuals with bd, and 28 healthy controls completed a facial emotion labeling task with two conditions designed to separate the use of featural and configural face processing strategies; part-based and whole-face emotion recognition. results: sz patients performed worse than controls on both conditions, and worse than bd patients on the whole-face condition. bd patients performed worse than controls on the whole-face condition only. conclusions: configural processing deficits appear to influence the recognition of facial emotions in bd, whereas both configural and featural processing abnormalities impair emotion recognition in sz. this may explain discrepancies in the profiles of emotion recognition between the disorders.
depression	aim: to evaluate the prevalence of recurrent falls and their risk factors among older men living in the veterans homes in taiwan. methods: this cross-sectional study enrolled 871 residents and all participants received the comprehensive geriatric assessment, including barthel index, mini-mental status examination (mmse), geriatric depression scale-5 questions (gds-5), mini-nutrition assessment short form (mna-sf), the status of urinary incontinence, stool incontinence, polypharmacy, past history of falls, multimorbidity, and medication history. results: overall, 871 subjects (mean age: 85.5 +/- 5.2 years, all males) participated in this study, whereas 222(25.5%) of them had experienced falls in the past year, and 91 were recurrent fallers. comparisons between non-fallers, single fallers and recurrent fallers disclosed that they were significantly different in the following characteristics: diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, charlson comorbidity index (cci), barthel index, gds-5, mna-sf, polypharmacy, use of hypnotics, urinary incontinence, and stool incontinence (p for trend all <0.05). multiple regression analysis identified that gds-5 was significantly associated with single falls and recurrent falls (or 1.256, 95% ci 1.094-1.441, p = 0.001 for single fallers; or 1.480, 95% ci 1.269-1.727, p < 0.001 for recurrent fallers). besides, urinary incontinence was the independently associated with recurrent fallers only (or 2.369, 95% ci 1.449-3.817, p < 0.001), but not single fallers. conclusion: urinary incontinence and depressive symptoms were independent associated factors for falls among older men living in the retirement communities. however, urinary incontinence was associated with recurrent falls, but not single falls. intervention study is needed to reduce recurrent falls through management of urinary incontinence.

antisocial_personality_disorder	although links between childhood residential mobility and subsequently increased risks of psychopathology have been well documented, associations across the full spectrum of psychiatric disorders are unknown. we conducted a population-based study of all 1,439,363 persons born in denmark during 1971-1997 to investigate relationships between childhood cross-municipality residential moves from year of birth to age 14 years and the development of a range of psychiatric disorders from mid adolescence to early middle age. we examined: (1) any substance misuse disorders; specifically alcohol misuse, and cannabis misuse; (2) any personality disorders; specifically antisocial, and borderline personality disorders; (3) schizophrenia and related disorders; specifically schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder; (4) any mood disorders; specifically bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder; (5) any anxiety and somatoform disorders; specifically obsessive compulsive disorder; (6) any eating disorders; specifically anorexia nervosa. childhood residential mobility was associated with elevated risks of developing most psychiatric disorders, even after controlling for potential confounders. the associations generally rose with increasing age at moving and were stronger for multiple moves in a year compared to a single move. links were particularly strong for antisocial personality disorder, any substance misuse disorder, and cannabis misuse in particular, for which the highest increases in risks were observed if relocation occurred during adolescence. childhood residential change was not linked to subsequent risk of developing an eating disorder. frequent residential mobility could be a marker for familial adversities. mental health services and schools need to be vigilant of the psychosocial needs of children, particularly adolescents, who have recently moved homes.

prenatal_development	experimental ooplasmic transplantation from donor to recipient oocyte took place between 1996 and 2001 at saint barnabas medical center, usa. indication for 33 patients was repeated implantation failure. thirteen couples had 17 babies. one patient delivered twins from mixed ooplasmic and donor egg embryos. a limited survey-based follow-up study on the children is reported: 12 out of 13 parents completed a questionnaire on pregnancy, birth, health, academic performance and disclosure. parents of a quadruplet did not participate. prenatal development and delivery were uneventful. school grades ranged from good to excellent. children were of good health. body mass index (bmi) was normal in 12 out of 13 children. one child had chronic migraine headaches, two mild asthma, three minor vision and three minor skin problems. one boy from a boy/girl twin was diagnosed with borderline pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified at age 18 months, but with no later symptoms. one couple disclosed the use of egg donor to their child. one reported intention to disclose; six were undecided and four reported they would not disclose. this limited follow-up strategy presents a high risk of bias. parents may not assent to standardized clinical analysis owing to lack of disclosure to their children.

media_violence	objective: recent studies have found a correlation between television viewing and behavior problems in children. this study aimed to examine the extent of children 's television-viewing time and its correlation with behavioral problems in a preschool age general population sample. method: a total of 356 preparatory school students aged 5 to 7 years, were recruited for the study. the questionnaires on children 's time spent on watching television, socioeconomic status of family (ses) and the child behavior checklist (cbcl) were administered to the parents of children 's. results: the overall mean +/- sd daily television viewing time was 3.2 +/- 1.4 hours. elevated scores of somatic complaints, depression and anxiety, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive behaviors, internalization, externalization subscales and total problems were associated with higher television watching times. overall television viewing time had a positive correlation with social problem, somatic complaints problem, anxious/depressed problem, internalization, externalization and total problem scores. conclusion: television viewing time is positively associated with internalization, externalization and total problems using cbcl in preschool children. although this study does not suggest that time of the viewing television is one of the most important determinants of children 's behavior problems, it indicates that heavy viewing may have a risk of behavioral problems for children. our findings support the importance of parental monitoring of their children 's television watching habits.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: the purpose of this study is to define treatment response and remission cut-point scores for the beck depression inventory-second edition (bdi-ii) when used to monitor seasonal affective disorder (sad) treatment. methods: data from two published randomized clinical trials for sad were utilized to complete a roc analysis to define response and remission thresholds for the bdi-ii. the structured interview guide for the hamilton rating scale for depression-seasonal affective disorder version (sigh-sad) was used as a reference standard. data from the two trials included bdi-ii and sigh-sad scores for patients at baseline, 6 weeks (post-treatment), and 1 year (next winter). results: bdi-ii score of <= 9 was the derived criterion for remission of sad, and bdi-ii score decrease of 50% from baseline was the criterion for treatment response. limitations: study participants were primarily female (94%) and caucasian (80%) so demographic diversity of the sample was limited. conclusion: this study validated bdi-ii scores compared to the sigh-sad reference standard. the bdi-ii has greater potential for widespread use by clinicians than the sigh-sad to monitor sad patients because it is a brief self-report instrument that can be conveniently administered in the waiting room.

child_abuse	the risk for using child abuse images (cai) is difficult to assess, especially as it mostly remains undetected by legal authorities. the present study investigates the association of aspects of sexual preference and dynamic risk factors with cai only and mixed offending (cai and child sexual abuse) over lifetime and within six months prior to assessment. a sample of 190 undetected, self-identified pedo- and/or hebephiles was investigated. multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that sexual preoccupation is of great importance, especially for recent cai only and mixed offending, as well as lifetime mixed offending. although inconclusive, a sexual preference for early-pubescent children seems to be of interest for recent and lifetime offending. a sexual preference for prepubescent children, additional paraphilias and sexualised coping have shown some, although no statistically meaningful association with lifetime offending. gender preference, exclusivity of pedohebephilia and offence-supportive attitudes did not show any significant relation with offending behaviour.
prenatal_development	ontogenetic peculiarities of catecholaminergic regulation of three vitally important physiological processes are described: heart beating, respiration, and early somatomotor activity. they are subordinated to the autorhythmical regime and are submitted to modulating effects of noradrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms. there are considered age-related changes of this effect whose peculiarity is polar changes of reactions in the process of their maturation from the predominantly excitatory reactions at early stages to the predominantly inhibitory ones.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objective: high rates of bipolar disorder (bd) have been found among major depressives with seasonal pattern (sp) consulting in psychiatric departments, as well as among patients seeking primary care. as sp was reported to be common in the latter, the current study was designed to assess (a) the frequency and characteristics of sp among major depressives attending primary care and (b) the prevalence and aspects of bd in this population. methods: among 400 patients who consulted french general practitioners (gps) for major depression between february and december 2010, 390 could be included in the study: 167 (42.8%) met diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, criteria for seasonal pattern [sp(+)], whereas 223 (57.2%) did not meet these criteria [sp(-)]. the two groups were compared on demographic, clinical, family history and temperamental characteristics. results: compared to sp(-), sp(+) patients were more frequently female, married and with a later age at first depressive episode, and showed more atypical vegetative symptoms, comorbid bulimia and stimulant abuse. they also exhibited more lifetime depressive episodes, were more often diagnosed as having bd ii and met more often bipolarity specifier criteria, with higher rates of bipolar temperaments and a higher bd family loading. among sp(+) patients, 68.9% met the bipolarity specifier criteria, whereas 31.1% did not. seasonality was not influenced by climatic conditions. the following independent variables were associated with sp: bd according to bipolarity specifier, female gender, comorbid bulimia nervosa, hypersomnia, number of depressive episodes and family history of substance abuse. conclusions: seasonal pattern is frequent among depressive patients attending primary care in france and may be indicative of hidden bipolarity. given the risks associated with both sp and bipolarity, gps are likely to have a major role in regard to prevention.

person_perception	first impressions made to photographs of faces can depend as much on momentary characteristics of the photographed image (within-person variability) as on consistent properties of the face of the person depicted (between-person variability). here, we examine two important sources of within-person variability: emotional expression and viewpoint. we find more within-person variability than between-person variability for social impressions of key traits of trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness, which index the main dimensions in theoretical models of facial impressions. the most important source of this variability is the emotional expression of the face, but the viewpoint of the photograph also affects impressions and modulates the effects of expression. for example, faces look most trustworthy with a happy expression when they are facing the perceiver, compared to when they are facing elsewhere, whereas the opposite is true for anger and disgust. our findings highlight the integration of these different sources of variability in social impression formation.
prejudice	following a mortality salience or control prime, black, hispanic, and white college students read a murder/carjacking or auto theft trial transcript in which the defendant belonged to their racial/ethnic group or one of the others. black and hispanic, but not white, mock-jurors discriminated, more frequently judging outgroup defendants guilty. mortality salience affected judgments about outgroup, but not ingroup, defendants, heightening perceptions of guilt in the murder case and decreasing guilty verdict preferences in the theft case. mortality salience may compel derogation of outgroup defendants who threaten the cultural worldview, but not of less threatening ingroup defendants. the effect, however, seems restricted to crimes like murder that can sustain death-related anxiety.
seasonal_affective_disorder	in rodents, the removal of the olfactory bulbs (obs), i.e. olfactory bulbectomy (obx), results in numerous alterations in neurotransmitter, endocrine and immune systems, as well as behavioral changes, similar to those observed in depressed patients. because the behavioral deficits induced in obx animals are reversed after repeated administration of antidepressants, this is a model often used to test the effectiveness of putative antidepressant agents. recent evidence suggests that obx results in the dysfunction of various cellular processes within the hippocampus, including decreases in dentate gyrus neurogenesis, disruption in long-term potentiation in ca1 and ca3 subregions and neuronal atrophy in the cm subregion, along with downstream markers, all of which are consistent with abnormal neuronal activity in the hippocampus of clinically depressed populations. moreover, repeated administration of novel natural and synthetic antidepressant compounds can improve certain aspects of depression-like behavior and hippocampal function. in an effort to bring together the existing literature, this review will focus on the mechanisms by which proposed pharmaceuticals impact hippocampal-dependent processes and behavior.

nonverbal_communication	background: there is widespread consensus on the importance of safe and secure communication in healthcare, especially in trauma care where time is a limiting factor. although non-verbal communication has an impact on communication between individuals, there is only limited knowledge of how trauma team leaders communicate. the purpose of this study was to investigate how trauma team members are positioned in the emergency room, and how leaders communicate in terms of gaze direction, vocal nuances, and gestures during trauma team training. methods: eighteen trauma teams were audio and video recorded during trauma team training in the emergency department of a hospital in northern sweden. quantitative content analysis was used to categorize the team members' positions and the leaders' non-verbal communication: gaze direction, vocal nuances, and gestures. the quantitative data were interpreted in relation to the specific context. time sequences of the leaders' gaze direction, speech time, and gestures were identified separately and registered as time (seconds) and proportions (%) of the total training time. results: the team leaders who gained control over the most important area in the emergency room, the ""inner circle"", positioned themselves as heads over the team, using gaze direction, gestures, vocal nuances, and verbal commands that solidified their verbal message. changes in position required both attention and collaboration. leaders who spoke in a hesitant voice, or were silent, expressed ambiguity in their non-verbal communication: and other team members took over the leader 's tasks. discussion: in teams where the leader had control over the inner circle, the members seemed to have an awareness of each other 's roles and tasks, knowing when in time and where in space these tasks needed to be executed. deviations in the leaders' communication increased the ambiguity in the communication, which had consequences for the teamwork. communication cannot be taken for granted; it needs to be practiced regularly just as technical skills need to be trained. simulation training provides healthcare professionals the opportunity to put both verbal and nonverbal communication in focus, in order to improve patient safety. conclusions: non-verbal communication plays a decisive role in the interaction between the trauma team members, and so both verbal and non-verbal communication should be in focus in trauma team training. this is even more important for inexperienced leaders, since vague non-verbal communication reinforces ambiguity and can lead to errors.
false_memories	the present study used a study-test recognition memory task to examine the brain regions engaged in episodic and associative memory processes. participants evaluated on a six-point rating scale how confident they were on whether or not an item was presented in a previous study phase. neural activations for high- and low-confidence decisions were examined in old and new items at two levels of between-item-associations. items had different amounts of associations within the stimulus set, while associations were defined by co-occurrence statistics. the medial frontal gyrus, the posterior cingulate gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus and the right hippocampus revealed u-shaped activation functions with greater activations for high-confidence old and new decisions. this was independent of the associative memory manipulation, which suggests that not episodic memory, but rather processes related to confidence account for the activation in these brain regions. in contrast, left hippocampus followed a different activation pattern that was modulated by the amount of associations. this provides evidence for the role of the left hippocampus in associative memory.

social_cognition	mindreading refers to the ability to attribute mental states, including thoughts, intentions and emotions, to oneself and others, and is essential for navigating the social world. empirical mindreading research has predominantly featured children, groups with autism spectrum disorder and clinical samples, and many standard tasks suffer ceiling effects with neurologically typical (nt) adults. we first outline a case for studying mindreading in nt adults and proceed to review tests of emotion perception, cognitive and affective mentalizing, and multidimensional tasks combining these facets. we focus on selected examples of core experimental paradigms including emotion recognition tests, social vignettes, narrative fiction (prose and film) and participative interaction (in real and virtual worlds), highlighting challenges for studies with nt adult cohorts. we conclude that naturalistic, multidimensional approaches may be productively applied alongside traditional tasks to facilitate a more nuanced picture of mindreading in adulthood, and to ensure construct validity whilst remaining sensitive to variation at the upper echelons of the ability.
antisocial_personality_disorder	objective: temperament and personality in bipolar-i (bp-i) patients have been studied but temperament and personality in bp-i patients comorbid with adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) have not been studied before. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of adhd on the temperament and personality of bp-i patients in remission. methods: patients with a bp-i disorder diagnosis (n=121, female 71, male 50) were matched with control group with no known psychiatric illness (n=100, female 55, male 45) according to age, sex, education were recruited from consecutive admissions. after the sociodemographic form, scid-i for childhood and adult adhd and the other axis-i diagnoses according to dsm-iv criteria and scid-ii have been applied to all patients and control group. all patients were interviewed for the presence and history of current adult and childhood adhd diagnosis. the subjects also completed the adult add/adhd dsm-iv based diagnostic and screening rating scale turkish version and the turkish version of temps-a scale. results: adult adhd diagnosis were observed in bipolar i patients with 21.7% (n=26) and in control group with 7% (n=7). tempera-ment measurements revealed depressive type was found more commonly in the pure bp-i and the comorbid bp-i with adult adhd group compared to the pure control group. there was no severe depressive temperament in the pure control group. when bp-i and the comorbid bp-i with adult adhd group were analysed separately for the depressive temperament, there were no difference between the pure bp-i and the comorbid bp-i with adult adhd group. the the comorbid bp-i with adult adhd group were observed to have moderate/severe episodes, earlier and longer maintenance treatment periods. all three groups differ in terms of personality disorder. antisocial personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder were observed only in the comorbid bp-i with adult adhd group. conclusion: bp-i disorder comorbid with adult adhd has significant clinical implications which may relate to a personality disorder. this may be due to the influence of adhd on bp-i disorder.
gender_roles	religion has an essential effect on the development of any society since it impacts religious norms and models of behaviour, establishes priorities and values, influences gender relations, predetermines gender roles, and influences the establishing of certain traditions, laws, and customs. this article is a review of the historic position of the russian orthodox church - the dominant religion in russia - its past and current status in russia, and the issues relating to women in russian socio-cultural and religious community. while there is a lack of research on the russian orthodox church and its influence on russians and, particularly, russian women, the increased religiosity in russia within the last decade requires us to study the russian orthodoxy and its impact on people 's lives and its attitude to gender. this article provides a deep analysis of the impact of the russian orthodox church on the image of women in russia. it has been argued that russian national character and heritage was formed by the russian orthodox church and the existing gender stereotypes in russia have been significantly impacted by the russian orthodox church and have mainly been derived from the interpretation of the new testament by the russian orthodoxy and its clergy. particularly, gender roles and the perception of family, and marriage are understood to be in compliance with the values of the russian orthodox faith. for the faith the most important purpose of marriage is the birth and raising of children and the chief responsibility and duty of a woman is to care for her husband and children as these are considered as a way of the woman 's service to society and to god.
social_cognition	technology is rapidly changing the nature of service, customers' service frontline experiences, and customers' relationships with service providers. based on the prediction that in the marketplace of 2025, technology (e. g., service-providing humanoid robots) will be melded into numerous service experiences, this article spotlights technology 's ability to engage customers on a social level as a critical advancement of technology infusions. specifically, it introduces the novel concept of automated social presence (asp; i. e., the extent to which technology makes customers feel the presence of another social entity) to the services literature. the authors develop a typology that highlights different combinations of automated and human social presence in organizational frontlines and indicates literature gaps, thereby emphasizing avenues for future research. moreover, the article presents a conceptual framework that focuses on (a) how the relationship between asp and several key service and customer outcomes is mediated by social cognition and perceptions of psychological ownership as well as (b) three customer-related factors that moderate the relationship between asp and social cognition and psychological ownership (i. e., a customer 's relationship orientation, tendency to anthropomorphize, and technology readiness). finally, propositions are presented that can be a catalyst for future work to enhance the understanding of how technology infusion, particularly service robots, influences customers' frontline experiences in the future.
gender_roles	in italy, since the early 2010s, the english word ""gender"" was twisted into a code-word for a purported ""teoria gender"" (""gender-theory"") or ""ideologia gender"" (""gender-ideology"") also simply referred to as ""il gender"" (""the gender""). such a ""theory"" purportedly aims to destroy any differences between males and females, preaching that sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender roles can and should be ""chosen"" at will, and that children ought be indoctrinated in schools with such a ""knowledge"". this paper examines the roots of the concept, originating within ""opus dei"", but further evolved in france and the movement against equal rights for same-sex couples. such a ""no-gender"" ideology cannot be understood either as a philosophical or as a theological theory, being a mere political tool. the utterly confused theories by the ""no-gender"" movement are not, in fact, a coherent rebuttal of ""gender studies"" or ""queer theories"", but rather a concocted mishmash of ""conspiracy theories"" held true by far-right groups.
eating_disorders	targeted approaches for the treatment of severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (se-an) have been recommended, but there is no consensus definition of se-an to inform research and clinical practice. this study aimed to take initial steps toward developing an empirically based definition of se-an by characterizing associations among putative indicators of severity and chronicity in eating disorders. patients with an (n=355) completed interviews and questionnaires at treatment admission and discharge; height and weight were assessed to calculate body mass index (bmi). structural equation mixture modeling was used to test whether associations among potential indicators of se-an (illness duration, treatment history, bmi, binge eating, purging, quality-of-life) formed distinct subgroups, a single group with one or more dimensions, or a combination of subgroups and dimensions. a three-factor (dimensional), two-profile (categorical) mixture model provided the best fit to the data. factor 1 included eating disorder behaviors; factor 2 comprised quality-of-life domains; factor 3 was characterized by illness duration, number of hospitalizations, and admission bmi. profiles differed on eating disorder behaviors and quality-of-life, but not on indicators of chronicity or bmi. factor scores, but not profile membership, predicted outcome at discharge from treatment. data suggest that patients with an can be classified on the basis of eating disorder behaviors and quality-of-life, but there was no evidence for a chronic subgroup of an. rather, indices of chronicity varied dimensionally within each class. given that current definitions of se-an rely on illness duration, these findings have implications for research and clinical practice.
borderline_personality_disorder	introduction: chart review is a low-cost, but highly informative, method to describe symptoms, treatment, and risk factors associated with borderline personality disorder (bpd) and to adapt screening and intervention to clinical reality. previous chart review studies report more aggressiveness/anger and psychotic features in youths with bpd. they show that adverse family environment and parental psychopathology constitute important factors for bpd pathology. objectives: to examine clinical characteristics of depressed bpd adolescents (12-17 years old) outpatients according to gender and to explore variables which are associated with bpd traits. methods: a retrospective chart review using the child and adolescent version of the retrospective diagnostic instrument for borderlines was conducted on 30 depressed adolescents with bpd traits and 28 depressed patients without bpd traits. participants who reached the retrospective diagnostic instrument for borderlines threshold for bpd were included in the bpd traits group. comparison analyses were performed using pearson 's chi-square test. associated factors were determined using regression analyses. results: bpd traits participants were characterized by higher family problems (parental psychopathology, parent disagreement/argument, and parent child relational problem), more aggressive symptoms, and higher rates of family intervention and hospitalization. a number of familial factors (parental history of delinquency, substance use, personality disorders, having siblings, or parental disagreement/argument in boys) were associated with bpd traits. attention seeking and problematic functioning (does not adapt well to group activities) were also associated with bpd traits. discussion: our study stresses the need to assess bpd traits in adolescent psychiatric evaluation, especially in the presence of aggressive behaviors, family problems and attention seeking. our results also highlight the importance of exploring family characteristics intervention in adolescents with bpd traits.
child_abuse	social support by family, friends and significant others is known to buffer the impact of adverse life events on children 's well-being and functioning, however little is known about pathways explaining this association. we investigated whether maltreatment-related cognitions mediate the association between social support and posttraumatic stress symptoms (ptss). furthermore, age was introduced as moderator. we assessed the history of maltreatment in 200 maltreated children and adolescents (age 8-17 years) using a semi-structured interview. participants' perceived current social support, maltreatment-related negative cognitions related to the subjectively ""worst"" experience of maltreatment and ptss during the past month were assessed using self-report questionnaires. a set of mediation analyses demonstrated, that negative maltreatment-related appraisals mediated the relation between perceived social support and ptss. the hypothesized negative associations of social support with ptss and dysfunctional cognitions did not differ between children (8-11:11 years) and adolescents (12-17;11 years). thus, the protective function of social support after maltreatment can be explained by fewer negative beliefs maltreated youth have about themselves and the world. these results provide support to models of social-cognitive processing and emphasize the importance of cognitive coping in regard to episodes of maltreatment which can be shaped within social interactions with non-abusive caregivers, friends, and significant others.

attention	relative to other historic documents, newspapers have received little attention from researchers as a source of archaeological data. now that many historic newspapers have been digitized and placed online, this traditionally underutilized resource has the potential to yield new information about archaeological sites, especially those in heavily developed urban areas where sites are inaccessible or have been destroyed. in this article, a methodology is proposed by which archived newspapers might be searched for data about archaeological sites. a case study using newspapers from allen county, indiana and its principal city, fort wayne, demonstrates the utility of the methodology by producing evidence about many previously unrecorded archaeological sites.
prenatal_development	native chickens (gallus domesticus) of bangladesh are scavenging in nature. data regarding morphology of lymphoid organs in prenatal stages are lacking. h&e staining method was performed to study the development of the bursa of fabricius, thymus, spleen and cecal tonsil from embryonic day (ed) 10 to 20. the budding of thymus was seen on ed 10. at ed 12, fiber network of thymus was formed to create a basement of cells of thymus and on ed 14 these cells began to organize to form cortex and medulla. but the cortex and medulla of thymus could not be differentiated before ed 20. the plicae of bursa fabricius started to develop on ed 10. from ed 12 the plicae became shorter and wider to form bursal follicles and these follicles were clearly organized into cortex and medulla on ed 20. at ed 10, very thin capsule was seen in embryonic spleen. during ed 12, only a few white pulps were observed, while on ed 14, purple colored white pulp and pinkish red pulp were easily visible. at ed 20, the thickness of capsule was increased and pulps were more distinguishable. all the lymphoid organs showed major development during the later incubation period, indicating that the immune system in that period is being prepared to face the scavenging environment after hatching.

prejudice	the so called ""three-step test"", that the limitations and exceptions of copyright shall be allowed in certain special cases, provided that they do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author, grants copyright flexibilities to balance the interests of all stakeholders, especially within the european system of circumscribed limitations and exceptions. this is essential for the domain of computer law, confronted by rapid and unpredictable global technological developments, and is, thus, enshrined in the most important international intellectual property(ip) treaties. through the proposed third amendment to the copyright law of the prc, the legislature intends to adopt this test while also introducing an open-ended list of limitations and exceptions that constitutes a china-specific ""two-step test."" this contravenes prima facie the thesis endorsed by the wto panel in the case concerning section 110(5) of the us copyright act in 2000. in contrast, court decisions in china frequently apply the fair use doctrine of us copyright law, neglecting to consider its peculiar context of the us common law tradition and, thus, unduly expanding the chinese courts' discretionary power. this paper summarizes the case law in china and.takes a comparative approach to address the divergence between the judicial application of cyber copyright law and the existing legislation. it suggests revising the proposed article 43 of the copyright law of the prc to capture the due interpretation of the three-step test, thereby finessing the delineation between rights protection and free use with the compensation of remuneration under the principle of proportionality. it argues that transplanting the us fair use doctrine into chinese copyright law is feasible, but with the preconditions of endeavouring to strengthen judicial reform to integrate the ip adjudication systems, enhancing the coherence and efficiency of copyright enforcement, and facilitating consistent dialogues between scholars, practitioners, and lawmakers.

problem-solving	research shows that mathematics anxiety and mathematics achievement present a challenge for many educators, particularly elementary school teachers who usually have lower mathematics content knowledge and higher math anxiety levels than average college students. this study investigated education majors' cognitive abilities and mathematics perceptions that affect their mathematics performance in geometry, word problem solving, and non-word problem-solving. we examined relationships between mathematics problem-solving and math anxiety in each of the three mathematical domains as a function of working memory (wm), spatial ability, and attitudes toward learning mathematics. math anxiety, wm, and spatial ability explained 62% of the variance in student overall mathematics performance with math anxiety being the highest (negative) predictor. although relationships between math anxiety and mathematics performance varied by mathematical domain, the negative effects of math anxiety were equally detrimental in each of the three mathematical domains, even after controlling for the effects of wm performance and spatial ability.

attention	the roadmap to a resource efficient europe aims that by 2020, waste will be managed as a resource. thus materials that have the ability for the reuse of several types of wastes, such as alkali-activated cement-based binders (aacbs), will merit special attention. some wastes like fly ash deserve special attention because they are generated in high amounts and have a very low reuse rate. this paper reports experimental results regarding the influence of the mix design of fly ash and waste glass aacb mortars containing two different biopolymers (carrageenan and xanthan) on their short-term mechanical performance. microstructure and cost analysis are also included. the results show that a mixture of 80% fly ash, 10% waste glass, and 10% calcium hydroxide activated with an alkaline activator has the highest compressive strength. the results also show that the mortars with minor biopolymer carrageenan content are associated with a relevant increase in compressive strength and that the use of 0.1% of carrageenan leads to optimum compressive strength in most mixtures. the use of xanthan shows no beneficial effects on the compressive strength of aacb mortars. several mixtures with xanthan even show a reduction in the compressive strength.
eating_disorders	introduction: it seems that the pursuit for muscularity may be related to eating disorders (ed) in male athletes. however, to our knowledge, there are no studies on this topic. objective: the aim of the study was to analyze the relationship of pursuit for muscularity and mood state with eating disorders in this population. methods: the study included 112 athletes from various sporting modalities from federations of southeastern brazil. we used the eating attitudes test (eat-26), the drive for muscularity scale (dfm) and the brunel mood scale (brums) to evaluate, respectively, the eating behaviors with risk of ed, the pursuit for muscularity and the mood state. results: the findings of the hierarchical regression models did not show a relationship between the pursuit for muscularity (p >0.05) and mood state (p >0.05) with disordered eating. however, the results indicated a difference in the pursuit for muscularity according to the eat-26 classifications (p0.05). conclusion: we concluded that both the mood state and the pursuit for muscularity were not related to the eating disorders in male athletes.
depression	this study examined the risk of deterioration/relapse in pregnant women who discontinued their antidepressant medications based on the discretion of the psychiatric specialists compared with those who performed self-interruption. we reviewed the obstetric records of all singleton deliveries beyond 22 weeks of gestation at japanese red cross katsushika maternity hospital from january 2009 through december 2015. compared with the women continuing antidepressant medications throughout pregnancy, the incidence of deterioration/relapse was higher in the women who discontinued their antidepressant medications regardless of who made the decision (interruption based on the discretion of the psychiatric specialists: 61%, odds ratio (or), 8.05; 95% confidence interval (ci), 2.4-27; p<0.01; self-interruption: 63%, odds ratio (or), 8.79; 95% confidence interval (ci), 2.6-29; p<0.01 versus 16%). the continuation of medications and careful observation are required for pregnant women complicated by depressive disorders.
prejudice	recent demographic changes in the forest-owner structure are suspected to have led to the increasing number of owners with no specific objectives for their forests. in addition, the continuous fragmentation of the forest holdings has increased the threat of the passiveness related to forest management. to decrease the tendency towards passiveness, new policy tools and initiatives have been suggested. in the finnish context, the idea of an investor-based jointly owned forest has been introduced as facilitating the effective utilization of the forest resource. however, collective ownership has faced prejudice and scepticism among private forest owners. in order to expand, the forest owners need to see the idea of jointly owned forests as a socially legitimate. thus, by adopting van leeuwen 's framework for analyzing the legitimation of new social practices, we examine how finnish forest owners legitimate their participation in jointly owned forests. the qualitative data of the study consist of 20 in-depth interviews with private forest owners who have joined a jointly owned forest. our study contributes to the recent discussion on jointly owned forests. we show how a change in the type of ownership results in moral, authoritative and rational justifications over the decision while simultaneously renewing the identity of the forest owner. accordingly, we suggest that forest ownership is not only driven by rational prospects, but the moral and emotional nature of ownership should be better taken into account at the policy level and in structural designs when discussing the promotion of new types of forest ownership.
social_cognition	it has been recognized that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) show discrepancies between their abstract capacities to solve social cognition dilemmas and their ability to spontaneously decipher live social interactions. in the last 15 years, different paradigms have been designed to investigate how individuals with asd grasp information when emerged in naturalistic or live social interactions. the present paper reviews three categories of such paradigms that focus on (1) verbal questionnaires and interviews while participants view a naturalistic social scenario, (2) eye tracking methods while participants view naturalistic settings, and (3) simulation of social interactions using virtual reality or robotics. this paper discusses the advantages and limitations of each paradigm and suggests a new concept for combining these paradigms.
nonverbal_communication	nonverbal communication, also known as body language, is an important form of communication. nonverbal behaviors such as posture, eye contact, and gestures send strong messages. in regard to nonverbal communication, eye contact is one of the most important forms that an individual can use. however, lack of eye contact occurs when we use video conferencing system. the disparity between locations of the eyes and a camera gets in the way of eye contact. the lock of eye gazing can give unapproachable and unpleasant feeling. in this paper, we proposed an eye gazing correction for video conferencing. we use two cameras installed at the top and the bottom of the television. the captured two images are rendered with 2d warping at virtual position. we implement view morphing to the detected face, and synthesize the face and the warped image. experimental results verify that the proposed system is effective in generating natural gaze-corrected images.
problem-solving	a minimal amount of research has examined the cognitive predictors of children 's performance in naturalistic, errand-type planning tasks such as the zoo map task of the behavioral assessment of the dysexecutive syndrome for children (bads-c). thus, the current study examined prospection (i.e., the ability to remember to carry out a future intention), executive functioning, and intelligence markers as predictors of performance in this widely used naturalistic planning task in 56 children aged 7- to 12-years-old. measures of planning, prospection, inhibition, crystallized intelligence, and fluid intelligence were collected in an individual differences study. regression analyses showed that prospection (rather than traditional measures of intelligence or inhibition) predicted planning, suggesting that naturalistic planning tasks such as the zoo map task may rely on future-oriented cognitive processes rather than executive problem solving or general knowledge.
attention	the carbon dots have got much attention recently. considering the environment protection, ""green"" materials are urgent. in this paper, nitrogen-and sulfur-co-doped carbon dots (n, s-cds) were prepared through one-pot simple and convenient hydrothermal carbonization approach with ""green"" ginkgo leaves as the materials. the synthesized carbon dots were successfully doped with nitrogen and sulfur elements. the fluorescence intensities of carbon dots were rather stable in different ph and ionic strength. furthermore, the ""green"" n, s-cds were successfully applied in bioimaging as fluorescent probes due to its excellent optical properties and low cytotoxicity.

prosocial_behavior	bidirectional associations between sibling relationships and children 's problem behaviors are robust, and links with prosocial behavior have also been reported. using cross-lagged models, we were able to conservatively test temporal directions of links between positive and negative aspects of sibling relationships and children 's prosocial behavior and conduct problems across a 3-year time span in middle childhood. the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (alspac; http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/) is an ongoing population-based study designed to investigate the effects of a wide range of factors on children 's health and development. for the purposes of the current analyses, we included 2,043 alspac families who had just 1 older sibling as well as the target child, with an age gap of no more than 5 years. mothers reported about the quality of the sibling relationship and both children 's prosocial behavior and conduct problems when the target child was 4 years of age and again when the target child was 7 years old. confirming our hypothesis, individual child behavior was predictive of sibling relationship quality, and sibling relationship quality was predictive of later child behavior, providing robust evidence of bidirectionality for both prosocial behavior and conduct problems. it would be consistent to expect that an improvement in either sibling relationship quality or individual children 's behavior could have a positive spill over effect. we also found evidence of older sibling dominance in the domain of prosocial behavior and the positive aspects of sibling interaction.
borderline_personality_disorder	accessible summary what is known on the subject? learning disability nursing in the area of people with a learning disability and an offending background has developed considerably over recent years, particularly since the publication of the bradley (). there has been limited work into the competencies nurses require to work in this area, and even less about the personal attributes of learning disability nurses. learning disability nursing 's specific contribution to the care of this population lies in their knowledge of the interaction between the learning disability, an individual 's, sometimes abusive, personal history and an understanding of the subsequent offending behaviour. the knowledge base of nurses working with people with learning disabilities and an offending background needs to reflect the changing service user group. this is particularly in relation to substance misuse, borderline personality disorder, and mental health and the way such factors inter-relate with the learning disability. what are the implications for practice? further research is required into the relationship among decision making, risk taking or reluctance to do this, and the personal attributes required by nurses to work in secure learning disability care. learning disability secure services are likely to continue to undergo change as circumstances alter and the offending population demonstrate greater complexity; nursing competencies and personal attributes need similarly to adapt to such changes. mental health nursing has a great deal to contribute to effective working with this population, specifically with regard to developing strong relationships when concerns around borderline personality disorder or substance misuse are particularly in evidence. abstract aim to identify and discuss the personal attributes required by learning disability nurses to work effectively with people with an offending background in secure and community settings. background this study was part of a larger research investigation into the nursing competencies required to work with people with an offending background. there are few existing studies examining the personal attributes necessary for working with this group. design a qualitative study addressing the perceptions of nurses around the personal attributes required to work with people with learning disabilities and an offending background. methods a semi-structured interview schedule was devised and constructed, and 39 individual interviews were subsequently undertaken with learning disability nurses working in high, medium, low secure and community settings. data were collected over 1 year in 2010/11 and analysed using a structured thematic analysis supported by the software package maxqda. findings the thematic analysis produced three categories of personal attributes, named as looking deeper, achieving balance and connecting, each of which contained a further three sub-categories. conclusion nursing of those with a learning disability and an offending background continues to develop. the interplay among personal history, additional background factors, nurses' personal attributes and learning disability is critical for effective relationship building.
antisocial_personality_disorder	measures of psychopathy have been proved to be valuable for risk assessment in violent criminals. however, the neuronal basis of psychopathy and its contribution to the prediction of criminal recidivism is still poorly understood. we compared structural imaging data from 40 male high-risk violent offenders and 37 non-delinquent healthy controls via voxel-based morphometry. psychopathic traits and risk of violence recidivism were correlated with gray matter volume (gmv) of regions of interest previously shown relevant for criminal behavior. relative to controls, criminals showed less gmv in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) and more gmv in cerebellar regions and basal ganglia structures. within criminals, we found a negative correlation between prefrontal gmv and psychopathy. additionally, there was a positive correlation between cerebellar gmv and psychopathy as well as risk of recidivism for violence. moreover, gmvs of the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (sma) were positively correlated with anti-sociality. gmv of the amygdala was negatively correlated with dynamic risk for violence recidivism. in contrast, gmv of (para)limbic areas (orbitofrontal cortex, insula) was positively correlated with anti-sociality and risk of violence recidivism. the current investigation revealed that in violent offenders deviations in gmv of the pfc as well as areas involved in the motor component of impulse control (cerebellum, basal ganglia, sma) are differentially related to psychopathic traits and the risk of violence recidivism. the results might be valuable for improving existing risk assessment tools.

gender_roles	the focus of this article is a cluster of grassroots movements and networks of networks: the association of indonesian migrant workers (atki) based in hong kong. by using kelly 's [2007. filipino migration, transnationalism and class identity (ari working papers series, 90). singapore: asia research institute.] typology of four dimensions of class (i.e. position, process, performance and politics) as a framework of analysis, the article shows that indonesian migrant domestic workers can hold multiple class identities at various positions in transnational political space(s). through organising in these particular spaces, indonesian migrant domestic workers express agency, reformulate their gender roles and identify themselves as a transnational social class. this social class identification is based on their awareness of the transnational nature of the exploitation that migrants experience but is also framed within a wider global perspective of root causes' such as neoliberal policies and unjust trade agreements. by not accepting the class position ascribed to them as domestic workers, these migrant organisations chose to define their social class by performance and generate political capital. the article adds the notion of positionality to the intersectionality approach, that is, the way social class intersects with gender, economic status/occupation, ethnicity and transnational status might differ depending on the position.
gender_roles	purpose: to review the current literature on the prevalence of cataract in hispanic females living in the united states. methods: review relevant literature on cataract, eye disease, and health practices of hispanics living in the u.s. results: females comprise 64.5% of blind persons worldwide. internationally, female gender is associated with lower awareness of cataract and other diseases of the eye and women are less likely to have cataract surgery than men in low- and middle-income countries. conclusion: hispanic women receive disparate care compared to their male counterparts. the etiology of this is likely multifactorial but possible contributors include genetics, gender roles, and personal healthcare decisions. interventions to address this disparity should be targeted, efficient, and sustainable.
attention	in bioethics and health policy, we often discuss the appropriate boundaries of public funding; how the interface of public and private purchasers and providers should be organized and regulated receives less attention. in this paper, i discuss ethical and regulatory issues raised at this interface by three medical practice models (concierge care, executive wellness clinics, and block fee charges) in which physicians provide insured services (whether publicly insured, privately insured, or privately insured by public mandate) while requiring or requesting that patients pay for services or for the non-insured services of the physicians themselves or their associates. this choice for such practice models is different from the decision to design an insurance plan to include or exclude user fees, co-payments and deductibles. i analyze the issues raised with regards to familiar health care values of equity and efficiency, while highlighting additional concerns about fair terms of access, provider integrity, and fair competition. i then analyze the common canadian regulatory response to block fee models, considering their extension to wellness clinics, with regards to fiduciary standards governing the physician-patient relationship and the role of informed consent. i close by highlighting briefly issues that are of common concern across different fundamental normative frameworks for health policy.
prenatal_development	histomorphological and histochemical studies were conducted on cardiac conduction system of buffalo heart during prenatal development. foetuses (20) ranging from 13 cm cvrl (87days) to 104 cm cvrl (308 days) were used for study. the heart tissues were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin (bnf) and routinely processed. the paraffin sections of 5-7 mu m thickness were stained with various stains to study the histomorphological and histochemical details. the study revealed that sinoatrial node was subepicardial and wedged at the junction of anterior vena cava with right atrium in 25 cm cvrl (130 days) foetus. nodal and purkinje type specialized cells were observed in sinoatrial node. the atrio-ventricular node was present in the base of atrial septum in front of coronary sinus under the endocardium. the branch of right bundle was first noticed in 13 cm cvrl (87 days) buffalo foetus. the sinoatrial node and right bundle branch showed intense reaction for acid and neutral mucopolysaccharides and basic proteins in all the age. a moderate to strong sudanophilic reaction was found in purkinje fibers, nodal cells of sinoatrial node and branch of right bundle.
social_cognition	electrophysiologic studies suggest that autism spectrum disorder is characterized by aberrant anatomic and functional neural circuitry. during normal brain development, pruning and synaptogenesis facilitate ongoing changes in both short- and long-range neural wiring. in developmental disorders such as autism, this process may be perturbed and lead to abnormal neural connectivity. careful analysis of electrophysiologic connectivity patterns using eeg coherence may provide a way to probe the resulting differences in neurological function between people with and without autism. there is general consensus that electroencephalogram coherence patterns differ between individuals with and without autism spectrum disorders; however, the exact nature of the differences and their clinical significance remain unclear. here we review recent literature comparing electroencephalogram coherence patterns between patients with autism spectrum disorders or at high risk for autism and their non-autistic or low-risk for autism peers.
attention	exosomes are naturally occurring extracellular vesicles released by most mammalian cells in all body fluids. exosomes are known as key mediators in cell-cell communication and facilitate the transfer of genetic and biochemical information between distant cells. structurally, exosomes are composed of lipids, proteins, and also several types of rnas which enable these vesicles to serve as important disease biomarkers. moreover, exosomes have emerged as novel drug and gene delivery tools owing to their multiple advantages over conventional delivery systems. recently, increasing attention has been focused on exosomes for the delivery of drugs, including therapeutic recombinant proteins, to various target tissues. exosomes are also promising vehicles for the delivery of micrornas and small interfering rnas, which is usually hampered by rapid degradation of these rnas, as well as inefficient tissue specificity of currently available delivery strategies. this review highlights the most recent accomplishments and trends in the use of exosomes for the delivery of drugs and therapeutic rna molecules.
attention	freedom is one of the central values in political and moral philosophy. a number of theorists hold that freedom (or, relatedly, opportunity) should either be the only or at least one of the central distribuenda in our theories of distributive justice. moreover, many follow mill and hold that a concern for personal freedom should guide, and limit, how paternalist public policy can be. for the most part, theorists have focussed on a person 's freedom at one specific point in time but have failed to give proper attention to freedom across time. given that we care about personal freedom now, we have reason to care about future freedom too. but what kind of distribution of freedom across a person 's lifetime should we promote as a matter of legislation and public policy? i argue that none of the candidate principles for the distribution of freedom across time is plausible. neither a starting gate view, nor a maximisation nor a sufficientarian view is satisfactory, because none adequately reflects our various reasons to value freedom. i show that this result presents a tough challenge for theories of distributive justice and paternalism that set great store by personal freedom.
person_perception	we investigated how the evaluation of ethicality that precedes ethical decision making is influenced by personal and situational factors. we argued that both individual and contextual factors would simultaneously influence ethicality evaluation. we found that employees' regulatory focus significantly influenced their evaluation of supervisors' ethical leadership (n = 40 supervisors and 142 employees). we also found that contextual factors interacted with individual factors in the ethicality evaluation process. results showed that a positive relationship between employees' promotion focus and their evaluation of their supervisor 's ethical leadership was negatively moderated by the supervisor 's moral attentiveness. theoretical and practical implications and limitations in the study are discussed.
media_violence	new media formats and technologies raise questions about new-found abilities to indulge apparently limitless violent and sadistic curiosity within our culture. in this context, the mainstreaming of sex and violence via mobile and screen media systems opens important questions about the degree to which these influences are harmful or indicative of deeper social problems. in this article, we offer a preliminary analysis of the consequences of these new media zones, acknowledging their allure, excitement and everyday cultural position. in particular, we focus on a distinctive hallmark of much online pornography and massively popular violent video games-the offer of unchecked encounters with others who can be subordinated to violent and sexual desire. we suggest that a key implication of these zones of cultural exception, in which social rules can be more or less abandoned, is their role in further assisting denials of harm from the perspective of hyper-masculinist and militaristic social value systems.
social_cognition	people use at least two strategies to solve the challenge of understanding another person 's mind: inferring that person 's perspective by reading his or her behavior (theorization) and getting that person 's perspective by experiencing his or her situation (simulation). the five experiments reported here demonstrate a strong tendency for people to underestimate the value of simulation. predictors estimated a stranger 's emotional reactions toward 50 pictures. they could either infer the stranger 's perspective by reading his or her facial expressions or simulate the stranger 's perspective by watching the pictures he or she viewed. predictors were substantially more accurate when they got perspective through simulation, but overestimated the accuracy they had achieved by inferring perspective. predictors' miscalibrated confidence stemmed from overestimating the information revealed through facial expressions and underestimating the similarity in people 's reactions to a given situation. people seem to underappreciate a useful strategy for understanding the minds of others, even after they gain firsthand experience with both strategies.
seasonal_affective_disorder	circadian typology (morning-type, neither-type, and evening-type) is an individual difference which has been related to numerous aspects of mental health. in this paper we present a review of the findings published on this topic. after searching in-the main databases a total number of 70 works were selected, published in. spanish and english from 1990 to 2012 collected in the databases isi scopus and medline. these works show that individuals with evening-type typology exhibit a greater prevalence of seasonal affective disorder, mayor depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, sleep disorders, addictive behaviours, adhd, and higher anxiety levels than morning-type typology individuals. in this sense, the evening-type is considered as a factor of risk whereas the morning-type would be a protective factor for the development of several mental disorders. this could be a result of clock gene polymorphisms, social jet lag and some personality traits. circadian typology must be considered in the evaluation, treatment and prevention of the mental disorders, as it affects to the start, course, remission and relapse of diverse problems of mental health. chronobiological therapy must be also considered in the therapeutic approaching when the circadian rhythmical expression is altered.
prejudice	a crucial element of navigating group conflict is how group members manage stigma imposed on them by other groups. across three experiments, we propose that group identification is a cause and consequence of self-labeling with stigmatizing group labels, a practice known to reduce stigma. experiment 1 found that group identification increased self-labeling with a stigmatizing group label. in experiment 2, individuals who self-labeled with a stigmatizing group label felt more identified with their group, which reduced the label 's perceived negativity; they also persisted longer on an in-group helping task, an effect that was partially mediated by group identification. in experiment 3, observers perceived self-labelers as more identified with their group and as viewing the label less negatively; perceived group identification mediated the relationship. group identification is a critical component in reappropriating stigmatizing labels and provides insight into how highly identified members can navigate group conflict by negotiating their group 's identity.
eating_disorders	objective: eating disorders (ed) and obesity are suggested to involve a spectrum of self-regulatory control difficulties. temporal discounting (td) tasks have been used to explore this idea, this systematic review examines behavioural and neuroimaging td data in ed and obesity. method: using prisma guidelines, we reviewed relevant articles in medline, psycinfo and embase from inception until 17th august 2016, studies that reported behavioural differences in td and/or td neuroimaging data in ed/obesity were included. results: thirty-one studies were included. limited data suggest that bn, bed and obesity are associated with increased td, whilst data in an are mixed. aberrant neural activity in frontostriatal circuitry is implicated. td tasks vary widely and td in ed/obesity may vary according to factors such as illness stage. conclusion: our findings suggest altered self-regulatory control in ed and obesity. td tasks are heterogeneous, limiting generalisability of findings, research into whether td is multidimensional, along with transdiagnostic neuroimaging research is needed. assessment of to may be useful in psychoeducation, outcome prediction and treatment of ed/obesity.

attention	lamno3 has attracted significant attention as energy conversion and storage materials, and especially as a promising noble-metal-free oxide catalyst and a new kind of electrode material for supercapacitors. however, the poor electronic transport ability of lamno3 hinders its application. thus, improvement of its electronic transport ability is essential to enhance the electron transfer from catalyst active sites to an electrode, which is effective to avoid ohmic potential drop and consequently energy loss. in this work, the high-quality epitaxial growth la-deficiency la0.9mno3 films were obtained by a simple and low cost polymer assisted deposition method. it is found that the room-temperature conductivity (sigma) of doping la0.9mno3 increases nearly ten times compared to that of the parent lamno3. the oxygen-content-driven enhancement of the conductivity is discussed for the oriented la0.9mno3 film. it is suggested that the existence of the laalo3 substrate is beneficial to stabilize the la-deficiency la0.9mno3 compound and a-site la-deficiency extends the range of oxygen content. both strain (including epitaxial strain and doping induced chemical strain) and annealing temperature are cooperating on the oxygen content, resulting in the oxygen stoichiometry independence of ambient conditions and the high conductivity. following this process, conductivity and electronic state of the perovskite-related material can be tuned for the practical application.
prejudice	advanced grammar courses often present standardized grammar rules to students without considering sociolinguistic variation. as a result, many native/heritage students feel that they speak incorrectly, and many second language learners do not get an accurate picture of the target language 's real-world grammar. this article describes and evaluates a unique approach to teaching advanced spanish grammar to university students. the curriculum focuses on core grammatical content by studying structures that are subject to sociolinguistic variation, as in habia approximate to habian dos ranas [there was approximate to were two frogs], and it highlights the sociopolitical factors that explain why some forms are deemed prestigious. to test the efficacy of this curriculum, students enrolled in an advanced spanish grammar course at a large university in the southwestern united states completed a pre- and posttest that measured spanish grammar knowledge, awareness of sociolinguistic concepts, and positive language attitudes. results showed statistically significant gains with respect to knowledge of grammar and sociolinguistics. students also demonstrated a heightened awareness of how prejudice can manifest in judgments of spoken language.
person_perception	social projection and self-stereotyping are rival explanations for self-other correspondence, in which people tend to perceive a high degree of similarity between themselves and others. the present research shows that both accounts are correct-that is, that knowledge of the self and knowledge of others are mutually constraining. in study 1, participants whose self-views were experimentally manipulated revised their judgments of an immediate ingroup. in study 2, an analogous manipulation of ingroup traits altered participants' self-views. in study 3, participants who were ascribed a trait readily projected to and stereotyped from their relevant ingroup, but not to or from an outgroup. finally, study 4 provides reaction-latency evidence for social projection and self-stereotyping as judgmental processes leading to self-other correspondence. in this task, participants referenced self-knowledge when reaching ingroup-descriptiveness judgments (evidence for social projection) and ingroup knowledge when judging the self (evidence for self-stereotyping). implications for the debate between protocentric and egocentric accounts of person perception are discussed.
child_abuse	parenting behaviors are influenced by numerous factors, including individual, family, and community contexts. ecological systems theory suggests that these systems as well as interactions among the systems coalesce to influence the parent/child relationship in multiple ways. when challenges exist within and across these systems, child abuse and neglect can occur. while a significant body of research has delved into parsing the relative importance of neighborhood-level versus individual-level predictors, little is known about the complex ways in which interactions across ecological systems might enhance or hinder parenting behaviors. the current study seeks to fill this gap by answering the following research question: (1) are there interactive effects of individual and neighborhood poverty on the risk of child maltreatment? structural equation modeling was used to analyze data from 946 parents at special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (wic) clinics in franklin county, ohio. living in higher poverty neighborhoods is associated with higher levels of maltreatment irrespective of individual poverty status, but there is not a corresponding decrease for those living in lower poverty neighborhoods. these findings suggest that both individual poverty status and neighborhood poverty matter for child maltreatment and that there does not appear to be a compounding effect of being both poor and in a poor neighborhood, nor is there a protective effect when poor but living in a nonpoor neighborhood.

attention	individuals with psychopathy are often characterized by emotional processing deficits, and recent research has examined the specific contexts and cognitive mechanisms that underlie these abnormalities. some evidence suggests that abnormal features of attention are fundamental to emotional deficits in persons with psychopathy, but few studies have demonstrated the neural underpinnings responsible for such effects. here, we use functional neuroimaging to examine attention-emotion interactions among incarcerated individuals (n = 120) evaluated for psychopathic traits using the hare psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r). using a task designed to manipulate attention to emotional features of visual stimuli, we demonstrate effects representing implicit emotional processing, explicit emotional processing, attention-facilitated emotional processing, and vigilance for emotional content. results confirm the importance of considering mechanisms of attention when evaluating emotional processing differences related to psychopathic traits. the affective-interpersonal features of psychopathy (pcl-r factor 1) were associated with relatively lower emotion-dependent augmentation of activity in visual processing areas during implicit emotional processing, while antisocial-lifestyle features (pcl-r factor 2) were associated with elevated activity in the amygdala and related salience network regions. during explicit emotional processing, psychopathic traits were associated with upregulation in the medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and superior frontal regions. isolating the impact of explicit attention to emotional content, only factor 1 was related to upregulation of activity in the visual processing stream, which was accompanied by increased activity in the angular gyrus. these effects highlight some important mechanisms underlying abnormal features of attention and emotional processing that accompany psychopathic traits.
false_memories	sleep is known to affect learning and memory, but the extent to which it influences behavioural processing in the left and right hemispheres of the brain is as yet unknown. we tested two hypotheses about lateralised effects of sleep on recognition memory for words: whether sleep reactivated recent experiences of words promoting access to the long-term store in the left hemisphere (lh), and whether sleep enhanced spreading activation differentially in semantic networks in the hemispheres. in experiment 1, participants viewed lists of semantically related words, then slept or stayed awake for 12 h before being tested on seen, unseen but related, or unrelated words presented to the left or the right hemisphere. sleep was found to promote word recognition in the lh, and to spread activation equally within semantic networks in both hemispheres. experiment 2 ensured that the results were not due to time of day effects influencing cognitive performance.

leadership	safety remains a major challenge in the construction industry throughout the world, yet there are very few longitudinal or quasi-longitudinal studies in this domain. this paper demonstrates how a quasi-longitudinal study can provide insight into safety performance. a comparison is made between two cross-sectional studies: 911 questionnaires collected from construction workers between 2004 and 2006, and 802 collected between 2014 and 2015 in ontario, canada. the data comprised demographic factors, 13 safety climate factors, and three safety outcome categories. rates of injury, stress, and safety events reduced overall since 2004, although the change was significant only for events. findings show improved consistency in safety awareness among participants independent of employers, suggesting that regionwide safety programs have been effective. safety climate factors accounted for 15-20% of the variance in safety outcomes, down from 2004. interpersonal conflict at work is strongly related to all safety outcome types. participants with 11-15years of experience reported the highest safety incident rates in all categories, a trend that was not observed 10years earlier. safety managers may consider broadening their safety programs, which often target new workers, to ensure that all workers are reminded of safe work practices.

prejudice	creating a socially conscious educational environment is an imperative if health care practitioners are to have a significant impact on health inequities. the effects of practitioner bias, prejudice, and discrimination on health and health outcomes have been well documented in the literature. individuals being trained to provide health care will be entering into an increasingly diverse world and must be equipped with the appropriate knowledge and skills in order to meet the needs of those seeking their care. cultural competency training in medical education has evolved over the past 15 years since the institute of medicine 's 2002 report, unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care. as research on the effectiveness of this training has emerged, several authors have called for the integration of antiracism training into the cultural competency curriculum, but few have found effective ways of doing so. this article describes the approach of one midwifery program in order to inform clinical education programs across the spectrum of health care practitioners.
social_cognition	extensive studies have reported cognitive abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (asd). another line of evidence suggests that stress also affects cognitive functions. in this study, we investigated whether there were associations between stress hormones and cognitive functions in asd and typically developing (td) children. cognitive functions in asd and td children were evaluated with a battery of psychological tests for working memory, behavioral flexibility, and social cognition for emotional assessments of others. asd children exhibited higher hair and salivary cortisol, which reflects chronic and acute stress hormone levels of subjects, respectively, than td children. autism-spectrum quotient (aq) was positively correlated with hair cortisol and the scores of spence children 's anxiety scale in asd children. in addition, a negative correlation was present between spatial working memory performance and hair cortisol in asd, but not in td, children. these results suggest that chronic stress hormone elevation may have relationships with some aspects of cognitive dysfunction in asd subjects.

seasonal_affective_disorder	health aspect of daylight has been revalued in recent years. whereas, urban congestion with multistory buildings and architectural design to minimize daylight openings for high energy performance of buildings tend to constrain people from enjoying benefits of daylight in buildings. the urban building act was established in 1919 in japan, and the building standard law replaced it in 1950 for protection of life, health and property of the nation and public welfare. the building standard law provides regulations on sunlight and daylighting such as restrictions of the height and form of buildings and requirements for daylight openings. but, those regulations have been gradually relaxed with urban growth. this paper outlines historical changes in japanese regulations and standards for sunlight and daylighting as an example. and it discusses challenges in future development or revision of international standards for sunlight and daylighting, especially in inclusion of criteria for health.
leadership	research has demonstrated that military service members are at elevated risk for a range of psychiatric problems, and mental health services use is a conduit to symptom reduction and remission. nonetheless, there is a notable underutilization of mental health services in this population. this systematic review aimed to identify and critically examine: (1) rates of service use; (2) barriers and facilitators to care; and (3) programs and interventions designed to enhance willingness to seek care and increase help-seeking behaviors among current military personnel (e.g., active duty, national guard, reserve). overall, 111 peer-reviewed articles were identified for inclusion. across studies, the rate of past-year service use among service members with mental health problems during the same time frame was 29.3% based on weighted averages. studies identified common barriers to care (e.g., concerns regarding stigma, career impact) and facilitators to care (e.g., positive attitudes toward treatment, family/friend support, military leadership support) among this population. although programs (e.g., screening, gatekeeper training) have been developed to reduce these barriers, leverage facilitators, and encourage service use, further research is needed to empirically test the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing rates of service utilization. critical areas for future research on treatment engagement among this high-risk population are discussed.

nonverbal_communication	the article acquaints with the means of dramatherapeutic intervention in two addictions departments - the centre for secondary prevention and addiction treatment at the military hospital in olomouc and the toxicorehabilitation department at the psychiatric hospital in kromeriz. the first department runs a detoxification and short-term (one month) intervention programme while in mandala, a medium-term (as long as half a year) dramatherapeutic programme is being implemented. the second part of the text presents the results of an enquiry focused on tracing the differences (connections) between the clients' perception of benefits and overall concept of the dramatherapeutic intervention at the above said departments. the implementation of a questionnaire method did not reveal differences between evaluations of the clients of both departments.
nonverbal_communication	patients with alzheimer 's disease (ad) show cognitive and behavioral disorders, which they and their caregivers have difficulties to cope with in daily life. psychological symptoms seem to be increased by impaired emotion processing in patients, this ability being linked to social cognition and thus essential to maintain good interpersonal relationships. non-verbal emotion processing is a genuine way to communicate, especially so for patients whose language may be rapidly impaired. many studies focus on emotion identification in ad patients, mostly by means of facial expressions rather than emotional prosody; even fewer consider emotional prosody production, despite its playing a key role in interpersonal exchanges. the literature on this subject is scarce with contradictory results. the present study compares the performances of 14 ad patients (88.4 +/- 4.9 yrs; mmse: 19.9 +/- 2.7) to those of 14 control subjects (87.5 +/- 5.1 yrs; mmse: 28.1 +/- 1.4) in tasks of emotion identification through faces and voices (non linguistic vocal emotion or emotional prosody) and in a task of emotional prosody production (12 sentences were to be pronounced in a neutral, positive, or negative tone, after a context was read). the alzheimer 's disease patients showed weaker performances than control subjects in all emotional recognition tasks and particularly when identifying emotional prosody. a negative relation between the identification scores and the npi (professional caregivers) scores was found which underlines their link to psychological and behavioral disorders. the production of emotional prosody seems relatively preserved in a mild to moderate stage of the disease: we found subtle differences regarding acoustic parameters but in a qualitative way judges established that the patients' productions were as good as those of control subjects. these results suggest interesting new directions for improving patients' care.
eating_disorders	aims: large-scale epidemiological studies show a significant prevalence of gambling disorder (gd) during adolescence and emerging adulthood, and highlight the need to identify gambling-related behaviors at early ages. however, there are only a handful of screening instruments for this population and many studies measuring youth gambling problems use adult instruments that may not be developmentally appropriate. the aim of this study was to validate a spanish version of the canadian adolescent gambling inventory (cagi) among late adolescent and young adults and to explore its psychometric properties. methods: the sample (16-29 years old) included a clinical group (n = 55) with gd patients and a control group (n = 340). results: exploratory factor analysis yielded one factor as the best model. this 24item scale demonstrated satisfactory reliability (internal consistency, cronbach 's alpha, alpha = 0.91), satisfactory convergent validity as measured by correlation with south oaks gambling screen (r = 0.74), and excellent classification accuracy (auc = 0.99; sensitivity = 0.98; and specificity = 0.99). conclusion: our results provide empirical support for our validation of the spanish version of the cagi. we uphold that the spanish cagi can be used as a brief, reliable, and valid instrument to assess gambling problems in spanish youth.
schizophrenia	cigarette smoking during the prenatal period has been investigated as a causative factor of obstetric abnormalities, which lead to cognitive and behavioural changes associated with schizophrenia. the aim of this study was to investigate behaviour and ache activity in brain structures in adult rats exposed to cigarette smoke during the prenatal period. pregnant rats were divided into non-pose (non-prenatal cigarette smoke exposure) and pcse (prenatal cigarette smoke exposure) groups. on post-natal day 60, the rats received saline or ketamine for 7 days and were subjected to behavioural tasks. in the locomotor activity task, the non-pcse + ketamine and pcse + ketamine groups exhibited increased locomotor activity compared with the saline group. in the social interaction task, the non-pcse + ketamine and pcse + ketamine groups exhibited an increased latency compared with the control groups. however, the pcse + ketamine group exhibited a decreased latency compared with the non-pcse + ketamine group, which indicates that the cigarette exposure appeared to decrease, the social deficits generated by ketamine. in the inhibitory avoidance task, the non-pcse + ketamine, pcse, and pcse + ketamine groups exhibited impairments in working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. in the pre-pulse inhibition (ppi) test, cigarette smoke associated with ketamine resulted in impaired ppi in 3 pre-pulse (pp) intensity groups compared with the control groups. in the biochemical analysis, the ache activity in brain structures increased in the ketamine groups; however, the pcse + ketamine group exhibited an exacerbated effect in all brain structures. the present study indicates that exposure to cigarette smoke during the prenatal period may affect behaviour and cerebral cholinergic structures during adulthood (c) 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
schizophrenia	objective: the objective of this study is to develop a new solubility enhancement strategy of antipsychotic drug - perphenazine (ppz) - in the form of its amorphous nanoparticle complex (or nanoplex) with polyelectrolyte dextran sulfate (dxt). significance: poor bioavailability of ppz necessitated the development of fast-dissolving ppz formulations regardless of delivery routes. existing fast-dissolving formulations, however, exhibited low ppz payload. the high-payload ppz-dxt nanoplex represents an attractive fast-dissolving formulation, as dissolution rate is known to be proportional to payload. methods: the nanoplex was prepared by electrostatically driven complexation between ppz and dxt in a simple process that involved only ambient mixing of ppz and dxt solutions. we investigated the effects of key variables in drug-polyelectrolyte complexation (i.e. ph and charge ratio r-dxt/ppz) on the physical characteristics and preparation efficiency of the nanoplex produced. subsequently, we characterized the colloidal and amorphous state stabilities, dissolution enhancement, and supersaturation generation of the nanoplex prepared at the optimal condition. results: the physical characteristics of nanoplex were governed by r-dxt/ppz, while the preparation efficiency was governed by the preparation ph. nanoplex having size of approximate to 80nm, zeta potential of approximate to(-) 60mv, and payload of approximate to 70% (w/w) were prepared at nearly 90% ppz utilization rate and approximate to 60% yield. the nanoplex exhibited superior dissolution than native ppz in simulated intestinal juice, resulting in high and prolonged apparent solubility with good storage stabilities. conclusions: the simple yet efficient preparation, excellent physical characteristics, fast dissolution, and high apparent solubility exhibited by the ppz-dxt nanoplex established its potential as a new bioavailability enhancement strategy of ppz.
gender_roles	reality television is a highly popular genre, with a growing body of scholarly research. unlike scripted programming, which offers fictional storylines, reality television relies heavily on cast member 's reactions to carefully crafted situations. this study examined the relationship between reality television and gender role stereotyping in a seminal reality television show, mtv 's jersey shore. content analysis was used to conduct an in-depth examination of the first season of jersey shore, investigating three gendered issues: physical appearance, social roles and behavioral traits. findings demonstrated the carefully manufactured relationship between gender role stereotyping and reality television programming in jersey shore, and illustrate the development of the female reality show character as related to sexualized behavior and social/emotional gender stereotypes. the depiction of female reality show characters seems to have increased its level of sensationalism, while continuing to be cliched and conventional, while depiction of male characters is beginning to push the boundaries of being typecast in regards to their physical appearance and role in performing domestic tasks. additionally, physical alterations on screen were many, warranting further investigation of this behavior.
problem-solving	in this paper, a node adaptive rearrangement is presented based on the estimated error in various domains for some problems in the fracture mechanics by discrete least-squares meshless method (dlsm). this method is one of the approximate methods recently introduced and used in the various fields. the method is based on minimization of the least-squares functional with respect to the nodal parameters, and it uses moving least-squares method for calculating the shape functions. due to the natural process of problem solving, after calculating the shape functions, the residuals are calculated and their values are considered as an objective function for rearrangement of the nodes. there are three popular methods for constructing shape functions in discontinuous domains, and here, the transparency method is utilized. similar to other numerical methods, there are different procedures for refinement and improvement of the results; however, adaptive rearrangement can be employed without increasing the computational cost. in this paper, the charged system search (css) algorithm is used as a tool for adaptive rearrangement or repositioning process. efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed adaptive rearrangement technique is tested by some benchmark two-dimensional crack examples with available analytical solution around crack tips.

gender_roles	the purpose of this article is to analyze the persuasive and preventing actions that social workers carried out in the radial stations of la plata city. these actions put pressure on gender roles and the established duties of their professional performance. it is based on two wider interests: first of all, to recover and rethink the social working history understanding social workers beyond medical prescriptions and gender roles. secondly, this article considers the relevance of local narrations to generate other points of view about women participation in the history of social working. the first part of the article introduces the characteristics of the school of social workers of hygiene of the university of la plata, and in the second section, it is focused on the participation of the social workers of hygiene as radial conference speakers.
problem-solving	the current study sought to assess the content validity and internal consistency of the peak generalization module. eighty-four children with autism were evaluated using the peak generalization assessment to ascertain the presence or absence of 184 language and learning skills within the child 's repertoire. following the assessment, a principal component analysis was run yielding a four-component model of the peak generalization module. specifically, components possessing eigenvalues greater than 3 and that had at least one item which was most strongly correlated to them were retained. items were then sorted into the various components based on their correlation scores within the rotated component matrix generated by the principal component analysis. following the establishment of the four-component model, the internal consistency of the model was tested using cronbach 's alphas which indicated strong internal consistency in the overall peak-g assessment as well as each of the four underlying components. the four components identified include the constructs of foundational learning and basic social skills, basic verbal comprehension, memory, and advanced social skills, advanced verbal comprehension, reading and writing, and basic problem solving skills, and verbal reasoning, problem solving, logic, and mathematical skills. with the increased demand for evidence-based intervention as the number of individuals with diagnoses of autism rises, the present data provide support for a conceptually systematic behavior analytic approach to the treatment of children with autism.
media_violence	adolescents' access to and use of new media technology (e.g., cell phone, personal data assistant, computer for internet access) are on the rise, and this explosion of technology brings with it potential benefits and risks. attention is growing about the risk of adolescents to become victims of aggression perpetrated by peers with new technology. in september 2006, the centers for disease control and prevention convened a panel of experts in technology and youth aggression to examine this specific risk. this special issue of the journal of adolescent health presents the data and recommendations for future directions discussed at the meeting. the articles in the journal support the argument that electronic aggression is an emerging public health problem in need of additional prevalence and etiological research to support the development and evaluation of effective prevention programs.

seasonal_affective_disorder	food is a potent natural reward and food intake is a complex process. reward and gratification associated with food consumption leads to dopamine (da) production, which in turn activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. an individual will repeatedly eat a particular food to experience this positive feeling of gratification. this type of repetitive behavior of food intake leads to the activation of brain reward pathways that eventually overrides other signals of satiety and hunger. thus, a gratification habit through a favorable food leads to overeating and morbid obesity. overeating and obesity stems from many biological factors engaging both central and peripheral systems in a bi-directional manner involving mood and emotions. emotional eating and altered mood can also lead to altered food choice and intake leading to overeating and obesity. research findings from human and animal studies support a two-way link between three concepts, mood, food, and obesity. the focus of this article is to provide an overview of complex nature of food intake where various biological factors link mood, food intake, and brain signaling that engages both peripheral and central nervous system signaling pathways in a bi-directional manner in obesity.
leadership	purpose: this study discusses the process of co-constructing a prototype pedagogical model for working with youth from socially vulnerable backgrounds.participants and settings: this six-month activist research project was conducted in a soccer program in a socially vulnerable area of brazil in 2013. the study included 17 youths, 4 coaches, a pedagogic coordinator and a social worker. an expert in student-centered pedagogy and inquiry-based activism assisted as a debriefer helping in the progressive data analysis and the planning of the work sessions.data collection/analysis: multiple sources of data were collected, including 38 field journal/observation and audio records of: 18 youth work sessions, 16 coaches' work sessions, 3 combined coaches and youth work sessions, and 37 meetings between the researcher and the expert.findings: the process of co-construction of this prototype pedagogical model was divided into three phases. the first phase involved the youth and coaches identifying barriers to sport opportunities in their community. in the second phase, the youth, coaches and researchers imagined alternative possibilities to the barriers identified. in the final phase, we worked collaboratively to create realistic opportunities for the youth to begin to negotiate some of the barriers they identified. in this phase, the coaches and youth designed an action plan to implement (involving a leadership program) aimed at addressing the youths' needs in the sport program. five critical elements of a prototype pedagogical model were co-created through the first two processes and four learning aspirations emerged in the last phase of the project.implications: we suggest an activist approach of co-creating a pedagogical model of sport for working with youth from socially vulnerable backgrounds is beneficial. that is, creating opportunities for youth to learn to name, critique and negotiate barriers to their engagement in sport in order to create empowering possibilities.
leadership	this study analyses the presence of gender segregation in spanish exporting firms. both women 's access to managerial positions (vertical segregation) and women 's achievement of managerial roles that are socially associated with communal attributes (horizontal segregation) are tested. we argue that boundary-spanning (henceforth, boundary management) in export interfirm relationships benefits from relational and communal skills and therefore could not only offer an opportunity for women to gain access to management positions but also put them at risk of falling into a rut before achieving other control-based managerial roles. this empirical study examines the characteristics (personal and firm-level) of spanish female managers in charge of export management through independent channels. a multivariate analysis has been performed to compare female managers with male managers both in boundary management and in the position of finance director, a control position closer to a socially stereotyped masculine role. the results show that women have slightly higher access to boundary management jobs than finance management jobs, as well as a significantly lower promotion time than male colleagues, but they also corroborate that there is a smaller percentage of women than men in any management positions, with female managers working in younger firms with fewer resources for export activity.

child_abuse	background. dental health care professionals play an important role as mandated advocates when health care neglect is suspected in children; however, there is some confusion around what constitutes child neglect. methods. the authors reviewed the dental literature for descriptors and definitions of neglect. they studied the individual state statutes to learn the protection afforded for both victims of neglect and for health care providers acting on behalf of such children. they also reviewed methods of action to address suspected neglect. results. the authors found confusion around what is or is not child neglect. yet, dental professionals are tasked by the law, and by a moral code, to protect children from neglect. the authors offer a definition of neglect and suggested practice guidelines to assist the practitioner acting as a child 's advocate. conclusions. clinicians can use strategies to address the problem of child neglect. a digital data treatment registry may provide additional views of a child 's health status. practical implications. with a better understanding of the definition of neglect, strategies can be implemented for use by the dental team to address this problem of neglect and reduce its incidence.
media_violence	objectives to examine the independent associations between television, computer, and video game use with physical violence in youth. methods the study population consisted of a representative cross-sectional sample of 9,672 canadian youth in grades 6-10 and a 1-year longitudinal sample of 1,861 youth in grades 9-10. the number of weekly hours watching television, playing video games, and using a computer was determined. violence was defined as engagement in >= 2 physical fights in the previous year and/or perpetration of >= 2-3 monthly episodes of physical bullying. logistic regression was used to examine associations. results in the cross-sectional sample, computer use was associated with violence independent of television and video game use. video game use was associated with violence in girls but not boys. television use was not associated with violence after controlling for the other screen time measures. in the longitudinal sample, video game use was a significant predictor of violence after controlling for the other screen time measures. conclusions computer and video game use were the screen time measures most strongly related to violence in this large sample of youth.
nonverbal_communication	seeking proximity to another person immediately expresses affiliafive intentions. these are highly relevant after experiencing social exclusion. through a novel task, the current study investigated the relation between proximity and observed ostracism during early childhood. a sample of 64 children (m-age = 58 months) first watched priming videos either depicting ostracism or not. subsequently, children saw four seats of varying distances from an interactant 's seat and chose where to sit. children who observed social exclusion selected seats with higher proximity. the results suggest that young preschoolers can immediately express the threatened need to belong by literally getting closer to even a stranger after witnessing ostracism. the task provides new opportunities to test reactions to social exclusion during early childhood.

media_violence	this paper discusses opportunities as well as constraints of evidence based policy and evidence based practice in education. expectations held by different strands of the public (policy makers, teachers, parents) are discussed as constraint of the underlying educational research. furthermore, such expectations constrain the communication between researchers and the public (a case of science communication). these relationships between educational research, evidence based policy and communication between research and the public are exemplified by case studies on three topics: the impact of violent computer games, the relationship between class size and students' learning outcomes and the issue of streaming in public schools.
gender_roles	a very high number of learners take part in massive open online courses (moocs) anywhere and at any time. some researchers give a broad overview about typical learners in moocs, but many questions about social, cultural and ethical dimensions of elearning are not answered yet. notwithstanding the above, there are a lot of worldwide initiatives for supporting girls and women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem). nevertheless in some countries, especially in western europe, we are still far away from gender parity in stem. in line with these two aspects this paper focuses on 100.000 learners from more than 190 countries (data collected since 2012 and enhanced with survey data) who take part in moocs on computer sciences offered by the online learning platform ""openhpi"". our primary interest concerns to the following research questions from a sociological point of view: who takes part in stem-moocs (selectivity)? which factors influence the successful participation of men and women in stem-moocs and under which conditions are moocs able to promote gender diversity in stem (e.g. second-chance education and re-entry into the labor market)? the aim of this paper is to raise the potential of moocs to educate underrepresented groups in specific fields like women in stem by analyzing the learning behavior of different kinds of people and giving recommendations for further mooc offers. therefore we analyze elearning in moocs in regard of the following social, cultural and ethical dimensions: o age, gender, socio-demographic background, subject field, working experience, social interaction among students (in the forum and in learning groups) and between students and teachers/tutors; o country of residence, values, gender roles; o fairness (e.g. in behalf of peer assessment) and conformity with regulations (e.g. concerning the communication via the forum). we report new results of our multivariate statistics and give recommendations for attracting more women to take part in stem-moocs, e.g. with regard to the role of teachers, course design, learning materials, examples and speech geared to a diverse target group and a suitable learning environment for a very heterogeneous group of learners.
schizophrenia	recently there is a growing interest in the interaction of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (ssd) and substance use disorders (sud), a condition named dual schizophrenia spectrum disorders (ssd+). while previous research has focused on clinical and cognitive aspects, little is known about the impact of comorbidity in the brain structure and functions. evidence suggests that dual diagnosis patients, including ssd+, show a better neurocognitive functioning during the first years of illness, followed by a serious long-term decline. the initial search retrieved 94 articles, 12 were excluded for being redundant and 49 for not fulfilling the selection criteria. thirty-three structural and functional neuroimaging studies that compare ssd and ssd+ patients were included. both groups exhibited more brain alterations, in comparison to only sud patients and healthy controls. ssd+ patients are less cognitively and emotionally impaired than non-dual ssd, but worse than healthy controls. the neurobiological alterations are prominent in ssd+ after five years of illness or longer. moreover, sud characteristics are important modulating factors, contrary to clinical severity or specific ssd diagnosis.

false_memories	studies examining hemispheric asymmetries in false memory have shown that the right hemisphere (rh) is more susceptible to false memories compared to the left hemisphere (lh). theories suggest that hemispheric asymmetries in true and false memory may be due to differences in representational coding and the use of top-down mechanisms in each hemisphere. in the current study, the deese-roediger-mcdermott false memory paradigmwas used in conjunction with divided visual field presentation to examine the role of top-down mechanisms in hemispheric asymmetries of true and false memory. in experiment 1, participants studied lists of related words while completing secondary cognitive load tasks. in experiment 2, the secondary tasks were administered during memory retrieval instead of memory encoding. results revealed that cognitive loads imposed during the study phase influenced veridical memory in the lh more than the rh, but cognitive loads imposed during retrieval did not influence veridical memory in either hemisphere. surprisingly, false memory rates were not influenced by cognitive loads and were higher in the lh. these data provide evidence that, at least for veridical memory, top-down control mechanisms are used more readily for the encoding of information into memory in the lh compared to the rh.
problem-solving	high school students in a chemistry course were challenged to prepare an improved lemon cake by means of statistical experimental design. they were introduced to basic statistical experimental design theory, calculation of effects, empirical mathematical models, response surfaces and their isocontour projections, as well as descriptive statistics. geogebra, a digital program for teaching and learning mathematics, was used to produce the mathematical models and response surface plots. assessment of the lemon cakes with regard to fluffiness (texture), lemon taste, and an overall rating required efficient planning of sensory panels. a slight extrapolation, that is, selection of the experimental setting outside the investigated domain, and assessment of the predicted procedure to check the reproducibility of the lemon cake recipe were also included in this project, which complements the next generation science standard.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objective and background: our aim was to characterize the association of 2 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6311 and rs6314) in the serotonin 2a receptor gene (htr2a) with severity of depression symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder. these polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with depression symptom severity and response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in adults with diagnosed depressive disorder. methods: parents of 104 children with autism spectrum disorder rated their children 's depressive symptoms using a validated scale based on criteria from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition. we compared severity of depression symptoms across the rs6311 and rs6314 genotypes, measured from the children 's genomic dna. results: children homozygous for the g allele of rs6311 had significantly more severe depression symptoms than those with g/a or a/a genotypes (p=0.025). the effect size (partial eta-squared) was small (eta p(2)=0.047) but was somewhat larger when we controlled for severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms (p=0.006, eta p(2)=0.072). when we restricted our analyses to white participants, our results were essentially the same as for the entire sample (p=0.004, eta p(2)=0.086). there was no significant association between rs6314 (c/c versus t carriers) and severity of depression. conclusions: our findings suggest that the htr2a functional rs6311 polymorphism, which other studies have associated with differential htr2a mrna expression, may modulate the severity of depression symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder. these tentative, hypothesis-generating findings need replication with larger, independent samples.
leadership	nowadays, although throughout europe the catholic, orthodox, muslim and protestant denominational identities remain among roma, the conversion rate would suggest the number of roma pentecostal will have numerically overtaken all the others in just a few years' time. the uniqueness of spanish gypsy pentecostalism contradicts some of the stereotypes of global pentecostalism and resides in its organisational complexity and hierarchical structure, its rapid institutionalisation as a sole church, the thorough theological training of its leaders, and its autonomy both from the state and from the european and latin american pentecostal roma movement. this article is structured around a life history and two concerns: (a) the role of the constant circulation of the gypsy evangelical ministers as regards charisma and leadership; (b) the growing transfer of prestige from the respected gypsy elders to the young evangelical pastors and their role in wide pacification processes involving ethnic cohesion and kinship.
eating_disorders	this article demonstrates that a loss of personal control leads to an increase in self-regulatory behavior. this occurs because a loss of control puts consumers at a deficit relative to one of the major lessons they learn during their childhood, which is to have control over the outcomes of their actions. this deficit triggers a compensatory process focused on following other lessons that consumers believe they learned during their childhood. because exerting self-regulation is another major lesson parents emphasize, consumers engage in self-regulatory behavior to compensate for a loss of personal control. however, when consumers believe their parents emphasized self-regulation less strongly during childhood (i. e., they believe their parents had a more permissive style), a loss of control can reduce self-regulatory behavior. these findings have implications for what we know about the effects of childhood experiences on adult consumer behavior, the importance of individuals' beliefs about childhood experiences in determining adult behavior, the consequences of low personal control, and the antecedents of self-regulatory behavior.
problem-solving	purpose - psychosocial risk factors and high rates of psychiatric comorbidity render individuals with autism spectrum disorders (asd) vulnerable to developing low self-esteem (lse). cognitive behaviour therapy (cbt) interventions are effective for enhancing self-esteem in typically developing populations, but the degree to which they are clinically beneficial for individuals with asd has been little explored. the paper aims to discuss these issues. design/methodology/approach - a pilot group intervention was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness and acceptability of cbt for lse in adults with asd. adaptations to standard protocols were made, in order to accommodate core asd characteristics. findings - four participants attended eight sessions: these comprised formulation of causal and maintaining mechanisms for lse, cognitive interventions designed to reduce self-criticism and promote a more balanced self-view, and behavioural interventions intended to increase engagement in enjoyable activities, and enhance problem-solving skills and assertiveness. self-report questionnaires were completed at four time points: baseline, at the first and last sessions, and at one-month follow-up. data analysis indicated no change in the primary self-esteem outcome measure. some improvements were noted on secondary outcomes, specifically in social anxiety and depressive symptoms, and general functioning. research limitations/implications - further studies are needed to determine how to design and deliver cbt interventions and techniques which target lse in individuals with asd. originality/value - this is one of the first cbt group interventions designed to address lse in adults with asd.
person_perception	national media consumer panels were conducted in taiwan to examine how the first-person and third-person perceptions would mediate the impacts of celebrity credibility on advertising skepticism. results revealed that (a) the third-person perceptions took place in the context of celebrity-endorsed advertising; (b) all three credibility variables were negatively correlated to advertising skepticism, but only celebrity attractiveness and expertise yielded direct effects; (c) indirect effects by the first-person perceptions were stronger than those by the third-person perceptions on advertising skepticism. theoretical and practical implication insights were discussed to indicate that taiwanese consumers did not want to be recognized as celebrity followers for a self-enhancement purpose. however, their first-person perceptions played a more active role than their third-person perceptions in mediating their perceived celebrity credibility and diminishing their skepticism toward celebrity-endorsed advertising.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: government strategy indicates that individuals with learning disabilities should have access to adapted psychological therapies. dialectical behaviour therapy (dbt) is recommended for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (bpd); however, there is little published research regarding whether it can be appropriately adapted for adults with learning disabilities. the research available primarily focuses on measures of behavioural and psychiatric change, with little emphasis on the psychological changes that occur. materials and methods: two case studies are presented that using repertory grid technique, based on personal construct psychology (pcp). both individuals completed repertory grids prior to, and following, adapted dbt for adults with learning disabilities within a specialist community psychology service in the united kingdom. results: the case studies show some of the psychological changes that have occurred within adults with learning disabilities who received adapted dbt within a community psychology service. changes included altered self-esteem and dilemmas individuals have about themselves. conclusion: the contrasting case studies demonstrate the complexity and idiosyncrasy of the experiences of individuals with learning disabilities who receive dbt, and discuss how this information can be integrated into clinical practice.
false_memories	flexible mnemonic mechanisms that adjust to different internal mental states can provide a major adaptive advantage. however, little is known regarding how this flexibility is achieved in the human brain. we examined brain activity during retrieval of false memories of a movie, generated by exposing participants to misleading information. half of the participants suspected the memory manipulation (distrustful), whereas the other half did not (naive). distrustful displayed more accurate memory performance and a brain signature different than that of naive. in distrustful, the ability to differentiate true from false information was driven by a qualitatively distinct hippocampal activity for endorsed items, consistent with the view that hippocampal encoding allows recollection of a specific source. conversely, in naive, bold differences between true and false memories were linearly correlated with accuracy across participants, suggesting that naive subjects needed to reinstate and evaluate stored information to discern true from false. we propose that our results lend support to models suggesting that hippocampal activity can exhibit different computational schemes, depending on memorandum attributes. furthermore, we show that trust, considered as a subjective state of mind, may alter basic hippocampal strategies, influencing the ability to separate real from false memory.

depression	caregivers of children living with hiv/aids (clwha) face unique challenges due to disease-related stigma and discrimination, isolation from society, financial constraints, grief and mortality of loved one. a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at udupi art centre to assess the caregiver burden, psychological distress and their associated factors among the caregivers of clwha in udupi district. the convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from 171 caregivers and analysed with the help of spss version 15.0. majority of caregivers were female (64.9%) with mean age of 38.1 +/- 9.6 years. about 64.3% caregivers were hiv-positive and 63.2% were biological parents of clwha. mild-to-severe caregiver burden on zarit burden inventory (zbi) was reported among 84.8% of caregivers, and mild-to-severe psychological distress on general health questionnaire (ghq-12) was reported among 49.7% caregivers. relationship with child was found to be a significant predictor of caregiver burden as compared to other relatives/foster (p<0.001). relationship with child (p 0.004), alcohol use (p 0.008) and schooling of children (p 0.049) were reported as significant predictors of psychological distress. study concludes that caregiver burden and psychological distress were high among caregivers of clwha. psychological problems of caregivers need to be addressed and integrated along with the clinical care of hiv-infected children at art centres.
depression	introduction: compared to the general population, veterans of the wars in afghanistan and iraq (oef/oif) are more likely to engage in hazardous alcohol use and meet criteria for mental health disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and major depressive disorder. less is known how distinct profiles of alcohol use behavior relate to mental health symptoms. method: the current study examined the extent that indicators of alcohol use (i.e., drinks per week, peak blood alcohol concentration, and alcohol-related problems) are categorized into different alcohol risk profiles utilizing a person-centered approach. we also examined how mental health symptoms (i.e., ptsd, depression, and anxiety-related symptoms) were associated with the alcohol risk profiles. participants were 252 veterans who reported consuming alcohol within the past month. results: latent profile analysis indicated a four-class solution yielded the best-fitting model, and profiles were named based on their respective levels and patterns of alcohol use. mental health symptoms were significantly different among the four profiles. profiles of veterans who endorsed more alcohol-related problems (i.e., the ""severe alcohol behavior"" and ""steady drinkers with functional impairment"") also reported comorbid clinical symptoms of ptsd, depression, and anxiety. the ""binge drinkers with no functional impairment"" and ""mild alcohol behavior"" profiles reported the lowest levels of mental health symptoms. discussion: findings highlight the unique relationship between distinct alcohol risk profiles and mental health outcomes. targeted interventions and treatment options based on unique alcohol risk profiles may be helpful in tailoring prevention and intervention efforts in detecting co-occurring mental health symptoms among oef/oif veterans.

seasonal_affective_disorder	background: circadian theories for major depressive disorder have suggested that the rhythm of the circadian pacemaker is misaligned. stable phase relationships between internal rhythms, such as temperature and rest/activity, and the external day-night cycle, are considered to be crucial for adapting to life in the external environmental. therefore, the relationship and possible alterations among (i) light exposure, (ii) activity rhythm, and (iii) temperature rhythm could be important factors in clinical depression. this study aimed to investigate the rhythmic alterations in depression and evaluate the ability of chronobiological parameters to discriminate between healthy subjects and depressed patients. methods: thirty female subjects, including healthy subjects, depressed patients in the first episode, and major recurrent depression patients. symptoms were assessed using hamilton depression scale, beck depression inventory and montgomery-asberg scale. motor activity, temperature, and light values were determined for 7 days by actigraph, and circadian rhythms were calculated. results: depressed groups showed a lower amplitude in the circadian rhythm of activity and light exposure, but a higher amplitude in the rhythm of peripheral temperature. the correlation between temperature and activity values was different in the day and night among the control and depressed groups. for the same level of activity, depressed patients had lowest temperature values during the day. the amplitudes of temperature and activity were the highest discriminant parameters. conclusions: these results indicate that the study of rhythms is useful for diagnosis and therapy for depressive mood disorders.
eating_disorders	the vermis or ""spinocerebellum"" receives input from the spinal cord and motor cortex for controlling balance and locomotion, while the longitudinal hemisphere region or ""cerebro-cerebellum"" is interconnected with non-motor cortical regions, including the prefrontal cortex that underlies decision-making. noradrenaline release in the cerebellum is known to be important for motor plasticity but less is known about plasticity of the cerebellar noradrenergic (na) system, itself. we characterized plasticity of dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive na fibers in the cerebellum of adolescent female rats that are evoked by voluntary wheel running, food restriction (fr) or by both, in combination. when 8 days of wheel access was combined with fr during the last 4 days, some responded with excessive exercise, choosing to run even during the hours of food access: this exacerbated weight loss beyond that due to fr alone. in the vermis, exercise, with or without fr, shortened the inter-varicosity intervals and increased varicosity density along na fibers, while excessive exercise, due to fr, also shortened na fibers. in contrast, the hemisphere required the fr-evoked excessive exercise to evoke shortened inter-varicosity intervals along na fibers and this change was exhibited more strongly by rats that suppressed the fr-evoked excessive exercise, a behavior that minimized weight loss. presuming that shortened inter-varicosity intervals translate to enhanced na release and synthesis of norepinephrine, this enhancement in the cerebellar hemisphere may contribute towards protection of individuals from the life-threatening activity-based anorexia via relays with higher-order cortical areas that mediate the animal 's decision to suppress the innate fr-evoked hyperactivity.
schizophrenia	depressed mood has a complex relationship with self-evaluation of personal competence in multiple populations. the absence of depression may be associated with overestimation of abilities, while mild depression seems to lead to accurate self-assessment. significant depression may lead to underestimation of functioning. in this study, we expand on our previous work by directly comparing the association between different levels of depression, everyday functioning, cognitive and functional capacity performance, and self-assessment of everyday functioning in a large (n = 406) sample of outpatients with schizophrenia. participants with very low self-reported depression overestimated their everyday functioning compared with informant reports. higher levels of depression were associated with more accurate self-assessment, but no subgroup of patients underestimated their functioning. depressive symptom severity was associated with poorer informant-rated social functioning, but there were no differences in vocational functioning, everyday activities, cognitive performance, and functional capacity associated with the severity of self-reported depression. there was minimal evidence of impact of depression on most aspects of everyday functioning and objective test performance and a substantial relationship between depression and accuracy of self-assessment.
prosocial_behavior	much of the research on birth order has focused on individual differences in personality traits, with relatively few studies focused on aspects of social behavior other than sibling conflict. however, one would predict that the differences in parental investment and niche differentiation that shape personality differences between siblings would also influence other social relationships. in particular, middleborns may be more likely to prioritize non-kin relationships. this study investigated the impact of birth order on a number of measures of prosocial behavior. results suggest that birth order has a moderate effect on prosociality such that later birth orders exhibit greater prosociality. however, both the linear and quadratic effects were significant and the quadratic was negative indicating that the greatest increase in prosociality is seen between first and secondborns, the rate of change decelerates as birth order and prosociality increase.

person_perception	surprisingly minimal appearance cues lead perceivers to accurately judge others' personality, status, or politics. we investigated people 's precision in judging characteristics of an unknown person, based solely on the shoes he or she wears most often. participants provided photographs of their shoes, and during a separate session completed self-report measures. coders rated the shoes on various dimensions, and these ratings were found to correlate with the owners' personal characteristics. a new group of participants accurately judged the age, gender, income, and attachment anxiety of shoe owners based solely on the pictures. shoes can indeed be used to evaluate others, at least in some domains.

child_abuse	although researchers have found that child welfare placement disruptions are associated with elevated youth physical and mental health problems, the mechanisms that explain this association have not been previously studied. the present study built on a previous investigation of the physical and behavioral consequences of long-term permanent placement patterns among youth who participated in the longitudinal studies of child abuse and neglect (longscan). the current investigation (n = 251) aimed to (a) report the early adolescent living situations of youth with different long-term placement patterns, and (b) to delineate the roles of adverse childhood experiences (aces) and post-traumatic stress (pts) reactions in the association between unstable long-term placement patterns and physical and mental health problems during the transition to adolescence. information about youth 's living situations, aces, and physical and mental health was gathered prospectively from child protective services records and biannual caregiver and youth interviews when youth were 4-14 years old. the majority of youth remained with the same caregiver during early adolescence, but youth with chronically unstable permanent placement patterns continued to experience instability. path analyses revealed that aces mediated the association between unstable placement patterns and elevated mental, but not physical, health problems during late childhood. additionally, late childhood pts mediated the association between unstable placement patterns and subsequent escalations in physical and mental health problems during the transition to adolescence. findings highlight the importance of long-term permanency planning for youth who enter the child welfare system and emphasize the importance of trauma-focused assessment and intervention for these youth.

schizophrenia	background: aripiprazole lauroxil is an extended-release prodrug of aripiprazole for intramuscular injection, approved for schizophrenia treatment. we developed a population pharmacokinetic (poppk) model to characterize aripiprazole lauroxil pk and evaluate dosing scenarios likely to be encountered in clinical practice. methods: data from 616 patients with schizophrenia, collected from 5 clinical studies, were used to construct the poppk model. the model was subsequently used to evaluate various dose levels and frequency and the impact of dosing delay on aripiprazole concentrations. findings: the results of the model indicate that aripiprazole is released into the systemic circulation after 5 to 6 days, and release continues for an additional 36 days. the slow increase in aripiprazole concentration after injection necessitates the coadministration of oral aripiprazole for 21 days with the first injection. based on the poppk model simulations, a dosing interval of 882 mg every 6 weeks results in aripiprazole concentrations that fall within the concentration range associated with the efficacious aripiprazole lauroxil dose range (441-882 mg dosed monthly). a 662-mg monthly dose also resulted in aripiprazole concentrations within the efficacious dose range. aripiprazole lauroxil administration results in prolonged exposure, such that dose delays of 2 to 4 weeks, depending on the dose regimen, do not require oral aripiprazole supplementation upon resumption of dosing. conclusions: this poppk model and model-based simulations were effective means for evaluating aripiprazole lauroxil dosing regimens and management of missed doses. such analyses play an important role in determining the use of this long-acting antipsychotic in clinical practice.
eating_disorders	it remains unclear whether body dissatisfaction, a widely recognized predictor of eating-related pathologies and depressive symptomatology, is consistent across cohorts and time. this question is important to investigate because dominant theories propose that sociocultural influences, which may fluctuate, play an important role in the development of body dissatisfaction. previous efforts for tracking body dissatisfaction across cohorts and time are limited by relying on data from a single institution or using assessments that lack psychometric support across genders. in this study, we utilized cross-temporal meta-analyses to examine changes in 2 dimensions of body dissatisfaction: thinness-oriented dissatisfaction as assessed with the eating disorder inventory-body dissatisfaction subscale (data available across 31 years from 326 unique samples, n = 100,228 participants) and muscularity-oriented dissatisfaction as measured with the drive for muscularity scale (data available across 14 years from 117 unique samples, n = 23,575 participants). results revealed a significant interaction between year of study and gender in predicting thinness-oriented dissatisfaction: girls and women scored higher than boys and men consistently (ds = 0.51-1.17), although only girls' and women 's scores decreased gradually across time (d = 0.49). boys and men scored higher than girls and women on muscularity-oriented dissatisfaction (d = 1.72), with no significant changes across time. these patterns remained when controlling for age and geographic location. overall, these findings highlight the importance of considering multiple dimensions of body dissatisfaction in research and offer evidence that sociocultural shifts in body acceptance and diversity may be countering thinness-related pressures for girls and women.
eating_disorders	topiramate (tpm) is effective for multiple seizure types and epilepsy syndromes in children and adults. topiramate has adverse effects (including cognitive, depression, renal stones), but many of these are low incidence when started at a low dose and slowly titrated to 100 to 200 mg/day. also, tpm has proven benefit for migraine, obesity, eating disorders, and alcohol use disorders, which can be comorbid in patients with epilepsy and may also be effective in subpopulations within specific psychiatric diagnoses. recently approved extended-release formulations of tpm (trokendi and qudexy in the united states) have reliable data supporting their safety and efficacy for patients with epilepsy. they have potential for more rapid titration within 1 month to 200 mg/day and have better patient retention than tpm immediate-release, but there are no robust double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing the different formulations. we expect the once per day extended-release formulations to improve medication adherence compared with the twice per day formulations. this has significant potential to improve outcomes in epilepsy and the other tpm-responsive disorders.
borderline_personality_disorder	borderline personality disorder (bpd) has a reputation for being a challenging disorder to treat due to the nature of the illness. with the development of evidence-based treatments, therapists are becoming more skilled at successfully helping this cohort of patients. a common factor associated with all validated treatments for bpd is the active involvement of therapists. for example, dbt is one treatment where therapists are expected to be available to patients for coaching outside of sessions. however, understanding the benefits and pitfalls associated with therapists' accessibility in between sessions is relevant to any treatment with intersession contact. in this article, three benefits of intersession contact are described: to generalize the use of skills, to improve understanding of the patient 's needs, and to facilitate an alliance. this article also addresses the pitfalls of therapists being so accessible to patients. both the benefits and pitfalls of intersession contact are illustrated using case vignettes. assessing the function served by a patient 's contact in between sessions is an important way to determine whether such contact is a productive part of treatment. recommendations are provided to avoid detrimental outcomes for both the therapist (therapist burnout) and the patient.
problem-solving	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to illustrate an application of the six sigma define, measure, analyze, improve, control (dmaic) problem-solving methodology in a portuguese industrial enterprise, aimed at reducing the rejection rate of a specific manufactured product due to defects generated in an aluminum gravity die casting operation. design/methodology/approach - along the five-stage roadmap, a set of analytical and conceptual tools was systematically employed to better characterize the problem, define the product 's critical to quality characteristics, estimate the process baseline, determine the relevant cause-and-effect relationships, identify the root causes leading to the high rejection rate, implement an improvement plan, determine the effectiveness of the improvement actions, and put in place a control plan. findings - the project team discovered that the high rejection rate was caused by factors inherent to the gravity die casting operation itself and by the mixing of rejected parts made of different types of alloys from other locations within the plant. another key finding was that the successful execution of the project was only possible due to the belief and support of top management and to the active involvement of the team members. practical implications - this case study illustrates a successful practical application of a six sigma project in a small-medium enterprise in portugal, as well as the operational and financial benefits that derived from it; thus providing a good example for others to follow. originality/value - few cases of continual improvement initiatives, including six sigma projects, developed at a portuguese company are available in the literature; this paper fills such void by describing a very successful application that demonstrates the advantages that other companies can learn in terms of adopting structured methodologies to improve the quality of their products and the efficiency of their processes. moreover, the analysis and conclusions herein presented can be of great importance for companies using gravity die casting technology.
gender_roles	given the different roles that women and men play in households and communities, strategies to improve food security and build adaptive capacity need to take gender differences into account. in many developing countries, local organizations have a role to play in it. however, the degree to which there is an overlap among the priorities of men, women, and organizations (including non-governmental bodies, local government offices, and other agencies working in the community) is not generally known, nor do we know whether organizations are strengthening the adaptive capacity of both men and women effectively and equally. using gender-disaggregated data arising from community-level participatory research and organizational-level interviews from 15 sites across west africa, east africa, and south asia, we conduct a cross-regional analysis of local organizational landscapes as they relate to livelihoods and food security. we find that in all regions, women tend to value local organizations more highly and thus appear to be less connected to external organizations than men. additionally, women 's perception of food security is broader than men 's, going beyond a production focus. most of the local organizations with food security as a stated objective focus on production, which can marginalize/alienate women. given the effects that climate change is predicted to have on food security, development organizations should consider the differing priorities of men and women, and use a gendered perspective when building adaptive capacity to respond to climate change, and to maintain/improve food security. such work can, perhaps, most effectively be implemented through existing community groups.
problem-solving	this study examined the extent to which positive and negative parenting relates to conduct problems (cp) and callous-unemotional (cu) traits among 172 adolescents (72 % males; m-age = 16.91 years, sd = .67) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and whether cu traits moderate the link between parenting and cp. mothers reported on their adolescents' cp, cu traits, and their own parenting practices. maternal behaviors were observed during a problem-solving communication task. parents who engaged in more positive parenting (self-reported and observed) reported their adolescents as having lower levels of cu traits. no effect was found for negative parenting. moderation analyses indicated that lower levels of positive maternal behavior was only associated with higher cp in the presence of higher levels of cu traits. negative parenting was positively related to cp regardless of cu traits. positive parenting, irrespective of measurement approach, uniquely relates to adolescents' cu traits while both positive and negative parenting relate to cp.
prenatal_development	developing axons can locally synthesize proteins, with roles in axon growth, guidance, and regeneration, but the mechanisms that regulate axonal mrna translation are not well understood. micrornas (mirnas) are important regulators of translation but have still been little characterized in developing axons. here we study mouse dorsal root ganglion (drg) axons and show that their extension is impaired by conditional deficiency of the mirna-processing enzyme dicer in vitro and in vivo. a screen for axonal localization identifies a specific set of mirnas preferentially enriched within the developing axon. high axonal expression and preferential localization were observed for mir-132, a mirna previously known for roles in dendrites and dysregulation in major neurologic diseases. mir-132 knockdown reduced extension of cultured drg axons, whereas overexpression increased extension. mechanistically, mir-132 regulated the mrna for the ras gtpase activator rasa1, a novel target in neuronal function. moreover, mir-132 regulation of rasa1 translation was seen in severed axons, demonstrating mirna function locally within the axon. mir-132 expression in drgs peaked in the period of maximum axon growth in vivo, consistent with its effect on axon growth, and suggesting a role as a developmental timer. together, these findings identify mir-132 as a positive regulator of developing axon extension, acting through repression of rasa1 mrna, in a mechanism that operates locally within the axon.
person_perception	the current study examines the effect of status information on the neural substrates of person perception. in an event-related fmri experiment, participants were presented with photographs of faces preceded with information denoting either: low or high financial status (e.g., ""earns $25,000"" or ""earns $350,000""), or low or high moral status (e.g., ""is a tobacco executive"" or ""does cancer research""). participants were asked to form an impression of the targets, but were not instructed to explicitly evaluate their social status. building on previous brain-imaging investigations, regions of interest analyses were performed for brain regions expected to support either cognitive (i.e., intraparietal sulcus) or emotional (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex) components of social status perception. activation of the intraparietal sulcus was found to be sensitive to the financial status of individuals while activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was sensitive to the moral status of individuals. the implications of these results towards uncovering the neural substrates of status perception and, more broadly, the extended network of brain regions involved in person perception are discussed.

nonverbal_communication	human communication covers two forms: verbal and nonverbal. nonverbal communication is an indispensable and inseparable part of human interaction and communication. as a main part of nonverbal communication, body language includes posture, gesture, eye contact, facial expression and so on. body language plays an important role in utterance meaning such as supplement, accenting, repetition or substitute. body language belongs to a part of culture. it is unavoidable to have body language misunderstanding since it has different meanings in different culture background, so it is necessary for us to master body language of different cultures. this thesis focuses on the communicative functions of body language from the perceptive of cultural differences. in this way, people can understand body language better and improve our communicationl.
nonverbal_communication	background: theoretically, specific pragmatic functions of intentional communication are differentially associated with language use in children with autism spectrum disorder (asd). the primary purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the relation of declarative and imperative intentional communication acts (icas), respectively, with language skills. we also examined five possible moderators of the separate associations and the difference in associations: metric used to quantify icas, expressive versus receptive language, longitudinal or concurrent correlations, within-study interobserver reliability of rating pragmatic function of icas, and risk for correlated measurement error. method: included studies provided at least 1 zero-order correlation (concurrent or longitudinal) of language measures with declarative or imperative ica5. participants were children with asd (n = 727), aged 8 years and younger. results: twenty-three studies were included. declarative icas were significantly associated with language (weighted mean r = 0.42; 95% ci [0.34, 0.50]). imperative icas were not significantly associated with language. moderator effects were not detected. conclusions: the association of declarative icas and language has implications for early treatment of asd-related language deficits. failure to find a significant association of imperative icas and language could have been due to low statistical power and/or publication bias; more research on imperative icas is needed.

leadership	in addition to everyday political threats, leaders risk removal from office through coups and mass movements such as rebellion. further, all leaders face threats from shocks such as downturns in their health, their country 's economy, or their government 's revenue. by integrating these risks into the selectorate theory, we characterize the conditions under which each threat is pertinent and the countermoves (purges, democratization, expansion of public goods, and expansion of private benefits) that best enable the leader to survive in office. the model identifies new insights into the nature of assassins; the relative risk of different types of leader removal as a function of the extant institutions of government; and the endogenous factors driving better or worse public policy and decisions to democratize or become more autocratic. importantly, the results highlight how an increase in the risk of deposition via one means intensifies other removal risks.
leadership	systems thinking is a holistic approach that puts the study of wholes before that of parts. this study explores systems thinking among school middle leaders - teachers who have management responsibility for a team of teachers or for an aspect of the school 's work. interviews were held with 93 school coordinators, among them year heads, heads of departments, evaluation coordinators, instruction coordinators, and information and communications technology coordinators. data analysis revealed that systems thinking among school middle leaders consists of four characteristics: (1) seeing wholes; (2) using a multidimensional view; (3) influencing indirectly; and (4) assessing significance. the findings of this study expand the existing knowledge on systems thinking in school leadership, discussing practical implications as well as further research avenues.
eating_disorders	bulimia nervosa can be reliably classified into subtypes based on dimensions of dietary restraint and negative affect. community and clinical studies have shown that dietary-negative affect subtypes have greater test-retest reliability and concurrent and predictive validity compared to subtypes based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm). although dietary-negative affect subtypes have shown utility for characterizing eating disorders that involve binge eating, this framework may have broader implications for understanding restrictive eating disorders. objective: the purpose of this study was to test the concurrent and predictive validity of dietary-negative affect subtypes among patients with anorexia nervosa (an; n = 194). method: latent profile analysis was used to identify subtypes of an based on dimensions of dietary restraint and negative affect. chi-square and multivariate analysis of variance were used to characterize baseline differences between identified subtypes. structural equation modeling was used to test whether dietary-negative affect subtypes would outperform dsm categories in predicting clinically relevant outcomes. results: results supported a 2-profile model that replicated dietary-negative affect subtypes: latent profile 1 (n = 68) had clinically elevated scores on restraint only; latent profile 2 (n = 126) had elevated scores on both restraint and negative affect. validation analyses showed that membership in the dietary-negative affect profile was associated with greater lifetime psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial impairment compared to the dietary class. dietary-negative affect subtypes only outperformed dsm categories in predicting quality-of-life impairment at 1-year follow-up. conclusions: findings highlight the clinical utility of subtyping an based on dietary restraint and negative affect for informing future treatment-matching or personalized medicine strategies.
prosocial_behavior	empathy is highly relevant for social behavior and can be verbally expressed by voicing sympathy and concern (emotional empathy) as well as by paraphrasing or stating that one can mentally reconstruct and understand another person 's thoughts and feelings (cognitive empathy). in this study, we investigated the emotional effects and neural correlates of receiving empathic social responses after negative performance feedback and compared the effects of emotionally vs. cognitively empathic comments. 20 participants (10 male) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while receiving negative performance feedback for a cognitive task. performance feedback was followed by verbal comments either expressing cognitive and emotional empathy or demonstrating a lack of empathy. empathic comments in general led to less negative self-reported feelings and calmer breathing. at the neural level, empathic comments induced activity in regions associated with social cognition and emotion processing, specifically in right postcentral gyrus and left cerebellum (cognitively empathic comments), right precentral gyrus, the opercular part of left inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus (emotionally empathic comments), as well as the orbital part of the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus (emotionally empathic vs. unempathic comments). the study shows that cognitively and emotionally empathic comments appear to be processed in partially separable neural systems. furthermore, confirming and expanding on another study on the same subject, the present results demonstrate that the social display of cognitive empathy exerts almost as positive effects on the recipient 's feelings and emotions in states of distress as emotionally empathic response does. this can be relevant for professional settings in which strong negative emotions need to be de-escalated while maintaining professional impartiality, which may allow the display of cognitive but not emotional empathy.

false_memories	the self-memory system encompasses the working self, autobiographical memory and episodic memory. specific autobiographical memories are patterns of activation over knowledge structures in autobiographical and episodic memory brought about by the activating effect of cues. the working self can elaborate cues based on the knowledge they initially activate and so control the construction of memories of the past and the future. it is proposed that such construction takes place in the remembering-imagining system - a window of highly accessible recent memories and simulations of near future events. how this malfunctions in various disorders is considered as are the implication of what we term the modern view of human memory for notions of memory accuracy. we show how all memories are to some degree false and that the main role of memories lies in generating personal meanings.

prosocial_behavior	in a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important. we present results from a comprehensive investigation of cross-societal cooperation in one-shot prisoner 's dilemmas involving population-representative samples from six countries and identify crucial facilitators of and obstacles to cooperation. in interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players' nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. these expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. in addition to erroneous expectations, participants' cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner 's nationality. in the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations.
leadership	human resources is the backbone of any system and the key enabler for all other functions to effectively perform. this is no different with the immunization supply chain, more so in todays' complex operating environment with the increasing strain caused by new vaccines and expanding immunization programmes (source: who, unicef). in order to drive the change that is required for sustainability and continuous improvement, every immunization supply chain needs an effective leader. a dedicated and competent immunization supply chain leader with adequate numbers of skilled, accountable, motivated and empowered personnel at all levels of the health system to overcome existing and emerging immunization supply chain (isc) challenges. without an effective supply chain leader supported by capable and motivated staff, none of the interventions designed to strengthen the supply chain can be effective or sustainable (source: gavi alliance sc strategy 2014). this landscape analysis was preceded by an hr evidence review (march 2014) and has served to inform global partner strategies and country activities, as well as highlight where most support is required. the study also aimed to define the status quo in order to create some form of baseline against which to measure the impact of interventions related to hr going forward. the analysis was comprised of a comprehensive desk review, a survey of 40 respondents from 32 countries and consultations with isc practitioners in several forums. the findings highlight key areas that should inform the pillars of a hr capacity development plan. at the same time, it revealed that there are some positive examples of where countries are actively addressing some of the issues identified and putting in place mechanisms and structures to optimize the sc function.

child_abuse	the perceptions and judgments of social workers who interview the child and family are especially significant factors in child abuse assessment process. the current study describes and compares child protection workers' assessment processes in korea and the usa through the use of case vignettes and in-depth interview. the responses from social workers in these two countries were compared and discussed in the areas of: risk assessment; perception of the main problems; tolerance of corporal punishment; and judgments about appropriateness of interventions. most revealing was that korean social workers determined abuse based on their child abuse definition and the us army fap social workers determined abuse based on their definition, which was affected by legal standards and cultural differences. korean social workers are more likely to remove a child from the home, even in mild cases, but us fap social workers would recommend child removal from the home as a last option. the social workers that participated in this survey play a vital role in the safety of children in child protective services. both countries can benefit from sharing information to improve the child protection services delivered. social workers' professional judgment leads to objective and consistent outcomes and are less likely to compromise child safety in the decision making process.
gender_roles	women leaders are scarce in evangelical mission organizations. part of the reason may be gender-role stereotypes, which function very strongly in much of evangelicalism. this article presents the stories of two women who worked at executive-level leadership positions in evangelical mission organizations. using narrative analysis and a critical feminist lens, i examine their stories to understand how these women describe their leadership and how they portray their use of power. the strength of gender-role stereotypes and evangelical gender roles appeared to define and limit the power they were able to use. as long as they stayed within prescribed norms, they experienced some success. deviations from the gender-role stereotypes led to sanctions from their organizations. conclusions and implications are that the stereotypes may limit women 's leadership and that both women and organizations need to become aware of how these unspoken assumptions may be functioning. recommendations for women leaders and for organizations seeking to incorporate women into leadership are offered.
attention	anatase tio2 crystal facets are garnering increasing attention due to their unique surface property. however, no specific linear relationship had been derived between the facet exposed on tio2 and the surface adsorption capacity as well as photocatalytic performance. this study systematically explored the facet effects on antimony (sb) adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation using high-index {201) and low-index {101), {001), and {100) tio2. the results suggest that high-index {201) tio2 exhibits the best sb(iii) adsorption and photocatalytic activity compared to the low-index tio2. both the sb(iii) adsorption density and the amount of ""oh and o-2(.)-generated in solution were correlated to the magnitude of surface energy on tio2 facets. photocatalytically generated 'oh and (t)-were responsible for sb(iii) photooxidation as evidenced by radical-trapping experiments. the great contribution of 'oh was observed only on {2011 not on low-index tio2. this phenomenon was found to be attributable to the high surface energy on {201), which enables the generation of a large amount of photogeneration 'oh to compensate for the fast rate of (oh)-o-. dissipation. therefore, the predominant participation of 'oh in sb(iii) photooxidation was only possible on high-index {201) tio2, which resulted in an enhanced photocatalytic rate. on the other hand, %-dominated the sb(iii) photocatalytic oxidation on low-index tio2. the intrinsic facet-dependent adsorption and photocatalytic mechanism obtained from this study would be useful for developing tio(2)based environmental technologies.

antisocial_personality_disorder	research on psychopathology and experimental studies of sleep restriction support a relationship between sleep disruption and both internalizing and externalizing disorders. the objective of the current study was to extend this research by examining sleep, impulsivity, antisocial personality traits, and internalizing traits in a university sample. three hundred and eighty six individuals (161 males) between the ages of 18 and 27 years (m = 18.59, sd = 0.98) wore actigraphs for 7 days and completed established measures of disorder-linked personality traits and sleep quality (i.e., personality assessment inventory (pai), triarchic psychopathy measure, barratt impulsiveness scale-11, and the pittsburgh sleep quality index). as expected, sleep measures and questionnaire scores fell within the normal range of values and sex differences in sleep and personality were consistent with previous research results. similar to findings in predominantly male forensic psychiatric settings, higher levels of impulsivity predicted poorer subjective sleep quality in both women and men. consistent with well-established associations between depression and sleep, higher levels of depression in both sexes predicted poorer subjective sleep quality. bidirectional analyses showed that better sleep efficiency decreases depression. finally, moderation analyses showed that gender does have a primary role in sleep efficiency and marginal effects were found. the observed relations between sleep and personality traits in a typical university sample add to converging evidence of the relationship between sleep and psychopathology and may inform our understanding of the development of psychopathology in young adulthood.
social_cognition	introduction: an impairment of visually perceiving backward masked stimuli is commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia, yet it is unclear whether this impairment is the result of a deficiency in first or higher order processing and for which subtypes of schizophrenia it is present. methods: here, we compare identification (first order) and metacognitive (higher order) performance in a visual masking paradigm between a highly homogenous group of young firstepisode patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (n = 11) to that of carefully matched healthy controls (n = 13). results: we find no difference across groups in first-order performance, but find a difference in metacognitive performance, particularly for stimuli with relatively high visibility. conclusions: these results indicate that the masking deficit is present in first-episode patients with paranoid schizophrenia, but that it is primarily an impairment of metacognition.
nonverbal_communication	blinking behavior is an important part of human nonverbal communication. it signals the psychological state of the social partner. in this study, we implemented different blinking behaviors for a humanoid robot with pronounced physical eyes. the blinking patterns implemented were either statistical or based on human physiological data. we investigated in an online study the influence of the different behaviors on the perception of the robot by human users with the help of the godspeed questionnaire. our results showed that, in the condition with human-like blinking behavior, the robot was perceived as being more intelligent compared to not blinking or statistical blinking. as we will argue, this finding represents the starting point for the design of a 'holistic' social robotic behavior.
nonverbal_communication	objective: investigating the strategies that nurses use to watch the hospitalized elderly. method: this is an exploratory study of qualitative nature. the research was conducted at a university hospital with fifteen clinical nurses. to facilitate the data collection was used the interview technique. the empirical material was analyzed qualitatively, using the technique of content analysis. results: from the qualitative analysis emerged three themes: reception and individualized nursing care and respect for the autonomy of elderly patients; respect to beliefs, values, the privacy and identity of the elderly patient, recovery of verbal and nonverbal communication to the patient and his family. conclusion: this study demonstrates the commitment of nurses participating in the research regarding the humanized nursing care directed to hospitalized elderly.
media_violence	this article places media violence research into a broader context than the typical public debate about whether violent video games (or tv programs, or movies) are the cause of school shootings and other extreme acts of violence. we describe how scientists today decide whether one variable (e.g., exposure to violent media) increases the risks for, contributes to, or causes another (e.g., aggressive or violent behavior). we discuss the different research methods used to examine the relationship between exposure to violent media and aggressive and violent acts. we review research evidence on the link between exposure to violent media and aggressive behavior, violent behavior, and other undesirable behavior (e.g., less helping, less empathy and compassion for others). we conclude that although exposure to violent media is not the cause of aggressive and violent behavior, it is an important risk factor that can contribute to more aggressive and violent behaviors, and fewer prosocial behaviors.
eating_disorders	body appreciation has been found to be linked to interpersonal and intrapersonal factors, with attachment styles and self-compassion separately identified as important correlates. the present study examined these variables together in a model, and we hypothesized that maternal attachment anxiety was related to peer and romantic attachment anxiety, which, in turn, was associated with self-compassion and body appreciation. using structural equation modeling, this cross-sectional study with a sample of 1306 incoming first year college women found that the proposed model explained 40% of the variance in body appreciation. results further revealed that peer and romantic attachment anxiety mediated the relationships between maternal attachment anxiety and self-compassion, and that self-compassion mediated the associations between peer and romantic attachment anxiety and body appreciation. self-compassion appears to hold a central role in explaining the relation between attachment anxiety and body appreciation.

gender_roles	this article analyses the novels luz y sombra (1903) by ana roque y las memorias de mama blanca (1929) by teresa de la parra, focusing on friendship between female characters. in these texts, friendships between women are important both in thematical as well as in structural terms. on the one hand, they constitute a parallel or alternative plot to the one centered on heterosexual love and the pressure for women to marry. on the other hand, the novels are comprised of the letters exchanged by the protagonists (luz y sombra) or built on the basis of collaborative artistic creations (las memorias de mama blanca). we propose that these narratives represent the possibility of building alternative spaces and trajectories for women, which depend largely upon building bonds of solidarity and intimacy. writing letters, reading together, sharing dialogues and reflections play a main role in the configuration of female subjectivities that are less bound to gender roles and stereotypes.
nonverbal_communication	wban (wireless body area network) is a growing technology, preferred in medical science. wban sensors are now used to monitor postures of a person. posture, playing a crucial role in a person 's life can provide a significant amount of important information on nonverbal communication and emotional cues. in recent trend of research, ban sensors are used to identify different postures of a person to correctly classify the health condition, as postures could potentially provide valuable clues about a person 's health. this class of interaction poses new challenge in classifying both static and dynamic postures. triaxial accelerometer is required to find the tilt of a person with respect to the line passing through the centre of gravity. based on the tilt, the posture is classified. this paper aims at uniquely distinguishing both static and dynamic postures. fall can also be detected at the same time. a detailed deployment scenario, system architecture and a suitable algorithm are presented to illustrate the working of the proposed system.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this theoretical study reviews two of the most cited profiles of intimate partner batterers in the scientific literature, paying special attention to the most notable differences between diem, as well as to their common criteria.. the study also discusses one of the longest standing controversies in various research studies, including the particular overview with respect to spain: it being the constant yet erroneous reference to the equivalence of psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder. similarly; special attention is paid to the implications of considering intimate partner batterers as having either a psychopathological or psychopathic profile, while also stressing the specific role played by psychopathy in the intimate partner batterer and, concerning psychopathic intimate partner batterers, such aspects as their specific motives for perpetrating intimate partner violence and the evaluation instruments of this particular profile. finally, a series of future directives for research concerning psychopathic intimate partner batterers are also pointed out.
prosocial_behavior	recent work has suggested the presence of a variety of motives and mechanisms that affect young children 's sharing decisions. yet, little is known about the relative impact of these motives. in three experiments with 3- to 6-year-old children (total n=140), the current study contrasts two important recipient characteristics that have been suggested to play a major role in early sharing; the positive social relationship between children and recipients and the differences in recipients' wealth. to this end, children could allocate resources to a friend who already possessed a lot of them and to a nonfriend (experiments 1 and 2) or a stranger (experiment 3) who owned only very few resources. across age, children showed a preference to share more with their rich friend, although this tendency was stronger in the older preschool children. the findings are discussed with respect to theoretical accounts on the psychological basis of early sharing.

problem-solving	background: past research underscores the key role of coping strategies in the development, maintenance, and exacerbation of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) symptoms. the goal of the current study was to extend existing literature by examining whether race/ethnicity moderates the relations among coping strategies (social support, problem-solving, avoidance) and ptsd symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, arousal).methods: participants were 369 community women (134 african americans, 131 latinas, 104 whites) who reported bidirectional aggression with a current male partner. multigroup path analysis was utilized to test the moderating role of race/ethnicity in a model linking coping strategies to ptsd symptom clusters.results: the strength and direction of relations among coping strategies and ptsd symptom clusters varied as a function of race/ethnicity. greater social support coping was related to more arousal symptoms for latinas and whites. greater problem-solving coping was related to fewer arousal symptoms for latinas. greater avoidance coping was related to more symptoms across many of the ptsd clusters for african americans, latinas, and whites, however, these relations were strongest for african americans.conclusion: results provide support for the moderating role of race/ethnicity in the relations among coping strategies and ptsd symptom clusters, and highlight potential targets for culturally informed ptsd treatments.
borderline_personality_disorder	purpose of reviewthis article aims to examine the relationships between obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) and personality disturbance, with a particular focus on the diagnostic, aetiological and treatment implications of these relationships.recent findingspersonality disorders are common in ocd. they interact in various ways and in accordance with a number of the proposed models. the relationship between ocd and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is the most important, but it can be conceptualised in different ways and may vary from one person to another. the most clinically relevant implication of the presence of schizotypal personality disorder in ocd is poor prognosis and treatment outcome of ocd. the findings of the effects of personality disorders on treatment outcome of ocd have been inconsistent for most personality disorders, largely due to poor quality of research. better understanding of the specific relationships between ocd and personality disturbance should lead to a more tailored treatment approach.summarylarge prospective studies are needed to better understand how various relationships between ocd and specific personality disorders could be conceptualised more soundly. such studies will also provide the foundation for more effective treatments of ocd patients with co-occurring personality disorders.
prenatal_development	there has been increasing interest on the possible harmful effects of prenatal exposure to magnetic fields. to investigate the effect of weak intensity magnetic fields on the prenatal brain, pregnant wistar rats were continuously exposed to one of four intensities (reference: 5-20 nt; low 30-50 nt; medium 90-580 nt; high 590-1200 nt) of a complex magnetic field sequence designed to interfere with brain development. as adults, rats exposed to the low-intensity (30-50 nt) complex magnetic field displayed impairments in contextual fear learning and showed anomalies in the cytological and morphological development of the hippocampus. in particular, low-intensity exposures resulted in a reduction in overall hippocampal size and promoted subtle dysgenesis of the ca1 and ca3 regions. in contrast, exposure to weaker or stronger intensities of the same complex magnetic field pattern did not interfere with hippocampal development or fear behavior. these findings suggest that prenatal exposure to complex magnetic fields of a narrow intensity window during development can result in subtle but permanent alterations in hippocampal microstructure and function that can have lasting effects on behavior.

eating_disorders	objectiveproeating disorder (pro-ed) communities online encourage harmful weight-loss and weight-control practices. this study examined the association between exposure to pro-ed content online and subjective well-being (swb) among adolescents and young adults in four countries. methodcross-national data were collected in the us, germany, the uk and finland from internet users aged 15-30 years (n=3,557; 50.15% male). the questionnaire assessed swb, exposure to harm-advocating websites, online activity, prior victimization, and social belonging. ordinary least squares (ols) regression models assessed the relationship between swb and pro-ed exposure and adjusted for a number of confounding factors. resultsof the participants, 17% had been exposed to pro-ed content (us 20%, germany 7%, uk 21%, finland 22%). exposure to pro-ed content online was negatively associated with swb in the us, germany, and finland, also after adjusting for the confounding factors. offline social belonging moderated the association between pro-ed and swb. discussionparticipants who visited pro-ed websites reported lower swb than others did. the potentially harmful impact of visiting these sites was buffered by the strong offline social belonging. given the observed similarities across the countries, it is important for families, health professionals, and educators to stay abreast of online communities that have possible contra recovery influences and to be able to discuss such internet contents in a way that increases treatment motivation.

media_violence	modern video games represent highly advanced virtual reality simulations and often contain virtual violence. in a significant amount of young males, playing video games is a quotidian activity, making it an almost natural behavior. recordings of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) during gameplay may reflect neuronal correlates of real-life behavior. we recorded 13 experienced gamers (18-26 years; average 14 hrs/week playing) while playing a violent first-person shooter game (a violent computer game played in self-perspective) by means of distortion and dephasing reduced fmri (3 t; single-shot triple-echo echo-planar imaging [epi]). content analysis of the video and sound with 100 ms time resolution achieved relevant behavioral variables. these variables explained significant signal variance across large distributed networks. occurrence of violent scenes revealed significant neuronal correlates in an event-related design. activation of dorsal and deactivation of rostral anterior cingulate and amygdala characterized the mid-frontal pattern related to virtual violence. statistics and effect sizes can be considered large at these areas. optimized imaging strategies allowed for single-subject and for single-trial analysis with good image quality at basal brain structures. we propose that virtual environments can be used to study neuronal processes involved in semi-naturalistic behavior as determined by content analysis. importantly, the activation pattern reflects brain-environment interactions rather than stimulus responses as observed in classical experimental designs. we relate our findings to the general discussion on social effects of playing first-person shooter games.
prosocial_behavior	get-out-the-vote mailers using explicit social pressure consistently increase electoral turnout; however, they often generate a negative reaction or backlash. one approach to increase turnout, yet alleviate backlash, may be to use implicit social pressure. an implicit social pressure technique that has shown promise is to display a set of eyes. researchers contend eyes generate a feeling of being watched, which cues subjects to act in more prosocial ways to demonstrate compliance with social norms. several studies support this argument, including two voter mobilization studies. the technique has not been widely tested, however, in the political context. in five randomized field experiments, we test the impact on turnout of mobilization mailers using eye displays. we extend previous research by testing for differences in effects between male and female eyes and across political cultures. the effects are substantively and statistically weak at best and inconsistent with previous findings.
gender_roles	an upsurge in popularity of homestays has provided newer economic opportunities to remote indian himalayan communities. despite the benefits homestays offer, their acceptance by mountain communities is fraught with challenges. this qualitative research study has listened to and given voice to homestay scheme non-participants, community members from 15 villages in the kuilu region. through thematic analysis, rational, understandable reasons leading to decisions not to engage are identified: socio-cultural; practical and apprehensions. reasons include an inability to comply with certain guidelines of the scheme, inadequacy in sanitary infrastructure, gender roles, complex socio-cultural issues and also home model issues, which all condition the scheme implementation. the concept of 'deliberate non-participation' is advanced which extends previous typologies of community participation. further theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed along with recommendations for future development of the homestay scheme.

prosocial_behavior	nostalgia, which is induced by reminiscing about a positive past experience, can counteract loneliness and promote prosocial behavior. however, the process of recalling and thinking about a nostalgic experience can have quite different effects. because nostalgic experiences rarely reoccur, people are motivated to savor them by prolonging the time they reminisce about them. the tendency to savor these experiences generalizes to situations that participants encounter later, thus increasing consumer patience. for this effect to emerge, however, consumers must be aware that waiting will be beneficial to the attainment of a benefit. moreover, the relationship between nostalgia and consumer patience is diminished when people perceive a nostalgic experience to be repeatable or when they intensify their memory of the experience rather than prolonging it. eight studies confirmed these effects and processes that underlie them.
child_abuse	the introduction of the concept of child abuse has radically changed the mode of interaction between pediatricians and children, but also the practice of sanitary personnel in primary care centers, who are often the first to see victims of maltreatment. this study aims at illustrating the results of a questionnaire sent to family doctors, pediatricians and hospitals in milan and surrounding areas. concerning child abuse. among all the operators, 273 returned the questionnaires. the results show scarce knowledge on how to report to judicial authority in cases of child abuse (51.5%), mainly because of lack of basilar information concerning the manner of reporting. for what concerns specific training, almost half the subjects recruited for the study admitted not to have attended any congress or meeting concerning child maltreatment in the last three years. in the same time span, more than one third has not read any scientific articles concerning child abuse. in addition, 75.6% admit to not ever having attended any professional training course concerning child maltreatment. this study highlights the scarce knowledge on the behalf of pediatricians and general practitioners regarding how to deal with child abuse and the importance of proper training programs.
depression	pre-ejection period (pep) reactivity to reward has been posited as a specific index of behavioral approach and incentive motivation, suggesting it might be uniquely associated with the affective and motivational deficits of anhedonia. this study evaluated pep reactivity to a reward task as a predictor of depressive symptoms among adolescents, examining global depressive symptoms as well as specific anhedonic and nonanhedonic symptoms clusters. participants included 76 adolescents, ages 11-15 years (52% female). this study found marginal support for an association between pep reactivity to reward and concurrent anhedonia symptoms, but no association with nonanhedonic or the global scale. findings are discussed in terms of potential associations between peripheral psychophysiological measures and dopaminergic functioning and also the utility of this measure for future research on anhedonia.
problem-solving	sustainability issues are often difficult for companies to manage because they require communication across organisational departments and divisions. this paper provides some of the first empirical evidence that communication ""silos"" exist within the mining sector, and that they may be impeding effective water management. results of a social network analysis at a mining company revealed gaps in direct communication about water-related issues between the two largest production departments. this gap was particularly surprising because the departments were connected in the other communication networks studied, namely: information, ideas, problem-solving and friendship. the health, safety and environment department played a crucial brokerage role within the water network, suggesting that water is primarily perceived as an environmental issue. a lack of direct communication between the major production departments could pose a barrier for recognising and responding to production-critical water risks. the work also found that the water network was characteristic of a core-periphery structure, such that communication was vulnerable to the removal of central ""hubs"". these hubs were dominated by senior management, which may present a risk for responding promptly to water-related crises. further research is needed to investigate the impacts of a siloed communication structure for managing other sustainability issues including energy and community development.

gender_roles	while more studies are exploring the ways in which gender structures the family experiences of americanborn children of immigrants, there is less attention to how gender shapes later views on ethnicity and culture. based on interviews with korean, chinese, and taiwanese americans in the new york-new jersey metropolitan area, this article examines the different ways second-generation children learn, interpret, and pass on the cultural values and family traditions in their adulthood. because their family roles center on their roles as leaders and carriers of the family name through male heirs, sons-especially oldest sons-can fulfill their filial obligations through relatively orthodox and nonengaging cultural practices that although restrictive, do not threaten their personal goals and privileged status. however, daughters must negotiate more emotionally burdensome expectations and responsibilities by preserving family honor, acting as family caretakers, and juggling multiple responsibilities; thus, they tend to re-create more subtle, self-empowering, and emotionally engaging ways of interpreting and preserving their parents' expectations on family culture. i argue that the gendered ways daughters and sons are taught to practice cultural values and protect family honor has significant bearing on their later views on ethnicity and culture but in complex ways that transcend the generational divide.
person_perception	this research examined how people 's ability to detect behavior change in simulated child targets is affected by their clinical experience and the assessment method they use. when using summary assessment methods that are widely employed in research and clinical practice, both inexperienced and experienced clinical staff detected changes in the overall frequency of targets' aggressive behavior, but were not uniquely influenced by changes in targets' reactions to social events. when using contextualized assessment methods that focused on conditional reactions, experienced staff showed greater sensitivity than novices to context-specific changes in targets' aggressive and prosocial reactions to aversive events. experienced staff also showed greater sensitivity to context-specific changes in their overall impressions of change, but only for aggression. the findings show how clinically experienced judges become more attuned to ifaeuro broken vertical bar thenaeuro broken vertical bar contingencies in children 's social behavior, and how summary assessment methods may hamper the detection of change processes.
antisocial_personality_disorder	previous studies have emphasized that antisocial personality disorder (apd) and psychopathy overlap highly but differ critically in several features, notably negative emotionality (nem) and possibly amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat and distress. here we examined whether dimensions of psychopathy and apd correlate differentially with nem and amygdala reactivity to emotional faces. testing these relationships among healthy individuals, dimensions of psychopathy and apd were generated by the profile matching technique of lynam and widiger (2001), using facet scales of the neo personality inventory-revised, and amygdala reactivity was measured using a well-established emotional faces task, in a community sample of 103 men and women. higher psychopathy scores were associated with lower nem and lower amygdala reactivity, whereas higher apd scores were related to greater nem and greater amygdala reactivity, but only after overlapping variance in apd and psychopathy was adjusted for in the statistical model. amygdala reactivity did not mediate the relationship of apd and psychopathy scores to nem. supplemental analyses also compared other measures of factors within psychopathy in predicting nem and amygdala reactivity and found that factor 2 psychopathy was positively related to nem and amygdala reactivity across measures of psychopathy. the overall findings replicate seminal observations on nem in psychopathy by hicks and patrick (2006) and extend this work to neuroimaging in a normative population. they also suggest that one critical way in which apd and psychopathy dimensions may differ in their etiology is through their opposing levels of nem and amygdala reactivity to threat.
nonverbal_communication	in the last decade, the validity and relevance of the dominance model was regularly put into question regarding relationships between canids like dogs and wolves, and consequently, human dog relationships as well. the concept underlying this model, scientifically defined as an intervening variable reflecting status difference between individuals, is applicable when formal status signals symbolize the long-term relationship between individuals, resulting in a formalized dominance hierarchy. this article reviews the basics underlying the concept of dominance and reflects on the value and importance of some new quantitative studies on the applicability of the concept of dominance in domestic dogs. the conclusions are, first, that formal dominance is present in the domestic dog, expressed by context-independent unidirectional formal status signals. consequently, formal dominance (e.g., submission) plays an important role in assessing status in dog dog relationships. second, that nonverbal status related communication in humans resembles that in dogs to a considerable degree, and hence dogs may be well able to interpret this human status related nonverbal communication from their perspective. dominance is therefore also likely to play a role in human dog relationships. hence, the dominance concept might be useful to explain the development of certain problems in dog dog and dog human relationships. however, enforcing a dominant status by a human may entail considerable risks and should therefore be avoided.

seasonal_affective_disorder	bright-light interventions have successfully been used to reduce depression symptoms in patients with seasonal affective disorder, a depressive disorder most frequently occurring during seasons with reduced daylight availability. yet, little is known about how light exposure impacts human brain function, for instance on risk taking, a process affected in depressive disorders. here we examined the modulatory effects of bright-light exposure on brain activity during a risk-taking task. thirty-two healthy male volunteers living in the greater copenhagen area received 3 weeks of bright-light intervention during the winter season. adopting a double-blinded dose-response design, bright-light was applied for 30 minutes continuously every morning. the individual dose varied between 100 and 11.000 lx. whole-brain functional mri was performed before and after bright-light intervention to probe how the intervention modifies risk-taking related neural activity during a two-choice gambling task. we also assessed whether inter-individual differences in the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-httlpr) genotype influenced the effects of bright-light intervention on risk processing. bright-light intervention led to a dose-dependent increase in risk-taking in the l-a/l-a group relative to the non-l-a/l-a group. further, bright-light intervention enhanced risk-related activity in ventral striatum and head of caudate nucleus in proportion with the individual bright-light dose. the augmentation effect of light exposure on striatal risk processing was not influenced by the 5-httlpr-genotype. this study provides novel evidence that in healthy non-depressive individuals bright-light intervention increases striatal processing to risk in a dose-dependent fashion. the findings provide converging evidence that risk processing is sensitive to bright-light exposure during winter.

attention	since the devastating 2011 tornado season, there has been renewed interest in understanding tornado wind loads and developing methodologies to reduce the risk of tornado damage. this study focuses on the assessment of the system-level performance of five different residential light-frame wood building archetypes subjected to tornado winds. the system-level performance considered three critical components along the vertical load path within each building, namely, the roof sheathing, roof-to-wall connection, and wall-to-foundation anchorage. although there has been significant work on each of these components independently, combined uplift and lateral forces have received less attention. therefore, a laboratory testing program for wood shear walls, reported herein, was performed to determine the wall-failure mechanisms and capacities when subjected to combined shear and uplift forces. each building archetype was designed at varying locations across the united states based on the current residential building code and/or observed practice. fragilities were developed, based on the assumption that failure of any component along the vertical load path results in failure of the system. because the forces in each connection along the vertical load path arise from the same tornado wind load, the connection failures are not statistically independent, and monte carlo simulation was applied to perform the system reliability analysis.

false_memories	recent studies regarding the effect of mood on the drm (deese-roediger-mcdermott) illusion have not been able to clearly establish yet whether valence or arousal is most critical in determining susceptibility to false memories, nor what the underlying processes are. in three experiments, both the valence and the level of arousal of participants' mood were manipulated. six conditions were used: positive mood with high/low arousal, negative mood with high/low arousal, neutral mood, and a control condition. memory was tested by means of immediate and delayed recognition and immediate free recall. the mood induction procedure was effective. for recognition memory, there was an effect of arousal on the endorsement of critical lures. low-arousal moods elicited more false recognition than high-arousal moods, regardless of valence. based on signal detection analyses, the effect was attributed to more liberal response criteria with low arousal, in combination with a tendency towards improved item-specific memory with high arousal.
borderline_personality_disorder	since its inception, the concept of ""secondary psychopathy"" has been contrasted with primary psychopathy on the grounds of neuroticism, affect instability, and anxiety. nonetheless, while the etiology of primary psychopathy, and its various possible expressions, has received ample attention, secondary psychopathy has been largely neglected and only discussed in cluster-analytic studies. this paper seeks to fill that caveat by delineating the continuum on which secondary psychopathic individuals may be set apart and exploring potential sources of within group homogeneity and heterogeneity. while secondary psychopathic individuals share a number of etiological antecedents (attachment problems, childhood maltreatment, neurobiological dysfunctions) they can vary on different temperamental predispositions and specific types of maltreatment experienced in childhood (neglect/abuse vs. trauma/abuse, low vs. high prefrontal catecholaminergic activity), thus creating the heterogeneity observed in this group. secondary psychopathic individuals may be situated on a continuum that spans from attentional hyposensitivity and cognitive distractibility on the far left side, associated with deficient prefrontal catecholamine activity and childhood neglect/abuse, ultimately culminating in more detached expressions of secondary psychopathy (callousness, hedonism, and low worrying), to attentional hypersensitivity and cognitive rigidity on the far right side, associated with non-optimally high levels of catecholamine activity and childhood relational trauma/abuse leading to more unstable expressions of secondary psychopathy (hostility, neuroticism, instability, and worrying).

person_perception	we investigated how interrater agreement in personality judgment is affected by the perceivers' affection or dislike regarding the targets. a total of 209 perceivers judged the personalities of 15 targets by means of 30 adjectives. the targets were public figures (e.g., the pope), which enabled gathering a large number of ratings by perceivers differing in liking. shared liking was associated with strong increases, and large liking differences were associated with strong decreases, in profile correlations. shared antipathy was also associated with lower agreement. the greater agreement between judgments of liked targets was largely due to the perceivers characterizing targets positively, whereas judgments of disliked targets were not affected by (shared) negativity to the same extent. the perceivers' attitudes toward the targets constitute an important factor in person perception and need to be taken into account more systematically in research studies.
prejudice	the effects of globalization, is the globalization of responsibilities. due to globalization, global or international criminal responsibility of the perpetrators of the crime will follow. states as one of the international actors are also not exempt from this, and the issue of criminal responsibility for them, because the rulers of communication and sensitivity to its governance principles, coupled with a lot of complexity. according to the principle of necessity, anticipate criminal responsibility of states to prevent and avoid a lot of international crimes by nature and only with the support and assistance of states in the international dimension, to establish international order and security, in line with the process of globalization is inevitable. however, with the removal of article 19 of the draft international responsibility of the state, approved by the international law commission, represents the most important source of international criminal responsibility of the government, doubt the government, there is no criminal liability, it should be stressed that the elimination of the need for it does not prejudice the existence of numerous international documents and procedures, are an expression of this. the fact is that many of the behaviors that violate the rules of universal acceptance of the international community, can be done only by governments and civil responsibility only for governments to violate the rules of universal and important, in accordance with the principles of justice and international law, such as the need to maintain international peace and order of the international community, that it makes some states of the vacuum to be exploited. in order to resolve ambiguities about the criminal responsibility of the state, should the use of existing capacity of the international community, including the un and the security council, to build the infrastructure and the necessary arrangements for the progressive development of these institutions, such as that for the international criminal court done.
antisocial_personality_disorder	many forensic psychiatric settings serve unique populations who have, in addition to traditional psychiatric symptoms, diverse legal and criminogenic needs. a lack of clear treatment standards that address all aspects of forensic care can lead to inefficient or inappropriate interventions and contribute to institutional violence.
prosocial_behavior	when it comes to the pursuit of happiness, popular culture encourages a focus on oneself. by contrast, substantial evidence suggests that what consistently makes people happy is focusing prosocially on others. in the current study, we contrasted the mood-and well-being-boosting effects of prosocial behavior (i.e., doing acts of kindness for others or for the world) and self-oriented behavior (i.e., doing acts of kindness for oneself) in a 6-week longitudinal experiment. across a diverse sample of participants (n = 473), we found that the 2 types of prosocial behavior led to greater increases in psychological flourishing than did self-focused and neutral behavior. in addition, we provide evidence for mechanisms explaining the relative improvements in flourishing among those prompted to do acts of kindness-namely, increases in positive emotions and decreases in negative emotions. those assigned to engage in self-focused behavior did not report improved psychological flourishing, positive emotions, or negative emotions relative to controls. the results of this study contribute to a growing literature supporting the benefits of prosocial behavior and challenge the popular perception that focusing on oneself is an optimal strategy to boost one 's mood. people striving for happiness may be tempted to treat themselves. our results, however, suggest that they may be more successful if they opt to treat someone else instead.
social_cognition	background: theory of mind concerns the sociocognitive ability to infer others' thoughts. it has been theorized to be impaired in substance use and abuse, as its alterations might explain negative social and interpersonal outcomes noted in the course of disorders. in addition, the brain structures involved in theory of mind (tom) have been found to be disrupted in drug use conditions. objective: we undertook a systematic review of tom functioning in drug use conditions. methods: four electronic databases (medline, web of science, psycinfo, and embase) were searched to find studies that have addressed tom and conditions related to actual or previous drug use. results: the search found 147 papers, of which 14 fulfilled our review eligibility criteria. different methods were used, but overall, results indicated that drugs are related to tom deficits, particularly related to alcohol and amphetamines use. these impairments correlate with other clinical and cognitive functions. conclusion: despite the lack of studies and the methodological limitations of the existing ones theory of mind seems to play a role in drug use conditions, which requires further investigation.
leadership	purpose. the implementation of lean methodology into pharmacy residency programs at a community teaching hospital is described. summary. new hanover regional medical center, a community teaching hospital in southeastern north carolina, fully adopted a lean culture in 2010. given the success of lean strategies organizationally, this methodology was used to assist with the evaluation and development of its pharmacy residency programs in 2014. lean tools and activities have also been incorporated into residency requirements and rotation learning activities. the majority of lean events correspond to the required competency areas evaluating leadership and management, teaching, and education. these events have included participation in and facilitation of various lean problem-solving and communication tools. the application of the 4 rules of lean has resulted in enhanced management of the programs and provides a set of tools by which continual quality improvement can be ensured. regular communication and direct involvement of all invested parties have been critical in developing and sustaining new improvements. in addition to program enhancements, lean methodology offers novel methods by which residents may be incorporated into leadership activities. conclusion. the incorporation of lean methodology into pharmacy residency programs has translated into a variety of realized and potential benefits for the programs, the preceptors and residents, and the health system. specific areas of growth have included quality-improvement processes, the expansion of leadership opportunities for residents, and improved communication among program directors, preceptors, and residents.
child_abuse	background: although children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) are more likely to be exposed to harsh parental discipline, research on this issue is scarce. in particular, few studies have examined the risk factors for harsh parental discipline in this population. we responded to this gap in the literature by testing multiple individual and environmental factors as potential predictors of parental psychological aggression and physical assault toward children with asd. guided by a developmental-ecological perspective, we hypothesized that harsh parental discipline would be shaped by the characteristics of the child (symptom severity), the parent (parenting stress), the family (economic pressure), and the broader context (discrimination in the community). method: a total of 424 hong kong parents of children with asd completed standardized questionnaires. the hypotheses were tested using bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses. results: at the bivariate level, child symptom severity, parenting stress, family economic pressure, and experienced discrimination were positively associated with parental psychological aggression. moreover, child symptom severity and parenting stress were positively associated with parental physical assault. at the multivariate level, parenting stress was significantly related to psychological aggression, while child symptom severity and parenting stress were significantly related to physical assault. mediation analyses further demonstrated that psychological aggression partially mediated the effect of parenting stress on physical assault. conclusions: theoretically, our findings contributed to our understanding of the origin of harsh parenting practices toward children with asd. practically, our findings provided insights about ways to identify high-risk families and to develop effective child maltreatment intervention programs.

prenatal_development	humans and most of our closest extant relatives, the anthropoids, are notable for their reduced snout. the striking reduction in facial projection is only a superficial similarity. all anthropoids, including those with long faces (e.g., baboons), have lost numerous internal projections (turbinals) and spaces (recesses). in sum, this equates to the loss of certain regions of olfactory mucosa in anthropoids. in addition, an accessory olfactory organ, the vomeronasal organ, is non-functional or even absent in all catarrhine primates (humans, apes, monkeys). in this commentary, we revisit the concept of anatomical reductions as it pertains to the anthropoid nasal region. certain nasal structures and spaces in anthropoids exhibit well-known attributes of other known vestiges, such as variability in form or number. the cupular recess (a vestige of the olfactory recess) and some rudimentary ethmoturbinals constitute reduced structures that presumably were fully functional in our ancestors. humans and at least some apes retain a vestige that is bereft of chemosensory function (while in catarrhine monkeys it is completely absent). however, the function of the vomeronasal system also includes prenatal roles, which may be common to most or all mammals. notably, neurons migrate to the brain along vomeronasal and terminal nerve axons during embryogenesis. the time-specific role of the vno raises the possibility that our concept of functional reduction is too static. the vomeronasal system of humans and other catarrhine primates appears to qualify as a chronological vestige, one which fulfills part of its function during ontogeny, and then becomes lost or vestigial. anat rec, 297:2196-2204, 2014.

prejudice	in this study, a market framework is proposed for the practical implementation of lossy financial transmission rights (ftrs). the advantage of lossy ftrs over conventional ftrs is that the lossy ftrs can be settled directly according to locational marginal prices (lmps) without requiring any lmp decomposition. therefore, the price risk for a forward contract can be perfectly hedged if the power transaction involved perfectly matches the corresponding ftr. although proposed long back, lossy ftrs still did not find an entry to the market because of the prejudice of market complexity and inefficiency. the principal aim of this study is, thus, to create the necessary environment so as to make those fine risk-hedging tools available in the market. first of all, a suitable format for forward contracts is prescribed to enable proper utilisation of lossy ftrs. the detailed lossy ftr auction model is prepared based upon a suitable optimal power flow (opf) formulation. in addition, the implementation of lossy ftrs is shown for an ac-dc system by appropriately modelling the dc-line power flow behaviour according to the chosen opf framework. the lossy ftr auction model prepared is thoroughly verified for the ftr issuance as per the market expectations.
leadership	purpose. the impact of an interprofessional faculty development fellowship (fdf) on pharmacy graduates' careers is described. summary. the fdf instructional approach is a longitudinal acquisition and application of knowledge, skills, and attitudes fostered by clinical care delivery, teaching experiences, structured reflection, the giving and receiving of feedback, research and scholarly projects, and leadership development and exercises. interprofessional fdf fellows teach, learn, and provide care together in both inpatient and outpatient clinical settings as a part of the evidence-based medicine curriculum, providing educational sessions for medical students, pharmacy students, medical residents, attending family medicine physicians, and clinical pharmacy faculty throughout the year. twenty-seven of the 30 pharmacist graduates of the fellowship (90% response rate) responded to an electronic survey about the influence of the fdf on their careers. overall, pharmacy graduates were very satisfied with the fellowship. the fellowship fostered a clear pattern of continued, collaborative learning. while additional training beyond a pharmacy residency program is not necessary for a successful clinical career, 41% of graduates pursued additional training after completing the fellowship. open-ended responses for motivations for completing the fdf and influences the fdf had on their careers fell unforced into the fdf curriculum domains, which reinforced the belief that these are the right areas to target for development. conclusion. pharmacy residents participated in a broad, interprofessional faculty development curriculum, which fostered teaching, scholarship, leadership, professional development, and clinical skills. pharmacist graduates indicated that the experience significantly influenced their careers and professional development.
eating_disorders	pre-adolescent and adolescent gymnasts, and especially artistics gymnasts (ag) and rhythmic gymnasts (rg), belong to a high risk group for severe deficiency in / lack of basic nutrients, especially calcium, iron, folic acid, vitamin d and zinc. the increased demands of accelerated pubertal development in combination with the need to maintain a reduced body mass and the intense daily training (without energy recovery and adequate rest) expose particularly the younger athletes to growth disorders, long-term nutritional deficiencies, problems of emotional nature (low self-esteem, dissatisfaction with body image, multiple daily weighing, obsessions with body aesthetics and physical appearance), hormonal disorders (amenorrhea), premature fatigue, osteopenia, and a particularly increased risk of injury. the vast majority of athletes feel that they are on a constant (chronic) diet. it is typical for athletes to spend hours of daily training with only water intake and no other snack, and coaches are aware of this. the detection and diagnostic assessment of nutritional deficiencies / shortcomings and future nutrition-dependent disorders during the developmental ages of a gymnast is a field of study for every qualified sport dietician. keeping this in mind, the purpose of this review is to provide targeted nutritional support directions to elite athletes of ag and rg with priority and emphasis on strengthening the immune system, nutritional strategy for direct energy recovery and the control of timely daily food intake during the annual training season.
false_memories	the autobiographical implicit association test (alat; sartori et al., 2008) is a variant of the implicit association test (iat; greenwald et al., 1998) that is used to establish whether an autobiographical memory is encoded in the respondent 's mind/brain. more specifically, with the alat, it is possible to evaluate which one of two autobiographical events is true. the method consists of a computerized categorization task. the alat includes stimuli belonging to four categories, two of them are logical categories and are represented by sentences that are always true (e.g., i am in front of a computer) or always false (e.g., i am climbing a mountain) for the respondent; two other categories are represented by alternative versions of an autobiographical event (e.g., i went to paris for christmas, or i went to new york for christmas), only one of which is true. the true autobiographical event is identified because, in a combined block, it gives rise to faster reaction times when it shares the same motor response with true sentences. here, we reviewed all the validation experiments and found more than 90% accuracy in detecting the true memory. we show that agreement in identifying the true autobiographical memory of the same alat repeated twice is, on average, more than 90%, and we report a technique for estimating accuracy associated with a single classification based on the d-iat value, which may be used in single subject 's investigations. we show that the alat might be used to identify also true intentions and reasons and conclude with a series of guidelines for building an effective a iat.
schizophrenia	patients with schizophrenia show specific abnormalities in visual perception, and patients with bipolar disorder may have related perceptual deficits. during tasks that highlight perceptual dysfunction, patients with schizophrenia show abnormal activity in visual brain areas, including the lateral occipital complex (loc) and early retinotopic cortex. it is unclear whether the anatomical structure of those visual areas is atypical in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. in members of those two patient groups and healthy controls, we localized loc and early retinotopic cortex individually for each participant using functional magnetic resonance imaging (mri), then measured the thickness of those regions of interest using structural mri scans. in both regions, patients with schizophrenia had the thinnest cortex, controls had the thickest cortex, and bipolar patients had intermediate cortical thickness. a control region, motor cortex, did not show this pattern of group differences. the thickness of each visual region of interest was significantly correlated with performance on a visual object masking task, but only in schizophrenia patients. these findings suggest an anatomical substrate for visual processing abnormalities that have been found with both neural and behavioral measures in schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses.
nonverbal_communication	background: there is limited evidence to support the use of facemasks in preventing infection for primary care professionals. negative effects on communication has been suggested when the physician wears a facemask. as communication skills and doctor patient relationship are essential to primary care consultations, the effects of doctor 's facemask wearing were explored. method: a randomised controlled study was conducted in primary care to explore the effects of doctors wearing facemasks on patients' perception of doctors' empathy, patient enablement and patient satisfaction. primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in hong kong. patients' views were gathered using the consultation and relational empathy (care) measure, patient enablement instrument (pei) and an overall satisfaction rating scale. the effects of face mask wearing were investigated using multilevel (hierarchical) modelling. results: 1,030 patients were randomised to doctor-mask wearing consultations (n = 514) and non mask wearing consultations (n = 516). a significant and negative effect was found in the patients' perception of the doctors' empathy (care score reduction -0.98, p-value = 0.04). in the more established doctor-patient relationship, the effect of doctors' mask wearing was more pronounced (care score reduction -5.67, p-value = 0.03). conclusion: this study demonstrates that when doctors wearing a facemask during consultations, this has a significant negative impact on the patient 's perceived empathy and diminish the positive effects of relational continuity. consideration should be taken in planning appropriate use of facemasks in infectious disease policy for primary care and other healthcare professionals at a national, local or practice level.
false_memories	background: virtual reality (vr) based methods for stroke rehabilitation have mainly focused on motor rehabilitation, but there is increasing interest in integrating motor and cognitive training to increase similarity to real-world settings. unfortunately, more research is needed for the definition of which type of content should be used in the design of these tools. one possibility is the use of emotional stimuli, which are known to enhance attentional processes. according to the socioemotional selectivity theory, as people age, the emotional salience arises for positive and neutral, but not for negative stimuli. methods: for this study we developed a cognitive-motor vr task involving attention and short-term memory, and we investigated the impact of using emotional images of varying valence. the task consisted of finding a target image, shown for only two seconds, among fourteen neutral distractors, and selecting it through arm movements. after performing the vr task, a recall task took place and the patients had to identify the target images among a valence-matched number of distractors. ten stroke patients participated in a within-subjects experiment with three conditions based on the valence of the images: positive, negative and neutral. eye movements were recorded during vr task performance with an eye tracking system. results: our results show decreased attention for negative stimuli in the vr task performance when compared to neutral stimuli. the recall task shows significantly more wrongly identified images (false memories) for negative stimuli than for neutral. regression and correlation analyses with the montreal cognitive assessment and the geriatric depression scale revealed differential effects of cognitive function and depressive symptomatology in the encoding and recall of positive, negative and neutral images. further, eye movement data shows reduced search patterns for wrongly selected stimuli containing emotional content. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that it is feasible to use emotional content in a vr based cognitive-motor task for attention and memory training after stroke. stroke survivors showed less attention towards negative information, exhibiting reduced visual search patterns and more false memories. we have also shown that the use of emotional stimuli in a vr task can provide additional information regarding patient 's mood and cognitive status.
prosocial_behavior	altruistic behavior varies considerably across people and decision contexts. the relevant computational and motivational mechanisms that underlie its heterogeneity, however, are poorly understood. using a charitable giving task together with multivariate decoding techniques, we identified three distinct psychological mechanisms underlying altruistic decision-making (empathy, perspective taking, and attentional reorienting) and linked them to dissociable neural computations. neural responses in the anterior insula (ai) (but not temporoparietal junction [tpj]) encoded trial-wise empathy for beneficiaries, whereas the tpj (but not ai) predicted the degree of perspective taking. importantly, the relative influence of both socio-cognitive processes differed across individuals: participants whose donation behavior was heavily influenced by affective empathy exhibited higher predictive accuracies for generosity in ai, whereas those who strongly relied on cognitive perspective taking showed improved predictions of generous donations in tpj. furthermore, subject-specific contributions of both processes for donations were reflected in participants' empathy and perspective taking responses in a separate fmri task (empatom), suggesting that process-specific inputs into altruistic choices may reflect participants' general propensity to either empathize or mentalize. finally, using independent attention task data, we identified shared neural codes for attentional reorienting and generous donations in the posterior superior temporal sulcus, suggesting that domain-general attention shifts also contribute to generous behavior (but not in tpj or ai). overall, our findings demonstrate highly specific roles of ai for affective empathy and tpj for cognitive perspective taking as precursors of prosocial behavior and suggest that these discrete routes of social cognition differentially drive intraindividual and interindividual differences in altruistic behavior.
prejudice	anti-fat bias in healthcare providers and medical students has serious implications for quality of care of higher-weight patients. studies of interventions aimed at reducing anti-fat attitudes in medical students have generally been disappointing, with little enduring effect. it is possible that some students may be more receptive to prejudice-reducing influences than others, due to underlying differences in their personal characteristics. it is also possible that attitudes toward patients, specifically, may differ from anti-fat attitudes in general, and prejudice-reduction effectiveness on patient-specific attitudes has not yet been evaluated. the present study explored the effect on general and patient-specific anti-fat attitudes of (1) contact with higher-weight individuals prior to and during medical school; and (2) training designed to increase medical students' empathy toward patients by encouraging them to take the patient 's perspective during clinical encounters. the moderating role of individual difference factors on effectiveness of contact and student-reported hours of empathy training on patient-specific attitudes was assessed. a total of 3,576 students enrolled across 49 us medical schools completed an online survey at the start of their first year of medical school and at the end of their fourth year. favorable contact experience with higher-weight patients predicted improved attitudes toward heavier patients after 4 years of medical school, and appeared sufficient to partially offset the effects of dislike of higher-weight individuals at baseline. the impact of favorable contact on general anti-fat attitudes was less strong, highlighting the importance of using target-specific outcome measures. the positive effects of favorable contact on attitudes toward higher-weight patients did not differ based on students' baseline levels of social dominance orientation, dispositional empathy, or need for cognitive closure. in contrast, the effectiveness of training did vary by student characteristics, generally being more effective in students who were more egalitarian and empathic at baseline, with little effect, or even adverse effects in students low in these traits. overall, however, perspective-taking training produced only small improvements in attitudes toward higher-weight patients.
schizophrenia	study objectivea substantial proportion of antipsychotic (ap) use in veterans is for nonapproved indications (i.e., off-label prescribing). not all off-label use is necessarily detrimental to patients, however, and in certain situations, off-label prescribing could be considered justifiable. the objective of this study was to determine the extent to which off-label ap prescribing in a veteran population was potentially appropriate. designexpert panel and retrospective analysis. data sourceveterans health administration (vha) corporate data warehouse. patientsa total of 69,823 veterans who had at least one pharmacy record for an ap medication during fiscal years 2005-2012. measurements and main resultsan expert panel was convened to determine if agreement exists on the appropriateness of ap use in various scenarios. the panel consisted of 10 experts in the field of psychiatry: nine physicians with various specialties, and one pharmacist. we used a modified rand appropriateness method approach to identify potentially appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate cases of ap use. the use of six second-generation aps was examined individually, and the use of first-generation aps was examined as a class. based on data previously collected quantifying vha ap use, the panel was given disease state scenarios for the most commonly occurring off-label diagnoses for ap prescriptions. disease states were coupled with scenario modifiers that the expert panel considered potentially significant clinical factors. among the four disease statesanxiety, dementia, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder29 scenarios were investigated for each ap. none of the scenarios were judged by the expert panel to be appropriate for the use of aps. of the 203 scenarios for all aps, 60% were judged to be inappropriate by the expert panel, and the remaining 40% were considered uncertain. of the ap medications, risperidone (72%) and olanzapine (62%) were the most likely to be seen as uncertain, whereas first-generation aps (86%) were the most likely to be considered inappropriate in a given scenario. widespread off-label use of aps outside of the approved indications of treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, or adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, may not be an appropriate treatment option. according to this expert panel, no examined situations were considered appropriate for the use of aps. conclusionthe consensus of our expert panel was that off-label ap use is uncertain at best and more likely, even in complicated cases, inappropriate. these findings strengthen the case for stronger control of aps in integrated health care settings such as the vha, as well as better education and information for practitioners who provide care for patients with anxiety, dementia, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder.
seasonal_affective_disorder	the health maintenance depends on the preservation of the homeostatic systems, such as nervous, endocrine and immune system, and a proper communication between them. in this regard, the circadian system, which promotes a better physiological system functions and thus well being, could be considered part of that homeostatic complex, since the neuroimmunoendocrine system possesses circadian patterns in most variables, as well as circannual or seasonal variations. with aging, an impairment of the homeostatic systems occurs and an alteration of circadian system regulation has been demonstrated. in the immune system, several function parameters, which are good markers of health and of the rate of aging, change not only with age (immunosenescence) but also throughout the day and year. indeed, with advancing age there is a modification of immune cell circadian function especially in lymphocytes. moreover, immune functions at early afternoon correspond to more aged values than at morning, especially in mature subjects (60-79 years of age). in addition, these mature men and women showed a significant impaired immune cell function, which is especially remarkable in the winter. it is noteworthy the role of immunomodulatory hormones, such as melatonin, in the regulation of biological rhythms and their involvement in the aging process. furthermore, the evidence of a neuroimmune regulation of the circadian system and its disturbance with aging, highlights the importance of proinflammatory cytokines in this complex cross-talk. the biological rhythms disruption with age and some diseases (jet lag, cancer and seasonal affective disorder), could contribute increasing the immune system impairment and consequently the loss of health.
leadership	aims and objectivesto identify how nurse leaders view and experience the opportunities offered by one of the largest global nursing organisations sigma theta tau international. backgroundworldwide, nursing leadership is challenged with addressing the complex issues impacting on care delivery. international nursing organisations are a means to bring together individuals to promote leadership and scholarship for nursing practice to promote patient safety and quality care. the newly established all-england chapter of sigma theta tau international is a recent addition to the society in terms of nurse leadership in europe, as such faces challenges as it establishes its identity and seeks to interpret the organisational vision: to advance world health through nursing leadership and scholarship. moving forward, members views were sought on the goals of the chapter and how they may be enacted. designin july 2013, all chapter members at that time had been nominated on the basis of achievement in nurse leadership; all were invited to participate in an online survey. the online questionnaire contained a series of closed and open questions. resultsmost respondents joined because they believed in the vision and networking opportunities sigma theta tau international provides. three themes were extracted from the data: the value of networking and communication, leadership and the development of culturally sensitive organisations and the need for shared scholarship for nursing practice. conclusionfindings indicate the growth of effective leadership at all levels of nursing could be harnessed through successful collaboration and keen support for robust connections between practice and education to promote quality care. relevance to clinical practicewhilst challenging, globalisation presents an opportunity for a nursing society such as sigma theta tau international to work collaboratively to address healthcare issues. a nursing society that explores and resolves its own complex issues by actively promoting leadership and collaborative scholarship reveals a potential to empower the profession to share our collective solutions towards enhancing clinical practice.
prejudice	three studies examined the role of need for affect (nfa) and need for cognition (nfc) in intergroup perception. we hypothesized that nfa predicts a preference for stereotypically warm groups over stereotypically cold groups, whereas nfc predicts a preference for stereotypically competent groups over stereotypically incompetent groups. study 1 supported these hypotheses for attitudes toward stereotypically ambivalent groups, which are stereotyped as high on one of the trait dimensions (e.g., high warmth) and low on the other (e.g., low competence), but not for stereotypically univalent groups, which are seen as high or low on both dimensions. studies 2 and 3 replicated this pattern for stereotypically ambivalent groups, and yielded provocative evidence regarding several putative mechanisms underlying these associations. together, these findings help integrate and extend past evidence on attitude-relevant individual differences with research on intergroup perception.
social_cognition	introduction: relationship perception focuses on social interactions, is reduced in schizophrenia and is related to daily functioning. it can be assessed with the relationships across domains (rad) test, built on relational models theory which states that people use four relational models to interpret social interaction. rad is time consuming, low on tolerability and only used in english-speaking countries. we evaluated the psychometric properties of a translated, abbreviated norwegian version.methods: sixty-two schizophrenia participants and 56 healthy controls underwent assessments of social and non-social cognition. the schizophrenia group completed functional and clinical measures. rad 's internal consistency was investigated with cronbach 's alphas, group differences with logistic regressions and associations between study variables with pearson 's correlations.results: rad was reduced from 25 (cronbach 's alpha=.809) to 12 vignettes (cronbach 's alpha=.815). schizophrenia participants had significant impairments, with larger effect sizes for the full version. associations of rad with study variables were similar for the two versions: smaller for clinical measures and larger for functional and cognitive measures. results were comparable to results for the english version.conclusions: the length of the norwegian rad was reduced while retaining its psychometric properties, which were similar to the english version. this suggests the test 's cross-cultural utility.
depression	literature studies showed the ability to treat neuropsychiatric disorders using h1 coil, developed for the deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dtms). despite the positive results of the clinical studies, the electric field (e) distributions inside the brain induced by this coil when it is positioned on the scalp according to the clinical studies themselves are not yet precisely estimated. this study aims to characterize the e distributions due to the h1 coil in the brain of two realistic human models by computational electromagnetic techniques and to compare them with the ones due to the figure-of-8 coil, traditionally used in tms and positioned as such to simulate the clinical experiments. despite inter-individual differences, our results show that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is the region preferentially stimulated by both h1 and figure-of-8 coil when they are placed in the position on the scalp according to the clinical studies, with a more broad and non-focal distribution in the case of h1 coil. moreover, the h1 coil spreads more than the figure-of-8 coil both in the prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex and towards some deeper brain structures and it is characterized by a higher penetration depth in the frontal lobe. this work highlights the importance of the knowledge of the electric field distribution in the brain tissues to interpret the outcomes of the experimental studies and to optimize the treatments.

prenatal_development	objective: jaw movement is an important mechanical factor for prenatal development of the condylar cartilage of mandible. fetal jaw movement restriction has been shown to cause deformity of the mandibular condyle. we hypothesized that this treatment affects the expression of mechanosensitive molecules, namely indian hedgehog (ihh) and parathyroid hormone related protein (pthrp) in the condyle. experimental methods: we restrained jaw movement by suturing the jaw of e15.5 mouse embryos and allowed them to develop until e18.5 using exo utero system, and analyzed them by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization methods. results: morphological, histomorphometric and immunohistochemical study showed that the mandibular condylar cartilage was reduced and deformed, the volume and total cell numbers in the condylar cartilage were also reduced, and number and/or distribution of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells, ihh-positive cells in the mesenchymal and pre-hypertrophic zones were significantly and correspondingly decreased in the sutured group. using in situ hybridization, reduced expression of ihh, pthrp and their related receptors were observed in condylar cartilage of the sutured embryos. conclusions: our results revealed that the altered mechanical stress induced by prenatal jaw movement restriction decreased proliferating cells, the amount of cartilage, and altered expression of the ihh and pthrp, suggesting that ihh act as mechanotransduction mediators in the development of mandibular condylar cartilage.

prenatal_development	exposure to testosterone during a critical period of prenatal development disrupts the normal display of sexual behaviors in adult ovariectomized (ovx) rats treated with estradiol benzoate (eb) followed by progesterone (p). the organizational hypothesis posits that prenatally androgenized females (pnafs) are desensitized to eb. we tested this hypothesis by first treating pnafs with varying doses of eb (2.5, 5, 10, 20 mu g) followed by p (500 mu g), and second by subjecting females to an established eb behavioral sensitization paradigm where females are first given sexual experience with eb (10 mu g) and p prior to repeated sexual behavior testing with eb alone. long-evans females were androgenized in utero by a s.c. injection of 500 mu g testosterone propionate or the oil control to pregnant dams on gestational day 18. female offspring were ovx on postnatal day 80 and tested one week later in the unilevel 4-hole pacing chamber. genital tissue was defeminized in phafs, and the lordosis quotient (lq) and partial (i.e., hops/darts) and full solicitations were significantly lower, while defensive behaviors were higher, in pnaf females, relative to non-pnaf females regardless of the acute eb priming dose. however, repeated testing with eb alone (10 mu g), or eb and p eliminated the differences between groups on lq and hops/darts, indicating that the behavioral deficit can be overcome by sexual experience. these results suggest that phafs are not desensitized to eb, and despite disruptions in sexual differentiation of anatomical structures, the deficiency in sexual behavior in response to acute eb and p can be experientially overcome. phafs appear, however, to have a chronic deficit in the expression of full solicitations.

false_memories	following collaborative remembering, people may adopt their partner 's contributions as their own memory. in two studies, we asked people to study partially overlapping lists of words. during collaborative remembering, dyads either worked to include all words no matter who studied them or limited recall to only words studied by both dyad members. this differential focus on source information during collaborative recall impacted performance on a later source memory test. nonetheless we found frequent source monitoring errors that displayed an egocentric bias. people were more likely to claim their partner 's contributions as their own memories than attribute their memories to their partners. in collaborative remembering, people work to construct an agreed upon version of the past that quickly becomes each individual 's memory.

person_perception	visual information plays a critical role in the assessment of music performance. audiovisual integration is well recognised in person perception, and people readily match talking faces to speaking voices. this effect exists in identifying music performers, but its strength is untested. this study investigated the importance of visual or audio priming in identifying a music performer from a line-up. half the participants saw a target saxophonist (no sound) and then heard a line-up (no visuals) of saxophonists playing (2 to 5 saxophonists). in contrast, half the participants heard a target saxophonist (no visuals) and then saw the line-up (no sound). participants identified the target saxophonist in visual and audio line-ups at a rate above chance, although identification accuracy decreased as the line-up number increased. those who saw the targets identified a significantly greater number of performers from the audio line-up than those who heard the targets and identified them from a visual line-up. as the task complexity and number of distractors increased, responses remained consistent and visual priming was robust and reliable in performer identification.
leadership	background: leadership is a process by which an individual influences a group or individual to achieve a common goal, in this case health promotion for individuals with disabilities. objectives: (1) to examine the association between the transformational leadership behaviors of the association of university centers on disabilities (aucd) network professionals and their practice beliefs about health promotion activities, specifically cardiovascular fitness and healthy weight, for people with disabilities. (2) to determine if discipline and/or years of practice moderate the association between transformational leadership behaviors and practice beliefs regarding health promotion. hypothesis: there is a positive association between transformational leadership behaviors and health professionals practice beliefs regarding health promotion activities for persons with disabilities. methods: a quantitative cross-sectional web-based survey design was used to determine the association between leadership behaviors and practices beliefs regarding health promotion for people with disabilities. the multifactor leadership questionnaire and an adapted version of the role of health promotion in physical therapy survey were used to measure leadership and practice beliefs, respectively. multiple regression analysis was applied to determine the association of leadership behaviors with health promotion practice beliefs variables. results: transformational leadership behaviors of the aucd network professionals were positively associated with health promotion practice beliefs about cardiovascular fitness for people with disabilities. years post licensure and discipline did not moderate the association between transformational leadership and practice beliefs regarding health promotion. conclusion: transformational leadership may facilitate health professionals' health promotion practices for people with disabilities. further research and training in leadership is needed.

attention	it is commonly known that enzymatic transformations are considerably more specific than classical chemical reactions which usually lead to formation of byproducts. that is why the enzymes are a powerful tool in the field of analytical chemistry. the main problems occurring while working with enzymes stem from their relatively high price and sensitivity to non-physiological conditions. the above mentioned disadvantages may be overcome through enzyme immobilization which allows for reusing the biocatalyst as long as it retains its activity. when the immobilization is performed correctly the enzymes are more stable and also more resistant to denaturation. such an approach in combination with additional benefits of miniaturization, heterogeneous catalysis and flow-mode operation contributes to the various applications of the immobilized enzyme reactors (imers) in particular, microfluidic (mu-imers). in the present review various types of mu-imers were described. particular attention was paid to techniques of their preparation including immobilization strategies and technical solutions connected with their applications using both capillary and chip format.

media_violence	possible associations between television viewing and video game playing and children 's aggression have become public health concerns. we did a systematic review of studies that examined such associations, focussing on children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties, who are thought to be more susceptible. we did computer-assisted searches of health and social science databases, gateways, publications from relevant organizations and for grey literature; scanned bibliographies; hand-searched key journals; and corresponded with authors. we critically appraised all studies. a total of 12 studies: three experiments with children with behavioural and emotional difficulties found increased aggression after watching aggressive as opposed to low-aggressive content television programmes, one found the opposite and two no clear effect, one found such children no more likely than controls to imitate aggressive television characters. one case-control study and one survey found that children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties watched more television than controls; another did not. two studies found that children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties viewed more hours of aggressive television programmes than controls. one study on video game use found that young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties viewed more minutes of violence and played longer than controls. in a qualitative study children with behavioural and emotional difficulties, but not their parents, did not associate watching television with aggression. all studies had significant methodological flaws. none was based on power calculations. this systematic review found insufficient, contradictory and methodologically flawed evidence on the association between television viewing and video game playing and aggression in children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties. if public health advice is to be evidence-based, good quality research is needed.
gender_roles	pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is effective for preventing hiv among hiv-serodiscordant heterosexual couples. gender roles may influence perceived personal and social risks related to hiv-prevention behaviors and may affect use of prep. in this study, interviews and focus groups were conducted with 68 individuals from 34 mutually disclosed serodiscordant heterosexual partnerships in thika, kenya. sociocultural factors that affect adherence to prep were explored using grounded analysis. three factors were identified, which shape perceptions of prep: gendered power dynamics and control over decision-making in the household; conflicts between risk-reduction strategies and male sexual desire; culture-bound definitions of women 's work. adherence to prep in the partners prep study was high; however, participants articulated conflicting interests related to prep in connection with traditional gender roles. the successful delivery of prep will require understanding of key social factors, particularly related to gender and dyadic dynamics around hiv serostatus.
prosocial_behavior	this study examined the role of children 's trust beliefs and trustworthiness in the development of prosocial behavior using data from four waves of a longitudinal study in a large, ethnically-diverse sample of children in switzerland (mean age = 8.11 years at time 1, n = 1,028). prosocial behavior directed towards peers was measured at all assessment points by teacher reports. children 's trust beliefs and their trustworthiness with peers were assessed and calculated by a social relations analysis at the first assessment point using children 's reports of the extent to which classmates kept promises. in addition, teacher reports of children 's trustworthiness were assessed at all four assessment points. latent growth curve modeling yielded a decrease in prosocial behavior over time. peer- and teacher-reported trustworthiness predicted higher initial levels of prosocial behavior, and peer-reported trustworthiness predicted less steep decreases in prosocial behavior over time. autoregressive cross-lagged analysis also revealed bidirectional longitudinal associations between teacher-reported trustworthiness and prosocial behavior. we discuss the implications of the findings for research on the role of trust in the development of children 's prosocial behavior.
problem-solving	drawing strategies are widely used as a powerful tool for promoting students' learning and problem solving. in this article, we report the results of an inferential mediation analysis that was applied to investigate the roles that strategic knowledge about drawing and the accuracy of different types of drawings play in mathematical modelling performance. sixty-one students were asked to create a drawing of the situation described in a task (situational drawing) and a drawing of the mathematical model described in the task (mathematical drawing) before solving modelling problems. a path analysis showed that strategic knowledge about drawing was positively related to students' modelling performance. this relation was mediated by the type and accuracy of the drawings that were generated. the accuracy of situational drawing was related only indirectly to performance. the accuracy of mathematical drawings, however, was strongly related to students' performance. we complemented the quantitative approach with a qualitative in-depth analysis of students' drawings in order to explain the relations found in our study. implications for teaching practices and future research are discussed.
child_abuse	the frequency and severity of physical abuse influences children 's outcomes, yet little theory-based research has explored what predicts its course. this study examined the potential role of social information processing (sip) factors in the course of abuse. mothers with histories of perpetrating physical abuse (n = 62) completed measures of sip, and the frequency and severity of mother-perpetrated physical abuse were collected from child protection services records. poorer problem-solving capacities were significantly related to greater frequency of physical abuse. hostile attributions toward children were positively associated with abuse severity. controlling for demographics and co-occurrence of neglect, sip factors together accounted for a significant proportion of variance in the frequency of physical abuse, but not severity. with the exception of unrealistic expectations, preliminary evidence supported a link between maternal sip and the course of abuse perpetration. future research directions and implications for intervention are discussed.
depression	although early sexual initiation has been linked to negative outcomes, it is unknown whether these effects are causal. in this study, we use propensity score methods to estimate the causal effect of early sexual initiation on young adult sexual risk behaviors and health outcomes using data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health. we found that early sexual initiation predicted having two or more partners (for both males and females) and having a sexually transmitted infection in the past year (females only) but did not predict depressive symptoms in the past week (for either gender). these results underscore the importance of continued programmatic efforts to delay age of sexual initiation, particularly for females.
prejudice	in divided societies, the promotion of cross-cultural contact through the education system has been central to efforts to improve intergroup relations. this approach is informed by an understanding of the contact hypothesis, which suggests that positive contact with a member of a different group should contribute to improvements in attitudes towards the group as a whole. while a substantial body of research provides support for contact theory, critics have argued that its emphasis on harmonious encounters can result in the neglect of group differences and associated issues of conflict and discrimination during contact. the research discussed in this article explores this tension with reference to two shared education projects in northern ireland. research data, gathered primarily through interviews with pupils, confirms that divisive issues are rarely addressed during contact and explores several influences on this: the nature of pupils' relationships, the programme structure, and the prevailing social norms of avoidance.
prenatal_development	the aim of this study was to follow several sequence histological changes that occur during the histogenesis of the rumen in one-humped camel (camelus dromedarius). histogenesis study was carried out on 66 fetuses of camel from 50th day of gestation until birth (390 days), according to the most relevant histo-differentiation characteristics of the rumen in fetuses, these were divided into four groups: group i (5-24 cm crown-rump length (c-rl); 50-140 days); group ii (24-30 cm c-rl; 140160 days); group iii (30-60 cm c-rl; 160-250 days); group iv (60-108 cm c-rl; 250-390 days). at 50 days, the rumen consisted of four layers: the epithelial layer, propria-submucosa, tunica muscularis and serosa. the epithelium glandular region was pseudostratified and in non-glandular region was stratified. the muscularis mucosa was observed incompletely from 140 days between lamina propria and submucosa in glandular region of the rumen to the birth day. the primary lymphatic nodules appeared in lamina propria of glandular region of the rumen at 160 days of gestation. the epithelium of the glandular region in rumen was formed by a simple columnar layer at 250 days. in all groups, the tunica muscularis layer of rumen was increased with ruminal development, gradually. the non-glandular region of rumen was formed by a stratified epithelium and number of these cells increased with ruminal development. the lymphatic nodules and muscularis mucosa in non-glandular region did not observe in all groups. the study observations revealed that non-glandular region of the rumen in the fetuses of camel are less precocious than the rumen of the domestic ruminants.

child_abuse	adverse childhood experiences (aces) have been linked to increased use of tobacco products later in life. however, studies to date have ignored smokeless tobacco products. to address this, data from the 2011 behavioral risk factor surveillance system, which interviewed adults 18 years and over (n = 102,716) were analyzed. logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios of ever smoking, current smoking and current smokeless tobacco use in relation to aces. results showed that less than 4 % of respondents currently used smokeless tobacco products, while 44.95 and 18.57 % reported ever and current smoking, respectively. physical abuse (or 1.40; 95 % ci 1.14, 1.72), emotional abuse (or 1.41; 95 % ci 1.19, 1.67), sexual abuse (or 0.70; 95 % ci 0.51, 0.95), living with a drug user (or 1.50; 95 % ci 1.17, 1.93), living with someone who was jailed (or 1.50; 95 % ci 1.11, 2.02) and having parents who were separated or divorced (or 1.31; 95 % ci 1.09, 1.57) were associated with smokeless tobacco use in unadjusted models. after accounting for confounders, physical abuse (or 1.43; 95 % ci 1.16, 1.78), emotional abuse (or 1.32; 95 % ci 1.10, 1.57), living with a problem drinker (or 1.30; 95 % ci 1.08, 1.58), living with a drug user (or 1.31; 95 % ci 1.00, 1.72) and living with adults who treated each other violently (or 1.30; 95 % ci 1.05, 1.62) were associated with smokeless tobacco use. living with someone who was mentally ill (or 0.70; 95 % ci 0.53, 0.92) was associated with smokeless tobacco use after accounting for confounders and all aces. results indicated that some childhood adversities are associated with use of smokeless tobacco products. special attention is needed to prevent tobacco use of different types among those experiencing aces.
leadership	in an era in which teaching excellence' in higher education attracts much attention, what is scholarship'? in this conceptual paper, i re-examine the notion of scholarship in relation to the goals and purposes of higher education. how does scholarship' speak to value-based conceptions of good' education in the european tradition, encapsulated in the german term bildung? how might the notion of scholarship relate to the principles, practices and outputs' of research? i argue that a more nuanced understanding of the legitimate diversity of scholarly practices in higher education could help individuals develop scholarly careers that draw on their personal values, strengths and goals. it can also help departments and institutions reward education-focused scholars and leaders more equitably. finally, realising fully the synergies between education and research within a holistic scholarship circle' can strengthen institutions' capacities for making an impact for good in the world.
social_cognition	all clinically-used antipsychotics display similar affinity for both d-2 (d2r) and d-3 (d3r) receptors, and they likewise act as 5-ht2a receptor antagonists. they provide therapeutic benefit for positive symptoms, but no marked or consistent improvement in neurocognitive, social cognitive or negative symptoms. since blockade of d-3 and 5-ht6 (5-ht6r) receptors enhances neurocognition and social cognition, and potentially improves negative symptoms, a promising approach for improved treatment for schizophrenia would be to develop drugs that preferentially act at d3r versus d2r and likewise recognize 5-ht6r. starting from the high affinity 5-ht6r ligands i and ii, we identified compounds 11a and 14b that behave as 5-ht6r ligands with significant selectivity for d3r over d2r.

gender_roles	this article presents an examination of mark twain as feminist, or at least as a man (re) considering gender roles, through ""an awful... terrible medieval romance"" (1870). more than a hoax, the story discusses gender roles, as well as touching on women 's treatment by men, sexuality, bisexuality, homosexuality, and-most obviously-cross-dressing. the work further touches on a relationship that appears incestuous as the author delves into areas then undefined but now designated by the grammatical term ""gender."" with a deliberately complicated plot, to convey the dilemma facing women in a male-dominated society, clemens exposes hypocrisy and unfairness women confront. the absurdity behind and the confusion of sexual roles in his story underscore the bizarre situation, assumed if unacknowledged, which male attitudes have created and maintained that men expect women to accept. the incompleteness and deliberate nonending of ""a medieval romance"" symbolize the woman 's unfinished, unfulfilling situation and her continuing status with no resolution in sight.
prosocial_behavior	human prosocial behavior emerges in the 2nd year of life, posing challenging questions about mechanism. an increasingly common claim is that prosocial behavior in the first 3 years of life is neither a result of nor affected by socialization. in this article, we argue that early socialization plays a critical role in the developmental origins of prosocial behavior. to support this argument, we highlight conceptual perspectives and empirical evidence for influences of socialization from parents' reports, direct observation, and experimental studies. we conclude that progress in explaining the ontogenetic origins of human prosocial behavior depends on more fully specifying mechanisms of socialization in infancy as well as what and how human infants learn from their social experiences.
seasonal_affective_disorder	circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm governing physiology and behavior with a period of approximate to 24 h. at the molecular level, circadian output is controlled by a molecular clock composed of positive and negative feedback loops in transcriptional and post-translational processes. clock is a transcription factor known as a central component of the molecular clock feedback loops generating circadian oscillation. although clock is known to undergo multiple post-translational modifications, the knowledge of their entities remains limited. cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase that is involved in various neuronal processes. here, we report that cdk5 is a novel regulator of clock protein. cdk5 phosphorylates clock at the thr-451 and thr-461 residues in association with transcriptional activation of clock. the cdk5-dependent regulation of clock function is mediated by alterations of its stability and subcellular distribution. these results suggest that cdk5 is a novel regulatory component of the core molecular clock machinery.
seasonal_affective_disorder	major depressive disorder (mdd) is predicted to be the second leading cause of disability worldwide by the year 2020. currently available treatments for mdd are suboptimal. only 50% of mdd patients recover in less than 12 weeks with adequate treatment, and up to 20% of patients will fail to adequately respond to all currently available interventions. moreover, current treatments come at the cost of significant central nervous system (cns) side effects, further highlighting the need for more effective treatments with fewer side effects. a greater mechanistic understanding of mdd and the actions of antidepressant drugs would provide opportunities for development of novel therapeutic approaches to treatment. with this aim in mind, we explore the novel, but empirically supported, hypothesis that an evolutionarily ancient thermoafferent pathway, signaling via the spinoparabrachial pathway from serotonergic sensory cells in the skin and other epithelial linings to serotonergic neurons and depression-related circuits in the brain, is dysfunctional in mdd and that antidepressant therapies, including antidepressant drugs and exercise, act by restoring its function.

problem-solving	backgroundnd: orthopaedic surgeons have a pivotal role in transitioning the care of orthopedic patients from a biomedical to a biopsychosocial rrlodel. in an effort to foster this transition we designed a study airried to determine surgeonis attitudes and practice of noticing, screening, discussing osycholpgical illness with patients, as well as making referra s to address psychosocial issues in patients in need, additionally, vve asked surgeons to rank order potential barriers to and reasons for referrals to psychosocial treatment. methods: orthopaedic surgeons members of the science and variation group and ankle platform (n =350) completed demographics, and a 4-part survey assessing the degree to which surgeons notice, assess, screen and refer for psychological treatments, as well ranked ordered barriers to engaging in these processes. results: as a group surgeons were neutral to referral for psychological treatment and formal screening of psychological factors, and somewhat likely to notice and discuss psychological factors. surgeons were more likely to refer for psychological treatment if they engaged in research, or if they reside in south america as opposed to north america. the highest ranked barriers to screening, noticing, discussing and referring for psychological treatment were lack of time, stigma and feeling uncomfortable. conclusion. overall surgeons are likely to notice and discuss psychological factors, but less likely to formally screen or refer for psychological treatment. transition to biopsychosocial models should focus on problem solving these barriers by teaching surgeons communication skills to increase comfort with discussing psychoemotional factors associated with orthopedic problems. the use of empathic communication can be very helpful in normalizing the difficulty of coping with an orthopedic condition, and may facilitate referral.
prosocial_behavior	this study examined the psychometric properties of the child adjustment and parent efficacy scale-developmental disability (capes-dd), a brief inventory for assessing emotional and behavioral problems of children with developmental disabilities aged 2- to 16-years, as well as caregivers' self-efficacy in managing these problems. a sample of 636 parents participated in the study. children 's ages ranged from 2 to 15. exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 21-item, three-factor model of capes-dd child adjustment with 13 items describing behavioral (10 items) and emotional (3 items) problems and 8 items describing prosocial behavior. three additional items were included due to their clinical usefulness and contributed to a total problem score. factor analyses also supported a 16-item, one factor model of capes-dd self-efficacy. psychometric evaluation of the capes-dd revealed scales had satisfactory to very good internal consistency, as well as very good convergent and predictive validity. the instrument is to be in the public domain and free for practitioners and researchers to use. potential uses of the measure and implications for future validation studies are discussed.

person_perception	discrepancies among independent sources of information about presumably identical constructs argue against reliance on a single perspective. to fill the need for temperament questionnaires for teacher and parent informants, we adapted the popular parent/caregiver child behavior questionnaire-short form for preschool and kindergarten teachers. informant correspondences were low as expected, but patterns were consistent with hypotheses drawn from person perception models. internal consistencies of the teacher scales were adequate, comparing favorably with those of parent-rated scales. anticipated relations of temperament scales emerged with social competence and tasks of executive attention for both parent and teacher informants. confirmatory factor analyses conducted separately for parent and teacher scales supported the familiar three-factor model when allowances were made for cross-loadings and correlated errors. a multigroup confirmatory factor analyses with parent and teacher data indicated that the factor structures of the two questionnaires are similar but not equivalent.
false_memories	associative memory refers to remembering the association between two items, such as a face and a name. it is a crucial part of daily life, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is impacted by aging and by alzheimer 's disease. evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) can improve memory performance, but few tdcs studies have investigated its impact on associative memory. in addition, no prior study of the effects of tdcs on memory performance has systematically evaluated the impact of tdcs on different types of memory assessments, such as recognition and recall tests. in this study, we measured the effects of tdcs on associative memory performance in healthy adults, using both recognition and recall tests. participants studied face-name pairs while receiving either active (30 min, 2 ma) or sham (30 min, 0.1 ma) stimulation with the anode placed at f9 and the cathode placed on the contralateral upper arm. participants in the active stimulation group performed significantly better on the recall test than participants in the sham group, recalling 50% more names, on average, and making fewer recall errors. however, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of their performance on the recognition memory test. this investigation provides evidence that stimulation at the time of study improves associative memory encoding, but that this memory benefit is evident only under certain retrieval conditions.

nonverbal_communication	during interpersonal communication, listeners must rapidly evaluate verbal and vocal cues to arrive at an integrated meaning about the utterance and about the speaker, including a representation of the speaker 's 'feeling of knowing' (i.e., how confident they are in relation to the utterance). in this study, we investigated the time course and neural responses underlying a listener 's ability to evaluate speaker confidence from combined verbal and vocal cues. we recorded real-time brain responses as listeners judged statements conveying three levels of confidence with the speaker 's voice (confident, close-to-confident, unconfident), which were preceded by meaning-congruent lexical phrases (e.g. i am positive, most likely, perhaps). event-related potentials to utterances with combined lexical and vocal cues about speaker confidence were compared to responses elicited by utterances without the verbal phrase in a previous study (jiang and pell, 2015). utterances with combined cues about speaker confidence elicited reduced, n1, p2 and n400 responses when compared to corresponding utterances without the phrase. when compared to confident statements, close-to-confident and unconfident expressions elicited reduced n1 and p2 responses and a late positivity from 900 to 1250 ms; unconfident and close-to-confident expressions were differentiated later in the 1250-1600 ms time window. the effect of lexical phrases on confidence processing differed for male and female participants, with evidence that female listeners incorporated information from the verbal and vocal channels in a distinct manner. individual differences in trait empathy and trait anxiety also moderated neural responses during confidence processing. our findings showcase the cognitive processing mechanisms and individual factors governing how we infer a speaker 's mental (knowledge) state from the speech signal.

media_violence	purpose: based on theories suggesting that frequent television viewers act and react in hostile, malicious, malevolent, or verbally aggressive ways rather than being physically violent, the present study investigates relationships between television viewing and different forms of bullying. methods: multilevel regression models were estimated based on cross-sectional data from 31,177 adolescents aged 11, 13, and 15 years from canada, estonia, israel, latvia, macedonia, poland, portugal, and the united states who participated in the 2001-2002 health behavior in school-aged children survey. results: although all different forms of bullying were associated with television viewing in bivariate analyses, only the verbal forms (i.e. ""calling mean names"" and ""spreading rumors"") remained significant in multiple regression models. these relationships were observed consistently in all eight participating countries. however, the association between television viewing and physical forms of bullying such as kicking, pushing, or shoving around, varied across countries. in most weekend tv viewing cultures, frequent television viewers were prone to kick or push another student in addition to verbal forms of bullying, which was not the case in weekday viewing cultures. conclusions: these results demonstrate the importance of limiting adolescents' time engaged in unsupervised television watching, and the need to motivate adolescents to engage in joint family activities or organized after-school activities.

prejudice	aims: to provide new insights into the socio-demographic characteristics of people who frequently attend accident and emergency (a&e) departments for alcohol-related reasons and to explore the findings with reference to stereotyping and prejudice. methods: semi-structured qualitative interviews with 30 individuals (18 males; 12 females; aged 20-68 years) recruited from six a&e departments across london, united kingdom. participants had all attended a&e 10 times within the last year or 5 times in the last three months for an alcohol-related condition. detailed data relating to participants' socio-demographic characteristics were systematically coded and analysed. findings: participants reported many years of heavy drinking, and high levels of mental and physical ill health, unemployment, dependence on state benefits, housing problems and social isolation. frequency of a&e attendances varied greatly by participant, patterns of drinking and other substance use were diverse, and the nature and extent of self-reported health and social problems were wide-ranging. conclusions: findings suggest that people who regularly attend a&e for alcohol-related reasons collectively experience multiple and complex needs, but individually have diverse patterns of drinking and other problems. flexible person-centred systems could help to support this patient population, whilst avoidance of terminology that overstates group traits should help to minimise stigma.
leadership	objective: sport participation shows an overall trend of decline with age (e.g., statistics canada, 2013), with the transition into adulthood often threatening athletes' decision to continue in sports (e.g., lim et al., 2011). this study explored the role of community sport clubs in facilitating sport participation throughout the youth to adult transition among non-elite athletes. design: this study was part of a larger project, which was guided by a case study design. method: eight non-elite athletes (n = 5 males, n = 3 females) that had successfully transitioned from youth to adult community club rugby in canada 's largest city, engaged in semi-structured interviews. data were analyzed through thematic analysis (braun & clarke, 2006). results: clubs first played an important role prior to transition, by drawing youth to their clubs. clubs then built a sense of loyalty, sport commitment, and identity throughout youths' transition into young adulthood; this was fostered by an appealing club philosophy and atmosphere, supportive team mates, and opportunities for senior-junior (adult-youth) mentorship. clubs' strategies for athletes' continued involvement into adulthood included gradual introduction to the senior (adult) level, a focus on skill development, fitness, and health, flexibility in programming, and providing opportunities for leadership roles. conclusions: findings are discussed through the lens of transition/adaptation models, as well as sport participation/development. findings highlight practical implications for promoting long-term sport participation among non-elite athletes, and emphasize the importance of further research exploring the trajectories of non-elite athletes, as they successfully (or less successfully) transition into adult sport.

antisocial_personality_disorder	psychopathy is one of the strongest predictors of future offending and is often included as an important item in structured risk assessment tools. recent research recognizes the importance of psychopathy in offenders with intellectual disabilities (oids). this study presents data on the clinical utility of the psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r) and the psychopathy checklist: screening version (pcl: sv) among oids. the psychometric properties of both instruments were similar, although the pcl: sv might have some minor advantages. first because of the absence of the pcl-r item marital relationships, which appeared difficult to score. second, the pcl: sv is less time-consuming than its extended counterpart. future research confirming these results with larger cohorts is recommended.
depression	objective: to assess systematically the effects of antidepressants and untreated maternal depression on human placenta and the developing fetus.methods: pertinent medical literature information was identified using medline/pubmed, scopus and embase. electronic searches, limited to human studies published in english, provided 21 studies reporting primary data on placental and fetal effects of antidepressant exposure or untreated gestational depression.results: the impact of antidepressants and non-medicated maternal depression on placental functioning and fetal biochemical architecture seems to be demonstrated, although its clinical significance remains unclear. more robust data seem to indicate that exposure to either antidepressants or untreated maternal depression may induce epigenetic changes and interfere with the physiological fetal behavior. two cases of iatrogenic fetal tachyarrhythmia have also been reported.conclusions: future research should clarify the clinical relevance of the impact of antidepressant and untreated maternal depression exposure on placental functioning. moreover, ultrasound studies investigating fetal responses to antidepressants or maternal depressive symptoms are mandatory. this assessment should be performed during the whole duration of gestational period, when different fetal behavioral patterns become progressively detectable. analyses of biochemical and epigenetic modifications associated with maternal mood symptoms and antidepressant treatment should also be implemented.
media_violence	the purpose of present study was to investigate differences in media violence exposure between groups of adolescents with and without disruptive behavior disorders with aggressive features, using a case-controlled design and multimethod assessment. samples of 27 adolescents aged 13-17 with disruptive behavior disorder with aggressive features and 27 age-gender-iq matched controls completed a semistructured interview about exposure to violence on television and video games; parents completed a corresponding questionnaire measure. moderate intercorrelations were found between most self- and parent-report television and video game violence exposure measures. compared to control adolescents, adolescents with disruptive behavior disorder with aggressive features had higher aggregate media violence exposure, higher exposure to video game violence, and higher parent-reported exposure to television violence. results show that adolescents and parents agree about the adolescent 's level of media violence exposure, that exposure to violence on television tends to be accompanied by exposure to violence in video games, and that the association between media violence exposure and disruptive behavior disorder with aggressive features is not due to a spurious effect of gender or iq.

prejudice	this work is the result of a study on the struggles and achievements of the lgbt community in brazil, both in the historical context and in the religious context. we will see initially the discriminatory process arising from the conflict between the human being and the society in which they live and how this conflict may create social transformation. from then on, two main issues will be addressed within the historical trajectory of homosexuality. its prevailing juxtaposition as normal and pathological since antiquity-characterized today by its dichotomized presentation as perversion along side the political debate of social acceptance and achievement of citizenship through the recognition of some basic civil rights to exercise it. and the religious issues-fueled by condemning rhetoric regarding the practice of homosexuality, by intolerance, and the relationship between homosexuals (and homosexuality) and the emergence of diseases such as aids-which have become more open to dialogue, although without promoting tolerance and brotherhood between the lgbt and religious communities in said discourse. even though stereotypes once constituted tend to last for centuries, due to large strides in favor of the lgbt community we are experiencing a quick break with these paradigms. on these issues was founded this monograph, which remains grounded in literary research and brought clarification on the issue, prompting new studies exploring the same theme.
borderline_personality_disorder	successful execution of intentions, but also the failure to recall are common phenomena in everyday life. the planning, retention, and realization of intentions are often framed as the scientific concept of prospective memory. the current study aimed to examine the influence of acute stress on key dimensions of complex ""real life"" prospective memory. to this end, we applied a prospective memory task that involved the planning, retention, and performance of intentions during a fictional holiday week. forty healthy males participated in the study. half of the subjects were stressed with the socially evaluated cold pressor test (secpt) before the planning of intentions, and the other half of the participants underwent a control procedure at the same time. salivary cortisol was used to measure the effectiveness of the secpt stress induction. stressed participants did not differ from controls in planning accuracy. however, when we compared stressed participants with controls during prospective memory retrieval, we found statistically significant differences in pm across the performance phase. participants treated with the secpt procedure before the planning phase showed improved prospective memory retrieval over time, while performance of controls declined. particularly, there was a significant difference between the stress and control group for the last two days of the holiday week. interestingly, control participants showed significantly better performance for early than later learned items, which could be an indicator of a primacy effect. this differential effect of stress on performance was also found in time- and event dependent prospective memory. our results demonstrate for the first time, that acute stress induced before the planning phase may improve prospective memory over the time course of the performance phase in time- and event dependent prospective memory. our data thus indicate that prospective memory can be enhanced by acute stress.

prejudice	measurements via different techniques of the crystal of benzoic acid have led to conflicting conceptions of tautomerism: statistical disorder for diffraction; semiclassical jumps for relaxometry; quantum states for vibrational spectroscopy. we argue that these conflicts follow from the prejudice that nuclear positions and eigenstates are pre-existing to measurements, what is at variance with the principle of complementarity. we propose a self-contained quantum theory. first of all, new single-crystal neutron diffraction data accord with long-range correlation for proton-site occupancies. then we introduce a macroscopic-scale quantum-state emerging from phonon condensation, for which nuclear positions and eigenstates are indefinite. as to quantum-measurements, an incoming wave (neutron or photon) entangled with the condensate realizes a transitory state, either in the space of static nuclear-coordinates (diffraction), or in that of the symmetry coordinates (spectroscopy and relaxometry). we derive temperature-laws for proton-site occupancies and for the relaxation rate, which compare favorably with measurements.

schizophrenia	aim: to assess variability in symptom presentation and explanatory models of psychosis for people from different ethnic groups. methods: clients with first-episode psychosis (n = 171) who identified as black african, black caribbean or white european were recruited from early intervention programmes in toronto and hamilton. we compared results by ethnic group for symptom profiles and explanatory models of illness. results: clients of black caribbean origin had a lower odds of reporting that they were speaking incomprehensibly (or = 0.36; 95% ci: 0.14-0.90) and black african clients had a greater odds of reporting persistent aches or pains (or = 2.92; 95% ci: 1.32-6.50). black african clients had a lower odds of attributing the cause of psychosis to hereditary factors (or = 0.41; 95% ci: 0.19-0.89) or to substance abuse (or = 0.29; 95% ci: 0.13-0.67) and had a lower odds of assigning responsibility for their illness to themselves (or = 0.41; 95% ci: 0.19-0.89). conclusions: understanding the differences in illness models for ethnic minority groups may help improve the cultural competence of mental health services.
attention	chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (cipn) and obesity are prevalent in cancer survivors and decrease quality of life; however, the impact of the co-occurrence of these conditions has garnered little attention. this study investigated differences between obese and non-obese cancer survivors with cipn and predictors of symptom burden and pain. patients with cipn were administered the md anderson symptom inventory and a modified version of pain descriptors from the mcgill pain inventory. independent t tests assessed group differences between obese and non-obese survivors, and linear regression analyses explored predictors of patient outcomes. results indicated a significant difference in symptom severity scores for obese (m = 32.89, sd = 25.53) versus non-obese (m = 19.35, sd = 16.08) patients (t(37.86) = -2.49, p = .02). significant differences were also found for a total number of pain descriptors endorsed by obese (m = 4.21, sd = 3.45) versus non-obese (m = 2.42, sd = 2.69) participants (t(74) = -2.53, p = .01). obesity was a significant predictor of symptom severity and total pain descriptors endorsed. other significant predictors included age and months since treatment. cancer survivors with cipn and co-occurring obesity may be more at risk for decreased quality of life through increased symptom severity and pain compared to non-obese survivors. this paper identified risk factors, including obesity, age, and months since treatment, that can be clinically identified for monitoring distress in cipn patients. future research should focus on the longitudinal relationship between obesity and cipn, and robust interventions to address the multifaceted issues faced by cancer survivors.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objective in earlier analyses of nonhispanic white women we found a stronger relation between abuse history and midpregnancy elevated depressive symptoms in women with the serotonin transporter (5-httlpr) s/s genotype. here, we focus on african-american women (n= 698). our inquiry is motivated by racial differences in depression diagnosis/treatment, stressors, and frequency of major 5-httlpr alleles (s, l(a), l(g)). materials and methods stressful life events (lifetime) and depressive symptoms (current) were ascertained at 15-27 weeks gestation. a center for epidemiological studies depression score of more than or equal to 18 was considered 'elevated'. life events were scored together and separated into six subconstructs. 5-httlpr genotypes were grouped as follows: (i) l and s alleles, (ii) s-lg equivalence ('triallelic to biallelic'), and (iii) la/la, all others, s/s ('high/intermediate/low'). odds ratios (or) for 'elevated' depressive symptoms-life events (total and subconstructs) relations were calculated for each genotype grouping. results the prevalence of 'elevated' depressive symptoms did not vary by genotype. the relation between stressful life events and 'elevated' depressive symptoms was stronger in s/s compared with la/la genotype (interaction p = 0.11). of the six subconstructs, only abuse showed a statistically significant gene-environment interaction. the or for the abuse-'elevated' depressive symptoms association was greater for s/s vs. la/la genotype (interaction p = 0.03) and in the 'triallelic to biallelic' grouping (interaction p = 0.04). in the 'high/intermediate/low' grouping, 'low' (s/s) had a higher or (5.5) than both 'intermediate' and 'high' (ors <= 2.3) (interaction p = 0.10). conclusions these results show the importance of examining racial groups, specific stressful events, and different 5-httlpr genotype groupings when exploring gene-environment interactions in depression. psychiatr genet 21: 271-280 (c) 2011 wolters kluwer health | lippincott williams & wilkins. psychiatric genetics 2011, 21: 271-280
social_cognition	in heterosexual individuals, attention is automatically captured by physically attractive members of the opposite sex. although helpful for selecting new mates, attention to attractive relationship alternatives can threaten satisfaction with and commitment to an existing romantic relationship. the current study tested the hypothesis that although a mating prime would increase selective attention to attractive opposite-sex targets (relative to less attractive targets) among single participants, this effect would be reduced among people already committed to a long-term romantic partner. consistent with hypotheses, whereas single participants responded to a mating prime with greater attentional adhesion to physically attractive opposite-sex targets (relative to less attractive targets), participants in a committed romantic relationship showed no such effect. these findings extend previous research suggesting the presence of relationship maintenance mechanisms that operate at early stages of social cognition.
person_perception	easily perceived identities (e.g., race) may interact with perceptually ambiguous identities (e.g., sexual orientation) in meaningful but elusive ways. here, we investigated how intersecting identities impact impressions of leadership. people perceived gay black men as better leaders than members of either single-minority group (i.e., gay or black). yet, different traits supported judgments of the leadership abilities of black and white targets; for instance, warmth positively predicted leadership judgments for black men but dominance positively predicted leadership judgments for white men. these differences partly occurred because of different perceptions of masculinity across the intersection of race and sexual orientation. indeed, both categorical (race and sex) and noncategorical (trait) social information contributed to leadership judgments. these findings highlight differences in the traits associated with leadership in black and white men, as well as the importance of considering how intersecting cues associated with obvious and ambiguous groups moderate perceptions.
nonverbal_communication	dance movement is intrinsically connected to the rhythm of music and is a fundamental form of nonverbal communication present in daily human interactions. in order to enable robots to interact with humans in natural real-world environments through dance, these robots must be able to listen to music while robustly tracking the beat of continuous musical stimuli and simultaneously responding to human speech. in this paper, we propose the integration of a real-time beat tracking system with state recovery with different preprocessing solutions used in robot audition for its application to interactive dancing robots. the proposed system is assessed under different real-world acoustic conditions of increasing complexity, which consider multiple audio sources of different kinds, multiple noise sources of different natures, continuous musical and speech stimuli, and the effects of beat-synchronous ego-motion noise and of jittering in ego noise (en). the overall results suggest improved beat tracking accuracy with lower reaction times to music transitions, while still enhancing automatic speech recognition (asr) run in parallel in the most challenging conditions. these results corroborate the application of the proposed system for interactive dancing robots.
prosocial_behavior	this article integrates knowledge from health psychology, life course development, and social psychology to outline a theoretical framework for identifying, investigating, promoting, and evaluating beneficial action. beneficial action is defined as a subset of prosocial (motivated to benefit others that may include self-interest) and altruistic (prosocial motivation without self-interest) behavior that uses consequential (scientific) knowledge to increase freedom within the global population. beneficial action theory seeks to increase political and social actions that are planned and evaluated to ensure key tasks in human development. central among these is the broadening of social identity to ensure that the human potential to use science to modify the natural environment achieves benefits for the global population. this article presents a theoretical framework for conceptualizing the psychological processes that underlie the development, application and evaluation of beneficial action for individuals and populations. the need to conceptualize beneficial action arises from 3 related observations. first, the certainty of knowledge of the beneficial outcome of a specific human action increases the moral motivation to engage in that action. for example, there is consensus among psychologists and other professions that it is unethical to engage in therapeutic practices that have evidence for neutral or harmful consequences. second, due to the rapid increase in scientific knowledge, the range of human action that has scientifically ascertainable consequences is rapidly expanding. third, advancing scientific knowledge means that human actions have increasingly powerful consequences for humanity and the natural world, warranting careful consideration of how to ensure global population benefits.
prejudice	of an estimated 6.8 million households in the united states headed by young adults, aged 19-25, 5 percent receive housing assistance that is funded by the u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud). this research looks for evidence in the 2011 american housing survey that the stigma associated with residence in hud-assisted housing has translated into low self-efficacy and the why try response to becoming economically self-sufficient. in 2011, a majority of these young householders, 58 percent, participated in the labor force, with household median incomes at 96 percent of the poverty line. forty percent of householders with less than good health or disability participated in the labor force. the vast majority was also parenting. small families were the norm. an estimated 526,000 children under age 18 lived in assisted housing headed by these young millennials. of these, 158,000 children were under age 5 and living in households headed by a single adult who was not a labor force participant. logistic regression was used to find whether there were any statistically significant predictors of labor force participation at the 0.10 level. good health and no disability of the respondent (or=3.3, ci=1.5-7.4) and educational attainment of some college (or=3.2, ci=1.0-10.2) were statistically significant for the entire sample. each additional adult in the household also increased (or=1.9) the odds of labor force participation by the household head (ci=.9-3.7). for households headed by a single adult, residence in the midwest census region depressed labor force participation (or=.32, ci=.10-1.00). we conclude that the discovery of these statistically significant predictors suggests that the stigma of living in assisted housing does not create such low self-efficacy that labor force participation is avoided. assisted housing reduces the burden on shelters and foster care systems as well as provides a significant safety net for workers who are unable to earn a living wage.
child_abuse	allegations of sexual abuse made against the former bbc entertainer, jimmy savile by former pupils of a girls' residential school attracted worldwide publicity when they were reported in a tv programme in 2012. the savile case has had major political and cultural reverberations, with the establishment of official inquiries across the countries of the uk to investigate claims of historical abuse. responses reinforce what has become a default position in respect of allegations of historical abuse-that we should believe those telling such stories. this article presents a case study, which introduces some caution in that regard. accounts of the past are constructed in particular social and cultural contexts and cannot be regarded as necessarily reflecting any wider, objective reality. moreover, unquestioning 'belief', while it may be posited as giving voice to former care home residents, may mask another politics of voice, within which these views are appropriated by more powerful cultural elites. this situation has implications for those who claim abuse, those accused of such abuse and for natural and social justice. the article begins to address some of the ethical issues raised when professionals encounter stories of historical abuse.
child_abuse	this research analyses the emotional competence difficulties (measured through emotional intelligence and empathy) and social communication disorders of young victims of abuse. these minors are in residential care centres with protective measures after suffering maltreatment and/or neglect. the relation between their emotional competence and social communication is analysed, as well as the contribution of empathy and emotional intelligence in predicting their social communication. the results indicate that a lack of emotional competence is related to and can predict their difficulties in social communication. the study manifests a scarcity of emotional intelligence, affecting attention, emotional repair and clarity of feelings, as well as a deterioration in affective and cognitive empathy. the minors' scarce ability to put themselves in the place of others, to understand others' intentions and emotional states, limits their use of language in social interactions. the research stresses the need to set up intervention programmes aimed at training in interpersonal and intrapersonal emotional competences which can encourage social communication.
seasonal_affective_disorder	polymorphisms in human circadian genes are potential genetic markers that affect diurnal preference in several populations. in this study, we evaluated whether four polymorphisms in circadian genes clock, arntl, per2, and gnb3 were associated with diurnal preference in a korean population. in all, 499 healthy subjects were genotyped for four functional polymorphisms in clock, arntl, per2, and gnb3. composite scale of morningness (csm) was applied to measure phenotype patterns of human diurnal preference. in addition, three subscale scores, i.e. ""morningness,"" ""activity planning,"" and ""morning alertness,"" were extracted from the csm. no significant associations were observed between csm scores and clock (rs1801260) genotype or t allele carrier status, csm scores and arntl (rs2278749) c allele carrier status, and csm scores and gnb3 (rs5443) genotype or c allele carrier status. however, total csm scores and scores of its subscales were significantly associated with per2 (rs934945) genotype (p = 0.010, p = 0.018, and p = 0.005 for total, morningness, and activity planning, respectively) and g allele carrier status (p = 0.003, p = 0.005, and p = 0.002 for total, morningness, and activity planning, respectively). the best model result obtained by performing multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis (chi(2) = 11.2798, p = 0.0008) indicated that interaction among c/t single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in arntl, c/t snp in gnb3, and g/a snp in per2 synergistically affected the risk associated with diurnal preference toward eveningness. these results suggest that circadian gene per2 is associated with diurnal preference in healthy korean population. although polymorphisms in arntl and gnb3 were not significantly associated with diurnal preference, their interactions with the polymorphism in per2 may synergistically increase the risk of diurnal preference toward eveningness.
antisocial_personality_disorder	background: the literature provides several studies on the effects of cocaine when exposed to the fetus. however, the majority of these data comes from animal models. objective: the objective of this study is to present socio-demographic and clinical data in crack-cocaine using pregnant women and their babies, as compared to non-users. methods: cross-sectional study, comprised by 56 dyads of crack-cocaine using mothers-babies and 89 control dyads. in addition to the socio-demographic data and the babies' information, data collection was based on abipemi for socioeconomic level, wais for iq, mini for psychopathology and assist for drug use. results: most crack users, in comparison to non-users, did not have a partner (10.52% vs 4.4%, p = 0.001) and presented lower iq (78.15, +/-8.07 vs 84.27 +/- 9.87; p = 0.002). the prevalence of antisocial personality disorder and suicide risk in users was higher than in non-users (24.44% vs none, p < 0.001; 28.26% vs 10.46% p = 0.01). most of the users did not participate in prenatal care (75%). the babies that the crack-cocaine using mothers gave birth to weighed significantly less than the controls (2.858 g vs 3.240 g, p = 0.002). discussion: users had a higher degree of psychopathology and lower attendance in prenatal care. there was an overlap of adverse factors, both for exposed mothers and babies. the sum of these vulnerabilities could result in significant harm to the developing infant.
person_perception	this chapter integrates literature on both expectations toward and perceptions of media. the author argues that those expectations and perceptions are important explanatory variables for the selection and effects of media. the chapter brings together ideas from the uses-and-gratifications tradition, from research on hostile media and third person perceptions, and from media credibility research in a model of the uses and perceptions of media. in the model audience perceptions are introduced as important antecedents of media use as well as of future expectations toward media. the chapter emphasizes the importance of media perceptions as their effects are not limited to an attitudinal level, but also regard political participation, voting and other behavioral responses. the chapter concludes with a call for more scholarly efforts linking uses and perceptions of media in political communication research.
leadership	opinion dynamics investigates the fusion process of the opinion formation in a group of agents, and is a powerful tool for supporting the management of public opinions. however, in real-life situations, firms or administrations are not only interested in the formation of public opinions, but also hope to influence and guide the forming opinions to reach either a consensus or even more a specific consensus point. this paper aims at developing a consensus building process in opinion dynamics, based on the concept leadership, by analyzing the structure of the social network in which all agents can form a consensus. it is then proposed a strategy adding a minimum number of interactions in the social network to form a consensus based on leadership, and afterwards it is generalized the consensus strategy to deal with the consensus problem with an established target. eventually, detailed theoretical proofs and numerical analysis are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the consensus strategy.

antisocial_personality_disorder	there is a paucity of research on how psychopathy relates to decision-making. in this study, we assessed the relationship between affective decision-making and psychopathic personality. a sample of prisoners (n = 49) was characterized in terms of psychopathic traits using the psychopathic checklist: screening version (pcl:sv). decision-making was assessed using the iowa gambling task (igt). higher levels of psychopathy related to more advantageous choices (p = .003). also counter-intuitively, higher levels of antisocial traits (facet 4) predicted advantageous choices during the learning phase of the task (p = .004). our findings suggest that some psychopathic facets may be more relevant to decision-making under risk, and highlight the importance of further investigations considering facet and trait-level relationships with decision-making.
prenatal_development	the effects of prenatal low-dose irradiation with heavy ions on embryonic development in mice and on melanocyte differentiation are not well understood. we performed whole-body irradiation of pregnant c57bl/10j mice at embryonic day 9 (e9) with a single dose of gamma-rays, silicon, argon or iron ions. the number of living embryos and embryonic body weight at e18 decreased after exposure to heavy ions at high doses. malformations such as small eyes and limb anomalies were observed in heavy-ion-treated embryos, but not in gamma-ray-treated embryos. the frequency of abnormally curved tails was increased by exposure to gamma-rays and argon and iron ions even at a dose of 0.1 gy (p < 0.05). in contrast, a dose-dependent decrease in the number of epidermal melanoblasts/melanocytes and hair bulb melanocytes was observed after 0.1 gy irradiation with gamma-rays or heavy ions (p < 0.01). the decrease in the number of dorsal hair bulb melanocytes, dorsal and ventral epidermal melanoblasts/melanocytes and ventral hair bulb melanocytes was not necessarily correlated with the linear energy transfer of the radiation tested. moreover, the effects of heavy ions were larger on the ventral skin than on the dorsal skin, indicating that the sensitivity of melanocytes to heavy ions differs between the dorsal and ventral skin. taken together, these results suggest that the effects of the low-dose heavy ions differ between cell types and tissues, and the effects on the prenatal development of mice and melanocyte development are not necessarily greater than those of gamma-rays.
false_memories	we created the conditions necessary for cognitive representations to develop by presenting individuals and groups with word lists consisting of items high and low in associative strength. strong cognitive representations were found to promote more schema-consistent memory errors than weaker representations. moreover, strong cognitive representations resulted in more of these errors for groups than individuals. weak cognitive representations, in contrast, resulted in fewer of these errors for groups than individuals. we find that variation in the frequency of memory errors between individuals and groups is influenced by the strength of shared representations that interfere with the ability of groups to correct schema-consistent memory errors among their members. further analyses suggest that strong shared representations also aid correct recall relative to weak shared representations. we conclude that despite general advantages of collaboration, select circumstances that allow for strong shared representations may promote schema-consistent memory errors in groups.
attention	bodily knowledge has attracted significant attention within the humanities and other related fields over the last two decades. although theoretical discussion on bodily knowledge in the context of physical education has been active over the past 10 years, these discussions lack clear conceptual analyses of bodily knowledge. using a phenomenological approach, the purpose of this paper is to clarify the notion of bodily knowledge, furthering epistemological discussions of the topic within reflective, embodied practices. instead of seeing bodily knowledge inherently connected to the acquisition of motor skills or improving physical fitness, we will discuss physical training as a reflective, embodied process that can turn sensuous information about the moving body into knowledge. using outdoor running as an example, we describe the process of forming bodily knowledge, which includes: (1) the exploring and identifying of movement qualities, (2) developing capabilities of registering changes in the body and (3) directing and modifying one 's own training processes based on bodily findings. contextualizing this epistemological discussion with adults' recreational physical activity, this paper argues that bodily knowledge can cultivate individuals to trust their own body awareness and embodied responses to take more responsibility for their own physical exercise. when biomedical knowledge of the body in sport sciences tends to shrink the body to physiological attributes, such as muscle mass and fat percentage, our analysis stresses the agency of the lived body as a source of knowledge in physical activity.
prenatal_development	background/aims smooth muscle cells (smcs) characteristically express serum response factor (srf), which regulates their development. the role of srf in smc plasticity in the pathophysiological conditions of gastrointestinal (gi) tract is less characterized. methods we generated smc-specific sri knockout mice and characterized the prenatally lethal phenotype using ultrasound biomicroscopy and histological analysis. we used small bowel partial obstruction surgeries and primary cell culture using cell-specific enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) mouse lines to study phenotypic and molecular changes of smcs by immunofluorescence, western blotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. finally we examined srf change in human rectal prolapse tissue by immunofluorescence. results congenital smc-specific sri knockout mice died before birth and displayed severe gi and cardiac defects. partial obstruction resulted in an overall increase in srf protein expression. however, individual smcs appeared to gradually lose srf in the hypertrophic muscle. cells expressing low levels of srf also expressed low levels of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (pdgfr alpha(low)) and ki67. smcs grown in culture recaptured the phenotypic switch from differentiated smcs to proliferative pdgfr alpha(low) cells. the immediate and dramatic reduction of srf and myh11 mrna expression confirmed the phenotypic change. human rectal prolapse tissue also demonstrated significant loss of srf expression. conclusions srf expression in smcs is essential for prenatal development of the gi tract and heart. following partial obstruction, smcs down-regulate srf to transition into proliferative pdgfr alpha(low) cells that may represent a phenotype responsible for their plasticity. these findings demonstrate that srf also plays a critical role in the remodeling process following gi injury.
antisocial_personality_disorder	recently developed models of psychopathy include such traits as fearlessness, boldness, and invulnerability. section iii of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5) includes as well a psychopathy specifier that is modeled after these traits. the purpose of the current study was to test empirically the convergent and discriminant validity of the psychopathic personality inventory-revised (ppi-r), the triarchic psychopathy measure (tripm), the elemental psychopathy assessment (epa), and the personality inventory for dsm-5 (pid-5) with respect to their relationship to one another, with traditional measures of psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder, and with a measure of the 5-factor model. participants were 2 samples of community adults (280 and 196) who indicated that they have engaged in criminal activities. the results indicated good convergent and discriminant validity for the ppi-r, tripm, epa, and the pid-5 psychopathy specifiers, as well as relationships with a measure of the 5 factor model that were quite distinct from the relationships obtained for traditional measures of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy. however, concerns are raised with respect to a reliance on reverse-coded items for the assessment of components of psychopathy.
child_abuse	with government 's response to child abuse and neglect seen as one of the most daunting challenges for public policy and law, legislative reform on this issue struggles to adequately protect children while preserving the integrity of family. the authors utilize the child abuse prevention and treatment act (capta) as an example of the funding and policy challenges in reforming federal child welfare law, as well as a lens through which advocates can locate both conventional and unconventional tools to move forward. capta is examined as an important but weak and flawed federal statute. authors present an array of opportunities to improve capta during the next reauthorization cycle. noting exemplary successes, in other recent and related legislation reforms, are suggested for capta to more effectively address ongoing challenges of child welfare.
prosocial_behavior	why do people vote? we design a field experiment to estimate a model of voting ""because others will ask"". the expectation of being asked motivates turnout if individuals derive pride from telling others that they voted, or feel shame from admitting that they did not vote, provided that lying is costly. in a door-to-door survey about election turnout, we experimentally vary (1) the informational content and use of a flyer pre-announcing the survey, (2) the duration and payment for the survey, and (3) the incentives to lie about past voting. the experimental results indicate significant social image concerns. for the 2010 congressional election, we estimate a value of voting ""to tell others"" of about $ 15, contributing 2 percentage points to turnout. finally, we evaluate a get-out-the-vote intervention in which we tell potential voters that we will ask if they voted.
prosocial_behavior	most research on threat documents its negative consequences. similarly, most research on intergroup contexts has emphasized their negative behavioral effects. drawing on the meaning maintenance model and recent perspectives on the potential for positivity in intergroup conflict, we predicted that meaning threat can produce both antisocial and prosocial responses to intergroup conflict, depending on people 's preexisting meaning frameworks. studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that under meaning threat, low ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for peaceful conflict resolution, whereas high ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for military-based conflict resolution. in the context of the israel-palestinian conflict, study 3 found that low glorification was associated with greater support for peace during ""hot"" (but not ""cold"") conflict, because hot conflict reduced their meaning in life. these findings are consistent with the notion that when meaning is threatened, people affirm their preexisting values-whether prosocial or antisocial-even in the context of intergroup conflict.
problem-solving	for students with mathematics difficulties (md), math word problem solving is especially challenging. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a problem-solving strategy, bar model drawing, on the mathematical problem-solving skills of students with md. the study extended previous research that suggested that schematic-based instruction (sbi) and cognitive strategy instruction (csi) delivered within an explicit instruction framework can be effective in teaching various math skills related to word problem solving. a multiple-baseline design replicated across groups was used to evaluate the effects of the intervention of bar model drawing on math problem-solving performance of students with md. student achievement was measured in terms of increased correct use of cognitive strategies and overall accuracy of math word problem solving. results showed that bar modeling drawing is an effective strategy for increasing elementary students' accuracy in solving math word problems and their ability to use cognitive strategies to solve the problems.
false_memories	network science draws from a number of fields to examine complex systems using nodes to represent individuals and connections to represent relationships between individuals to form a network. this approach has been used in several areas of psychology to illustrate the influence that the structure of a network has on processing in that system. in the present study the concept of keyplayers in a network (borgatti, 2006) was examined in the domain of psycholinguistics. keyplayers are nodes in a network that, when removed, result in the network fracturing into several smaller components. a set of such nodes was found in a network of phonological word-forms as was another set of foil words, comparable to the ""keywords"" on a number of lexical and network characteristics. in three conventional psycholinguistic tasks keywords were responded to more quickly and accurately than the foils. a similar trend was observed in an analysis of the keywords and foils (and another set of foils) in the english lexicon project. these results open avenues for further exploration of keywords in various areas of language processing, and demonstrate the utility of the network science approach to psycholinguistics and psychology more generally.

attention	in order to explain the macroscopic radiative behaviour of an open-cell ceramic foam, knowledge of its solid phase distribution in space and the radiative contributions by this solid phase is required. the solid phase in an open-cell ceramic foam is arranged as a porous skeleton, which is itself composed of an interconnected network of ligament. typically, ligaments being based on the assembly of grains more or less compacted, exhibit an anisotropic geometry with a concave cross section having a lateral size of one hundred microns. therefore, ligaments are likely to emit, absorb and scatter thermal radiation. this framework explains why experimental investigations at this scale must be developed to extract accurate homogenized radiative properties regardless the shape and size of ligaments. to support this development, a 3d numerical investigation of the radiative intensity propagation through a real world ligament, beforehand scanned by x-ray micro-tomography, is presented in this paper. the radiative transfer equation (rte), applied to the resulting meshed volume, is solved by combining discrete ordinate method (dom) and streamline upwind petrov-garlekin (supg) numerical scheme. a particular attention is paid to propose an improved discretization procedure (spatial and angular) based on ordinate parallelization with the aim to reach fast convergence. towards the end of this article, we present the effects played by the local radiative properties of three ceramic materials (silicon carbide, alumina and zirconia), which are often used for designing open-cell refractory ceramic foams.

leadership	this paper uses documents generated by the 1594-1595 composiciones de tierras in cuzco, peru, to discuss the economic transformation of the former heartland of the inca empire and the impact of spanish administrative policies implemented in the early 1570s. the diverse social and environmental landscapes of rural areas lying to the west of cuzco provide a range of local case studies that reveal how settlement and tribute policies of the viceroy francisco de toledo failed to produce sustainable colonial towns of christian indians. detailed records of indigenous land repartition in the area show gender- and status-based patterns of individual allocations, as well as ecological differences in landholding between communities. the local records indicate the continuing importance of inca-era community identities and local leadership for maintaining possession of community lands. by contrast, documents related to the composiciones among private landowners reveal vast inequalities in land access, as well as the rapid growth in the demand for indigenous labor to produce important agrarian commodities. we argue that spanish administrative policies accelerated the transformation of the means of production in rural cuzco, creating peasants instead of christian indian subjects.
nonverbal_communication	while the hominin fossil record cannot inform us on either the presence or extent of social and cognitive abilities that may have paved the way for the emergence of language, studying non-vocal communication among our closest living relatives, the african apes, may provide valuable information about how language originated. although much has been learned from gestural signaling in non-human primates, we have not yet established how and why gestural repertoires vary across species, what factors influence this variation, and how knowledge of these differences can contribute to an understanding of gestural signaling 's contribution to language evolution. in this paper, we review arguments surrounding the theory that language evolved from gestural signaling and suggest some important factors to consider when conducting comparative studies of gestural communication among african apes. specifically, we propose that social dynamics and positional behavior are critical components that shape the frequency and nature of gestural signaling across species and we argue that an understanding of these factors could shed light on how gestural communication may have been the basis of human language. we outline predictions for the influence of these factors on the frequencies and types of gestures used across the african apes and highlight the importance of including these factors in future gestural communication research with primates. am. j. primatol. 75:891-903, 2013.

eating_disorders	orthorexia is recognized as an eating disorder, an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, or a somatoform disorder. the aim of our research was to analyze nutritional behaviors for the assessment of the risk of orthorexia. the authors developed a questionnaire in which 981 respondents participated and used it as a research method. both men and women ate mostly 4-5 meals per day (46.30% women versus 34.74% men); however, more men than women ate 1-2 meals daily (18.95% men versus 7.9% women). both place of birth and field of study did not differ in terms of the number of meals. moreover, it was observed that the number of meals per day was correlated with the declared time spent on planning a diet. people who ate over 3 meals per day more often indicates that they spent >3 h per day on planning their diet in comparison with people who ate only 1-2 meals. only 17.6% of the respondents declared that they most often ate meals in a company of someone, whereas 45.3% indicated that there was no rule. the remaining 37.1% of the respondents most often consumed their meals alone. almost twice as many men as women never paid attention to the qualitative composition of nutrition. women followed a slimming diet more often than men (20.3% versus 5.8%) and this indicated >4 attempts of losing weight. around one-third of all the respondents suffered or suffer from eating disorders. owing to insufficient information on orthorexia, it is essential to conduct further research to determine the characteristics of high-risk groups. taking the growing interest in a healthy lifestyle into account, there is a need to address the problem of orthorexia in the public space.
leadership	background: incorporating evidence-based integrated treatment for dual disorders into typical care settings has been challenging, especially among those serving veterans who are homeless. this paper presents an evaluation of an effort to incorporate an evidence-based, dual disorder treatment called maintaining independence and sobriety through systems integration, outreach, and networking-veterans edition (mission-vet) into case management teams serving veterans who are homeless, using an implementation strategy called getting to outcomes (gto). methods: this hybrid type iii, cluster-randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of gto over and above mission-vet implementation as usual (iu). both conditions received standard mission-vet training and manuals. the gto group received an implementation manual, training, technical assistance, and data feedback. the study occurred in teams at three large va medical centers over 2 years. within each team, existing sub-teams (case managers and veterans they serve) were the clusters randomly assigned. the trial assessed mission-vet services delivered and collected via administrative data and implementation barriers and facilitators, via semi-structured interview. results: no case managers in the iu group initiated mission-vet while 68% in the gto group did. seven percent of veterans with case managers in the gto group received at least one mission-vet session. most case managers appreciated the mission-vet materials and felt the gto planning meetings supported using mission-vet. case manager interviews also showed that mission-vet could be confusing; there was little involvement from leadership after their initial agreement to participate; the data feedback system had a number of difficulties; and case managers did not have the resources to implement all aspects of mission-vet. conclusions: this project shows that gto-like support can help launch new practices but that multiple implementation facilitators are needed for successful execution of a complex evidence-based program like mission-vet.
social_cognition	social knowledge beyond one 's direct relationships is a key in successfully manoeuvring the social world. individuals gather information on the quality of social relationships between their group companions, which has been termed triadic awareness. evidence of the use of triadic awareness in natural contexts is limited mainly to conflict management. here we investigated triadic awareness in wild barbary macaques (macaca sylvanus) in the context of bridging interactions defined as male-infant-male interactions whereby a male (initiator, holder) presents an infant to another male (receiver, non-holder) in order to initiate an affiliative interaction with that male. analyses based on 1263 h of focal observations on ten infants of one wild social group in morocco supported the hypothesis that males use their knowledge of the relationship between infants and other adult males when choosing a male as a partner for bridging interactions. specifically, (i) the number of bridging interactions among holder-infant-receiver triads was positively affected by the strength of the infant-receiver relationship and (ii) when two males were available as bridging partners, a male was more likely to be chosen as the receiver the stronger his social relationship with the infant relative to the other available male. this demonstrates that non-human primates establish triadic awareness of temporary infant-male relationships and use it in a naturally occurring affiliative context. our results contribute to the discussion about the mechanism underlying the acquisition of triadic awareness and the benefits of its usage, and lend support to hypotheses linking social complexity to the evolution of complex cognition.
nonverbal_communication	typically-developing (td) children frequently refer to objects uniquely in gesture. parents translate these gestures into words, facilitating children 's acquisition of these words (goldin-meadow et al. in dev sci 10(6):778-785, 2007). we ask whether this pattern holds for children with autism (au) and with down syndrome (ds) who show delayed vocabulary development. we observed 23 children with au, 23 with ds, and 23 td children with their parents over a year. children used gestures to indicate objects before labeling them and parents translated their gestures into words. importantly, children benefited from this input, acquiring more words for the translated gestures than the not translated ones. results highlight the role contingent parental input to child gesture plays in language development of children with developmental disorders.
prosocial_behavior	positive youth development is thought to be essential to the prevention of adolescent risk behavior and the promotion of thriving. this meta-analysis examined the effects of positive youth development interventions in promoting positive outcomes and reducing risk behavior. ten databases and grey literature were scanned using a predefined search strategy. we included studies that focused on young people aged 10-19 years, implemented a positive youth development intervention, were outside school hours, and utilized a randomized controlled design. twenty-four studies, involving 23,258 participants, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. the impact of the interventions on outcomes including behavioral problems, sexual risk behavior, academic achievement, prosocial behavior and psychological adjustment were assessed. positive youth development interventions had a small but significant effect on academic achievement and psychological adjustment. no significant effects were found for sexual risk behaviors, problem behavior or positive social behaviors. intervention effects were independent of program characteristics and participant age. low-risk young people derived more benefit from positive youth development interventions than high-risk youth. the studies examined had several methodological flaws, which weakened the ability to draw conclusions. substantial progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of youth development in the past two decades. this progress needs to be matched in the intervention literature, through the use of high-quality evaluation research of positive youth development programs.
attention	silver nanoparticles (agnp) have strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and gained increased attention for the development of agnp based products, including medical and food applications. initially, the efficacy of agnp and silver nitrate (agno3) was evaluated for inactivating norovirus surrogates, the feline calicivirus (fcv) and the murine norovirus (mnv). these norovirus surrogates were exposed to agno3 and agnp solutions for 24 h at 25 degrees c and then analyzed by cell-culture assays. both agnp and silver ions significantly decreased fcv and mnv infectivity in a dose-dependent manner between concentrations of 2.1 and 21 mg/l. furthermore, poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (phbv) films were prepared by depositing a coating of thermally post-processed electrospun phbv18/agnp fiber mats over compression moulded phbv3 films. after 24 h exposure at 37 degrees c and 100% rh, no infectious fcv were recovered when in contact with the agnp films while mnv titers decreased by 0.86 log. the morphology of the phbv18 and phbv18/agnp fibers studied by sem showed smooth and continuous fibers in both cases and the edax analysis confirmed the homogeneously distribution of agnp into the coating and onto the phbv3/phbv18 layer. this study showed, for the first time, the suitability of the phbv18/agnp electrospun coating for antiviral surfaces.

schizophrenia	the dopamine d2 receptor (d2r) plays an important part in the human central nervous system and it is considered to he a focal target of antipsychotic agents. it is structurally modeled in active and inactive states, in which homodimerization reaction of the d2r monomers is also applied. the asp2314 (also known as acr16) ligand, a d2r stabilizer, is used in tests to evaluate how dimerization and conformational changes may alter the ligand binding space and to provide information on alterations in inhibitory mechanisms upon activation. the administration of the d2r agonist ligand acr16 [h-3] (+)-4-propy1-3,4,4a,5,6,10 b-hexahyd ro-2h-naphtho [1,2-b] [1,4] oxazin-9-ol ((+)phno) revealed k-i values of 32 nm for the d2(high)r and 52 mu m for the d2(iow)r. the calculated binding affinities of acri6 with post processing molecular dynamics (md) simulations analyses using mm/pbsa for the monomeric and homodimeric forms of the d2(high)r were -9.46 and -8.39 kcal/mol, respectively. the data suggests that the dimerization of the d2r leads negative cooperativity for acr16 binding. the dimerization reaction of the d2(high)r is energetically favorable by -22.95 kcal/mol. the dimerization reaction structurally and thermodynamically stabilizes the d2(high)r conformation, which may be due to the intermolecular forces formed between the tm4 of each monomer, and the result strongly demonstrates dimerization essential for activation of the d2r.
leadership	research about the impact of the ceo 's personality on firm-level outcomes has been ambiguous, partly because the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. given that the individuals most strongly influenced by a firm 's ceo are the top management team (tmt) members, this study focuses on the ceo-tmt interface as a salient intervening relationship. we hypothesize that ceo personality traits of extraversion and openness to experience would influence firm performance indirectly through tmt behavioral integration (tmt teamness). using multisource survey data from 138 small- to medium-sized firms, we test and find general support for a mediation model in which the ceo 's personality traits are positively related to tmt behavioral integration, which, in turn, enhances firm performance. limitations and implications for future research are also discussed.
schizophrenia	stress during adolescence is a risk factor for schizophrenia, and medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) dysfunction is proposed to interfere with stress control, increasing the susceptibility to stress. we evaluated the impact of different stressful events during adolescence (restraint stress [rs], footshock [fs], or the combination of fs and rs) on behaviors correlated with schizophrenia in rats as adults. at adulthood, animals were tested for anxiety responses (elevated plus-maze), cognitive function (novel-object recognition test) and dopamine (da) system responsivity (locomotor response to amphetamine and da neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (vta) using in vivo electrophysiology). all adolescent stressors impaired weight gain and induced anxiety-like responses in adults. fs and fs + rs also disrupted cognitive function. interestingly, only the combination of fs and rs induced a da hyper-responsivity as indicated by augmented locomotor response to amphetamine and increased number of spontaneously active da neurons which was confined to the lateral vta. additionally, prelimbic (pl) mpfc lesions triggered a da hyper-responsivity in animals exposed to fs alone during adolescence. our results are consistent with previous studies showing long-lasting changes induced by stressful events during adolescence. the impact on da system activity, however, seems to depend on intense multiple stressors. our data also suggest that plpfc dysfunction increases the vulnerability to stress in terms of changes in the da system. hence, stress during adolescence could be a precipitating factor for the transition to schizophrenia, and stress control at this vulnerable period may circumvent these changes to prevent the emergence of psychosis.
false_memories	the negative features of false memories are frequently at the foreground of false memory research. however, it has become increasingly apparent that false memories also have positive consequences. in two experiments, we examined the positive consequences of false memories. participants were visually presented with false memory word lists and received a recognition task. in a modified perceptual closure test, participants received degraded visual representations of words (false, true, and unrelated items) that became clearer over time. participants had to identify them as fast as possible. identifications based on false memories were significantly faster than those based on true memories and (un)related items. a roughly similar pattern was observed when no recognition task was used and when critical lures were replaced with other items (experiment 2). our results indicate that false memories can be beneficial for problem-solving tasks and counter the standard perspective that false memories are inherently negative in nature.

borderline_personality_disorder	previous studies on borderline personality disorder (bpd) development suggest a transgenerational transmission of parent-child relationship quality, which may also be influenced by parents' mental health status. the aim of this study was twofold. first, we aimed to investigate the transgenerational effect of parental bonding experiences on the development of bpd in their offspring. second, we examined the association between parents' mental health status and bpd in offspring. ninety-one female adolescent psychiatric inpatients along with 87 mothers and 59 fathers were enrolled in the study. adolescent bpd was assessed with the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv-ii, parental bonding with the parental bonding instrument, and parents' psychiatric symptoms with the patient health questionnaire. we found that low parental care produced a transgenerational effect from mother to bpd in offspring. further, significant associations were found between paternal psychiatric symptoms and adolescent bpd. high paternal stress levels mediated the association between maternal affect reported by fathers and bpd in daughters. there is evidence of a transgenerational effect of parental bonding specifically for female adolescents with bpd, compared with other clinical control subjects. our findings highlight the importance of including both parents in future research and in early clinical treatment in adolescents with bpd.
seasonal_affective_disorder	purpose. intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (iprgcs) mediate nonimage-forming visual functions such as pupillary constriction and circadian photoentrainment. optimizing daytime nonimage-forming photostimulation has health benefits. we aimed to enhance iprgc excitation using flickering instead of steady light. methods. human subjects were tested with a three-dimensional matrix of flickering 463-nm stimuli: three photon counts (13.7, 14.7 and 15.7 log photons cm(-2)), three duty cycles (12%, 47%, and 93%) and seven flicker frequencies (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 7 hz). steady-state pupil constrictions were measured. results. among stimuli containing 13.7 log photons cm(-2), the one flickering at 2 hz with a 12% duty cycle evoked the greatest pupil constriction of 48% +/- 4%, 71% greater than that evoked by an equal-intensity (12.3 log photons cm(-2) s(-1)) continuous light. this frequency and duty cycle were also best for 14.7 log photons cm(-2) stimuli, inducing a 58% +/- 4% constriction which was 38% more than that caused by an equal-intensity (13.3 log photons cm(-2) s(-1)) constant light. for 15.7 log photons cm(-2) stimuli, the 1-hz, 47% duty cycle flicker was optimal although it evoked the same constriction as the best 14.7 log photons cm(-2) flicker. conclusions. pupillary constriction depends on flicker frequency and duty cycle besides intensity. among the stimuli tested, the one with the lowest photon count inducing a maximal response is 13.3 log photons cm(-2) s(-1) flickering at 2 hz with 12% duty cycle. our data could guide the design of healthier architectural lighting and better phototherapy devices for treating seasonal affective disorder and jet lag.
nonverbal_communication	this study examined infants' early visual attention (at 1 month of age) and social engagement (4 months) as predictors of their later joint attention (12 and 18 months). the sample (n = 325), drawn from the maternal lifestyle study, a longitudinal multicenter project conducted at 4 centers of the national institute of child health and human development neonatal research network, included high-risk (cocaine-exposed) and matched noncocaine-exposed infants. hierarchical regressions revealed that infants' attention orienting at 1 month significantly predicted more frequent initiating joint attention at 12 (but not 18) months of age. social engagement at 4 months predicted initiating joint attention at 18 months. results provide the first empirical evidence for the role of visual attention and social engagement behaviors as developmental precursors for later joint attention outcome.
person_perception	this review explicates the past, present and future of theory and research concerning audience perceptions of the media as well as the effects that perceptions of media have on audiences. before the sections that examine media perceptions and media effects perceptions, we first identify various psychological concepts and processes involved in generating media-related perceptions. in the first section, we analyze two types of media perceptions: media trust/credibility perceptions and bias perceptions, focusing on research on the hostile media perception. in both cases, we address the potential consequences of these perceptions. in the second section, we assess theory and research on perceptions of media effects (often referred to as presumed influence) and their consequences (referred to as the influence of presumed influence). as examples of presumed influence, we evaluate the literature on the persuasive press inference and the third-person perception. the bodies of research on media perceptions and media effects perceptions have been featured prominently in the top journals of the field of mass communication over the past 20 years. here we bring them together in one synthetic theoretical review.
attention	in two studies, we examine how need for cognitive closure (nfc), referring to an individual 's tendency to reduce uncertainty via rigid processing style, relates to the way attentional resources are distributed while multitasking. previous studies show that nfc is related to focused, rather than distributed, attention. high nfc individuals should thus process tasks serially rather than in parallel. that is, in order to maintain performance on an additional task, they would need to shift attentional focus to this task more often. low nfc individuals, on the other hand, should be able to process both tasks in parallel, i.e. they would maintain performance on the additional task with fewer attentional shifts. to test our hypotheses, we asked participants to perform a main and additional task simultaneously. during task performance participants' eyes were tracked. in line with our predictions, the interest area analysis showed that nfc was related to more fixations and longer dwell time on the additional task. it was also associated with more runs to this task (studies 1 and 2). the effects were stronger in difficult, compared to easy, condition (study 2). the paper is the first one to directly test attention allocation during multitasking depending on nfc levels.

child_abuse	child abuse is a major public health concern that can explain a proportion of fractures in children. osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is the most common inherited syndrome that predisposes to skeletal fractures. we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from clinical, laboratory, and radiographic information from children evaluated for child abuse in which molecular testing for col1a1 and col1a2 genes was conducted. a total of 43 patients underwent molecular testing for oi. pathogenic variants predicted to result in a mild form of oi were found in two patients (5%), both clinically suspected to have this diagnosis. none of the cases in whom oi molecular testing was ordered when maltreatment concerns were thought to be more likely (0/35) were identified to have pathogenic variants. after reviewing each individual case, the final diagnosis was child abuse for 34 cases (77%), and additional radiographic and laboratory studies did not identify any with inherited metabolic predisposition to fracture or rickets. we conclude that routine testing for oi in the setting of child abuse when no other suggestive clinical findings are present has a low yield. a careful review of the medical history and a detailed clinical evaluation help identify those at risk for genetic alterations.

prejudice	as family structures diversify, attitudes towards nontraditional families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. we also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. in study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. in study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as family. in studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional familybut did not affect evaluations of a traditional familyrelative to learning only positive family behavior. despite survey data that suggest that people 's views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.
social_cognition	individuals are not merely passive vessels of whatever beliefs and opinions they have been exposed to; rather, they are attracted to belief systems that resonate with their own psychological needs and interests, including epistemic, existential, and relational needs to attain certainty, security, and social belongingness. jost, glaser, kruglanski, and sulloway (2003) demonstrated that needs to manage uncertainty and threat were associated with core values of political conservatism, namely respect for tradition and acceptance of inequality. since 2003 there have been far more studies on the psychology of left-right ideology than in the preceding half century, and their empirical yield helps to address lingering questions and criticisms. we have identified 181 studies of epistemic motivation (involving 130,000 individual participants) and nearly 100 studies of existential motivation (involving 360,000 participants). these databases, which are much larger and more heterogeneous than those used in previous meta-analyses, confirm that significant ideological asymmetries exist with respect to dogmatism, cognitive/perceptual rigidity, personal needs for order/structure/closure, integrative complexity, tolerance of ambiguity/uncertainty, need for cognition, cognitive reflection, self-deception, and subjective perceptions of threat. exposure to objectively threatening circumstances-such as terrorist attacks, governmental warnings, and shifts in racial demography-contribute to modest ""conservative shifts"" in public opinion. there are also ideological asymmetries in relational motivation, including the desire to share reality, perceptions of within-group consensus, collective self-efficacy, homogeneity of social networks, and the tendency to trust the government more when one 's own political party is in power. although some object to the very notion that there are meaningful psychological differences between leftists and rightists, the identification of ""elective affinities"" between cognitive-motivational processes and contents of specific belief systems is essential to the study of political psychology. political psychologists may contribute to the development of a good society not by downplaying ideological differences or advocating ""swiss-style neutrality"" when it comes to human values, but by investigating such phenomena critically, even-or perhaps especially-when there is pressure in society to view them uncritically.
eating_disorders	this article aims to shed light on the self-perceptions of people with eating disorders in malta and italy through a deep understanding of their narratives. in contrast to the biomedical perception of the phenomenon and in opposition with the prevalent feminist theories on the subject, i consider eating disorders as the result of self-transformative processes. i suggest that anorexics, bulimics and binge eaters are actively and deliberately engaged in a project of moral self-transformation that is culturally defined. the moral transformations of women with eating disorders in malta and italy, the two considered contexts of this research, reflect the social expectations of women in these societies. the drastic changes in personal attitudes towards both food and the body that characterise eating disorders are the result of a complete dedication to the moral values embodied in thinness, namely the control of bodily needs and pleasure. the self-transformative process of people with eating disorders can be understood as a form of moral conversion along a continuum of increasing control over hunger: the higher the control, the higher the level of satisfaction and the degree of moral conversion achieved. considering the general low recovery rates of people with eating disorders, this approach helps in the understanding of why people who are diagnosed with an eating disorder accept medical definitions and treatments to different extents.
borderline_personality_disorder	acquisition and generalization of specific behavioral skills is a key component of dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) for individuals with borderline personality disorder (bpd). we examined the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and immediate effects of the dbt coach, a mobile phone application (app) designed specifically to augment skills generalization through interactive coaching in dbt skills. in this pilot study, we provided the dbt coach installed on a mobile device as an adjunct to 6 months of standard dbt, among a sample of 16 individuals with bpd and a recent history of attempted suicide and/or nonsuicidal self-injury (nssi). results indicate good acceptability and usability of the dbt coach with considerable between-person variability in the frequency of app use and a median use of only 11.5 times over the course of treatment and a 3-month follow-up period. using a hierarchical linear modeling approach, analyses indicated the dbt coach reduced subjective distress and urges to self-harm following app use. however, use of the dbt coach was not related to any treatment outcomes, except for reductions in nssi. this study is the first to examine the use of mobile technology as an adjunct in dbt and highlights some potential challenges in incorporating apps into treatment. implications for future research and clinical utility are discussed.
prenatal_development	background: a low birth weight has been extensively related to poor adult health outcomes. birth weight can be seen as a proxy for environmental conditions during prenatal development. identical twin pairs discordant for birth weight provide an extraordinary model for investigating the association between birth weight and adult life health while controlling for not only genetics but also postnatal rearing environment. we performed an epigenome-wide profiling on blood samples from 150 pairs of adult monozygotic twins discordant for birth weight to look for molecular evidence of epigenetic signatures in association with birth weight discordance. results: our association analysis revealed no cpg site with genome-wide statistical significance (fdr < 0.05) for either qualitative (larger or smaller) or quantitative discordance in birth weight. even with selected samples of extremely birth weight discordant twin pairs, no significant site was found except for 3 cpgs that displayed age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation with fdrs 0.014 (cg26856578, p = 3.42e-08), 0.0256 (cg15122603, p = 1.25e-07) and 0.0258 (cg16636641, p = 2.05e-07). among the three sites, intra-pair differential methylation increased with age for cg26856578 but decreased with age for cg15122603 and cg16636641. there was no genome-wide statistical significance for sex-dependent effects on intra-pair differential methylation in either the whole samples or the extremely discordant twins. conclusions: genome-wide dna methylation profiling did not reveal epigenetic signatures of birth weight discordance although some sites displayed age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation in the extremely discordant twin pairs.
nonverbal_communication	the purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of the autism spectrum disorders-child (asd-dc). mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 333) and mothers of typically developing children (n = 223) ages from 2 to 16 years completed the asd-dc. the confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the 4-factor structure of the asd-dc fits the data well, comprising the following factors: nonverbal communication/socialization, verbal communication, social relationships, and insistence of sameness/restricted interests. the asd-dc was associated with high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. the discriminant validity was demonstrated by the mean differences between asd and control group. high correlations between several subscales of asd-dc and social communication questionnaire (scq) were found, showing concurrent validity. high correlations between several subscales were found. optimal cutoff scores for autism, asperger 's disorder, and pdd-nos were found via roc curve analysis. clinical and research implications as well as limitations are discussed.

child_abuse	across the eight jurisdictions of australia, mandatory reporting obligations and thresholds for reporting vary. teachers are one group of the professionals who are mandated to report child maltreatment, yet some teachers are still reluctant to make such a report. this paper examines the barriers that discourage teachers from reporting child maltreatment and also whether teachers consider it necessary to question a child about the maltreatment before they decide if a report should be made. thirty semi-structured interviews with victorian primary school teachers were thematically analysed and revealed that inadequate and inconsistent mandatory reporting training, the need for certainty before initiating a report and the ambiguous concept of neglect were barriers to teachers identifying and reporting child maltreatment. analyses further revealed that teachers gather evidence to confirm or disconfirm their suspicions of maltreatment by questioning the suspected child victim. the consequences of this practice are discussed along with recommendations to help overcome the barriers to making a formal report when child maltreatment is suspected.
false_memories	recent research has revealed that misinformation from gestures can influence eyewitness memory. however, it is still unclear whether gestural misinformation can emulate the effects of verbal misinformation on the reporting of major details in serious crimes. to investigate the salience of suggestions provided nonverbally, and how these compare to those made verbally, two experiments were conducted. in experiment 1, participants watched footage of a crime scene and were presented with one of two types of gestures during questioning that suggested different interpretations of the crime. the results confirmed that the gestures influenced responses, with participants altering their interpretation of the crime according to the information gestured to them. experiment 2 built on this to investigate how comparable gestural influence was to verbal influence. the results revealed that gestural misinformation caused participants to alter their interpretation of the crime and elicited the same effects as verbal misinformation. across the two experiments, participants were unlikely to identify the misleading gestures or report feeling misled by them. these results reveal new insights into the strength of gestural misinformation and show that, despite their subtle nature in communication, gestures can exert a powerful influence in eyewitness interviews.
prejudice	what narrative is deemed most compelling to justify anti-immigrant sentiments when a country 's economy is not a cause for concern? we predicted that flourishing economies constrain the viability of realistic threat arguments. we found support for this prediction in an experiment in which participants were asked to take on the role of speechwriter for a leader with an anti-immigrant message (n = 75). as predicted, a greater percentage of realistic threat arguments and fewer symbolic threat arguments were generated in a condition in which the economy was expected to decline than when it was expected to grow or a baseline condition. perhaps more interesting, in the economic growth condition, the percentage realistic entitlements and symbolic threat arguments generated were higher than when the economy was declining. we conclude that threat narratives to provide a legitimizing discourse for anti-immigrant sentiments are tailored to the economic context.
nonverbal_communication	recognition of emotional expressions plays an essential role in children 's healthy development. anomalies in these skills may result in empathy deficits, social interaction difficulties and premorbid emotional problems in children and adolescents with schizophrenia. twenty-six subjects with early onset schizophrenia spectrum (eoss) disorders and twenty-eight matched healthy controls (hc) were instructed to identify five basic emotions and a neutral expression. the assessment entailed presenting visual, auditory and congruent cross-modal stimuli. using a generalized linear mixed model, we found no significant association for handedness, age or gender. however, significant associations emerged for emotion type, perception modality, and group. eoss patients performed worse than hc in uniand cross-modal emotional tasks with a specific negative emotion processing impairment pattern. there was no relationship between emotion identification scores and positive or negative symptoms, self-reported empathy traits or a positive history of developmental disorders. however, we found a significant association between emotional identification scores and nonverbal communication impairments. we conclude that cumulative dysfunctions in both nonverbal communication and emotion processing contribute to the social vulnerability and morbidity found in youths who display eoss disorder.

borderline_personality_disorder	this article addresses common psychopathological self-injurious behaviors in adolescents. this article utilizes a cognitive behavioral theoretical approach which includes functional analysis. the proposed objective is to analyze pathologies associated with self-injurious behaviors and relevant descriptive and explanatory variables. this study looks at personal history information, stable personality characteristics, and the consequences associated with self-injurious behavior, which includes self-harm without suicide. it also specifies key mechanisms of self-injurious behavior, such as negative self-concept and self-esteem, forms taken by self-harm and its intentionality. finally, this article utilizes a case study of a teenager with borderline personality disorder to exemplify outlined self-injurious behaviors and traits addressed in the article.
borderline_personality_disorder	previous studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation and the neural changes that are evoked bymusic exposure. however, the link between music and emotion regulation is poorly understood. the objectives of this review are to (1) synthesize what is known about the neural correlates of emotion regulation and music-evoked emotions, and (2) consider the possibility of therapeutic effects of music on emotion dysregulation. music-evoked emotions can modulate activities in both cortical and subcortical systems, and across cortical-subcortical networks. functions within these networks are integral to generation and regulation of emotions. since dysfunction in these networks are observed in numerous psychiatric disorders, a better understanding of neural correlates of music exposure may lead to more systematic and effective use of music therapy in emotion dysregulation.
schizophrenia	the functional optimization of neural ensembles is central to human higher cognitive functions. when the functions through which neural activity is tuned fail to develop or break down, symptoms and cognitive impairments arise. this review considers ways in which disturbances in the balance of excitation and inhibition might develop and be expressed in cortical networks in association with schizophrenia. this presentation is framed within a developmental perspective that begins with disturbances in glutamate synaptic development in utero. it considers developmental correlates and consequences, including compensatory mechanisms that increase intrinsic excitability or reduce inhibitory tone. it also considers the possibility that these homeostatic increases in excitability have potential negative functional and structural consequences. these negative functional consequences of disinhibition may include reduced working memory-related cortical activity associated with the downslope of the ""inverted-u"" input-output curve, impaired spatial tuning of neural activity and impaired sparse coding of information, and deficits in the temporal tuning of neural activity and its implication for neural codes. the review concludes by considering the functional significance of noisy activity for neural network function. the presentation draws on computational neuroscience and pharmacologic and genetic studies in animals and humans, particularly those involving n-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonists, to illustrate principles of network regulation that give rise to features of neural dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. while this presentation focuses on schizophrenia, the general principles outlined in the review may have broad implications for considering disturbances in the regulation of neural ensembles in psychiatric disorders.
attention	recently, the low-cost effective biosensing systems based on advanced nanomaterials have received a key attention for development of novel assays for rapid and sequence-specific nucleic acid detection. the electrochemical biosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rgo) modified disposable pencil graphite electrodes (pges) were developed herein for electrochemical monitoring of dna, and also for monitoring of biointeraction occurred between anticancer drug, daunorubicin (dnr), and dna. first, rgo was synthesized chemically and characterized by using uv-vis, tga, ft-ir, raman spectroscopy and sem techniques. then, the quantity of rgo assembling onto the surface of pge by passive adsorption was optimized. the electrochemical behavior of rgo pges was examined by cyclic voltammetry (cv). rgo-pges were then utilized for electrochemical monitoring of surface-confined interaction between dnr and dna using differential pulse voltammetry (dpv) technique. additionally, voltammetric results were complemented with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis) technique. electrochemical monitoring of dnr and dna was resulted with satisfying detection limits 0.55 mu m and 2.71 mu g/ml, respectively.
antisocial_personality_disorder	background the distribution and co-morbidity of common psychiatric disorders can be largely explained as manifestations of two broad psychopathological spectra of internalizing and externalizing disorders. twin studies suggest that these spectra arise from genetic factors. method structural equation twin modeling was applied to interview and questionnaire data on personality traits and lifetime psychiatric disorders on more than 5300 members of male-male (mm) and female-female (ff) twin pairs. results the best-fitting models for both the externalizing and internalizing spectra differed significantly in males and females. in males, the externalizing genetic common factor was best indexed by four disorders in the following order: antisocial personality disorder (aspd), drug abuse/dependence (dad), alcohol abuse dependence (aad) and conduct disorder (cd). in females, the four disorders most closely related to the externalizing common factor were, in order: dad, aad, nicotine dependence (nd) and aspd. personality traits of novelty seeking (ns) and extraversion (e) better indexed the genetic externalizing spectrum in females than in males. in both males and females, major depression (md) and generalized anxiety disorder (gad) best indexed the genetic internalizing common factor. panic disorder (pd) and agoraphobia (agp) better reflected the internalizing genetic common factor in women, and neuroticism (n) in men. genetic correlations between the two spectra were estimated at +0.53 in males and +0.52 in females. conclusions the disorders that optimally index the genetic liability to externalizing and internalizing disorders in the general population differ meaningfully in men and women. in both sexes, these genetic spectra are better assessed by psychiatric disorders than by personality traits.
false_memories	this research investigated the relationship between false memories induced by two different paradigms (misinformation and deese-roediger-mcdermott [drm]). the misinformation effect refers to the phenomenon that a person 's recollection of a witnessed event can be altered after exposure to misleading information about the event. drm false memory represents the intrusion of words that are semantically related but not actually presented in the study session. subjects (n = 432) completed both misinformation and drm false memory tests. results showed a small but significant correlation (r = .12, p = .02) between the misinformation and drm false memories. furthermore, using signal detection theory, we found that the discrimination ability index (d') was related to both the misinformation and drm false memories (r = -.12 and -.13, p = .01), while the response bias was related only to drm false memory (r = -.46, p < .001). these results suggest that misinformation and drm false memories generally involve different mechanisms and that their shared mechanism may involve the global discrimination ability.
prenatal_development	background and purpose:the inverted-l osteotomy for mandibular distraction in pierre robin sequence (prs) is a useful technique for avoiding injury to the tooth root and inferior alveolar nerve. identification of the lingula is understudied and may decrease iatrogenic complications. this study aims to map the position of the lingula in the micrognathic mandible and compare the location of the lingula in relative normal mandible.methods:this is a retrospective cohort study of symptomatic prs patients. three-dimensional ct scans were reviewed and the relative lingula position described.results:the study includes 11 prs patients and 4 controls. the average measurements were overjet 9.99 (prs) versus 4.28mm (control) (p=0.001), vertical ramus height 16.05 versus 23.04mm (p=0.003), and width 15.16 versus 20.67mm (p=003); horizontal ramus length 26.58 versus 40.62mm (p=0.001), gonial angle 132.64 degrees versus 123.5 degrees (p=0.018); horizontal lingula position 7.25 versus 10.75mm (p=0.001), vertical position 9.02 versus 11.34mm (p=0.026). the ratio along the x-axis in prs was 0.44 versus 0.52 in controls (p=0.138); along the y-axis, the ratio was 0.57 versus 0.49 (p=0.078).conclusions:compared to normal controls, overjet is greater, vertical ramus height and widths are lesser, horizontal ramus length is lesser, and the gonial angle is greater in prs patients. when analyzed as proportions along the height and width of the vertical ramus, there is no statistical difference (p>0.05) in the position of the lingula between prs patients and normal controls.
attention	the works of richard wagner have been celebrated for their impact on progressive elements in european culture, as a bridge from romanticism to modernism. in france the influence of wagner on symbolist writers and artists, and musicians sympathetic to them, has emerged as particularly significant. but there was also a conservative response to wagner that has received much less attention in the scholarly literature. this filiation is exemplified in the figure of alberic magnard and his opera berenice (1911), which he claimed was influenced by a ""classical"" wagner. this article considers the classicism of berenice and its composer from several perspectives: portrayals of temperament that demonstrate consonance with classical precepts, political readings that emphasize classical values, the legacy of the french theater of the seventeenth century, and strategies of tonal organization and motivic development related to the german symphony extending back to beethoven.
child_abuse	objective: to examine the association of pain catastrophizing to pain experience and a history of childhood sexual abuse in women with chronic pelvic pain (cpp) of gynecologic origin. study design: cross-sectional study of women with cpp (n=273) attending a tertiary care obstetrics and gynecology pain clinic. subjects completed standardized questionnaires to assess pain intensity, pain interference with daily activity, pain catastrophizing, severity of depressive symptoms, and a history of childhood sexual abuse. results: correlational analysis indicated, that pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, pain interference and depression scores all shared significant association. multiple regression analysis indicated that, after controlling for the influence of depressive symptoms on both pain intensity and pain interference, pain catastrophizing significantly predicted both pain outcome measures. after controlling for pain catastrophizing, depressive symptoms were found to significantly influence pain interference but not pain intensity. of the abuse measures, only women who reported major sexual abuse in childhood were found to endorse more severe pain catastrophizing. conclusion: pain catastrophizing appears to be an important variable in understanding the pain experience of women with chronic pelvic pain. more over, the presence of a history of major sexual abuse in childhood may be an additional risk factor for pain catastrophizing in this population, contributing to further pain morbidity.
borderline_personality_disorder	although the processes that underlie sharing others' emotions (empathy) and understanding others' mental states (mentalizing, theory of mind) have received increasing attention, it is yet unclear how they relate to each other. for instance, are people who strongly empathize with others also more proficient in mentalizing? and (how) do the neural networks supporting empathy and mentalizing interact? assessing both functions simultaneously in a large sample (n = 178), we show that people 's capacities to empathize and mentalize are independent, both on a behavioral and neural level. thus, strong empathizers are not necessarily proficient mentalizers, arguing against a general capacity of social understanding. second, we applied dynamic causal modeling to investigate how the neural networks underlying empathy and mentalizing are orchestrated in naturalistic social settings. results reveal that in highly emotional situations, empathic sharing can inhibit mentalizing-related activity and thereby harm mentalizing performance. taken together, our findings speak against a unitary construct of social understanding and suggest flexible interplay of distinct social functions.
nonverbal_communication	primary objective: there is considerable evidence suggesting facial affect recognition and cognitive functions are impaired in many people with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). however, little is known about the relationship between these two domains in the tbi population. research design: this study investigated the relationship between facial affect recognition and cognitive functioning in 75 adults with moderate-to-severe tbi. methods and procedures: participants were administered three facial affect recognition tests and a computerized cognitive test battery that assessed seven cognitive domains. main outcomes and results: deficits in facial affect recognition were significantly correlated with impairments in non-verbal memory, working memory, speed of processing, verbal memory and verbal delayed memory. no significant relationship was found between executive dysfunction and facial affect recognition impairments. non-verbal memory, working memory and speed of processing significantly predicted overall facial affect recognition performance. conclusions: it is concluded that impairment in several cognitive processes may contribute to facial affect recognition deficits in tbi, in particular non-verbal memory, working memory and speed of processing. furthermore, executive functioning may not be a critical factor in facial affect recognition, but would most likely be important in deciding what to do once facial affect is perceived.
media_violence	this paper reviews the literature on sex and cultural differences in physical aggression and argues that only through understanding the interactions among evolutionary predispositions. hormonal influences, and social/situational factors can we possibly make sense of the patterns of human aggression that we see around us. specifically, it is proposed that the process of natural selection has shaped hormonal responses in males that are sensitive to situations involving challenges to status and/or competition with other males. and that these hormonal changes are essential ingredients of the aggressiveness that occurs in these situations. models of aggression that focus only on situational and cognitive/emotional triggers of aggressive behavior and attempt to understand human aggression without any reference to biology are destined to be incomplete at best.

eating_disorders	we investigated whether parental expressed emotion (criticism and emotional overinvolvement) is related to children 's emotional eating and whether this relationship is mediated by children 's negative urgency. one hundred children, aged 8 to 13years, either healthy or have binge-eating disorder and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, completed the questionnaires, along with their parents. parental criticism and, to a lesser extent, parental emotional overinvolvement were both positively related to children 's emotional eating, and this relationship was mediated by children 's negative urgency. further exploratory analyses revealed that the mediating role of children 's negative urgency in the relationship between parental criticism and children 's emotional eating was pronounced in the clinical group of children with binge-eating disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but almost absent in the healthy control group. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd and eating disorders association.
borderline_personality_disorder	social functioning is routinely understood to be disrupted for those with bpd features; however there is little understanding of how bpd features and bpd-relevant traits impact social network characteristics over time. we hypothesized that bpd features negatively predict social network quality and composition and that rejection sensitivity (rs) would affect these relations. to examine this, a sample of female college students (n = 127) was recruited and followed over one month. bpd features predicted lower ratings of social network quality and aspects of network composition. bpd features exerted an indirect effect through one-week rs on perceived levels of conflict and criticism as well as on number of partners in the network at one-month follow-up. moderation analyses revealed that bpd features predicted lower social network satisfaction and support at one month for those with high rs, but did not impact satisfaction or support for those with low rs. these results indicate that even non-clinical levels of bpd psychopathology are related to poor social network outcomes. these findings also highlight rs as a potential mechanism by which bpd features predict lower social support and satisfaction and a potential risk factor for higher conflict and criticism within social networks.

child_abuse	shaking and smothering in response to infant crying are life-threatening child abuse. parental childhood abuse history is known to be one of the most robust risk factors for abusing their offspring. in addition to childhood abuse history, other adverse childhood exposures (aces) need to be considered due to co-occurrence. however, few studies have investigated the impact of aces on caregivers shaking and smothering their infant. this study aims to investigate the association of aces with shaking and smothering among caregivers of infants in japan. a questionnaire was administered to caregivers participating in a four-month health checkup between september 2013 and august 2014 in chiba city, japan, to assess their aces (parental death, parental divorce, mentally ill parents, witness of intimate partner violence, physical abuse, neglect, psychological abuse and economic hardship), and shaking and smothering toward their infants (n = 4297). logistic regression analysis was used to examine the cumulative and individual impacts of aces on shaking and smothering. analyses were conducted in 2015. a total of 28.3% reported having experienced at least one ace during their childhood. we found that only witness of ipv had a significant association with shaking of infant (or=1.93, 95% ci: 1.03-3.61). the total number of aces was not associated with either shaking or smothering. our findings suggest that shaking and smothering in response to crying can occur regardless of aces. population-based strategies that target all caregivers to prevent shaking and smothering of infants are needed.

borderline_personality_disorder	mindfulness-based strategies show promise for targeting the construct of impulsivity and associated variables among problematic alcohol users. this study examined the moderating role of intervention (mindfulness vs relaxation vs control) on trait impulsivity and three outcomes examined post-intervention (negative affect, positive affect, and urge to drink) among 207 college students with levels of at risk drinking. moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between baseline impulsivity and the primary outcomes significantly differed for participants who underwent the mindfulness versus relaxation interventions. notably, simple slope analyses revealed that negative urgency was positively associated with urge to drink following the mindfulness intervention. among participants who underwent the relaxation intervention, analysis of simple slopes revealed that negative urgency was negatively associated with urge to drink, while positive urgency was positively associated with positive affect following the relaxation intervention. findings suggest that level (low vs high) and subscale of impulsivity matter with regard to how a participant will respond to a mindfulness versus relaxation intervention.

antisocial_personality_disorder	investigators have reported that cigarette smoking is associated with behavioral disinhibition, novelty seeking, and diminished threat sensitivity. methods. the prediction that smokers would obtain higher scores on measures of disinhibition, novelty seeking, behavioral activation, and related personality disorder symptoms, and lower scores on measures of harm avoidance, behavioral inhibition, and associated personality disorder features was tested. cigarette smokers (n= 75) were compared to nonsmokers (n= 77). results. smokers obtained significantly higher scores on measures of depressive symptoms, novelty seeking, and histrionic, borderline, passive-aggressive, and antisocial personality disorder symptoms, and lower scores on a measure of avoidant personality. groups did not differ on measures of cluster a and other cluster c personality disorder symptoms, disinhibition, executive dysfunction, apathy, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and behavioral inhibition and activation. conclusions. findings lend partial, but weak, support to the notion that smokers are more likely to present with personality features associated with behavioral dyscontrol and novelty seeking.

borderline_personality_disorder	the primary aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of personality disorders in problem gamblers, to explore the relationship between personality disorders and problem gambling severity, and to explore the degree to which the psychological symptoms highlighted in the biosocial developmental model of borderline personality disorder (impulsivity, distress tolerance, substance use, ptsd symptoms, psychological distress and work/social adjustment) are associated with problem gambling. a secondary aim was to explore the strength of the relationships between these symptoms and problem gambling severity in problem gamblers with and without personality disorder pathology. participants were 168 consecutively admitted problem gamblers seeking treatment from a specialist outpatient gambling service in australia. the prevalence of personality disorders using the self-report version of the iowa personality disorders screen was 43.3 %. cluster b personality disorders, but not cluster a or c personality disorders, were associated with problem gambling severity. all psychological symptoms, except alcohol and drug use, were significantly higher among participants with personality disorder pathology compared to those without. finally, psychological distress, and work and social adjustment were significantly associated with problem gambling severity for problem gamblers with personality disorder pathology, while impulsivity, psychological distress, and work and social adjustment were significantly associated with problem gambling severity for those without personality disorder pathology. high rates of comorbid personality disorders, particularly cluster b disorders, necessitate routine screening in gambling treatment services. more complex psychological profiles may complicate treatment for problem gamblers with comorbid personality disorders. future research should examine the applicability of the biosocial developmental model to problem gambling in community studies.
false_memories	although many scientific discoveries were frequently reported as kinds of insightful breakthrough that suddenly illuminated in one 's mind, we can never exactly know whether these afterward reports were reliable or not. in this study, subjects were asked to solve a list of remote associate test problems and got both subsets of the insightfully and routinely solved items. then, this study examined whether people can recollect their ""aha!"" experiences as well as ""non-aha"" ones. it was found that subjects were more accurate in recollecting their aha! experiences relative to the routine ones. the study further examined if the report bias of aha! or non-aha problem solving experiences could be changed by the afterward-suggestive information that indicated the discovery is unique (rare) or not. it was found that the tendency for participants to falsely recollect their routine problem solving experience as aha! ones if they were told the item they had solved was very rare, and the tendency to falsely recollect the aha! problem solving experiences as routine ones if the item were said to be common.
prenatal_development	during prenatal development, a large number of different cell types are formed, the vast majority of which contain identical genetic material. the basis of the great variety in cell phenotype and function is the differential expression of the approximately 25,000 genes in the mammalian genome. transcriptional activity is regulated at many levels by proteins, including members of the basal transcriptional apparatus, dna-binding transcription factors, and chromatin-binding proteins. importantly, chromatin structure dictates the availability of a specific genomic locus for transcriptional activation as well as the efficiency, with which transcription can occur. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) is a method to assess if chromatin modifications or proteins arc present at a specific locus. chip involves the cross linking of dna and associated proteins and immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies to dna-associated proteins followed by examination of the co-precipitated dna sequences or proteins. in the last few years, chip has become an essential technique for scientists studying transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure. using chip on mouse embryos, we can document the presence or absence of specific proteins and chromatin modifications at genomic loci in vivo during mammalian development. here, we describe a chip technique adapted for mouse embryos.
antisocial_personality_disorder	violent behaviour is a serious problem in terms of the impact on victims, quality of life for perpetrators, and the financial burden on the prison service, the health sector, and society generally. however, to date there is not a general consensus as to how this can be managed other than removing the perpetrators from communities. incarceration can be on an indeterminate basis or for a short period of time before reintegration into society, depending on the gravity of the offence. this systematic review critically examines the existing research literature on psychotherapeutic interventions for violent behaviour in forensic and clinical populations. five databases were searched, selected journals were hand searched, and authors of identified papers were contacted in efforts to obtain relevant unpublished work. the first author and a colleague independently evaluated the eligibility of all studies identified, abstracted data, and assessed study quality. the overall findings provide tentative support for the utility of psychotherapeutic interventions in reducing aggressive behaviour in forensic and psychiatric patients with a history of violent behaviour.

media_violence	manga, a type of graphic novel, represent a widely popular literary genre worldwide and are one of the fastest growing areas of the publishing arena aimed at adolescents in the united states. however, to our knowledge, there has been almost no empirical research examining content or effects of reading manga. this article consists of 2 studies. study 1 represents a content analysis of aggressive behavior in best-selling manga aimed at adolescents. results revealed that aggression was common and was often portrayed in ways that may influence subsequent behavior. study 2 examined the relationship between reading manga and aggressive behavior in 223 adolescents. manga readers were more physically aggressive than non-manga readers and also reported more peer relationships with lonely individuals and smaller groups. in addition, reading manga with particularly high levels of aggression was associated with physical aggression even after controlling for media violence exposure in other media. implications regarding these findings are discussed.
antisocial_personality_disorder	neuropsychological deficits in executive functions (ef) have been linked to antisocial behavior and considered to be cardinal to the onset and persistence of severe antisocial and aggressive behavior. however, when psychopathy is present, prior evidence suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is unaffected leading to intact ef. ninety-one male offenders with antisocial personality disorder (aspd) and 24 controls completed the wisconsin card sorting test (wcst). aspd individuals were grouped in three categories according to psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r) scores (low, medium and high). we hypothesized that aspd offenders with high pcl-r scores will not differ from healthy controls in ef and will show better ef performance in comparison with subjects with low pcl-r scores. results showed that aspd offenders with low pcl-r scores committed more perseverative errors and responses than controls and offenders with high pcl-r scores, which did not differ from healthy controls. moreover, scores on factor 1 and the interpersonal facet of the pcl-r were predictors of better wcst performance. our results suggest a modulatory role of psychopathy in the cognitive performance of aspd offenders, and provide further evidence supporting that offenders with aspd and psychopathy are characterized by a cognitive profile different from those with aspd without psychopathy.

prenatal_development	introduction: the endocrine pancreas plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism. as regards the morphogenesis of the islets of langerhans, there is conflicting data regarding the timing of appearance of the b cells, and, the proportion and arrangement of the b cells within the islets. the present work is a baseline study conducted in the indian subcontinent. the histogenesis of the islets of langerhans was studied and we also observed the expression of anti-insulin antibody in the islets at different gestational ages. methods: ten aborted fetal specimens of pancreas of gestational ages 10-36 weeks were procured from the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, lnjp hospital, new delhi. fetuses were fixed in 10% formalin. serial sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and few sections were processed for immunocytochemistry with a specific marker for b-cell, the anti-insulin antibody. results: the cells of the islets arise from the lining epithelium of the tubules. the b cells contain insulin at 10th week as seen by immunostaining. small capillaries are seen enclosed in the islets at 14 weeks. the arrangement of b cells in different islets is variable. the formation of islets continues throughout fetal life. discussion: our study reaffirms that the endocrine pancreas begins to differentiate early in fetal life. the growth and maturation of islets is associated with coordinated vascular development. by the 28th week of intrauterine life, the fetal pancreas attains sufficient morphological maturity so as to fulfil the hormonal requirements of the growing fetus. copyright (c) 2015, anatomical society of india. published by reed elsevier india pvt. ltd. all rights reserved.
gender_roles	background: male involvement during antenatal care is promoted to be an important intervention to increase positive maternal and new born health outcomes. despite active promotion to stimulate male involvement during antenatal care, few men in tanzania accompany women to their antenatal care visits. this study aims to understand perceptions, attitudes and behaviour of men regarding their role and involvement during pregnancy and antenatal care visits in a rural district in tanzania. methods: data collection took place in magu district between september 2013 and march 2014, using a mixed method approach. this included observations at six government health facilities, nine focus group discussions (with a total of 76 participants) and 26 semi-structured interviews of participants, included through convenience-and snowball sampling. additionally, a questionnaire was distributed among 156 women attending antenatal care, regarding their partners' involvement in their pregnancy. qualitative analysis was done through coding of themes based on the three delays framework. descriptive analysis was used for quantitative data. results: male involvement in pregnancy and antenatal care in magu district is low. although men perceived antenatal care as important for pregnant women, most husbands had a passive attitude concerning their own involvement. barriers for male involvement included: traditional gender roles, lack of knowledge, perceived low accessibility to join antenatal care visits and previous negative experiences in health facilities. conclusion: although several barriers impede male involvement during antenatal care, men 's internal motivation and attitudes towards their role during pregnancy was generally positive. increasing community awareness and knowledge about the importance of male involvement and increasing accessibility of antenatal clinics can reduce some of the barriers.
seasonal_affective_disorder	the differential susceptibility model states that a given genetic variant is associated with an increased risk of pathology in negative environments but greater than average resilience in enriched ones. while this theory was first implemented in psychiatric-genetic research, it may also help us to unravel the complex ways that genes and environments interact to influence feeding behavior and obesity. we reviewed evidence on gene vs. environment interactions that influence obesity development, aiming to support the applicability of the differential susceptibility model for this condition, and propose that various environmental ""layers"" relevant for human development should be considered when bearing the differential susceptibility model in mind. mother-child relationship, socioeconomic status and individual 's response are important modifiers of bmi and food intake when interacting with gene variants, ""for better and for worse"". while only a few studies to date have investigated obesity outcomes using this approach, we propose that the differential susceptibility hypothesis is in fact highly applicable to the study of genetic and environmental influences on feeding behavior and obesity risk.

prejudice	microteaching has gained considerable attention for its effectiveness in rapid and contextual training in professional development programs. however, the interpretive quality of the teaching demonstration and peer feedback may influence individuals' attribution and self-correction, leading to ineffective learning. in this study, a microteaching workshop in a professional development program for 78 elementary school science teachers was investigated. the results showed that the effectiveness of microteaching was negatively affected by participants' perception bias due to social categorization. moreover, it was indicated that the participants' perception of the in-group and out-group, classified by the degree of the individuals' science knowledge, fostered social categorization. participants tended to experience perception conflicts caused by their inability to see personal faults, and a typical perception bias of ""seeing one 's own strengths and seeing others' shortcomings"" was more frequently recognized in the out-group. these results converge to highlight the importance of social categorization in perception bias relevant to microteaching.
prenatal_development	the article deals with the attitude of the russian orthodox church to the human prenatal development. due to the increase of high reproductive technologies application around the world including russia the russian orthodox church admits the necessity of stating its own opinion of the human embryo value. the research is based on the analysis of hagiographical materials, biblical texts, liturgical tradition, church iconography, patristic heritage. the paper concludes that the russian church considers the human embryo to be an absolute value. the most convincing evidence can be found in hagiography. for instance the life of st. sergius of radonezh says that god has chosen the great man of faith in his mother 's womb. as for patristic heritage many years ago holy fathers taught that a child leads its own spiritual life in his/her mother 's womb. as athenagoras writes the embryo in the mother 's womb is a living being who is under the god 's care. the most convincing proof that the russian church has always regarded the antenatal life as human and individual is liturgical tradition. among the russian religious holidays are not only the holidays like the nativity of the most holy mother of god, john the forerunner, our lord jesus christ but also the holidays of their conception. there are a lot of monasteries and cathedrals sanctified in honour of these events. biblical basis of the russian church proof of conception as the beginning of human life is gospel of luke (1:41-44) describing the meeting of lady mary and righteous elizabeth. the book of psalms of david the king and the prophet says about every person as the god 's creature known by the god even in the mother 's womb. iconographic tradition knows the icons conception of the most holy mother of god, conception of st. ann, conception of john the forerunner. thus the russian church highly respects a human life from the moment of conception assuming that an embryo formed or unformed is a true human being shaped in the image of god. the proof is found in the liturgical tradition, gospel narratives, hagiography and church iconography
borderline_personality_disorder	non-suicidal self-injury (nssi) is highly prevalent in adolescence and has been suggested as an autonomous diagnosis in the diagnostic and statistical manual (dsm-5). social rejection is as potential risk factor for nssi and depression in adolescence. objectives of this study were to identify differences in neural processing of social rejection in depressed adolescents with and without co-morbid nssi and healthy controls. participants were 28 depressed adolescents (14 with co-morbid nssi, 79% females) and 15 healthy controls, with an average age of 15.2 years (sd = 1.8). social exclusion was implemented using the cyberball paradigm 'cyberball' during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). all participants reported feelings of social exclusion after fmri scanning. investigating the effects of nssi, we found that depressed adolescents with nssi showed relatively enhanced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vipfc) compared to depressed adolescents without nssi and also compared to healthy controls. results point towards divergent processing of social exclusion in depressed adolescents with nssi as compared to adolescents with mere depression in brain regions previously related to the processing of social exclusion. this finding of distinct neurophysiological responses may stimulate further research on individual treatment approaches.

nonverbal_communication	objective: replicating the training program in non-verbal communication based on the theoretical framework of interpersonal communication; non-verbal coding, valuing the aging aspects in the perspective of active aging, checking its current relevance through the content assimilation index after 90 days (mediate) of its application. method: a descriptive and exploratory field study was conducted in three hospitals under direct administration of the state of sao paulo that caters exclusively to unified health system (sus) patients. the training lasted 12 hours divided in three meetings, applied to 102 health professionals. results: revealed very satisfactory and satisfactory mediate content assimilation index in 82.9%. conclusion: the program replication proved to be relevant and updated the setting of hospital services, while remaining efficient for healthcare professionals.
prenatal_development	this study seeks to determine the main events that occur in the development of the ciliary body (cb) in the 5-14th week of development. the cb develops from the distal portion of the optic cup (oc) and the neighboring mesenchyme. during the 5th week of development, 4 zones were observed in the distal portion of the oc: in zone 1, the epithelia of the outer and inner layers of the oc came into contact. this contact coincided with the appearance of mainly apical granule pigments. this zone corresponded to the anlage of the epithelial layers of the cb. in zone 2, the cells surrounded the marginal sinus and contained scarce pigment granules and nuclei in the basal position. this zone corresponded to the anlage of the iris. zone 3 was triangular in shape and its vertex ran towards the marginal sinus and corresponded to common cell progenitors. zone 4 corresponded to the retinal pigment epithelium anlage and the neural retina anlage. we determined the onset of the stroma and the ciliary muscle anlage at the end of the 7th week. in the 13-14th week, we observed the anlage of the orbicularis ciliaris (pars plana of the cb) and corona ciliaris (pars plicata of the cb), in addition to the anlage of the ciliary muscle. our study, therefore, establishes a precise timetable of the development of the cb.

attention	sliced ready-to-eat traditional meat products presented in individual packaging with more convenience to the consumer is the way that food industry tries to adapt to the new consumer tendencies. the current work assessed the survival of listeria monocytogenes in a contaminated sliced vacuum packed chourico with different sugar concentrations, two salt levels, and presence/absence of lactobacillus sakei as starter culture along the storage period at two temperatures (8 degrees c and 22 degrees c). neither the inoculation with l. sakei, nor the addition of carbohydrates influenced the survival of the pathogen. higher amount of salt resulted in a signifi cant reduction of l. monocytogenes, and storage at the higher temperature displayed a safer product. after 7 days, l. monocytogenes was not detected in any samples. the study of the association of the factors contributing for l. monocytogenes survival by logistic regression showed that increasing the level of salt addition from 1.5% to 3% reduces the odds of survival of l. monocytogenes to about one fifth (0.174). worthy of attention is the signifi cant reduction in the odds (or=0.028) of fi nding viable l. monocytogenes when the samples are stored at room temperature (22 degrees c), when compared to low temperature (8 degrees c). the general and indiscriminate use of refrigeration for meat products might increase the risk of presence of l. monocytogenes. the competitive advantage that l. monocytogenes has at low temperatures, as the potential inhibition of lab activity, is probably the reason of the observed behaviour. the amount of salt was an important hurdle to control l. monocytogenes growth, so, manufacturing meat products with lower salt contents to meet the demands of healthy products might represent a risk for safety, since high levels of salt together with low a w are the keys for their conservation.
nonverbal_communication	background: mobile phoned-based interventions have been increasingly used in clinical populations to improve health and health care delivery. the literature has shown that mobile phone-based text messages (short message service, sms) are instantaneous, cost effective, and have less chance of being misplaced. studies using mobile phone based-text messages have reported text messages as effective reminders that have resulted in increased appointment attendance, adherence to treatment, and better self-management. there have been no reports of adverse events when using text messaging in terms of misreading or misinterpreting data, transmitting inaccurate data, losing verbal or nonverbal communication cues, privacy issues, or failure or delay in message delivery. however, the literature has cited a need for personalized messages that are more responsive to individual needs. in addition, there has been a dearth of information on the use of reminders in nonclinical populations. objective: the goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of adding reminders in the form of text messaging versus reminder calls versus text messages and reminder calls to increase use of service referrals provided through community outreach. methods: a total of 300 participants will be recruited for the study. each participant will be randomized to one of three arms: a group that receives only reminder calls (callsonly); a group that receives only text message reminders (textonly); and a group that receives both reminder calls and text messages (calls+ text). all groups will receive their reminder intervention on the 15th and 45th day after baseline when they receive medical and social service referrals from the community health workers (chws). a standard script will be used to administer the call and text reminders and a 15-item telephone-based satisfaction survey will be administered to assess the participant satisfaction with the process of receiving periodic reminders. results: the study is in the recruitment and follow-up phase. the authors anticipate completion of recruitment, interventions, and data entry by july 2016. preliminary results are expected to be available by september 2016. conclusions: this study will provide an opportunity to test the effectiveness of mobile-based interventions on nonclinical, community-recruited populations. in particular, such a protocol would increase the effectiveness of a community-based engagement program by instating a formal reminder system for all program members who receive social and/or medical service referrals during outreach in the community. findings from this study would guide the development and implementation of reminder protocols for community-based engagement programs nationwide.
nonverbal_communication	the acculturative family distancing (afd) rating questionnaire measures the distancing that occurs between immigrant parents and their children, which is caused by breakdowns in communication and cultural value differences. the items included in the afd questionnaire are indicators for more proximal and problem-focused aspects of the acculturation gap. in this study, a psychometric analysis is performed on the data gathered with the afd instrument. one hundred twenty-three chinese american families (112 mothers, 85 fathers, and 120 children for a total of 317) completed the questionnaire. in addition, the specifications for an extended 2-tier item factor analysis model within a bayesian multidimensional item response theory framework are provided to psychometrically analyze the afd data. results suggest that the original 2 dimensions of communication difficulties and cultural values incongruency can be further refined into 4 clinically relevant dimensions (i.e., verbal communication difficulties, nonverbal communication difficulties, general cultural values incongruency, and family values incongruency). moreover, reducing the number of items can improve afd estimates and reduce assessment burden.
false_memories	in current philosophy of mind, there are two main approaches to the question of personal identity. the first one claims that personal identity is based on our memory and for several decades has been known as a psychological approach to the problem. the second one has been called an animalistic approach and considers personal identity as a biological property of human beings or as a specific feature of our bodily continuity. experiments on creating false memories in mice brains, recently conducted at mit, seem to shed new light on the question of personal identity, taking into account the fact that the mouse brain is morphologically quite similar to our brain. the purpose of the article is to clarify the question about whether the above-mentioned experiments support one of the approaches: the psychological or the animalistic. using the conceptual instrumentarium of contemporary analytic philosophy and cognitive phenomenology the author differentiates between strong and weak false memories and argues that we cannot consider the conducted experiments as supporting the animalistic approach.
borderline_personality_disorder	various psychiatric problems in adolescence and early adulthood have been shown to associate with criminal behaviour. in this study the association of personality disorders (pds) with criminal behaviour was examined in adolescents treated in psychiatric hospitals. the study sample consisted of 508 adolescents (age 13-17) admitted to acute psychiatric impatient care between april 2001 and march 2006. crime data was obtained from the finnish legal register centre on september 2013. the schedule for affective disorder and schizophrenia for school-age children present and lifetime (k-sads-pl) was used to assess psychiatric diagnoses in adolescence. the information on pds in early adulthood was based on follow-up information on psychiatric treatments in either out-or inpatient settings until the end of 2012, and was extracted from the national care register for health care provided by the finnish national institute for health and welfare. a total of 22 (39%) of the 57 subjects with pd had committed a crime. in women, the likelihood for violent criminality was significantly increased in those with borderline pd (or 6.09, ci 1.24-29.84, p = 0.009) and was also associated with conduct disorder (or 4.26, ci 1.38-13.19, p = 0.012), child welfare placement (or 11.82, ci 3.61-38.76, p < 0.001) and parent 's substance use disorder (or 7.74, ci 2.30-26.10, p = 0.001). in men, no association was observed between pd and any kind of criminal behaviour. significant predictors for violent criminality in males were conduct disorder (or 4.05, ci 1.75-9.38, p = 0.001), substance use disorder (or 2.51, ci 1.22-5.17, p = 0.012) and special services at school (or 2.58, ci 1.16-5.76, p = 0.021). females with borderline pd showed an increased risk for violent offending. this suggests borderline pd as a potential explanatory factor for violent assaults by females and highlights the importance of recognizing the risk for violence in young women with a borderline pd.

problem-solving	gestures help people think and can help problem solvers generate new ideas. we conducted two experiments exploring the self-oriented function of gesture in a novel domain: creative thinking. in experiment 1, we explored the relationship between children 's spontaneous gesture production and their ability to generate novel uses for everyday items (alternative-uses task). there was a significant correlation between children 's creative fluency and their gesture production, and the majority of children 's gestures depicted an action on the target object. restricting children from gesturing did not significantly reduce their fluency, however. in experiment 2, we encouraged children to gesture, and this significantly boosted their generation of creative ideas. these findings demonstrate that gestures serve an important self-oriented function and can assist creative thinking.
prenatal_development	past investigations of prenatal craniofacial growth have largely relied on histological sections. few studies have taken measurements on three-dimensional representations (3d reconstruction, 3d ct, postmortem) or varying depth levels (ultrasound), and we know of no craniofacial growth studies done on cleared-and-stained specimens of whole fetal heads. this study comprised 14 human fetal head specimens cleared and stained with alizarin red and alcian blue. they had been stored in glycerol and represented weeks 8-12 of gestation, with crown-rump lengths ranging from 23-145 mm. these specimens were cephalometrically analyzed in norma frontalis and norma lateralis, which notably included the opportunity for side-to-side comparison. as the cranial membrane bones progressively approached each other, the orbits, maxilla, and mandible gradually grew wider. likewise, the sagittal dimensions of the maxilla and mandible increased continuously and synchronically. we noted side-to-side differences ranging from 2-5 mm. another notable finding concerned the inclination of the maxilla relative to the cranial base, which increased more on the right than on the left side. this is the first investigation presenting side-to-side comparative measurements of human fetal head specimens. such measurements are essential in the quest toward validating the findings of other imaging techniques such as ct or mri and-most importantly-intrauterine sonography.
eating_disorders	international literature has studied the role of parental eating disorder (ed) on children development, highlighting that it constitutes a relevant risk factor for the onset of offspring 's emotional-behavioural problems. limited attention has been given to parental binge eating disorder (bed) and its impact on offspring 's psychopathology. thus, further investigations of this clinical manifestation as possible predictor of offspring 's psychopathology are needed. the present study aimed to assess the maladaptive outcomes in children of parents with psychopathological risk and psychiatric diagnoses. specifically, we intended to verify whether offspring of parents who were both diagnosed with bed showed higher affective and behavioural problems, compared with their peers with only one parent diagnosed with bed. we conducted a longitudinal study (t1 18 months old children; t2 36 months old children) on a sample of 100 italian couple of parents and children (n-total = 300), divided into three groups based on the presence of bed diagnosis. group a, diagnosis in both parents; group b, diagnosis only in the mothers; group c, diagnosis only in the fathers. the presence of bed in one or both parents was associated with the emotional and behavioural development in offspring. particularly, the diagnosis of bed in both parents had a direct effect on infants' affective problems. the offspring of parents diagnosed with bed were more likely to manifest emotional and behavioural difficulties and psychiatric symptoms within the first three years of life.

attention	background parenting by people with intellectual disability is attracting increasing attention, and policymakers and service providers require empirical evidence to develop sound policy and service responses. the purpose of the study was to identify prevalence and demographic data on parents with id in australia compared with parents with other disabilities and the population of parents without disability.method the survey of disability, ageing and carers, 2009, was identified as the most suitable survey, and design-weighted analysis was performed.results an estimated 0.41% of australian parents had intellectual disability, equating to 17,000 parents with id. parents with id were more likely to have only 1 child and to reside outside a capital city compared with parents without disability.conclusions these findings provide benchmark data for monitoring, over time, the prevalence of parents with id and point to policy and service responses for parents with only 1 child and for those in outer urban, regional, and rural areas of australia.
prosocial_behavior	this study is guided by the research question, are personality traits, character traits, situational factors, and their interaction all necessary to explain helping behavior? 121 undergraduates' scores on the agreeableness scale of the big five inventory and the kindness scale of the values in action inventory were examined in conjunction with experimentally induced positive, neutral, or negative mood via false feedback on a bogus intelligence test. the number of spilled pencils participants helped retrieve in a ""mishap"" was the measure of helping. kindness significantly predicted helping behavior, but neither feedback condition nor agreeableness was significantly related to helping. interactions between kindness, agreeableness, and feedback conditions were non-significant. these results highlight a stronger contribution to helping behavior from the trait of kindness than from the trait of agreeableness and situational factors.

problem-solving	human granulation intelligence means that people can observe and analyze the same problem from various granulation points of view, which generally acknowledge an essential feature of human intelligence. each granulation view can generate a granular structure through dividing a cognitive target into some meaningful information granules. this means that a large number of granular structures can be generated from the cognitive target. however, people can group these granular structures and select some representative ones for problem solving. this leads to an interesting research topic: how to efficiently and effectively group a family of granular structures. to address this issue, we first introduce a granular structure distance to measure the difference between two granular structures within a unified knowledge representation. then, we propose a framework for grouping granular structures, called ggs algorithm, which is used to efficiently partition them. moreover, two indices denoted as dis and apd are also designed for evaluating the performance of a grouping result of granular structures. finally, experiments carried out for nine data sets show that the ggs algorithm comes as a sound solution from perspectives of its convergence, effectiveness and scalability. in this way we have proposed and experimented with the general framework for discovering the structure inherent in granular structures, which can be afterwards used to simulate intelligent behavior of human 's abilities of granular structure selection.

nonverbal_communication	the art historian ernst gombrich asserted that both artists and viewers are constrained by specific cultural mental sets within which they operate: he used ""schemata"" to refer to both actual sketches and our mental sets. in mapping the mechanism of culture, juri lotman situated both language and the ""schematized image"" at the centre of semiospheres: they function to introduce unity and eliminate contradictions. schemata have obviously served as both the cause and the result of human knowledge, some loosely constructed yet highly condensed forms of art in different domains. theorizing at a time of a hypertrophy of scientific and linguistic models, lotman and gombrich appear to have converged on theorizing our means of connecting people across cultures. they each put forward their own perspectives concerning the interplay between culture, art and pictorial representation. this paper serves to: (1) examine how lotman and gombrich interpreted jakobson 's scheme of communication; (2) reveal the paradox of schemata and nonverbal communication latent in their writings; (3) soften the paradox by drawing on lotman 's conceptulization of play as an emotional structure. it is argued that the kind of emotive potential defined from the perspective of beholders or addressees is crucial to our survival in the global village.
gender_roles	the transition to parenthood is a rite of passage for most adults; however, given the dynamic state of gender roles in society, the parameters surrounding the ease or difficulty with this transition are evolving. the purpose of this paper is to introduce the work included in the special issue, gender and the transition to parenthood. academic literature has been filled with articles on how women cope with the transition to parenthood from a variety of perspectives, including a feminist perspective. however, much of this literature is dated and cannot account for how today 's gender roles in society (particularly those of fathers) may influence the transition to parenthood. we argue that, with the rapidly changing gender roles in society, it is crucial to consider three perspectives in parenting: hers, his, and theirs. the ten works included in this special issue represent these three perspectives and seek to understand the transition to parenthood and its intersection with today 's gender roles. based on these works, the authors encourage researchers interested in the transition to parenthood to incorporate both male and female perspectives, as well as the interplay between the genders in making the transition smooth or difficult. following a brief overview of the existing literature, we introduce the articles in the special issue. all papers in this special issue are based on u.s. samples.
depression	this study investigated whether the use of thought control strategies specific to suicidal thoughts influenced suicide ideation and suicide risk in a sample of adult students (n = 135) who were selectively recruited after endorsing a history of suicide ideation on a pre-screen assessment. an adapted version of the thought control questionnaire (tcq; wells & davies, 1994) specific to controlling thoughts of suicide was employed to assess whether participants responded to thoughts of suicide with worry, self-punishment, reappraisal, concealment, and distraction. the suicide-specific thought control questionnaire demonstrated a reliable factor structure similar to the original measure. results indicated that distraction from suicidal thoughts was negatively correlated with suicide ideation and risk, whereas self-punishment for having these thoughts and worrying about other thoughts were positively correlated with suicide ideation and suicide risk. clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.

problem-solving	aimto assess the quality of evidence and determine the effect of patient-related and economic outcomes of self-management support interventions in chronically ill patients with a low socio-economic status. backgroundintegrated evidence on self-management support interventions in chronically ill people with low socio-economic status is lacking. designsystematic literature review. data sourcescochrane database of trials, pubmed, cinahl, web of science, psycinfo and joanna briggs institute library were searched (2000-2013). randomized controlled trials addressing self-management support interventions for patients with cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and/or chronic respiratory disease were included. review methodsdata extraction and quality assessment were performed by independent researchers using a data extraction form. resultsstudies (n=27) focused mainly on diabetes. fourteen studies cited an underlying theoretical basis. most frequently used self-management support components were lifestyle advice, information provision and symptom management. problem-solving and goal-setting strategies were frequently integrated. eleven studies adapted interventions to the needs of patients with a low socio-economic status. no differences were found for interventions developed based on health behaviour theoretical models. conclusionlimited evidence was found for self-management support interventions in chronically ill patients with low socio-economic status. essential characteristics and component(s) of effective self-management support interventions for these patients could not be detected. rigorous reporting on development and underlying theories in the intervention is recommended.
schizophrenia	maternal immune activation (mia) during pregnancy in rodents increases the risk of the offspring to develop schizophrenia-related behaviors, suggesting a relationship between the immune system and the brain development. here we tested the hypothesis that mia induced by the viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly i:c) in early or late gestation of mice leads to behavioral and neuroanatomical disorders in the adulthood. on gestational days (gds) 9 or 17 pregnant dams were treated with poly i:c or saline via intravenous route and the offspring behaviors were measured during adulthood. considering the progressive structural neuroanatomical alterations in the brain of individuals with schizophrenia, we used magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to perform brain morphometric analysis of the offspring aged one year. mia on gd9 or gd17 led to increased basal locomotor activity, enhanced motor responses to ketamine, a psychotomimetic drug, and reduced time spent in the center of the arena, suggesting an increased anxiety-like behavior. in addition, mia on gd17 reduced glucose preference in the offspring. none of the treatments altered the relative volume of the lateral ventricles. however, a decrease in brain volume, especially for posterior structures, was observed for one-year-old animals treated with poly i:c compared with control groups. thus, activation of the maternal immune system at different gds lead to neuroanatomical and behavioral alterations possibly related to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. these results provide insights on neuroimmunonological and neurodevelopmental aspects of certain psychopathologies, such as schizophrenia.

prenatal_development	in this study, we investigated the morphology of the ventricular germinal zone and neocortex of the cerebral hemispheres in the projection field no. 4 of the motor area in human fetuses in dynamics from week 22 to 40 of fetal development. morphological study allowed us to clarify the following patterns of prenatal ontogeny of the human cns. on weeks 22-27, an intensive formation of the main sulci of the first order, differentiating the brain into lobes, is observed. by weeks 28-32, the formation of all sulci of the first order is completed; and on weeks 33-37, additional sulci characteristic of an individual are formed. the spurt of gyrification of the cortex (weeks 22-27) practically coincides with the completion of neuronal differentiation and formation of the motor neocortex. the structure of the latter is characterized by a clear stratification of cytoarchitectonic layers and modular organization of neurons with their vertical orientation in cell columns (weeks 25-27). in subsequent weeks of prenatal development until birth, no significant changes in the topography and structure of the neocortex are observed. structural rearrangement of the ventricular germinal zone on weeks 22-40 of prenatal development consists in its gradual reduction and is completed on weeks 37-40. the criteria of physiological reduction of this area are the zonal location of glioblasts and a progressive decrease in its thickness on weeks 33-37 of prenatal development.
antisocial_personality_disorder	numerous studies show that individuals with substance use and gambling problems discount delayed and probabilistic outcomes at different rates than controls. few studies, however, have investigated the association of discounting with antisocial personality disorders (aspd), and none have evaluated whether sex impacts these relationships. because females with aspd exhibit different patterns of antisocial behavior than their male counterparts, they may also differ in their decision-making tendencies. this study examined the effects of aspd and sex on discounting in pathological gamblers. results revealed effects of aspd, and an interaction between aspd and sex, on probability discounting rates. none of these variables, however, were related to delay discounting. females with aspd highly preferred probabilistic outcomes, suggesting that female gamblers with aspd are particularly impulsive when it comes to probabilistic rewards. greater understanding of sex differences in aspd might help guide the selection of more effective sex-specific prevention and treatment programs.
prejudice	negative attitudes are a major barrier to the equality of people with disabilities. governments and other organizations have implemented numerous programmes to change attitudes towards people with disabilities. we analyse published evidence about the effectiveness of such programmes using a framework of the interrelationship among three levels of policy intervention to change attitudes: personal level directed at changing the attitudes of individuals; organizational level concerning attitudinal barriers in domains such as employment, education and health; and government level - legally mandating behaviour change. the analysis finds that the following policy types can be effective if used together: policies that involve direct contact with people with disability; information and awareness campaigns; education and training about disability; and antidiscrimination enforcement. policy characteristics that contribute to effectiveness include a positive programme experience for participants; multifaceted and prolonged interventions; and adequate programme resources. policy effectiveness to change attitudes relies on corresponding reinforcement at all three policy levels.
media_violence	this study examines how mixed martial arts (mma) events are marketed in order to understand the role of violence in promoting events. researchers examined 134 pieces of promotional artwork and 57 promotional news releases by mma organisations across north america, asia and europe and found that 18 (13.4%) pieces of promotional artwork used violent text or imagery. violent text was found in 12 (21%) of the 57 news releases. violence was typically limited to smaller or european organisations. results illustrate an evolution of the sport, suggesting violence may no longer be necessary to promote events.
prenatal_development	human brain is extraordinarily complex and yet its origin is a simple tubular structure. its development during the fetal period is characterized by a series of accurately organized events which underlie the mechanisms of dramatic structural changes during fetal development. revealing detailed anatomy at different stages of human fetal brain development provides insight on understanding not only this highly ordered process, but also the neurobiological foundations of cognitive brain disorders such as mental retardation, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar and language impairment. diffusion tensor imaging (dti) and histology are complementary tools which are capable of delineating the fetal brain structures at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. in this review, the structural development of the fetal brains has been characterized with dti and histology. major components of the fetal brain, including cortical plate, fetal white matter and cerebral wall layer between the ventricle and subplate, have been delineated with dti and histology. anisotropic metrics derived from dti were used to quantify the microstructural changes during the dynamic process of human fetal cortical development and prenatal development of other animal models. fetal white matter pathways have been traced with dti-based tractography to reveal growth patterns of individual white matter tracts and corticocortical connectivity. these detailed anatomical accounts of the structural changes during fetal period may provide the clues of detecting developmental and cognitive brain disorders at their early stages. the anatomical information from dti and histology may also provide reference standards for diagnostic radiology of premature newborns.

person_perception	personality profiles describe individual persons' locations on multiple trait dimensions and enable calculation of profile similarity indices for individual persons and dyads. they are easily misinterpreted, however, unless two components are distinguished: a normative component comprising the sample means of the variables and a distinctive component reflecting the given individual 's deviations from those means. these two profile components provide different kinds of information. focusing on person-perception research, we review predictors of the similarity of individual profiles to the normative profile (i.e., profile normativeness) and of the agreement between distinctive profiles. we also provide some suggestions for future research.
gender_roles	the effects of portrayals of ethnic endorsers in advertising are ambiguous. these portrayals strengthen the ethnic identity of ethnic minority groups, thus leading to positive responses toward the ad. they can lead to negative responses, because these portrayals can be perceived as stereotyped. humor is a tool that can increase positive effects of identity-building and reduce negative effects of stereotyping. in this study, we investigate how humor moderates the effects of ethnic advertising on consumers from ethnic minority and majority groups. we find that humor supports the effects of traditional portrayals for both groups. moreover, the effect of traditional portrayals combined with humor is strongest for the minority group. these findings provide evidence for the positive effects of humor in ethnic advertising and thus provide new insights to the stereotyping, ethnic advertising, and humor literature. the findings have practical implications for advertising using ethnic endorsers, humor, or targeted at ethnic minority groups.
attention	this reflection investigates some of the questions that arise when one attempts to write lives together'. what are the intellectual and theoretical implications of this mode of biographical writing? what might be its seductions? what are its creative possibilities? it considers the place of invisible figures in group biography, and argues that the genre enables the recovery of these figures in particularly productive ways. it does so because its focus rests not on individuals but on the interstices between them. two women receive particular attention. the first is elizabeth kent, the sister-in-law of the radical romantic journalist leigh hunt. the second is virginia edgar, a friend and correspondent of mary anne disraeli. the reflection explores what happens to the versions of the past we construct when such figures disappear from dominant cultural narratives, how group biography enables their recovery, and the theoretical pitfalls inherent in returning them to the foreground. through a sustained focus on creative experience it suggests a way of deploying the possibilities of group biography in an act of resistance towards posthumous and anachronistic constructions of significance, and argues that such resistance has the potential to be creatively liberating.
nonverbal_communication	children begin to show preferences for specific playmates as early as the first 2years of life. children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty making friends, even in elementary and middle school. however, very little is known about earlier friendships in children with autism such as preschool friendships. this study examined friendships in preschool children with autism and explored how joint attention contributes to these friendships in mainstream settings. a secondary aim was to determine the extent to which teachers used strategies to facilitate friendship development. the participants were 31 mainstreamed preschool children (ages 2-5years) with autism spectrum disorder. school observations were conducted individually to capture participants' interactions with peers and adults during free play. the results indicated that 20% of the participants had friendships at school. children with friends were more likely than children without friends to be jointly engaged with their peers during free play, and they used higher joint attention skills. teachers used few friendship facilitating strategies, and more often used behavioral management strategies within the classrooms. future studies may want to examine the effects of early interventions and/or teacher training on the development of friendships in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder within the school setting.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the triarchic model of psychopathy (patrick, fowles, & krueger, 2009) comprises 3 phenotypic domains: meanness, disinhibition, and boldness. ongoing controversy surrounds the relevance of boldness in the conceptualization and assessment of psychopathy. in the current study, undergraduate students (n = 439) completed the triarchic psychopathy measure (patrick, 2010) to examine the association between boldness and a host of theoretically relevant external criteria. boldness was generally unrelated to either prosocial or harmful criteria. boldness rarely provided incremental value above or interacted with meanness and disinhibition with respect to external criteria. curvilinear effects of boldness rarely emerged. the findings suggest that boldness might not be a central construct in the definition of psychopathic personality disorder. implications for the 5th edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (american psychiatric association, 2013) psychopathic specifier are discussed.
person_perception	we examined the influence of interdependence goals on the accessibility of implicit gender stereotypical associations. participants were asked to cooperate with or compete against a woman on a mathematical abilities task and subsequently the relative activation of positive and negative warmth and competence traits was measured using a primed categorization task. results showed that female primes (vs. male primes) facilitated the activation of low warmth and high competence in the competition condition, whereas high warmth was activated in the cooperation condition and no differences were found for competence traits. these results are discussed referring to the stereotype content model and the compensation effect in person perception. the goal dependent nature of implicit gender stereotypes is emphasized.
prenatal_development	, while ghrelin cells were the most numerous during the se since reports on endocrine cells and their kinetics in the corpus of the human stomach are limited, the aim of this study was to examine the appearance, localization, density, and the relationship among the endocrine cell types in the corpus of the human stomach during prenatal and early postnatal development. we examined chromogranin a, somatostatin, ghrelin, glucagon, and serotonin expression by immunohistochemistry in 2 embryos, 38 fetuses, and 3 infants in the corpus of human stomach. chromogranin a secreting endocrine cells were identified in the corpus at week 10 of gestation. somatostatin cells were present from the 10th week, ghrelin and serotonin cells from the 11th week, and glucagon cells from the 12th week of gestation. endocrine cells were present individually or clustered within the glandular base and body during the first trimester, and were present separately within the basal and central parts of glands during the second and third trimesters. somatostatin cells were the most common type of cells (similar to 46 %) during the first trimestercond trimester (similar to 34 %), and in infants (similar to 28 %). the percentage of glucagon cells was significant only during the first trimester of pregnancy (5.5 %), and the percentage of serotonin cells was only significant just before birth (4.8 %). these results show, for the first time, that the largest number of endocrine cells are present in the corpus during the first trimester of prenatal development. also, these results suggest that secretory products of endocrine cells play a role in the regulation of homeostasis, growth, and differentiation, and in human stomach function.
prejudice	this article empirically examines the postulated effects of at least a single terrorist attack on the measure of monthly international arrivals. the study uses the tsoutliers r package to detect outliers in time series data following terrorist attacks in five destinations. the contribution of this paper is found in the methodological approach that was implemented consistently across all five destinations. the findings suggest that there is no evidence to support the view that there is a consistent disturbance from a well-fitted time series (a data fingerprint') created by a terrorist attack across the five different destinations or even, in at least one case, in the same destination, at different times. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
borderline_personality_disorder	most individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (bpd) have been exposed to severe and traumatic stressors and thus frequently present with symptoms of a posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). severe sleep disturbances often accompany these complex cases, but changes of sleep parameters during therapy and the impact of sleep on treatment response have barely been studied. narrative exposure therapy (net) is an evidence-based approach for the treatment of trauma-related psychological disorders. to investigate the effect of net on sleep in patients with bpd and comorbid ptsd, we screened 45 inpatients and outpatients who met the inclusion criteria of both diagnoses according to dsm-iv and who had a minimum of 2 weeks' stable medication. patients were allocated to net (n = 13) or treatment as usual (tau; n = 8) in blocks. polysomnographies and psychological questionares were performed before, directly and 6 months after the last therapy session. the aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effectiveness of trauma therapy by net on sleep quantity (total sleep time) and sleep continuity (sleep efficiency and awakenings) in patients with comorbid bpd and ptsd. participants of the net group compared with those who received tau showed an increased reduction in sleep latency from baseline to the end of therapy and a reduction in arousals over time. patients with longer pre-treatment total sleep time and pre-treatment rem sleep duration showed a better outcome of net with respect to ptsd symptoms. net seems not lead to a change in sleep for the worse during therapy and seems to improve sleep as good as treatment as usual. furthermore, our results provide evidence of an influence of sleep structure at baseline on treatment success later on.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this paper examines the validity of the structured clinic interview for dsm-iv (scid) i and ii in a sample of veterans seeking treatment for substance use disorders (suds). participants (n = 183) initially receiving residential or outpatient treatment for suds completed the scid i and ii. more than one-third of participants met criteria for an axis i disorder, and almost one-half met criteria for an axis ii disorder. concurrent, discriminant, and predictive validity were examined for diagnoses of suds and antisocial personality disorder (apd), as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and thought disorder. results generally provided strong support for the concurrent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the scid i diagnoses of alcohol use disorders (auds) and strong support for the concurrent and discriminant validity of drug use disorders (duds). there was mixed support for the concurrent validity of apd. predictive validity for duds or apd was not supported.
gender_roles	background: by focusing upon formal sex education programmes, the mozambican government has significantly enhanced the general health of adolescents and young adults. however, when it comes to contraception, little is known about how adolescents and young adults actually behave. methods: based upon a qualitative study in two settings in maputo province - ndlavela and boane - this paper explores the knowledge and practices of contraception among adolescents and young adults. a total of four focus group discussions, 16 in-depth interviews, four informal conversations, and observations were equally divided between both study sites. results: discrepancies between what adolescents and young adults know and what they do quickly became evident. ambivalent and contradictory practices concerning contraceptive use was the result. as well, young people had numerous interpretations of risk-taking when not using contraceptives. these inconsistencies are influenced by social and medical barriers such as restricted dialogue on sexuality among adolescents and young adults and their parents and peers. additionally, ideas about indigenous contraceptives, notions of masculinity and femininity, misconceptions and fear of the side effects of contraceptives, make people of all ages wary of modern birth control. other barriers include imposed contraceptive choice - meaning no choice, overly technical medical language used at clinics and the absence of healthcare workers more attuned to the needs of adolescents and young adults. conclusions: adolescents and young adults have numerous - often erroneous - opinions about contraception, leading to inconsistent use as well as vague perceptions of risk-taking. moreover, social norms and cultural gender roles often contradict and hinder risk-avoiding behaviour. therefore, in order to improve young people 's health, policymakers must address the reasons behind this ambivalence and inconsistency.
prosocial_behavior	engaging in mentalizing, i.e., reflecting on others' thoughts, beliefs and feelings, is known to facilitate later empathy and prosocial behavior. activation in dorsomedial prefrontal (dmpfc) areas during mentalizing has been shown to predict the extent of prosocial behavior. it is unclear, however, what cognitive process drives these effects: a simulation process in which the own mental states are used as a proxy for those of others (self-projection) or an effortful other-enhancement process in which one 's own perspective is overridden. in this fmri study we examined the effects of mentalizing with similar and dissimilar others on behavioral and brain measures of empathy and prosocial behavior, to assess which cognitive process mediates the facilitative effects of mentalizing. participants had to mentalize with two fictitious target persons, one of whom was manipulated to have similar thoughts and beliefs as the participant, while the other had dissimilar mental states. we then assessed participants' behavioral and neural responses during an empathy for pain task and a prosocial behavior task. similarity between participant and target person increased empathy and affiliation ratings, and mentalizing with dissimilar persons evoked increased activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the extent of which was inversely related with bias towards the similar person in empathy. responses in two dmpfc regions were also predictive of later variations in subsequent empathy and prosocial behavior, either predicting overall prosociality and empathic concern (lateral dmpfc), or predicting reduced empathic bias towards the similar person and a lower response to self-related stressors in pain matrix areas (medial dmpfc). this pattern of results suggests that generating and enhancing other-related representations while overcoming one 's own perspective, rather than enhanced recruitment of self-projection processes, is driving the facilitative effects of mentalizing on later empathic and prosocial responses.

borderline_personality_disorder	objectivesnew research-informed methods for case conceptualization that cut across traditional therapy approaches are increasingly popular. this paper presents a trans-theoretical approach to case formulation based on the research observations of emotion. methodsthe sequential model of emotional processing (pascual-leone & greenberg, 2007) is a process research model that provides concrete markers for therapists to observe the emerging emotional development of their clients. we illustrate how this model can be used by clinicians to track change and provides a clinical map,' by which therapist may orient themselves in-session and plan treatment interventions. resultsemotional processing offers as a trans-theoretical framework for therapists who wish to conduct emotion-based case formulations. first, we present criteria for why this research model translates well into practice. second, two contrasting case studies are presented to demonstrate the method. conclusionsthe model bridges research with practice by using client emotion as an axis of integration. key practitioner message process research on emotion can offer a template for therapists to make case formulations while using a range of treatment approaches. the sequential model of emotional processing provides a process map' of concrete markers for therapists to (1) observe the emerging emotional development of their clients, and (2) help therapists develop a treatment plan. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
depression	this descriptive study evaluates how dance movement psychotherapy (dmp) works in patients with fibromyalgia, analysing the psychotherapeutic process. as a second objective, we considered the effects of dmp on pain, stiffness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and lifestyle changes. the study includes 16 patients with a diagnosis of primitive fibromyalgia who were referred to individual dmp for psychological distress related to pain. self-assessment questionnaires were administered before and after the intervention, and the data were analysed using a simple regression model and student 's test. despite limitations, the study highlights changes in many areas of the relationship with self and with others. some of the symptoms of fibromyalgia seem to have decreased, but the results were not statistically significant. the patients used the movement as a means of expression despite pain or other disabling symptoms. a low drop-out rate suggests that this approach could be useful when it is difficult to develop a therapeutic alliance.
child_abuse	the study examines family characteristics that put adolescent girls at increased risk of abuse, mainly physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect. stratified random sampling was done among classes 7th to 12th of government girls' schools of a semi-urban area of delhi, and a total of 1060 adolescent girls participated. majority were in mid-adolescence. approximately 70% study subjects faced at least one form of maltreatment. physical abuse was faced by 42.6%, sexual abuse by 26.6%, emotional abuse by 37.9% and neglect by 40.1% of study subjects. the most frequent perpetrator of physical and emotional abuse was mother, and of sexual abuse were friends, relatives or neighbours. no or low education of father increased odds of physical and emotional abuse, while odds of physical abuse and neglect were lower if mothers were housewives. excessive arguments between parents and history of maltreatment in parents increased odds of child maltreatment in study subjects.
schizophrenia	sexual dysfunction, a common side effect of antipsychotic medications, may be partly caused by dopamine antagonism and elevation of prolactin. in qualify, a randomized study, aripiprazole once-monthly 400mg (aom 400), a dopamine d-2 receptor partial agonist, showed noninferiority and subsequent superiority versus paliperidone palmitate (pp), a dopamine d-2 receptor antagonist, on the heinrichs-carpenter quality-of-life scale (qls) in patients with schizophrenia aged 18-60 years. sexual dysfunction (arizona sexual experience scale) and serum prolactin levels were also assessed. odds for sexual dysfunction were lower with aom 400 versus pp [week 28 adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.29 (0.14-0.61); p=0.0012] in men [0.33 (0.13-0.86); p=0.023], women [0.14 (0.03-0.62); p=0.0099], and patients aged 18-35 years [0.04 (<0.01-0.34); p=0.003]. among patients shifting from sexual dysfunction at baseline to none at week 28, there was a trend toward greater improvement in the qls total score. the mean (sd) prolactin concentrations decreased with aom 400 [-150.6 (274.4)miu/l] and increased with pp [464.7 (867.5)miu/l] in both men and women. six pp-treated patients experienced prolactin-related adverse events. in addition to greater improvement on qls, patients had a lower risk for sexual dysfunction and prolactin elevation with aom 400 versus pp in qualify.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: maladaptive emotional control is a defining feature of personality disorders. yet little is known about the underlying physiological dynamics of emotional reactivity to psychosocial stress across distinct personality disorders. the current study compared subjective emotional responses with autonomic nervous system and hpa axis physiological responses to psychosocial stress in women with cluster c personality disorder (cpd) and borderline personality disorder (bpd). methods: subjective mood ratings, salivary cortisol, heart rate (hr), and skin conductance level (scl) were assessed before, during, and after exposure to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm (trier social stress test, tsst) in 26 women with bpd, 20 women with cpd, and 35 healthy female controls. subjects were free of any medication including hormonal contraceptives, had a regular menstrual cycle, and were tested during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. results: both cpd and bpd patients reported a similar burden of subjective mood disturbance. however, only bpd patients demonstrated reduced baseline cortisol levels with a blunted cortisol and hr reactivity to the tsst. in addition, bpd patients exhibited a generalized increase of scl. no significant differences in baseline or tsst reactivity of cortisol, hr, or scl were observed between cpd patients and healthy controls. conclusion: these findings indicate that patients with bpd have significant alterations in their physiological stress reactivity, which is notably distinct from patients with cpd and those of healthy controls.

gender_roles	the paper explores perceptions regarding family and paid employment expressed by university students in chile, based on the analysis of quantitative data from the maule region (southern chile). we argue that the increasing unpredictability of labor markets has eroded the role paid employment historically has had as the lynchpin of individual 's - particularly men 's - life project, altering the expectations about both work and family life. likewise, changes in gender roles have shaped youngsters' ideals about family life. this seems to be the case especially for women, who strongly affirm their economic independence and personal projects, departing from traditional family views. we conclude that young people are demanding a new balance between life (understood mainly as personal and family time) and work. there is also a strong affirmation of the individual project, including a demand for greater gender equality. although still at the level of projected visions of the future, these findings signal changes in the way the relation work-family is traditionally organized, bringing new challenges for public policy.
depression	objectivethere is evidence that some transgender people find aspects of the standards ofcare (soc) for thehealth oftranssexual,transgender, andgendernonconformingpeople, and/or their implementation by health professionals, problematic and counterproductive to transitioning. this study evaluated the significance of this dissatisfaction to the transitioning and mental health of transgender people. method161 self-identified transgender people responded to an online survey that assessed satisfaction with health services provided in accordance with soc guidelines, satisfaction with health professionals assisting with their transition, personal hardiness, gender congruence, steps to transition, and depression, anxiety, and stress. resultsalthough results revealed dissatisfaction with the standards of care and with health professionals (particularly psychiatrists), subsequent path analyses conducted via structural equation modelling failed to reveal associations between this dissatisfaction and factors relevant to transitioning or mental health. however, personal hardiness was found to be associated with greater progress in transitioning and, by way of this, improved gender congruence, self-esteem, and mental health. conclusionwhile the results reveal dissatisfaction with the australian health system and its professionals, this does not appear to translate into poor mental health outcomes. rather personal hardiness during transition is the important predictor of transitioning and mental health. this argues for greater emphasis to be placed on building and supporting personal resilience in transgender people.
prenatal_development	bromodomain-and phd finger-containing protein 1 (brpf1) is a unique epigenetic regulator that contains multiple structural domains for recognizing different chromatin modifications. in addition, it possesses sequence motifs for forming multiple complexes with three different histone acetyltransferases, moz, morf, and hbo1. within these complexes, brpf1 serves as a scaffold for bridging subunit interaction, stimulating acetyltransferase activity, governing substrate specificity and stimulating gene expression. to investigate how these molecular interactions are extrapolated to biological functions of brpf1, we utilized a mouse strain containing a knock-in reporter and analyzed the spatiotemporal expression from embryos to adults. the analysis revealed dynamic expression in the extraembryonic, embryonic, and fetal tissues, suggesting important roles of brpf1 in prenatal development. in support of this, inactivation of the mouse brpf1 gene causes lethality around embryonic day 9.5. after birth, high expression is present in the testis and specific regions of the brain. the 4-dimensional expression atlas of mouse brpf1 should serve as a valuable guide for analyzing its interaction with moz, morf, and hbo1 in vivo, as well as for investigating whether brpf1 functions independently of these three enzymatic epigenetic regulators.
leadership	state leaders often promote implementation of evidence-based practices but have difficulty sustaining and expanding them over time. this paper examines the activities of leaders in 13 states that have successfully implemented, sustained, and expanded evidence-based supported employment, known as individual placement and support (ips), for 4 to 12 years. we interviewed state leaders from 13 states participating in a learning community regarding the composition of their leadership team, participation in the learning community, interagency collaboration, state policy alignment, financing, training, and monitoring of fidelity and outcome. to assess state-level performance in implementing, sustaining, and expanding ips services, we obtained measures of sustainment, expansion, program fidelity, and employment in the subsequent year and compared them to a priori benchmarks. the majority of states (between 69 % and 77 %) met benchmarks for sustainment, expansion, fidelity, and employment. states varied widely in specific actions to advance ips, but all had established leadership teams, participated in the national learning community, and built an infrastructure supporting ips. leaders in 13 states participating in a learning community have adopted and maintained multiple strategies to sustain and expand evidence-based supported employment at a high level of fidelity with good employment outcomes.
prenatal_development	the side population (sp) phenotype, defined by the ability of a cell to efflux fluorescent dyes such as hoechst, is common to several stem/progenitor cell types. in avian species, sp phenotype has been identified in pubertal and adult testes, but nothing is known about its expression during prenatal development of a male gonad. in this study, we characterized the hoechst sp phenotype via the cytofluorimetric analysis of disaggregated testes on different days of chicken embryonic development. male prenatal gonads contained a fraction of sp cells at each stage analyzed. at least two main sp fractions, named p3 and p4, were identified. the percentage of p3 fraction decreased as development proceeds, whereas p4 cell number was not affected by gonad growth. functional inhibition of bcrp1 channel membrane using verapamil and/or ko143 showed that p3, but not p4 phenotype, was dependent on bcrp1 activity. molecular analysis of both p3- and p4-sorted fractions revealed a differential rna expression pattern, indicating that p3 cells mainly contained germinal stem cell markers, whereas p4 was preferentially composed of both sertoli and leydig cell progenitor markers. finally, these findings provided evidence that the sp phenotype is a common feature of both germ and somatic cells detected in chicken developing testis.

problem-solving	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to develop a content analysis framework and from that derive a process model of knowledge construction in the context of virtual product user communities, organization sponsored online forums where product users collaboratively construct knowledge to solve their technical problems. design/methodology/approach - the study is based on a deductive and qualitative content analysis of discussion threads about solving technical problems selected from a series of virtual product user communities. data are complemented with thematic analysis of interviews with forum members. findings - the research develops a content analysis framework for knowledge construction. it is based on a combination of existing codes derived from frameworks developed for computer-supported collaborative learning and new categories identified from the data. analysis using this framework allows the authors to propose a knowledge construction process model showing how these elements are organized around a typical ""trial and error"" knowledge construction strategy. practical implications - the research makes suggestions about organizations' management of knowledge activities in virtual product user communities, including moderators' roles in facilitation. originality/value - the paper outlines a new framework for analysing knowledge activities where there is a low level of critical thinking and a model of knowledge construction by trial and error. the new framework and model can be applied in other similar contexts.
antisocial_personality_disorder	psychopathic personality disorder is the subject of many research papers and in particular in the context of forensic settings, where its link to risk of future violence has been established. this topic is well examined but there is still considerable debate about the nature of the construct and how psychopathy is measured. contemporary models such as the triarchic theory (patrick, fowles & krueger, 2009) have been put forward yet the research into psychopathy tends to rely on one assessment tool, the psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r; hare, 2003) that is argued not to capture elements of psychopathy such as boldness. the triarchic psychopathy measure (tripm; patrick, 2010) is a measure that is based on the triarchic theory, and it places an equal focus on boldness when measuring psychopathy. it is however a self-report instrument, and this approach has many limitations. this paper aims to review the scientific support for the tripm and to discuss its potential application to clinical practice. it concludes that the tripm may not yet be a contender for the pcl-r throne as the sole tool of choice for psychopathy measurement, but the research into the application of the tripm is expanding our understanding of psychopathy as a construct.

person_perception	narcissists, relative to non-narcissists, seem to regard their own narcissistic traits (e.g., rudeness and arrogance) more positively and are more motivated to cultivate such traits. that said, should we expect narcissists to regard others' narcissistic traits more positively too? in this study, participants (n = 463) completed a survey in which they responded on a measure of trait narcissism, rated the likeability of people who possessed various narcissistic traits (e.g., arrogant, rude, self-centered), and then indicated the extent to which they possessed the same narcissistic traits. interestingly, narcissists - who are generally disagreeable and harsh individuals - rated others who possessed narcissistic traits more positively than non-narcissists. furthermore, a mediation analysis revealed that this effect of narcissism on ratings was mediated by narcissists' self-reports of possessing the narcissistic traits. thus, this study provides initial evidence that narcissists are more accepting of others' narcissistic traits, and this study has implications for understanding the interpersonal and intrapersonal consequences of narcissism.

depression	objectiveelectroconvulsive therapy (ect) remains underutilized because of fears of cognitive and medical risks, including the risk of death. in this study, we aimed to assess the mortality rate of ect by means of a systematic review and pooled analysis. methodthe study was conducted in adherence with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guideline. the ect-related mortality rate was calculated as the total number of ect-related deaths reported in the included studies divided by the total number of ect treatments. resultsfifteen studies with data from 32 countries reporting on a total of 766 180 ect treatments met the inclusion criteria. sixteen cases of ect-related death were reported in the included studies yielding an ect-related mortality rate of 2.1 per 100 000 treatments (95% ci: 1.2-3.4). in the nine studies that were published after 2001 (covering 414 747 treatments), there was only one reported ect-related death. conclusionthe ect-related mortality rate was estimated at 2.1 per 100 000 treatments. in comparison, a recent analysis of the mortality of general anesthesia in relation to surgical procedures reported a mortality rate of 3.4 per 100 000. our findings document that death caused by ect is an extremely rare event.
eating_disorders	the evolution of cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) for the treatment of bulimic disorders is described in this review. the impacts of successive attempts to enhance cbt such as the addition of exposure and response prevention; the development of enhanced cbt; and broadening the treatment from bulimia nervosa to binge eating disorder are considered. in addition to developing advanced forms of cbt, shortening treatment to guided self-help was the first step in broadening access to treatment. the use of technology such as computer-based therapy and more recently the internet, promises further broadening of access to self-help and to therapist guided treatment. controlled studies in this area are reviewed, and the balance of risks and benefits that accompany the use of technology and lessened therapist input are considered. looking into the future, more sophisticated forms of treatment delivered as mobile applications (""apps"") may lead to more personalized and efficacious treatments for bulimic disorders, thus enhancing the delivery of treatments for eating disorders.

antisocial_personality_disorder	the present study aimed to examine relationships between antisocial personality disorder (apd) symptoms in adulthood and retrospective reports of childhood maltreatment, parental bonding, and teasing, and while controlling for symptoms of depression and anxiety. four hundred eleven non-clinical participants (99 males, 312 females), aged 18-65 years, recruited from an australian university and the general public, completed the questionnaire package. findings indicated significant associations between childhood maltreatment, parental bonding, teasing, depression, and anxiety, and levels of apd symptomatology. hierarchical regression analysis revealed that physical abuse, physical neglect, teasing, and level of father care made the largest unique contributions to the prediction of apd scores after statistically controlling for comorbid depression and anxiety. analysis of variance revealed higher levels of apd symptoms were reported by males and younger participants. this research contributes importantly to our understanding of factors influencing apd symptomatology, with clinical and early intervention implications.
prejudice	despite post-racial rhetoric, stereotypes remain salient for american youth. we surveyed 150 elementary and middle schoolers in northern california and conducted case studies of 12 students. findings showed that (a) students hold school-related stereotypes that get stronger in middle school, (b) african american and latino students experience greater divergence between stereotype awareness about their group and endorsement than other students, and (c) students who eschewed the applicability of stereotypes to them demonstrated higher engagement and achievement in math. this study has implications for studying race in schools and mathematics, and the need for urban educators to facilitate racialized counter-narratives.
borderline_personality_disorder	replicability of findings is an essential prerequisite of research. for both basic and clinical research, however, low replicability of findings has recently been reported. replicability may be affected by research biases not sufficiently controlled for by the existing research standards. several biases such as researcher allegiance or selective reporting are well-known for affecting results. for psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research, specific additional biases may affect outcome (e.g. therapist allegiance, therapist effects or impairments in treatment implementation). for meta-analyses further specific biases are relevant. in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research these biases have not yet been systematically discussed in the context of replicability. using a list of 13 biases as a starting point, we discuss each bias 's impact on replicability. we illustrate each bias by selective findings of recent research, showing that (1) several biases are not yet sufficiently controlled for by the presently applied research standards, (2) these biases have a pernicious effect on replicability of findings. for the sake of research credibility, it is critical to avoid these biases in future research. to control for biases and to improve replicability, we propose to systematically implement several measures in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research, such as adversarial collaboration (inviting academic rivals to collaborate), reviewing study design prior to knowing the results, triple-blind data analysis (including subjects, investigators and data managers/statisticians), data analysis by other research teams (crowdsourcing), and, last not least, updating reporting standards such as consort or the template for intervention description and replication (tidier).
prenatal_development	studies on the process of acoustic stimulation in prenatal period require to assess the beneficial condition for child development, as well as characteristic sounds which could negatively affect the development of auditory system, brain or even entire body. it can be provided with the simplified model of sound attenuation in the uterus, which can be represented by first order passive low pass filter. on the basis of total harmonic distortion analysis for a single sound, a proposal indicating the sound reduction in the intrauterine environment is formulated. it is hypothesised that the sound stimuli in the uterus is not the same sound as the music in the source.
leadership	this paper responds to recent calls in the leadership studies literature for anthropologically informed empirical research on leadership phenomena in non-western and non-anglophone settings. the authors have worked extensively on rural development projects in laos and draw on ethnographic observant-participation' and interview data to explore how leadership is construed in a contested terrain where traditional concepts intersect with those of official government and international development agencies. a theoretical discussion of linguistic relativity and the socially constitutive nature of language in general is offered as background justification for studying the language of leadership in context. the anthropological distinction between etic and emic operations is also introduced to differentiate between various interpretative positions that can be taken in relation to the fieldwork and data discussed in this paper. the study shows how difficult it can be for native lao speakers to find words to describe leadership or give designations to leaders' outside of officially sanctioned semantic and social fields. a key finding of the study is that, viewed from the perspective of the lao people 's revolutionary party, authority and leadership are coextensive. this social fact is reflected in the linguistic restrictions on what can and cannot be described as leadership in laos.
borderline_personality_disorder	epigenetic mechanisms are believed to link environmental exposures to gene expression, and in so doing, to provide a physical basis for the activation, by life experiences, of mental-health problems. this paper provides a background to the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms link life stresses (perinatal, childhood and adult) and effects of malnutrition to the eating disorders (eds). the paper reviews literature bearing upon the putative link between epigenetic factors and ed development, and examines ways in which epigenetic alterations could account for risk of eating disturbances and commonly associated behavioral and emotional problems. ultimately, we propose that epigenetic processes provide an intriguing (although hypothetical) biological ""platform"" upon which ed-relevant effects of perinatal insults, life stresses, and consequences of malnutrition may be registered, and argue that an epigenetically informed understanding may explain why eds are triggered and maintained by excessive caloric restraint, why they coincide so frequently with mood- and impulse regulation problems, and why they tend to become increasingly entrenched over time. finally, we comment on the clinical relevance and implications of an epigenetically informed model of ed etiology.

attention	the soil organic carbon (soc) stock is an important indicator in ecosystem service assessments. even though a considerable fraction of the total stock is stored in the subsoil, current assessments often consider the topsoil only. furthermore, mapping efforts are hampered by the limited spatial density of these topsoil measurements. the aim of this study was to assess the soc stock in the upper 100 cm of soil in 30,556 ha of low-input high-diversity systems, such as nature reserves, in flanders (belgium) and compare this estimate with the stock found in the topsoil (upper 15 cm). to this end, we combined depth extrapolation of 139 measurements limited to the topsoil with four digital soil mapping techniques: multiple linear regression, boosted regression trees, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines. particular attention was given to vegetation characteristics as predictors. for both the stock in the upper 15 cm and 100 cm, a boosted regression trees approach was most informative as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the relative importance of predictors. the predictors of the stock in the upper 100 cm were soil type, groundwater level, clay fraction and community weighted mean (cwm) and variance (cwv) of plant height. these predictors, together with the cwm of specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, cwv and cwm of rooting depth, terrain slope, cwm of mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also explained the topsoil stock. our total stock estimates show that focusing on the topsoil (1.63 tg oc) only considers 36% of the stock in the upper 100 cm (4.53 tg oc). given the magnitude of subsoil oc and its dependency on typical ecosystem characteristics, it should not be neglected in regional ecosystem service assessments.

prejudice	does ongoing exposure to political violence prompt subject groups to support or oppose compromise in situations of intractable conflict? if so, what is the mechanism underlying these processes? political scholarship neither offers conclusive arguments nor sufficiently addresses individual-level forms of exposure to violence in the context of political conflict, particularly the factors mediating political outcomes. we address this by looking at the impact of exposure to political violence, psychological distress, perceived threat, and ethos of conflict on support for political compromise. a mediated model is hypothesized whereby exposure to political violence provokes support for the ethos of conflict and hinders support for compromise through perceived psychological distress and perceived national threat. we examined representative samples of two parties to the same conflict: israelis (n = 781) and palestinians from gaza, east jerusalem, and the west bank (n = 1,196). the study 's main conclusion is that ethos of conflict serves as a mediating variable in the relationship between exposure to violence and attitudes toward peaceful settlement of the conflict.
depression	objective: structural and functional brain alterations in major depression disorder (mdd) are well studied in cross-sectional designs, but little is known about the causality between onset and course of depression on the one hand, and neurobiological changes over time on the other. to explore the direction of causality, longitudinal studies with a long time window (preferably years) are needed, but only few have been undertaken so far. this article reviews all prospective neuroimaging studies in mdd patients currently available and provides a critical discussion of methodological challenges involved in the investigation of the causal relationship between brain alterations and the course of mdd. method: we conducted a systematic review of studies published before september 2015, to identify structural magnetic resonance imaging (mri) studies that assess the relation between neuronal alterations and mdd in longitudinal (1year) designs. results: only 15 studies meeting minimal standards were identified. an analysis of these longitudinal data showed a large heterogeneity between studies regarding design, samples, imaging methods, spatial restrictions and, consequently, results. there was a strong relationship between brain-volume outcomes and the current mood state, whereas longitudinal studies failed to clarify the influence of pre-existing brain changes on depressive outcome. conclusion: so far, available longitudinal studies cannot resolve the causality between the course of depression and neurobiological changes over time. future studies should combine high methodological standards with large sample sizes. cooperation in multi-center studies is indispensable to attain sufficient sample sizes, and should allow careful assessment of possible confounders.
child_abuse	this paper (re) tells the story of a sports coach who was accused of emotional abuse of a child athlete and, following an investigation by his club, cleared of the allegation. accounts of such allegations are rare and no research to date has explored coaches' lived experiences of this. such stories are 'dangerous' and remain largely unrecognised and undebated as they represent a challenge to the meta-narrative of child protection. using the stance of a 'storyteller', the coach-participant 's story is presented as a monologue crafted using his words and embellished with literary techniques. the story is purposefully largely left open for interpretation in an attempt to encourage readers to engage cognitively and emotionally with it. telling such a 'dangerous' story aims to add to the narrative repertoires available to those working in this field and expand understandings of child protection in sport.
problem-solving	the aim of this article is to address some of the questions dr. paula s. nurius presents in her article, innovation and emerging scientific careers: is social work prepared to compete in todays scientific marketplace? specifically, this article will focus on what we can do to better prepare our emerging research scholars to be successful innovators through trans-disciplinary training and educational activities. this article recommends two main ideas. the first main idea is that social work co-host meetings, lectures, roundtables and trainings with disciplines we do not tend to collaborate with, in order to build inter-disciplinary partnerships. the second suggestion is that students are socially integrated, via extensive interaction of outside disciplines, through customized semester-long rotation style trainings. by implementing these suggestions, we will be providing a space for our doctoral students to gain an understanding of how different disciplines researchers, technologies, and/or methods can add to their ability to produce innovative ideas, encouraging creative and complex thinking and problem solving.
social_cognition	for more than a century researchers have used enculturated animals-those extensively trained or reared by humans-to explore the effects of learning and environment on the capacities for linguistic abilities outside of the human line. unfortunately, due to many controversies, the findings of these studies frequently have been dismissed or outright ignored. however, experimental exploration of the capacities of nonhumans is the only option to determine which, if any, language-associated capacities are unique to humans. researchers continue to publish findings from language projects that move our understanding forward, including descriptions of capacities, such as gestural comprehension, declarative communication, and categorization, that are frequently considered to be specific biological adaptations.
person_perception	classic and contemporary research on person perception has demonstrated the paramount importance of interpersonal warmth. recent research on embodied cognition has shown that feelings of social warmth or coldness can be induced by experiences of physical warmth or coldness, and vice versa. here we show that people tend to self-regulate their feelings of social warmth through applications of physical warmth, apparently without explicit awareness of doing so. in study 1, higher scores on a measure of chronic loneliness (social coldness) were associated with an increased tendency to take warm baths or showers. in study 2, a physical coldness manipulation significantly increased feelings of loneliness. in study 3, needs for social affiliation and for emotion regulation, triggered by recall of a past rejection experience, were subsequently eliminated by an interpolated physical warmth experience. study 4 provided evidence that people are not explicitly aware of the relationship between physical and social warmth (coldness), as they do not consider a target person who often bathes to be any lonelier than one who does not, with all else being equal. together, these findings suggest that physical and social warmth are to some extent substitutable in daily life and that this substitution reflects an unconscious self-regulatory mechanism.
prosocial_behavior	this study examined at-risk boys' social self-efficacy and physical activity self-efficacy within bandura 's self-efficacy framework. a total of 97 boys, aged between 10 and 13 years, attending a summer sports camp completed questionnaires assessing their social self-efficacy, physical activity self-efficacy, prosocial behaviors, and effort. results indicated that social self-efficacy and physical activity self-efficacy were clearly distinguishable. however, the two constructs had a strong positive correlation. both social self-efficacy and physical activity self-efficacy predicted prosocial behaviors significantly, with social self-efficacy having a stronger predictive power. physical activity self-efficacy was a better predictor of effort than social self-efficacy. this study provides initial empirical evidence supporting bandura 's conceptualization of the domain-specific features and predictive power of self-efficacy in a summer sports camp setting, and thus enables a better understanding of the nature and effects of self-efficacy.
prenatal_development	objective: to evaluate the horizontal migration of the human mental foramen before and after birth. methods: 54 formalin-fixed fetuses between 17 and 32 weeks of gestation, and 94 panoramic radiographs of children aged between 4 and 12 years were investigated. the distances between the mental foramen and mental symphysis, and the distances between the posterior border of the mandibular ramus and mental foramen were determined according to development periods. results: our results confirm that the mental foramen moves in a posterior direction during the development of the mandible. conclusion: the horizontal location of the pre- and postnatal mental foramen changes in a posterior direction as the development progresses, however, prenatal mental foramen features an irregular behavior, while the postnatal mental foramen gradually migrates posteriorly in a regular pattern.

child_abuse	the causes of homelessness are complex and poorly understood. this paper describes the homeless population in santa clara county, california in terms of adverse childhood events, traumatic brain injuries (tbis), and family breakdown. respondents reported severely traumatic childhoods; 78.7% grew up in a household with a person with drug or alcohol dependence and 64.6% endured psychological abuse as a child. seventy-six percent of subjects recalled at least one tbi, 58.4% with loss of consciousness. nineteen percent were in foster care as children and 40.2% reported having someone other than a parent as a primary caregiver. fifty-three percent felt they had moved too much as children, and 37.5% had experienced homelessness as children. santa clara county has both the highest median income and the highest rate of unsheltered homelessness in the nation. leaders and community members should work together to improve the lives of the homeless and to prevent another generation of homeless people.
gender_roles	aim: becoming a parent precipitates changes in new mothers' psychological and social domains. previous literature has focused exclusively on pregnancy and the early postpartum, but parenting is an evolving process, necessitating adaption to changing circumstances. we extended previous literature and investigate the changes in the postpartum from 3 to 18 months that occur in maternal attitudes. methods: using the childbearing attitudes questionnaire, we collected data on mothers' ratings of maternal worries, self-efficacy, mother-infant bonding, relationship with the partner and interest in sex (n = 171 women). data were analysed with a latent growth curve. results: results demonstrated stability in all maternal attitudes after 3 months postpartum. further, different maternal attitudes are affected by different variables. maternal worries and self-efficacy are associated with parity, postpartum depression and child temperament. interestingly, a negative evaluation of the relationship with the partner was only associated with breastfeeding status, while interest in sex was associated with parity, socio-economic status (ses) and depressive symptoms. conclusion: despite general stability, different maternal attitudes related to different sets of variables. these patterns of attitudes in relation to relevant variables are discussed in terms of the literature on self-efficacy and gender roles, with important implications for clinical interventions.
false_memories	some of the previous research on stress-memory interactions has suggested that stress increases the production of false memories. however, as accumulating work has shown that the effects of stress on learning and memory depend critically on the timing of the stressor, we hypothesized that brief stress administered immediately before learning would reduce, rather than increase, false memory production. in the present study, participants submerged their dominant hand in a bath of ice cold water (stress) or sat quietly (no stress) for 3 min. then, participants completed a short-term memory task, the deese-roediger-mcdermott paradigm, in which they were presented with 10 different lists of semantically related words (e.g., candy, sour, sugar) and, after each list, were tested for their memory of presented words (e.g., candy), non-presented unrelated ""distractor"" words (e.g., hat), and non-presented semantically related ""critical lure"" words (e.g., sweet). stress, overall, significantly reduced the number of critical lures recalled (i.e., false memory) by participants. in addition, stress enhanced memory for the presented words (i.e., true memory) in female, but not male, participants. these findings reveal that stress does not unequivocally enhance false memory production and that the timing of the stressor is an important variable that could mediate such effects. such results could have important implications for understanding the dependability of eyewitness accounts of events that are observed following stress.

gender_roles	gender ideologies in cape verde are shifting. individuals find themselves caught between changing tides, pushed and pulled in opposite directions by divergent gendered expectations. the article examines the different ways in which young women and men take recourse to tactics in response to the tensions that arise as they deal with changing gender ascriptions in the midst of their relations with community and kin. women, in particular, are unevenly affected by traditional demands and expectations whilst they cross the boundaries of traditional gender roles in their pursuit of enhanced education and more sexual freedom. yet, their actions are not characterized by an outright rejection of traditional gender ideologies, but rather by piecemeal tactical manoeuvres to plot a route through the centrifugal forces at play.
false_memories	previous research has shown that arbitrary stimuli acquire the valence of facial expressions that convey different emotions when both become members of the same equivalence class. the present study investigated whether stimuli that shifted class membership and became equivalent to another facial expression would change in valence accordingly. fifty-four college students formed equivalence classes a1b1c1d1, a2b2c2d2, and a3b3c3d3, where a1, a2, and a3 were facial expressions of happiness, neutrality, and anger, respectively. semantic differential ratings showed that d1, d2, and d3 acquired the valences of the equivalent facial expressions. training for class reorganization was then conducted, altering the cd relation, so that d2, d3, and d1 would become equivalent to expressions of happiness, neutrality, and anger, respectively. this training was conducted in a delayed matching-to-sample format for one group of participants and in a simultaneous matching-to-sample format for another group. when asked to rate the d stimuli again, participants who showed class reorganization showed valence changes according to the facial expression to which these stimuli became equivalent after training of the altered cd relation. valence changed more for participants trained for class reorganization with delayed matching. participants who did not pass the test for class reorganization did not show changes in the valence of the d stimuli. these results indicate that training parameters affect the extent to which stimuli change in meaning when they shift membership in equivalence classes.
child_abuse	the paradigmatic system of societal abuse occurs in totalitarian state systems. the relational systems of subjugation that maintain such states of terror must, of necessity, destroy any authentic civic space in which individuals can flourish. similar dynamics characterize child abuse within families. survival requires the use of varied strategies, the most extreme of which are dissociative in nature, and that result in marked distortions of developmental trajectories across all psychological domains. such dynamics are mirrored in dissociative systems that, in the absence of intervention, perpetuate the trauma of non-recognition by subjugation and self-objectification, or by omnipotent denial of others' subjectivity. all abusive systems are facilitated by bystanders, whose awareness of what is disavowed is always partial, resulting in a state of knowing and not-knowing. as dynamics shift, bystanders may behave like victimspassive, helpless, frightened and frozen, or like perpetratorstaking vicarious and voyeuristic pleasure in abuse or actively aiding and abetting the abusers.
gender_roles	gender roles in mainstream us culture suggest that girls express more happiness, sadness, anxiety, and shame/embarrassment than boys, while boys express more anger and externalizing emotions, such as contempt. however, gender roles and emotion expression may be different in low-income and ethnically diverse families, as children and parents are often faced with greater environmental stressors and may have different gender expectations. this study examined gender differences in emotion expression in low-income adolescents, an understudied population. one hundred and seventy nine adolescents (aged 14-17) participated in the trier social stress test (tsst). trained coders rated adolescents' expressions of happiness, sadness, anxiety, shame/embarrassment, anger, and contempt during the tsst using a micro-analytic coding system. analyses showed that, consistent with gender roles, girls expressed higher levels of happiness and shame than boys; however, contrary to traditional gender roles, girls showed higher levels of contempt than boys. also, in contrast to cultural stereotypes, there were no differences in anger between boys and girls. findings suggest gender-role inconsistent displays of externalizing emotions in low-income adolescents under acute stress, and may reflect different emotion socialization experiences in this group.
nonverbal_communication	pharmacological intervention for autism spectrum disorder (asd) is an important addition to treatment, yet currently available agents target co-morbid psychiatric concerns, such as aggression and irritability. propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist with anxiolytic effects, has been shown to improve verbal fluency and working memory in adults and adolescents with asd in single-dose challenges. the present pilot study explores the acute effects of propranolol on a measure of conversational reciprocity in this population. we also examined whether autonomic activity and anxiety moderate or mediate response to the drug, given relationships between these variables and asd, as well as the drug 's effects. in a within-subject crossover design, 20 individuals with asd received a single dose of propranolol or placebo during two sessions in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. after drug administration, participants performed a conversational reciprocity task by engaging in a short conversation with the researcher. measurements of autonomic activity and anxiety were obtained before and after drug administration. propranolol significantly improved performance on the conversational reciprocity task total [d = 0.40] and nonverbal communication domain scores when compared to the placebo condition. however, neither autonomic activity nor anxiety was significantly associated with drug response. acute propranolol administration improved conversational reciprocity in asd. further exploration of these preliminary findings, as well as other potential treatment response predictors, with serial doses is warranted.
attention	what is known and objectivethe role of cyp3a5 in drug metabolism has been receiving attention because cyp3a5 may be more involved in the metabolism of cyp3a substrates in vivo than previously thought. the polymorphism of transporters, such as p-gp (p-glycoprotein) and breast cancer-related protein (bcrp), influences the metabolism of these substrates, and felodipine is a substrate of p-gp. the aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacogenetic variability in the disposition of felodipine in healthy chinese subjects. methodsa single dose of 5 mg felodipine was orally administered to 45 healthy chinese subjects. the serum concentration of felodipine was measured by using lc/ms/ms. we detected the snps of cytochromes p450 enzymes and transporters, which play vital roles in drug metabolism and have a high frequency of mutation in chinese population. results and discussionthe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) within the time points 0 to 72 h (auc((0-72))) after felodipine administration was significantly higher in subjects possessing the bcrp421aa alleles than in those with the bcrp421 cc or ca genotype (p = 0034). the subjects with cyp3a5*3/*3 (n = 27) had higher felodipine exposure than cyp3a5*1/*3 (n = 15) (p = 0035). what is new and conclusionthis study showed that the genetic polymorphisms of cyp3a5*3 and bcrpc421a might explain the variability in the pharmacokinetics of felodipine in the chinese population.
attention	one of the important topics in morphometry that received high attention recently is the longitudinal analysis of shape variation. according to kendall 's definition of shape, the shape of object appertains on non-euclidean space, making the longitudinal study of configuration somehow difficult. however, to simplify this task, triangulation of the objects and then constructing a non-parametric regression-type model on the unit sphere is pursued in this paper. the prediction of the configurations in some time instances is done using both properties of triangulation and the size of great baselines. moreover, minimizing a euclidean risk function is proposed to select feasible weights in constructing smoother functions in a non-parametric smoothing manner. these will provide some proper shape growth models to analysis objects varying in time. the proposed models are applied to analysis of two real-life datasets.
prenatal_development	reviewing the recent literature on the role of mitochondria during fetal development paradoxically reveals two features: the importance of mitochondria in these early developmental phases, and the scarcity of information available for humans. indeed, most of the available information on the role of mitochondria during development comes from studies of animal models that do not necessarily strictly apply to humans. in this paper, we attempted to collect information existing on humans, together with data from animal studies essentially presented as corroboration. this makes clear that a complex interacting network of energetic, genetic and epigenetic factors governs the impact of mitochondrial function on early development in humans. this complexity presumably also accounts for our poor understanding of the consequences of impaired mitochondrial function on prenatal development, or conversely, of the impact of development on the expression of such deficiencies.

seasonal_affective_disorder	the influence of day length on living creatures differs with the photosensitivity of the creature; however, the possible sunshine duration (n-0) might be an inadequate index of the photoperiod for creatures with low light sensitivity. to address this issue, the authors tried to estimate the effective day length, i.e., the duration of the photoperiod that exceeds a certain threshold of light intensity. continual global solar radiation observation data were gathered from the baseline surface radiation network (bsrn) of 18 sites from 2004 to 2007 and were converted to illuminance data using a luminous efficiency model. the monthly average of daily photoperiods exceeding each defined intensity (1 lx, 300 lx,. 20,000 lx) were calculated [defined as ne((lux))]. the relationships between the monthly average of global solar radiation (rs), n-0, and ne((lux)) were investigated. at low light intensity (10,000 lx), ne((lux)) and rs showed a logarithmic relationship. using these relationships, empirical models were derived to estimate the effective day length at different light intensities. according to the validation of the model, the effective day length for any light intensity could be estimated with an accuracy of less than 11% of the mean absolute percentage error (mape) in the estimation of the monthly base photoperiod. recently, a number of studies have provided support for a link between day length and some diseases. our results will be useful in further assessing the relationships between day length and these diseases.
eating_disorders	the current study sought to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a compassion-focused therapy (cft) group as an adjunct to evidence-based outpatient treatment for eating disorders, and to examine its preliminary efficacy relative to treatment as usual (tau). twenty-two outpatients with various types of eating disorders were randomly assigned to 12weeks of tau (n=11) or tau plus weekly cft groups adapted for an eating disorder population (cft+tau; n=11). participants in both conditions completed measures of self-compassion, fears of compassion, shame and eating disorder pathology at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12. additionally, participants receiving the cft group completed measures assessing acceptability and feasibility of the group. results indicated that the cft group demonstrated strong acceptability; attendance was high and the group retained over 80% of participants. participants rated the group positively and indicated they would be very likely to recommend it to peers with similar symptoms. intention-to-treat analyses revealed that compared to the tau condition, the cft+tau condition yielded greater improvements in self-compassion, fears of self-compassion, fears of receiving compassion, shame and eating disorder pathology over the 12weeks. results suggest that group-based cft, offered in conjunction with evidence-based outpatient tau for eating disorders, may be an acceptable, feasible and efficacious intervention. furthermore, eating disorder patients appear to see benefit in, and observe gains from, working on the cft goals of overcoming fears of compassion, developing more self-compassion and accessing more compassion from others. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
schizophrenia	background: many studies have indicated that immune dysfunction might be involved in the physiopathology of schizophrenia and aggression. this study aimed to investigate the correlation between high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp), interleukin (il)-10 and clinical characteristics, especially aggression, and to explore the potential role of hscrp and il-10 as plasma biomarkers of schizophrenia. methods: forty-one patients with schizophrenia and forty healthy individuals were enrolled. psychopathological severity and aggression were assessed using the positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) and modified overt aggression scale (moas). plasma concentrations of hscrp and il-10 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: (1) higher levels of hscrp (p < 0.001), lower levels of logil-10 (p < 0.001) and higher ratio of hscrp to il-10 (p < 0.001) were observed in the plasma of patients with schizophrenia, compared to healthy controls; (2) roc (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis revealed that ratio of hscrp/il-10 (predictive value: 0.783, p < 0.01; sensitivity: 85.4%; specificity: 67.5%) was more applicable as a biomarker to distinguish patients with schizophrenia from the control group than hscrp and il-10 alone (predictive value: 0.718, p < 0.01; 0.275, p < 0.001, respectively); (3) we found positive correlations between hscrp and the total score and verbal aggression score of moas (r = 0.654, p < 0.01; r = 0.678, p < 0.05), and between hscrp/il-10 and the total score of moas (r = 0.636, p < 0.01). conclusions: our results suggest the possible function of hscrp and il-10 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the possible value of hscrp/il-10 as a potential peripheral biomarker of schizophrenia. this finding also suggests a relationship between hscrp, il-10 and their ratio with aggression in patients with schizophrenia.

nonverbal_communication	accessible mind maps tools are, due to their visual nature hardly available and, if available, they focus on rendering the structure, not considering nonverbal communication elements in ongoing discussions. in this paper, we describe the need for this type of communication as well as a mind map tool that is capable of processing the respective information, coming from a leap tracking system attached to the interactive surface.
depression	most theoretical frameworks regarding the role of life stress in bipolar disorders (bd) do not incorporate the possibility of a changing relationship between psychosocial context and episode initiation across the course of the disorder. the kindling hypothesis theorizes that over the longitudinal course of recurrent affective disorders, the relationship between major life stressors and episode initiation declines (post, 1992). the present study aimed to test an extension of the kindling hypothesis in bd by examining the effect of early life adversity on the relationship between proximal life events and prospectively assessed mood episodes. data from 145 bipolar participants (59.3% female, 75.2% caucasian, and mean age of 20.19 years; sd = 1.75 years) were collected as part of the temple-wisconsin longitudinal investigation of bipolar spectrum project (112 bipolar ii; 33 cyclothymic disorder). participants completed a self-report measure of early adversity at baseline and interview-assessed mood episodes and life events at regular 4-month follow-ups. results indicate that early childhood adversity sensitized bipolar participants to the effects of recent stressors only for depressive episodes and not hypomanic episodes within bd. this was particularly the case with minor negative events. the current study extends prior research examining the kindling model in bd using a methodologically rigorous assessment of life stressors and mood episode occurrence. clinicians should assess experiences of early adversity in individuals with bd as it may impact reactivity to developing depressive episodes in response to future stressors.
leadership	applying an observable delay game framework developed in noncooperative game theory, we investigate the timing problem concerning when a manufacturer managing dual-channel supply chains, consisting of a retail channel and a direct channel, should post its wholesale price and direct price. conventionally, operational research models describing dual-channel supply chains examine price competition, where the retailer and the manufacturer simultaneously determine the retail and direct prices, respectively. in contrast to this conventional setting, our model demonstrates that such simultaneous price competition never arises if the manufacturer and retailer can choose not only the level of the price but also the timing of pricing. if the manufacturer sets the direct price after setting the wholesale price to the retailer, the retailer accelerates the timing of retail pricing prior to the direct price setting by the manufacturer. our findings suggest that the manufacturer should post the direct price before or upon, but not after, setting the wholesale price for the retailer. this upfront posting of the direct price not only constitutes the subgame perfect nash equilibrium of the noncooperative game between channel members but also maximizes the profits for a manufacturer employing multichannel sales strategies.

media_violence	the issue of children 's exposure to violent video games has been a source of considerable debate for several decades. questions persist whether children with pre-existing mental health problems may be influenced adversely by exposure to violent games, even if other children are not. we explored this issue with 377 children (62 % female, mixed ethnicity, mean age = 12.93) displaying clinically elevated attention deficit or depressive symptoms on the pediatric symptom checklist. results from our study found no evidence for increased bullying or delinquent behaviors among youth with clinically elevated mental health symptoms who also played violent video games. our results did not support the hypothesis that children with elevated mental health symptoms constitute a ""vulnerable"" population for video game violence effects. implications and suggestions for further research are provided.
nonverbal_communication	background/aim: gesturing plays an important role in social behavior and social learning. deficits are frequent in schizophrenia and may contribute to impaired social functioning. information about deficits during the course of the disease and presence of severity and patterns of impairment in first-episode patients is missing. hence, we aimed to investigate gesturing in first - compared to multiple-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. methods: in 14 first-episode patients, 14 multiple-episode patients and 16 healthy controls matched for age, gender and education, gesturing was assessed by the comprehensive test of upper limb apraxia. performance in two domains of gesturing imitation and pantomime - was recorded on video. raters of gesture performance were blinded. results: patients with multiple episodes had severe gestural deficits. for almost all gesture categories, performance was worse in multiple-than in first-episode patients. first-episode patients demonstrated subtle deficits with a comparable pattern. conclusions: subjects with multiple psychotic episodes have severe deficits in gesturing, while only mild impairments were found in first-episode patients independent of age, gender, education and negative symptoms. the results indicate that gesturing is impaired at the onset of disease and likely to further deteriorate during its course.

borderline_personality_disorder	background: both postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) have been identified as unique risk factors for poor maternal psychopathology. little is known, however, regarding the longitudinal processes of co-occurring depression and ptsd among mothers with childhood adversity. the present study addressed this research gap by examining co-occurring postpartum depression and ptsd trajectories among mothers with childhood trauma history. methods: 177 mothers with childhood trauma history reported depression and ptsd symptoms at 4, 6, 12, 15 and 18 months postpartum, as well as individual (shame, posttraumatic cognitions, dissociation) and contextual (social support, childhood and postpartum trauma experiences) factors. results: growth mixture modeling (gmm) identified three comorbid change patterns: the resilient group (64%) showed the lowest levels of depression and ptsd that remained stable over time; the vulnerable group (23%) displayed moderately high levels of comorbid depression and ptsd; and the chronic high-risk group (14%) showed the highest level of comorbid depression and ptsd. further, a path model revealed that postpartum dissociation, negative posttraumatic cognitions, shame, as well as social support, and childhood and postpartum trauma experiences differentiated membership in the chronic high-risk and vulnerable. finally, we found that children of mothers in the vulnerable group were reported as having more externalizing and total problem behaviors. limitations: generalizability is limited, given this is a sample of mothers with childhood trauma history and demographic risk. conclusions: the results highlight the strong comorbidity of postpartum depression and ptsd among mothers with childhood trauma history, and also emphasize its aversive impact on the offspring.

problem-solving	instructional strategies can be helpful in facilitating students' knowledge construction and developing advanced cognitive skills. in the context of collaborative learning, instructional strategies as scripts can guide learners to engage in more meaningful interaction. previous studies have been investigated the benefits of different instructional strategies; nonetheless, relatively little attention has been paid to illustrating the learners' cognitive processing and behavioral patterns in the learning process. nowadays, with the proliferation of information technology, behavior and interaction of learners can be conveniently documented and analyzed. the aim of this study is to propose a new approach examining the learning process. this study designed a four-week collaborative learning activity involving four widely used instructional strategies, i.e. problem solving, peer assessment, role playing and peer tutoring. blogs were used to support students' collaboration. a total of 9843 discussion messages were retrieved for data analysis. quantitative content analysis and lag sequential analysis were employed to explore the content structure and behavioral patterns demonstrated in students' online discussions. the results showed that students exhibited relatively more cognitive process of 'understand' under peer assessment and peer tutoring instructional strategies. meanwhile, students showed relatively more cognitive process of 'create' under problem solving and role playing strategies. implications of the findings and suggestions for subsequent work are discussed.
nonverbal_communication	the discursive use of language in legal contexts is multifaceted and complex. first, it begins with the chain of oral narrative structures (victim, witness, suspect accounts) and written texts (confessions, notes, depositions, letters, internet documents, email, tweets, telephone records) used in a court of law. the transcription of oral communiques is a potentially transformative phase of evidence production that may be flawed (ambiguity, error, mistakes, gaps, misrepresentation). second, it includes or/excludes the textual and narrative representation of nonverbal communication (kinesics, paralanguage, proxemics) and how it is recorded (transcripts, graphics, video, enactments). at each stage of the legal process, interpretation of narrative structures and texts plays a key role in the ultimate meaning of verbal and nonverbal communication. third, it concerns interrogation strategies and tactics in preliminary evidence gathering as well as in the courtroom. fourth, it involves translation of documents written in another language or interpretation of oral statements in another language to the language of the courtroom.
eating_disorders	introduction: obesity represents a major public health problem associated with medical and psychological impairment. obesity is frequently studied with binge eating disorder (bed) comorbidity. less evidence is available for non-bed obesity, in spite of its correlation with psychological impairment and body image disturbance. in this study, we explored psychopathological features, eating behaviors, body image disturbance and self-identity impairment in patients with obesity and a control group. in patients, we also studied the relation between specific eating/body features and psychopathological symptoms. finally, we explored the latent factorial structure that describes these features. material and methods: the clinical sample was composed by twenty patients suffering from obesity without bed (16 females). the control group included twenty-eight healthy and normal-weight subjects (20 females) enrolled from the general population. all participants underwent a clinical interview and filled out questionnaires about body image and psychopathological symptoms. statistics: the student t test was applied to compare obese patients and healthy controls in all psychological dimensions. in the clinical sample, gender differences were tested through multivariate analyses of variance (manova). then, correlational analyses explored the relation between specific eating/body features and psychopathological symptoms. lastly, a principal-components factor analysis was performed to explore the existence of a latent factorial structure emerging from assessment evaluation in obese population. results: obese patients reported significantly higher scores than healthy controls in several psychopathological dimensions, i.e. somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. patients also reported higher body uneasiness and self-identity impairment resulting from some scores on body uneasiness test and identity and eating disorders questionnaire. avoidant behaviours were more frequently reported in men whereas women reported higher body distress/dissatisfaction. in the clinical sample the questionnaires were correlated and a three-factor structure emerged: ""weight and body control"", ""weakness of self-identity"", and ""psychopathological distress"". discussion: the present study found that obese patients might present several disturbances in body image, self-perception and general psychopathological distress. clinicians should be aware of these issues to improve therapeutic strategy in the treatment of obesity.
problem-solving	initial teacher education does not only imply preparing student teachers for knowing, thinking and understanding but it involves supporting student teachers in developing understanding in order to act. several specialists have recommended case pedagogy for initial teacher education, arguing that it can help teacher educators overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional models of teacher education, and it can greatly enhance teacher professional development. case pedagogy is based on the idea that new knowledge is constructed in connection with prior knowledge, it is directly related to experience, it is transformable and it can change overtime. in addition, case pedagogy helps student teachers understand the complexity of teaching and this encourages experimentation and innovation in teaching. in this paper i maintain that case pedagogy encourages critical reflection, facilitates the understanding of theory and it helps teachers to develop problem-solving skills, linking teaching, research and professional development.
false_memories	cognitive models of vulnerability to anxiety propose that information processing biases such as interpretation bias play a part in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. however, at present little is known about the role of memory in information processing accounts of child anxiety. the current study investigates the relationships between interpretation biases, memory and fear responses when learning about new stimuli. children (aged 8-11 years) were presented with ambiguous information regarding a novel animal, and their fear, interpretation bias, and memory for the information was measured. the main findings were: (1) trait anxiety and interpretation bias significantly predicted acquired fear; (2) interpretation bias did not significantly mediate the relationship between trait anxiety and acquired fear; (3) interpretation bias appeared to be a more important predictor of acquired fear than trait anxiety per se; and (4) the relationship between interpretation bias and acquired fear was not mediated by the number of negative memories but was mediated by the number of positive and false-positive memories. the findings suggest that information processing models of child anxiety need to explain the role of positive memory in the formation of fear responses.
seasonal_affective_disorder	bright light therapy is used as the primary treatment for seasonal affective disorder; however, the mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effect are not fully understood. previously, we found that c57bl/6j mice exhibit increased depression-like behavior during a short-day condition (sd) and have lowered brain serotonin (5-ht) content. this study analyzed the effect of bright light on depression-like behaviors and the brain serotonergic system using the c57bl16j mice. in the mice maintained under sd, bright light treatment (1000 lx, daily 1 h exposure) for 1 week reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test and increased intake of saccharin solution in a saccharin intake test. however, the light treatment did not modify 5-ht content and selective 5-ht uptake in the amygdala, or temporal patterns of core body temperature and wheel-running activity throughout a day. in the next experiment, we attempted to enhance the effect of bright light by using l-serine, a precursor of n-serine that acts as an n-methyl-naspartic acid receptor coagonist. daily subcutaneous injection of l-serine for 2 weeks prior to the bright light strongly reduced the immobility time in the forced swimming test, suggesting a synergistic effect of light and l-serine. furthermore, bright light increased the total number of 5-ht-immunoreactive cells and cells that had colocalized 5-ht and c-fos immunosignals in several subregions of the raphe nuclei. these effects were potentiated by prior injection of l-serine. these data suggest that the bright light may elicit an antidepressant-like effect via enhanced 5-ht signals in the brain and l-serine can enhance these effects.

gender_roles	according to gender role theory, individuals who confirm expectations associated with their gender roles are rewarded and judged against these expectations when they deviate. parental roles are strongly tied to gender, and there are very different expectations for behaviors of mothers and fathers. this study examined how mothers' and fathers' behaviors that support or discourage a positive relationship with the other parent are perceived in terms of their acceptability. two-hundred twent-eight parents completed an online survey assessing perceptions of acceptability of negative ( parental alienating) and positive coparenting behaviors. results provided support for our hypothesis: although parental alienating behaviors were rated unacceptable, they were more acceptable for mothers than fathers. expectancy violation theory can explain why parental alienating behaviors are not viewed as negatively when mothers exhibit them than fathers.
prenatal_development	background: prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (edcs) has previously shown to alter epigenetic marks. objectives: in this work we explore whether prenatal exposure to mixtures of xenoestrogens has the potential to alter the placenta epigenome, by studying dna methylation in retrotransposons as a surrogate of global dna methylation. methods: the biomarker total effective xenoestrogen burden (texb) was measured in 192 placentas from participants in the longitudinal inma project. dna methylation was quantitatively assessed by bisulfite pyrosequencing on 10 different retrotransposons including 3 different long interspersed nuclear elements (lines), 4 short interspersed nuclear elements (sines) and 3 human endogenous retroviruses (hervs). associations were tested using linear mixed-effects regression models and sex interaction was evaluated. results: a significant sex interaction was observed for aluyb8 (p-value for interaction <0.001, significant at bonferroni corrected p-value threshold of 0.0025). boys with the highest texb-alpha levels of exposure (third tertile) presented on average a decrease of 0.84% in methylation compared to those in the first tertile (p-value < 0.001), while no significant effects were found in girls (p-value = 0.134). conclusions: our findings suggest that boys may be more susceptible to the effect of exposure to xenoestrogens during prenatal development, producing shifts in dna methylation of certain sensitive genomic repetitive sequences in a tissue important for fetal growth and development.

prejudice	self-definition becomes a central task during early adolescence, as youth identify with multiple social groups. focusing on ethnic identification and identification with other salient social ingroups (e.g., those based on extracurricular activities), we examined predictors of perceived ingroup membership overlap among ethnically diverse adolescents (n = 1264; m (age) = 12.51; 53 % female). social ingroup overlap remained relatively stable, but decreased, across the seventh to eighth grade. the number of cross-ethnic classmates in seventh grade predicted lower overlap in the eighth grade, and cross-ethnic friendships by eighth grade mediated this association. findings underscore the opportunities provided by multiethnic middle schools for youth to connect and befriend one another across ethnic lines, as well as to foster divergent social identities that are associated with positive intergroup attitudes.
prejudice	the pervasiveness of explicit and implicit weight bias (wb) defined as negative stereotypes and prejudice regarding one 's weight has been observed among individuals of all weight categories. as a source of wb, health messages have been discussed due to reinforcing stigmatizing notions. the present study sought to investigate whether health messages (i.e., eat healthy, become physically active) have the potential to increase explicit and implicit wb. participants (n = 144) from the community were randomized to either an experimental group (eg) or a control group (cg). while the eg was presented with health messages, the cg was presented with neutral information. before and after manipulation, participants completed measures of explicit and implicit wb. paired samples t-test revealed no differences in explicit wb after manipulation, however, a small effect decrease of implicit wb in the eg but not in the cg was found. this study provided evidence that health messages might have differential impact to change wb. according to dual-model approaches, explicit and implicit wb tap into two different information processing systems, and thus were differentially affected by health messages. brief exposure to health messages might have the potential to contribute to health behavior and to mitigate implicit wb.
problem-solving	in this paper, we describe findings from a three-year evaluation of a well-developed mathematics professional development program that is commercially available on a wide scale. the professional development is designed to improve teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching and to enable them to elicit more student thinking and reasoning during mathematics lessons. specifically, it focused on helping teachers (a) learn more mathematics, (b) understand how children learn math, (c) use formative assessment to develop insight into what specific students know and do not know, and (d) develop effective classroom instructional strategies that enable student problem solving. participants included 105 fourth- and fifth-grade teachers teaching in 19 low-income schools within a single district. teachers were randomly assigned within schools either to a business as usual control group or to receive the professional development. the training consisted of a week-long summer institute and four to six in-service days during the school year. the training was run by full-time trained associates. we find some limited evidence of positive impacts on teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching, but no effects on instructional practice or student outcomes.
nonverbal_communication	in this paper, we propose a communication support tool for understanding emotion in an unstable narrowband network. the tool can reflect some emotion with a selected voice to character-based real time communication such as chat. the voice data is transmitted asynchronously and stored in local storage. in order to evaluate the effectiveness of communication to play voice data according to emotion, we implemented web-based voice contents classified according to some massage types and primitive emotion.
attention	when we hear an event description, our mental construal is not only based on lexical items, but also on the message 's syntactic structure. this has been well-studied in the domains of causation, event participants, and object conceptualization. less studied are the construals of temporality and numerosity as a function of syntax. we present a theory of how syntax affects the construal of event similarity and duration in a way that is systematically predictable from the interaction of mass/count syntax and verb semantics, and test these predictions in six studies. punctive events in count syntax (give a kiss) and durative events in mass syntax (give advice) are construed as taking less time than in transitive frame (kiss and advise). durative verbs in count syntax (give a talk), however, result in a semantic shift, orthogonal to duration estimates. these results demonstrate how syntactic and semantic structure together systematically affect event construal.

antisocial_personality_disorder	offenders with high psychopathic traits and/or antisocial personality disorder (aspd) are hypothesised to experience less guilt and less responsibility for their actions than offenders without these problems. these hypotheses were tested and partly substantiated. the study investigates blame attributions and guilt feeling using gudjonsson blame attribution inventory-revised (gbai-r) for 177 young male violent offenders. gbai scores were compared to aspd and psychopathy according to the psychopathy checklist-revised. results showed that individuals with aspd and those with higher degrees of psychopathy tended to report significantly less guilt and higher degree of mental control than other subjects. another finding was a weak relationship between aspd, high scores on psychopathic traits and external attribution. we suggest these results might be explained by admitting poor mental control may be extra difficult for individuals belonging to either of these groups and that the external attribution items do not separate causal from moral responsibility.
prenatal_development	hormones present in hair provide summative information about endocrine activity while the hair was growing. therefore, it can be collected from an infant after birth and still provide retrospective information about hormone exposure during prenatal development. we employed this approach to determine whether a delimited period of maternal stress during pregnancy affected the concentrations of glucocorticoids and gonadal hormones in the hair of neonatal rhesus monkeys. hair from 22 infant monkeys exposed to 5 weeks of gestational disturbance was compared to specimens from 13 infants from undisturbed control pregnancies. using an lc/ms/ms based technique, which permitted seven steroid hormones to be quantified simultaneously, we found 2 hormones were significantly different in infants from disturbed pregnancies. cortisol and testosterone levels were lower in the hair of both male and female neonates. maternal hair hormone levels collected on the same day after delivery no longer showed effects of the disturbance earlier during pregnancy. this study documents that a period of acute stress, lasting for 20% of gestation, has sustained effects on the hormones to which a developing fetus is exposed.

prenatal_development	the functional connectivity architecture of the adult human brain enables complex cognitive processes, and exhibits a remarkably complex structure shared across individuals. we are only beginning to understand its heterogeneous structure, ranging from a strongly hierarchical organization in sensorimotor areas to widely distributed networks in areas such as the parieto-frontal cortex. our study relied on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data of 32 fetuses with no detectable morphological abnormalities. after adapting functional magnetic resonance acquisition, motion correction, and nuisance signal reduction procedures of resting-state functional data analysis to fetuses, we extracted neural activity information for major cortical and subcortical structures. resting fmri networks were observed for increasing regional functional connectivity from 21st to 38th gestational weeks (gws) with a network-based statistical inference approach. the overall connectivity network, short range, and interhemispheric connections showed sigmoid expansion curve peaking at the 26-29 gw. in contrast, long-range connections exhibited linear increase with no periods of peaking development. region-specific increase of functional signal synchrony followed a sequence of occipital (peak: 24.8 gw), temporal (peak: 26 gw), frontal (peak: 26.4 gw), and parietal expansion (peak: 27.5 gw). we successfully adapted functional neuroimaging and image post-processing approaches to correlate macroscopical scale activations in the fetal brain with gestational age. this in vivo study reflects the fact that the mid-fetal period hosts events that cause the architecture of the brain circuitry to mature, which presumably manifests in increasing strength of intraand interhemispheric functional macro connectivity.
nonverbal_communication	autism spectrum disorder diagnoses sometimes change due to misdiagnosis, maturation, or treatment. this study uses a probability-based national surveythe survey of pathways to diagnosis and servicesto compare currently diagnosed (n=1420) and previously diagnosed (n=187) children aged 6-17years based on retrospective parental reports of early concerns about their children 's development, responses to those concerns by doctors and other healthcare providers, the type of provider who made the first autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and the autism spectrum disorder subtype diagnoses received (if any). propensity score matching was used to control for differences between the groups on children 's current level of functioning and other current characteristics that may have been related to diagnosis loss. approximately 13% of the children ever diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder were estimated to have lost the diagnosis, and parents of 74% of them believed it was changed due to new information. previously diagnosed children were less likely to have parents with early concerns about verbal skills, nonverbal communication, learning, and unusual gestures or movements. they were also less likely to have been referred to and diagnosed by a specialist. previously diagnosed children were less likely to have ever received a diagnosis of asperger 's disorder or autistic disorder.
attention	the proportion of workers in their 50s, 60s, and 70s is larger than ever before. current work-force trends indicate global increases in retirement ages and that many individuals are working until later ages than in decades past, and older people are applying for jobs and at later ages. research to date on age discrimination in selection has focused primarily on disparate treatment or intentional discrimination. however, based on accumulated knowledge about age-related changes in cognitive and physical abilities as well as changes in personality and work motivation across the life course, we suggest that more attention be paid to the possibility of age-based subgroup differences on selection procedures, manifested as adverse impact and differential prediction. we provide recommendations to guide future human resource management research and practice.

schizophrenia	background: the human dopamine d2 receptor gene has three polymorphic variants that alter its amino acid sequence: alanine substitution by valine in position 96 (v96a), proline substitution by serine in position 310 (p310s) and serine substitution by cysteine in position 311 (s311c). their functional role has never been the object of extensive studies, even though there is some evidence that their occurrence correlates with schizophrenia. methods: the hek293 cell line was transfected with dopamine d1 and d2 receptors (or genetic variants of the d2 receptor), coupled to fluorescent proteins which allowed us to measure the extent of dimerization of these receptors, using a highly advanced biophysical approach (flim-fret). additionally, fluoro-4 am was used to examine changes in the level of calcium release after ligand stimulation of cells expressing different combinations of dopamine receptors. results: using flim-fret experiments we have shown that in hek 293 expressing dopamine receptors, polymorphic mutations in the d2 receptor play a role in dimmer formation with the dopamine d1 receptor. the association level of dopamine receptors is affected by ligand administration, with variable effects depending on polymorphic variant of the d2 dopamine receptor. we have found that the level of heteromer formation is reflected by calcium ion release after ligand stimulation and have observed variations of this effect dependent on the polymorphic variant and the ligand. conclusion: the data presented in this paper support the hypothesis on the role of calcium signaling regulated by the d1-d2 heteromer which may be of relevance for schizophrenia etiology.

person_perception	a wide array of social decisions relies on social comparisons. as such, these decisions require fast access to relative information. therefore, we expect that signatures of the comparative process should be observable in electrophysiological components at an early stage of information processing. however, to date, little is known about the neural time course of social target comparisons. therefore, we tested this hypothesis in 2 electroencephalography (eeg) studies using a social distance effect paradigm. the distance effect capitalizes on the fact that stimuli close on a certain dimension take longer to compare than stimuli clearly differing on this dimension. here, we manipulated the distance of face characteristics regarding their levels of attractiveness (study 1) and trustworthiness (study 2), 2 essential social dimensions. in both studies, size comparisons served as a nonsocial control condition. in study 1, distance related effects were apparent 170 ms (vertex positive potential, vpp) and 200 ms (n2) after stimulus onset for attractiveness comparisons. in study 2, trustworthiness comparisons took effect already after 100 ms (n1) and likewise carried over to an event-related n2. remarkably, we observed a similar temporal pattern for social (attractiveness, trustworthiness) and nonsocial (size) dimensions. these results speak in favor of an early encoding of comparative information and emphasize the primary role of comparison in social information processing.
borderline_personality_disorder	emotion reactivity and emotion regulation are salient constructs in theories of emotion and emotion disorders; however, little is known about the convergent and discriminant validity of instruments used to measure them. the current paper examines the validity of four emotion-regulation and three emotion reactivity instruments (with a total of 27 subscales) across three independent samples of university students (total n = 715). eight subscales from a coping instrument were also examined. confirmatory factor analysis failed to show the expected patterns of convergent and discriminant validity; however, exploratory factor analysis revealed three different factors, reflecting out-of-control negative emotion, emotion awareness and expression, and cognitive strategies for emotion regulation. results have implications for both basic emotions research and clinical science.

attention	the application of fibers is more and more extensive, and the pollution caused by abandoned fibers is getting more serious, which has aroused wide attention. so it is necessary to find a way to solve the problem. in this paper, the para-aramid fiber (af) was recycled and modified by phosphoric acid, and then was applied as environmental friendly flame retardant for thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (tpu). the flame retardant properties of tpu were tested using cone calorimeter test (cct) and thermogravimetric/fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (tg-ir). the cct test showed that af-p had better flame retardant effect on tpu than pure af. remarkably, the phrr value for the sample with 1.00 wt% content of af-p was decreased by 48.1%; af-p had improved the char forming progress and the residual mass was 30.6%, which was much more than pure tpu. tg test showed that af-p could improve the thermal stability of tpu at high temperature. the tg-ir test revealed that af-p had reduced the release of co2 at the beginning. based on the above results, it will make a great influence on the study of reuse of fibers and environmental friendly flame retardant of polymer.

child_abuse	child maltreatment and other adverse childhood experiences adversely influence population health and socioeconomic outcomes. knowledge of the risk factors for child maltreatment can be used to identify children at risk and may represent opportunities for prevention. we examined a range of possible child, parent and family risk factors for child maltreatment in a prospective 27-year population-based birth cohort of 2443 australians. physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and witnessing of domestic violence were recorded retrospectively in early adulthood. potential risk factors were collected prospectively during childhood or reported retrospectively. associations were estimated using bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions and combined into cumulative risk scores. higher levels of economic disadvantage, poor parental mental health and substance use, and social instability were strongly associated with increased risk of child maltreatment. indicators of child health displayed mixed associations and infant temperament was uncorrelated to maltreatment. some differences were observed across types of maltreatment but risk profiles were generally similar. in multivariate analyses, nine independent risk factors were identified, including some that are potentially modifiable: economic disadvantage and parental substance use problems. risk of maltreatment increased exponentially with the number of risk factors experienced, with prevalence of maltreatment in the highest risk groups exceeding 80%. a cumulative risk score based on the independent risk factors allowed identification of individuals at very high risk of maltreatment, while a score that incorporated all significant risk and protective factors provided better identification of low-risk individuals.

false_memories	the abstractness and modality of interpersonal communication have a considerable impact on comprehension. they are relevant for determining thoughts and constituting internal models of the environment. whereas concrete object-related information can be represented in mind irrespective of language, abstract concepts require a representation in speech. consequently, modality-independent processing of abstract information can be expected. here we investigated the neural correlates of abstractness (abstract vs. concrete) and modality (speech vs. gestures), to identify an abstractness-specific supramodal neural network. during fmri data acquisition 20 participants were presented with videos of an actor either speaking sentences with an abstract-social [as] or concrete-object-related content [cs], or performing meaningful abstract-social emblematic [ag] or concrete-object-related tool-use gestures [cg]. gestures were accompanied by a foreign language to increase the comparability between conditions and to frame the communication context of the gesture videos. participants performed a content judgment task referring to the person vs. object-relatedness of the utterances. the behavioral data suggest a comparable comprehension of contents communicated by speech or gesture. furthermore, we found common neural processing for abstract information independent of modality (as >cs boolean and ag >cg) in a left hemispheric network including the left inferior frontal gyrus (ifg), temporal pole, and medial frontal cortex. modality specific activations were found in bilateral occipital, parietal, and temporal as well as right in ferior frontal brain regions for gesture (g >s) and in left anterior temporal regions and the left angular gyrus for the processing of speech semantics (s >g). these data support the idea that abstract concepts are represented in a supramodal manner. consequently, gestures referring to abstract concepts are processed in a predominantly left hemispheric language related neural network.
eating_disorders	the current guidelines for treatment of anorexia nervosa (an) in children and adolescents recommend an integrated multidisciplinary approach as the elective intervention for this disorder. nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence on the results of an integrated approach for the treatment of an adolescent patients, especially in a hospital setting. this study aims to analyze clinical and psychological changes occurring in adolescent patients after completion of a day-hospital multifocal integrated treatment (mit) for anorexia nervosa. the sample consisted of 60 adolescents with an or eating disorder not otherwise specified (ednos) restrictive type, aged 11 to 18 years, and their parents. clinical course was evaluated at 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up periods. our results showed clinical remission in a good percentage of patients. in general, we found a significant reduction of the eating psychopathology, whereas we did not detect any significant improvement in body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, and relational difficulties. this positive trend was confirmed at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up, despite the increase of drop-outs. these results suggest that the proposed treatment is reasonably effective, because it aims to contain and reduce the acute phase of the disease in a limited time and in a hospital setting, but it is necessary to continue the treatment with targeted psychotherapeutic interventions to address the deeper psychological discomfort underlying the eating disorder.
media_violence	objectives: to assess desensitization in parents' repeated exposure to violence and sex in movies. methods: a national us sample of 1000 parents living with at least 1 target child in 1 of 3 age groups (6 to 17 years old) viewed a random sequence of 3 pairs of short scenes with either violent or sexual content from popular movies that were unrestricted to youth audiences (rated pg-13 or unrated) or restricted to those under age 17 years without adult supervision (rated r). parents indicated the minimum age they would consider appropriate to view each film. predictors included order of presentation, parent and child characteristics, and parent movie viewing history. results: as exposure to successive clips progressed, parents supported younger ages of appropriate exposure, starting at age 16.9 years (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.8 to 17.0) for violence and age 17.2 years (95% ci, 17.0 to 17.4) for sex, and declining to age 13.9 years (95% ci, 13.7 to 14.1) for violence and 14.0 years (95% ci, 13.7 to 14.3) for sex. parents also reported increasing willingness to allow their target child to view the movies as exposures progressed. desensitization was observed across parent and child characteristics, violence toward both human and non-human victims, and movie rating. those who frequently watched movies were more readily desensitized to violence. conclusions: parents become desensitized to both violence and sex in movies, which may contribute to the increasing acceptance of both types of content by both parents and the raters employed by the film industry.
social_cognition	autism spectrum disorders (asds) are known to be characterized by restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests and by impairments in social communication and interactions mainly including ""theory of mind"" (tom) processes. the cerebellum has emerged as one of the brain regions affected by asds. as the cerebellum is known to influence cerebral cortex activity via cerebello-thalamo-cortical (ctc) circuits, it has been proposed that cerebello-cortical ""disconnection"" could in part underlie autistic symptoms. we used resting-state (rs) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to investigate the potential rs connectivity changes between the cerebellar dentate nucleus (dn) and the ctc circuit targets, that may contribute to asd pathophysiology. when comparing asd patients to controls, we found decreased connectivity between the left dn and cerebral regions known to be components of the tom network and the default mode network, implicated in specific aspects of mentalizing, social cognition processing, and higher order emotional processes. further, a pattern of overconnectivity was also detected between the left dn and the supramodal cerebellar lobules associated with the default mode network. the presented rs-fmri data provide evidence that functional connectivity (fc) between the dentate nucleus and the cerebral cortex is altered in asd patients. this suggests that the dysfunction reported within the cerebral cortical network, typically related to social features of asds, may be at least partially related to an impaired interaction between cerebellum and key cortical social brain regions.
problem-solving	whereas past research has focused on the downsides of task switching, the present research uncovers a potential upside: increased creativity. in two experiments, we show that task switching can enhance two principal forms of creativity divergent thinking (study 1) and convergent thinking (study 2) in part because temporarily setting a task aside reduces cognitive fixation. participants who continually alternated back and forth between two creativity tasks outperformed both participants who switched between the tasks at their discretion and participants who attempted one task for the first half of the allotted time before switching to the other task for the second half. importantly, studies 3a-3d reveal that people overwhelmingly fail to adopt a continual-switch approach when incentivized to choose a task switching strategy that would maximize their creative performance. these findings provide insights into how individuals can ""switch on"" creativity when navigating multiple creative tasks.

borderline_personality_disorder	a number of studies have reported on dysfunctions in steroid secretion, including altered cortisol and testosterone levels in borderline personality disorder (bdp) patients compared to healthy controls. the present study extends findings from blood and saliva studies to the cumulative measure of hair steroids. we investigated women with bpd (n = 18) and age-and education-matched healthy women (n = 17). we did not find differences between bpd patients and healthy women (p = 0.40) concerning hair cortisol levels but increased hair testosterone levels among bpd patients compared to controls (p = 0.03). these results remained when restricting the analyses to unmedicated patients. our data indicate altered long-term testosterone but not cortisol levels in females with bpd. future studies should address the possible impact of altered testosterone on medical illness processes including metabolic syndrome in this population.

prejudice	women are still underrepresented in management and men hold the majority of higher positions. nonetheless, one often-heard claim in popular media is that female people-centered leadership skills (empathy, communication, etc.) are a better match for the business world - especially in the future. furthermore, a related idea is that women may use this advantage to take over men 's dominant position in leadership. four studies show that such claims paradoxically maintain gender inequality, by undermining support for affirmative action to reduce female underrepresentation in leadership. where earlier research shows that positive stereotypes can hurt women by suggesting that they are unqualified for leadership, the current findings show that even positive stereotypes that claim that women are particularly well qualified for leadership can hurt women in their chances for gaining leadership positions. although it is good to highlight the advantages of female leadership, exaggerated and sensationalist claims contribute to a perpetuation of gender inequality.
schizophrenia	objective: this review critically examines the structural neuroimaging evidence in psychotic illness, with a focus on longitudinal imaging across the first-episode psychosis and ultra-high-risk of psychosis illness stages. methods: a thorough search of the literature involving specifically longitudinal neuroimaging in early illness stages of psychosis was conducted. the evidence supporting abnormalities in brain morphology and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories is discussed in the context of a clinical staging model. results: in general, grey matter (and, to a lesser extent, white matter) declines across multiple frontal, temporal (especially superior regions), insular and parietal regions during the first episode of psychosis, which has a steeper trajectory than that of age-matched healthy counterparts. although the ultra-high-risk of psychosis literature is considerably mixed, evidence indicates that certain volumetric structural aberrations predate psychotic illness onset (e.g. prefrontal cortex thinning), while other abnormalities present in ultra-high-risk of psychosis populations are potentially non-psychosis-specific (e.g. hippocampal volume reductions). conclusion: we highlight the advantages of longitudinal designs, discuss the implications such studies have on clinical staging and provide directions for future research.
depression	background: the effects of therapeutic relationship (tr) in elder mental health are understudied. a greater understanding of tr in geriatric psychotherapy is particularly needed for treating late-life depression with executive dysfunction, which predicts poor response to antidepressant medication and presents unique clinical challenges. methods: participants were older patients (n = 220) with major depression and executive dysfunction who received 12 weeks of problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy in a randomized control trial. multilevel growth curve modeling and latent change scores were used to analyze tr dimensions of understanding and accepting at the patient level (individual patient ratings, n = 194) and therapist level (ratings of each therapist averaged across participants, n = 10). results: tr predicted reduction of depression in both treatment groups, while treatment x tr interactions were not significant. patients treated by therapists with higher average understanding (patient and therapist level) and accepting (therapist level) ratings had greater decreases in depression. the patient level x therapist level interaction for understanding approached statistical significance (p=.065), suggesting a synergistic effect on treatment outcome. together, understanding and accepting predicted 21% of variance in depression level changes. limitations: tr was not assessed throughout the course of treatment (only after the first therapy session and at post-treatment) and did not include ratings from an objective evaluator. conclusions: assessment of patient 's experience of the tr and of therapist ability to foster understanding and accepting can play a significant role in the delivery of geriatric psychosocial interventions.
problem-solving	approximately 50 % of hiv-1 seropositive individuals develop hiv-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (hand), which commonly include alterations in executive functions, such as inhibition, set shifting, and complex problem solving. executive function deficits in hiv-1 are fairly well characterized, however, relatively few studies have explored the elemental dimensions of neurocognitive impairment in hiv-1. deficits in temporal processing, caused by hiv-1, may underlie the symptoms of impairment in higher level cognitive processes. translational measures of temporal processing, including cross-modal prepulse inhibition (ppi), gap-prepulse inhibition (gap-ppi), and gap threshold detection, were studied in mature (ovariectomized) female hiv-1 transgenic (tg) rats, which express 7 of the 9 hiv-1 genes constitutively throughout development. cross-modal ppi revealed a relative insensitivity to the manipulation of interstimulus interval (isi) in hiv-1 tg animals in comparison to control animals, extending previously reported temporal processing deficits in hiv-1 tg rats to a more advanced age, suggesting the permanence of temporal processing deficits. in gap-ppi, hiv-1 tg animals exhibited a relative insensitivity to the manipulation of isi in comparison to control animals. in gap-threshold detection, hiv-1 tg animals displayed a profound differential sensitivity to the manipulation of gap duration. presence of the hiv-1 transgene was diagnosed with 91.1 % accuracy using gap threshold detection measures. understanding the generality and permanence of temporal processing deficits in the hiv-1 tg rat is vital to modeling neurocognitive deficits observed in hand and provides a key target for the development of a diagnostic screening tool.
attention	adhesively bonding fiber-reinforced polymer (frp) composites to reinforced concrete members is a simple and highly effective method to restore strength, increase loading capacities, and extend the service life of structures. with growing demand and wider applications of these strengthening systems, it is their durability that has recently received significant attention from the research community, largely in the form of laboratory testing of deteriorated frp-to-concrete joints. to develop generalized deterioration factors, a database of shear tests has been collected to quantitatively assess the change in bond characteristics across a number of environmental conditions. it has been identified that a major shortcoming of existing test data is that reporting of the full-range load-displacement behavior is very limited. to supplement existing data, an experimental study is devised to further assess the deterioration of carbon frp bonded systems under three aqueous conditions. the investigation consists of continually immersing specimens in water, a 5% salt solution, and, for the first time, a sulfuric acid solution of ph 4.0 to simulate the pooling of acid rain. results show that sulfuric acid attack is most detrimental to the durability of the bond. then, using a mechanics-based numerical model, bond properties are extracted from the present results as well those in published literature, to determine conservative deterioration factors for the change in bond characteristics with environmental exposure.

depression	objectiveestablish whether inflammatory biomarkersserum amyloid a (saa), c-reactive protein (crp), interleukin-6 (il-6), and tumor necrosis factor- (tnf-)are related to key symptoms of depression, including anxiety and fatigue, in a cross-sectional, out-patient setting to identify biomarkers that reflect psychiatric symptomatology in a naturalistic, real-life population. methodswe measured saa, crp, il-6, and tnf- in plasma samples from 89 adult psychiatric out-patients by multiplex, high-sensitivity electrochemiluminescent assays. psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the hamilton depression rating scale (hamd-17), the patient health questionnaire (phq-9), and the center for epidemiological studies depression scale (ces-d). resultsplasma saa was most robustly associated with depressive symptoms across diagnostic boundaries in this cohort of out-patients. elevated saa was significantly associated with higher total scores on the hamd-17 scale and correlated with multiple scale items that rated symptoms of fatigue and depressed mood, but not with anxiety-related items. conclusionssaa might constitute a cross-diagnostic marker indicative of depressed mood and fatigue in a naturalistic patient setting. because saa activates toll-like receptors 2 and 4, present on macrophages and glial cells, its association with depression severity could also implicate this inflammatory mediator in the pathogenesis of mood disorders.
attention	trees outside forests (tof) represent a source of lignocellulosic biomass that has received increasing attention in the recent years. while some studies have already investigated the potential of tof in germany, a spatial explicit analysis, specifically for baden-wuerttemberg, is still lacking. we used a unique wall-to-wall airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) dataset combined with openstreetmap (osm) data to map and classify tof of the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg (similar to 35.000 km(2)) in south-western germany. furthermore, from annual biomass potentials of tof areas collected from available literature, we calculated the mean annual biomass supply for all tof areas in baden-wuerttemberg. this combination of remote sensing-based classification and available literature resulted in a mean annual biomass supply between similar to 490,000-730,000 t from tof in baden-wuerttemberg. the classification congruence on three reference sites was very high (similar to 99%) using a simple filter technique applied to the lidar data and masking man-made objects using osm data. in contrast, the available literature revealed a high variability of biomass potentials, supporting the demand for an inventory system. still, the results demonstrate the applicability of lidar based vegetation mapping and the value of osm data in baden-wuerttemberg to detect man-made objects.

child_abuse	a three year old girl was observed to have bluish marks on her back, arms and legs. the social services initiated an examination on the local hospital, but no conclusion regarding the marks was reached. the girl was institutionalized before a forensic examination after three days concluded that the marks were mongolian spots. the case stresses the importance of being able to distinguish between mongolian spots and skin hematomas and the need for a genuine clinical forensic examination in cases where child abuse is suspected. a guide for distinguishing between mongolian spots and skin hematomas is presented.
child_abuse	background: childhood maltreatment is an important risk factor for mental and physical health problems. adolescents living in residential youth care (ryc) have experienced a high rate of childhood maltreatment and are a high-risk group for psychiatric disorders. quality of life (qol) is a subjective, multidimensional concept that goes beyond medical diagnoses. there is a lack of research regarding the associations between childhood maltreatment and qol. in the present study, we compare self-reported qol between adolescents in ryc in norway with and without maltreatment histories, and adolescents from the general population. we also study the impact of number of types of adversities on qol. methods: adolescents aged 12-23 years living in ryc in norway were invited to participate in the study; 400 participated, yielding a response rate of 67 %. maltreatment histories were assessed through interviews with trained research assistants, and completed by 335 adolescents. previous exposure to maltreatment was reported by 237 adolescents. the questionnaire for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (kindl-r) was used. nonexposed peers in ryc (n = 98) and a sample of adolescents from the general population (n = 1017) were used for comparison. general linear model analyses (ancova) were conducted with five kindl-r life domains as dependent variables. linear regression was used to study the effect of number of types of adversities. results: exposed adolescents in ryc reported poorer qol than peers in control groups. compared with nonexposed peers in ryc, the 95 % confidence intervals for mean score differences on the kindl-r subdomains (0-100 scale) were 1.9-11.4 (physical well-being), 2.2-11.1 (emotional well-being), -0.7-10.0 (self-esteem), and 1.8-10.9 (friends). compared with the general population sample, the 95 % confidence intervals for mean score differences were 9.7-17.6 (physical well-being), 7.9-15.3 (emotional well-being), 3.6-12.5 (self-esteem), and 5.3-12.8 (friends). number of types of adversities was associated with a poorer qol score on all subdomains (physical-and emotional well-being, self-esteem, friends, and school). conclusions: childhood maltreatment was associated with a poorer qol score. we suggest the use of qol and maltreatment measures for all children and adolescents in ryc.
prosocial_behavior	recent research on community involvement points to the importance of both agentic (advancing the self) and communal motives (serving others) as key predictors, though few studies have examined both simultaneously. at the same time, research has identified generativity, defined as concern for future generations as a legacy of the self, as particularly relevant for community involvement. moreover, generativity involves both agentic and communal motives, meaning that advancing personal goals and caring for others are integrated in this construct. therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how individual differences in attributes pertaining to self and to others-specifically, self-esteem, initiative, and empathy-related to both generativity and community involvement. a sample of adolescents (n = 160; 64% female, mage = 17) and a sample of young adults (n = 237; 84% female, mage = 20) completed a survey including measures of community involvement and generativity. generative concern fully mediated the associations between individual differences (self-esteem, initiative, and empathy) and community involvement, suggesting that the early generativity has a role in fostering capacities and contribution in youth. these developmental indicators pertaining to self and others link to actions that benefit the community through a desire to benefit future generations.
attention	through a series of long-term column experiments, the fate of three common pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (cbz), diclofenac, and indomethacin) and their major phase i metabolites in soil aquifer treatment (sat) were monitored. cbz concentration increased by a factor of two (from 37 to ca. 70 ng/l) regardless of the treatment conditions, and its metabolites, 10,11-dihydro-10hydroxycarbamazepine (approximately 500 ng/l after sat) and cbz-10,11-epoxide (12-42 ng/l after sat) were not effectively removed after sat. our results indicated that some metabolites of pharmaceuticals are present at much higher concentration than the original forms in the sat effluent, and that some metabolites are more persistent during sat with a relatively short retention time (i.e., 30 days). the study indicated that more attention should be paid to the formation and fate of metabolites in the water quality management of sat effluent.
prenatal_development	experimental studies have shown that anogenital distance (agd) at birth reflects androgen concentrations during prenatal development and predicts adult agd. in male rodents, shortened agd is associated with compromised reproductive function. the aim of this study was to examine associations between agd measures and semen quality in male partners of subfertile couples. all men were attending an infertility service and provided a semen sample and completed epidemiological questionnaires on lifestyle and general health. two variants of agd [from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (agdas) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (agdap)] were assessed in 91 men. semen parameters (semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm counts, motility, and morphology) were determined following who guidelines. associations between agd measures and semen quality were tested using multiple regression analyses controlling for appropriate covariates. significant positive associations between agdas measures and sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total sperm motile count were detected (p-values<0.05). this study represents the first analysis of agd in potential infertile european men showing an association between perineal length and semen parameters. however, it is still uncertain the utility to clinical practice, therefore further studies are warranted to confirm and extent these findings.
media_violence	traditionally, the public and professional debate about the inappropriateness of media violence for children focuses mainly on the negative effects of violence in entertainment programming. however, since the terrorist attacks on september 11th and the recent coverage of the war in iraq, the suitability of real-life news violence for children may be doubted more than ever. to draw attention to the potential harmful effects of violence presented in news programs, it is argued in the present article that health care professionals should advocate a broader conception of media violence than thus far has been used. on the basis of recent research, potential effects of violent news content, such as fear, aggression, and desensitization, are discussed and recommendations are provided on how to abate these outcomes.
attention	amino-functionalized metal-organic frameworks have attracted much attention because of their potential applications in many fields such as catalysis, adsorption and separation of co2, further modification. in this work, we report that amino-functionalized mil-101(cr) with a large bet surface area of 3262 m(2)/g has been successfully synthesized by the reduction of mil-101(cr)-no2 prepared under solvent-free conditions. additionally, it has been demonstrated that the obtained material with high surface area exhibited superior catalytic activity in henry reaction.

antisocial_personality_disorder	the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm 5) classification of antisocial personality disorder (aspd) describes individuals who engage in repetitive irresponsible, delinquent, and criminal behavior. the diagnosis is highly controversial, with many researchers and clinicians arguing that the category is too heterogeneous, overinclusive, and demonstrates considerable overlap with other disorders. this review focuses on recent studies that have improved our understanding of the characteristics of individuals who fit the aspd definition by exploring how subtypes differ and how comorbid conditions influence the presentation of aspd. in addition, we discuss research on the etiology of aspd that has identified genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to the development and persistence of antisocial behavior, and brain imaging research that has improved our understanding of the relationships between aspd and other psychopathology. finally, we discuss promising preliminary research on treatment for this disorder.
social_cognition	eyes have been shown to play a key role during human social interactions. however, to date, no comprehensive cross-discipline model has provided a framework that can account for uniquely human responses to eye cues. in this review, i present a framework that brings together work on the phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and neural bases of perceiving and responding to eyes. specifically, i argue for a two-process model: a first process that ensures privileged attention to information encoded in the eyes and is important for the detection of other minds and a second process that permits the decoding of information contained in the eyes concerning another person 's emotional and mental states. to some degree, these processes are unique to humans, emerge during different times in infant development, can be mapped onto distinct but interconnected brain regions, and likely serve critical functions in facilitating cooperative interactions in humans. i also present evidence to show that oxytocin is a key modulator of sensitive responding to eye cues. viewing eyes as windows into other minds can therefore be considered a hallmark feature of human social functioning deeply rooted in our biology.
prejudice	past research has shown that individuals low in prejudice think more carefully when information is from or about stigmatized individuals than non-stigmatized individuals. one explanation for this effect is that the heightened scrutiny stems from a motivation to guard against potential prejudice toward stigmatized others (i.e. ""watchdog motivation""). the present research tested a variation of the watchdog hypothesis based on the idea of implicit ambivalence. specifically, we argue that among individuals low in explicit (i.e., deliberative) prejudice, it is those who are also relatively high in implicit (i.e., automatic) prejudice who will do the most processing in prejudice relevant contexts. the implicit ambivalence framework also makes a novel prediction that individuals who are relatively high in explicit prejudice but low in implicit prejudice would also engage in enhanced information processing. as predicted, people with racial implicit-explicit attitude discrepancies, regardless of the direction of discrepancy, were found to engage in greater of scrutiny of a message about the hiring of black faculty (study 1), a message about a black job candidate (study 2), and even when the black concept was merely primed subliminally prior to reading a race-irrelevant message (study 3).

prosocial_behavior	based on quantitative analysis of a nationally representative sample of 1,589 self-reported eligible blood donors in the united states, this paper investigates how religion influences giving the gift of life. i find significant positive effects for both organizational and subjective dimensions of religion. the reasons these dimensions promote this generous act vary, however. religious service attendance works entirely through religious ties. these ties, in turn, influence various established channels of donation, including solicitation to donate, which not only has a direct effect on giving, but also indirect effects through moral norms and willingness to donate. in addition to its impact on these ties, religious group involvement encourages blood donation through exposure to messages about helping others. finally, the impact of religious salience operates through the belief that ""it is better to give than to receive"" as well as religious ties. the implications of these findings for both the literature on blood donation and the larger scholarship on religion and generosity are discussed.
schizophrenia	backgroundthere is controversial information on outcome of school age individuals who lose the diagnosis of autism and achieve optimal outcome (oo). the present study assessed the autism symptoms and other psychiatric disorders in a group of children with a past history of autism. methodsthe subjects consisted of 26 individuals who had lost the diagnosis of autism 2-8 years previously. clinical assessment was done with both parents and children. diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th edn; dsm-v) criteria were used for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (asd). in addition, childhood autism rating scale and social communication questionnaire (current version) were used. psychiatric disorders were assessed using the kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children present and lifetime version (k-sads-pl). resultsnone of the participants met the criteria for asd. ninety-two percent had a lifetime diagnosis and 81% had a present psychiatric disorder based on the k-sads. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, specific phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder were the most common disorders. conclusionsimproved status with regard to autism symptomatology is maintained over time, but these individuals are vulnerable to developing other psychiatric disorders. it is crucial to maintain psychiatric follow up of children who move off the autism spectrum.
nonverbal_communication	the purpose of the present study was to analyze mother-child collaborative play in children with autism spectrum disorders (asd) compared to children with down syndrome (ds) and typical developing children (td). children with asd are often described as having deficient play skills, particularly in the symbolic domain. caregivers' involvement in child play activities increases the structural complexity of playing in both typically developing children and children with disabilities. participants included 75 mothers and their children with asd (n = 25), with down syndrome (n = 25) and with typical development (n = 25). mother-child play sessions were analyzed using a coding system for exploratory and symbolic play. results indicated that children with asd showed more exploratory play compared to children in the other groups. no significant differences emerged between the three groups for child symbolic play or for mother play. these findings are discussed in relation to the debate about functional and symbolic play in children with asd and in relation to the importance of setting and age for play assessment.
prenatal_development	prenatal development and early childhood are critical periods for establishing the tissue-specific epigenome, and may have a profound impact on health and disease in later life. however, epigenomic profiles at birth and in early childhood remain largely unexplored. the focus of this report is to examine the individual variation and longitudinal pattern of genome-wide dna methylation levels from birth through the first two years of life in 105 black children (59 males and 46 females) enrolled at the boston medical center. we performed epigenomic mapping of cord blood at birth and venous blood samples from the same set of children within the first two years of life using illumina infinium humanmethylation27 beadchip. we observed a wide range of inter-individual variations in genome-wide methylation at each time point including lower levels at cpg islands, tss200, 5' utr and 1st exon locations, but significantly higher levels in cpg shores, shelves, tss1500, gene body and 3' utr. we identified cpg sites with significant intra-individual longitudinal changes in the first two years of life throughout the genome. specifically, we identified 159 cpg sites in males and 149 cpg sites in females with significant longitudinal changes defined by both statistical significance and magnitude of changes. these significant cpg sites appeared to be located within genes with important biological functions including immunity and inflammation. further studies are needed to replicate our findings, including analysis by specific cell types, and link those individual variations and longitudinal changes with specific health outcomes in early childhood and later life.
prejudice	racial stereotyping has been found to handicap african american and latino candidates in negative ways. it is less clear how racial stereotypes may change the fortunes of asian candidates. this paper explores the candidacies of asian americans with an experiment run through amazon mechanical turk as well as real-world evaluations of asian american candidates using the cooperative congressional elections study. in my experiments, i find that asian candidates do significantly better than white candidates across different biographical scenarios (conservative, liberal, and foreign). i find that, contrary to expectations, asian candidates are not significantly disadvantaged from being immigrant and foreign born. my experimental results mirror my observational results, which show that asian democrats are significantly advantaged even when compared with whites. these results indicate that asian candidates in america face a set of racial-political stereotypes that are unique to their racial subgroup.
antisocial_personality_disorder	objective: the study aimed to investigate the correlation between impulsiveness and the antisocial personality disorder among short-term prisoners. method: the impulsiveness was diagnosed by the barratt impulsiveness scale (bis). results: short-term prisoners with antisocial personality disorder scored significant higher marks on the bis total scale than those without any personality disorder. in detail, they scored higher marks on each subscale regarding attentional, motor and nonplanning impulsiveness. moderate and high effects were calculated. conclusion: it is to be considered to regard impulsivity as a conceptual component of antisociality.
prenatal_development	the pterygoid process undergoes ossification of both the cartilage and membrane. however, few studies have attempted to explore the sequential development of the pterygoid process. using histological examination, we performed morphological observations of the pterygoid process and surrounding tissue. icr mice at embryonic days 13.5-18.0 and postnatal day 0 were used for morphological observations of the pterygoid process. by embryonic day 14.5, a mesenchymal cell condensation forming the anlage of the future medial pterygoid process differentiated into osteoid-like tissue and cartilage. at embryonic days 15.5-16.5, cartilage cells were clearly evident in the medial pterygoid process. in the medial pterygoid process, a bone collar was evident and calcified bone tissue surrounded the cartilage. at this point, a mesenchymal cell condensation formed the anlage of the pterygoid hamulus. at embryonic days 17.0-18.0, the cartilages were located along the lower and posterior border of the medial pterygoid process. a metachromatically stained matrix first became detectable around cells located in the pterygoid hamulus. on the other hand, at embryonic day 13.5, a metachromatically stained matrix was already evident in the space between the flattened cells in the lateral pterygoid process. at embryonic day 17.0, a hypertrophic cell zone had clearly formed in the diaphysis. on the basis of our present investigation, the lateral pterygoid process can be classified as primary cartilage, whereas the medial pterygoid process can be classified as secondary cartilage. furthermore, it was found that the pterygoid hamulus is formed latest in the medial pterygoid process.
person_perception	medical education relies heavily on assessment formats that require raters to assess the competence and skills of learners. unfortunately, there are often inconsistencies and variability in the scores raters assign. to ensure the scores from these assessment tools have validity, it is important to understand the underlying cognitive processes that raters use when judging the abilities of their learners. the goal of this paper, therefore, is to contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive processes used by raters. representative findings from the social judgment and decision making, cognitive psychology, and educational measurement literature will be used to enlighten the underpinnings of these rater-based assessments. of particular interest is the impact judgments referred to as first impressions (or thin slices) have on rater-based assessments. these are judgments about people made very quickly and based on very little information. a narrative review will provide a synthesis of research in these three literatures (social judgment and decision making, educational psychology, and cognitive psychology) and will focus on the underlying cognitive processes, the accuracy and the impact of first impressions on rater-based assessments. the application of these findings to the types of rater-based assessments used in medical education will then be reviewed. gaps in understanding will be identified and suggested directions for future research studies will be discussed.
schizophrenia	introduction: drug development and repurposing are urgently needed for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (asd) and psychiatric comorbidity, which often presents as aggression and self-injury.areas covered: we review dopamine antagonists, including classical and atypical, as well as unconventional antipsychotics in asd. the older antipsychotic loxapine is discussed in terms of preliminary albeit limited evidence in asd. emerging promise of amitriptyline in asd is discussed, together with promising bdnf effects of loxapine and amitriptyline.expert opinion: in asd, pharmacotherapy and specifically dopamine antagonist drugs are often prescribed for challenging behaviors including aggression. the novel antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole have received most study in asd and are fda-approved for irritability in children with asd over age 5 years; individuals with asd are prone to weight gain, type ii diabetes and associated side effects. low dose loxapine has properties of classical and novel antipsychotics but importantly appears more weight neutral, and with promising use in adolescents and adults with asd. amitriptyline appears effective in asd for irritability, aggression, gastrointestinal problems, and insomnia, in children, adolescents and adults however our adult data on amitriptyline in asd is still in preparation for publication. both loxapine and amitriptyline may stimulate bdnf; further studies are warranted.
eating_disorders	the aim of the current study was to establish the prevalence of subthreshold body dysmorphic disorder (subthreshold-bdd) in a community sample of adolescents, and to compare disorder correlates in individuals with subthreshold-bdd to those with probable full-syndrome bdd (probable-boo) and those without bdd (non-bdd). self-report questionnaires assessing dsm-iv bm criteria, past mental health service use, and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders, were completed by 3149 australian high school students (mean age =14.6 years, 63.5% male). male participants also completed measures assessing quality of life, muscularity concerns, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems. the prevalence of subthreshold-bdd) was 3.4%, and probable-bdd was 1.7%. compared to the non-bdd group, subthreshold-bdd was associated with elevated symptoms of comorbid psychopathology and greater past mental health service use, and in male-only measures, with poorer quality of life and elevated muscularity concerns. subthreshold-bdd participants reported significantly lower mental health service use, and fewer symptoms of depression, eating disorders, and hyperactivity than probable-bdd participants, however, other comorbid symptoms did not differ significantly between these groups. these findings indicate that subthreshold-bdd is associated with substantial difficulties for adolescents in the general community. bdd screening should include subthreshold presentations, as these may be an important target for early intervention programs.
child_abuse	in high-conflict divorce cases, the emotional toll on the family unit is unquestionably destructive. while the physical and mental health of the children should be the primary focus, the emotional turmoil of a high-conflict divorce often moves the focus away from the children as parents struggle emotionally and financially. although the best interests of the children are always in the judicial purview, the repeated, lengthy, and hostile litigation process often associated with high-conflict dissolution has lasting effects on the physical and mental health of children, similar to those associated with physical abuse and neglect. child protective services (cps) must step in and protect the emotional well-being of children during high-conflict divorce cases.
schizophrenia	accessible summary what is known on the subject? recently, concerns have been raised about how well united kingdom national health service nurses care for their patients and their level of compassion. motivational interviewing (mi) is an established approach to helping people make positive behaviour changes, through directive, person-centred counselling within a collaborative relationship between clinician and recipient. based on evidence that mi may influence nursing practice positively, an investigation into the feasibility of training nurses on mental health inpatient rehabilitation wards (rehabilitation') in mi to improve patient experience was reported. what this paper adds to existing knowledge? this pilot study demonstrates that training rehabilitation nurses in mi is feasible and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that a larger study to examine efficacy is warranted, including a calculation of sample size required to draw robust statistical conclusions. nurses evaluated the training as highly relevant to their work. patients responded well to interviews and focus groups with support from experts-by-experience; they were generally fairly satisfied with the rehabilitation ward and slight improvements in their experience were found following mi training for nurses but not at 6-month follow-up. what are the implications for practice? rehabilitation nurses may face conflicting demands between ensuring patients with severe difficulties meet their basic needs and working with them to develop greater independence. qualitative findings question whether nurse-patient interactions are fully valued as nursing interventions in inpatient rehabilitation. learning mi might be a useful way of helping nurses think in detail about their interactions with patients and how to improve communications with their patients. the principles of mi should be incorporated into pre-registration training. abstract introduction there is limited research addressing the experiences of patients in inpatient rehabilitation (rehabilitation), who often spend long periods in hospital, and the nursing approaches utilized. aim based on evidence that motivational interviewing (mi) may improve nursing practice, this was a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of training rehabilitation nurses in mi and measuring patient experience. method nurses underwent training and supervision focusing on mi spirit. quantitative and qualitative measures were taken pretraining, 2months post-training and 8months post-training. expert-by-experience research assistants facilitated patients' participation in the study. results this study showed that training rehabilitation nurses in mi was feasible and relevant to their work. patients participated in interviews and focus groups with support and potential improvements that require further empirical investigation in patient experience were found following the mi training. discussion this pilot study establishes the feasibility of a larger study addressing efficacy. tentative qualitative findings question whether interactions between nurses and patients are valued in rehabilitation and support mi as a promising skill set for rehabilitation nurses. implications for practice bringing mi into inpatient rehabilitation provoked reflection on nursing practice. dilemmas for nurses about balancing safety with promoting autonomy and communicating constructively with patients emerged as important.
prenatal_development	the processes of flat bones growth, sutures formation and interdigitation in the human calvaria are controlled by a complex interaction between genetic, biochemical and environmental factors that regulate bone formation and resorption during prenatal development and infancy. despite previous experimental evidence accounting for the role of the main biochemical factors acting on these processes, the underlying mechanisms controlling them are still unknown. therefore, we propose a mathematical model of the processes of flat bone and suture formation, taking into account several biological events. first, we model the growth of the flat bones and the formation of sutures and fontanels as a reaction diffusion system between two proteins: tgf-beta 2 and tgf-beta 3. the former is expressed by osteoblasts and allows adjacent mesenchymal cells differentiation on the bone fronts of each flat bone. the latter is expressed by mesenchymal cells at the sutures and inhibits their differentiation into osteoblasts at the bone fronts. suture interdigitation is modelled using a system of reaction diffusion equations that develops spatio-temporal patterns of bone formation and resorption by means of two molecules (wnt and sclerostin) which control mesenchymal cells differentiation into osteoblasts at these sites. the results of the computer simulations predict flat bone growth from ossification centers, sutures and fontanels formation as well as bone formation and resorption events along the sutures, giving rise to interdigitated patterns. these stages were modelled and solved by the finite elements method. the simulation results agree with the morphological characteristics of calvarial bones and sutures throughout human prenatal development and infancy.

child_abuse	ross cheit 's book the witch-hunt narrative highlights the difficulties of prosecuting child sexual abuse. drawing examples from a single case, alex a., we examine the ways in which false acquittals of sexual abuse are likely to occur. first, prosecutors tend to question children in ways that undermine their productivity and credibility. second, prosecutors have difficulty in explaining to juries the dynamics of sexual abuse and disclosure, making children 's acquiescence to abuse and their failure to disclose when abuse first occurs incredible. third, attorneys undermine children 's credibility by pushing them to provide difficult to estimate temporal and numerical information. a post-script to the alex a. case illustrates the costs of wrongful acquittals.
problem-solving	recent global developments in awareness and concerns about environmental problems have led to reconsidering built environment approaches and construction techniques. one of the alternatives is the principle of low/zero-energy buildings. this study investigates the potentials of energy savings in an existing multi-story building in the mediterranean region in order to achieve net-zero energy as a solution to increasing fossil fuel prices. the colored building at the faculty of architecture, eastern mediterranean university, cyprus was chosen as a target of this study to be investigated and analyzed in order to know how energy efficiency strategies could be applied to the building to reduce annual energy consumption. since this research objective is to develop a strategy to achieve net-zero energy in existing buildings, case study and problem solving methodologies were applied in this research in order to evaluate the building design in a qualitative manner through observations, in addition to a quantitative method through an energy modeling simulation to achieve desirable results which address the problems. after optimizing the building energy performance, an alternative energy simulation was made of the building in order to make an energy comparison analysis, which leads to reliable conclusions. these methodologies and the strategies used in this research can be applied to similar buildings in order to achieve net-zero energy goals.
nonverbal_communication	purpose - previous research has demonstrated the importance of emotion recognition ability in negotiations and leadership, but scant research has investigated the role of emotion recognition ability in service contexts. the purpose of this paper is to propose and test a compensatory model in which service employees' emotion recognition ability helps enhance their job performance, particularly when employees score low on the agreeableness personality dimension or have low cognitive ability. design/methodology/approach - with a two-wave multisource dataset collected from a service center of a large retail bank, multiple regression analysis was used to test the moderating roles of agreeableness and cognitive ability on the relationship between service employees' emotion recognition ability and their performance. findings - service employees' emotion recognition ability helped enhance their job performance. however, the positive effect of emotion recognition ability on job performance was only statistically significant when employees' agreeableness or cognitive ability was low. practical implications - the findings have important implications for how service organizations select and recruit employees. in particular, service employees with low agreeableness or cognitive ability may still be able to perform well when possessing high emotion recognition ability. therefore, emotion recognition ability should be considered in the selection and recruitment process. originality/value - going beyond self-report measures of emotion recognition and using a performance measure from organizational records, this study is one of the first to examine how emotion recognition ability interacts with personality and cognitive ability in predicting service employees' effectiveness in a service organization.
child_abuse	background: suspected child physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect are not uncommon presentations. as part of the assessment of these cases, a forensic medical history may be taken. this forensic history is used not only to determine the steps necessary to address the child 's wellbeing but also to direct the forensic examination. currently, there is no clear consensus on whether or not a forensic medical history should consistently be considered an integral element within the paediatric forensic evaluation. this study examines the value derived by the medical practitioner taking a forensic medical history rather than relying on hearsay evidence when a child presents for an assessment. methods: a retrospective review of paediatric cases seen by the victorian forensic paediatric medical service (vfpms) between 2014 and 2015 was undertaken. 274 forensic case reports were reviewed and the data was entered into an excel spread sheet and analysed using chi squared tests within stata (r). results: with increasing age of the child, a forensic medical history is significantly more likely to be taken. additional information is made available to the medical practitioner what would otherwise have been provided if the medical practitioner relied only on the interview conducted by the police. discrepancies observed between the official third parties (police or child protection) report of what a child has said and what the child says to the medical practitioner decrease with age, as do discrepancies observed between the child 's version of events and a third party 's (eg. parents, caregivers, friends) version of events. conclusions: the study showed that by taking a forensic medical history from the child additional information can be obtained. further, that there is a value in the examining medical practitioner taking a forensic medical history from children in cases of child physical and sexual abuse and neglect.

child_abuse	background: child abuse is often unrecognized at out-of-hours primary care (ooh-pc) services. the aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of the screening instrument sputovamo-r2 for child abuse (checklist), followed by a structured approach (reporting code), at ooh-pc services. the reporting code with five steps should ensure consistent action in case of a suspicion. methods: all children attending one of the five participating ooh-pc services in the region of utrecht, the netherlands, in a year time, were included. the checklist is an obligatory field in the electronic patient file and was filled in for all children. in case of a positive checklist, the steps in the reporting code were followed. additionally, the case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary team to determine the probability of child abuse. results: the checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0.2 %) were positive. the multidisciplinary team diagnosed child abuse in 24 (22 %) of the 108 positive checklists, and no child abuse in 36 (33 %). emotional neglect was the most frequent type of abuse diagnosed. for all abused children, care was implemented according to the protocol. the most frequent care given was a referral to the hospital (n = 7) or contact with child 's own general practitioner (n = 6). conclusion: a checklist followed by a reporting code guarantees consistent actions and care for children with a suspicion of child abuse. the percentage of positive checklists is lower than expected. validity of the checklist should be assessed in a diagnostic study.
prejudice	in the field of psychology, the topic of everyday life as a specific subject of inquiry has been afforded little attention. indeed, everyday life has recently been analyzed mainly in psychological studies that examine people 's ways of behaving and thinking when they act in situations termed as mundane and ordinary. these studies are mainly carried out in two fields of social psychology which we refer to in general terms as social cognition and social representation theory. the aim of this paper is to examine how both these fields treat some of the features commonly attributed to everyday life. in particular, the features of familiarization, continuity and stability over time and automaticity are discussed in order to try to figure out meeting points between the two fields mentioned.
media_violence	recent studies in psychiatry reveal an acceptance of trauma through the media. traditionally restricted to immediate experience, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is now expanding to include mediated experience. how did this development come about? how does mediated trauma manifest itself? what are its consequences? this essay addresses these questions through three cases: (1) trauma film paradigm', an early 1960s research program that employed films to simulate traumatic effects; (2) the psychiatric study into the clinical effects of watching catastrophic events on television, culminating with the september 11 attacks; (3) reports on drone operators who exhibit ptsd symptoms after flying combat missions away from the war zone. the recognition of mediated trauma marks a qualitative change in the understanding of media effects, rendering the impact literal and the consequences clinical. what informs recent speculations about the possibility of trauma through media is a conceptual link between visual media and contemporary conceptions of trauma.
prenatal_development	congenital anomalies of the brain frequently correspond to cranial base anomalies, and a detailed description of morphology and individual variations in the developing cranial base is of clinical importance for diagnosing anomalies. development of the human cranial base has been studied using dissection, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. we here examined development of the normal human fetal cranial base using bone staining, which allows for direct observation of the ossification centers and precise three-dimensional measurements. we observed alizarin red s-stained sphenoids and basiocciputs of 22 normal formalin-fixed human fetuses with crown-rump lengths (crl) of 115-175 mm. we defined landmarks and measured sphenoids and basiocciputs using a fine caliper. growth patterns of these ossifying bones were obtained, and we found similarities and differences among the growth patterns. we also observed individual variations in the ossification patterns, in particular, single-or double-ossification center patterns for the basisphenoid. the orbitosphenoid and basisphenoid widths and ratios of the widths to the total cranial base width were significantly different between the two pattern groups, whereas the other measurements and their ratios to the total cranial base did not differ between the groups. we measured the cerebrum and pons in different sets of 22 human fetuses with crls of 105-186 mm and found close relationships with the development of corresponding parts of the cranial base. the results contribute to the quantitative and qualitative information about the growth patterns and variations during human fetal cranial base development.
person_perception	this study aimed to identify the cues upon which athletes rely when developing their expectations with regard to the competence of sports officials and to examine the sources of information, which are given priority in different kinds of sport (i.e. team, racquet and fighting sports). a questionnaire - the athlete perception of sports officials questionnaire (apso-q) - was developed in which athletes (n=472) were asked to indicate the influence of 32 cues on their impressions of sports officials. exploratory factor analysis (efa) yielded a four-factor model (i.e. static cues, psychological, communicational and performance cues). athletes mostly rely on psychological and personal communication attributes when evaluating officiating competence. moreover, team players perceived that static cues were more influential when forming their expectations of sports officials than racquet players and fighting contestants. such findings may have implications for athlete-official relationships and training of sports officials.
seasonal_affective_disorder	we investigated the cardio-autonomic and psychological effects of colored light cycling with the wavelength of ultradian rhythms. in two consecutive experiments, an explorative, longitudinal test followed by a randomized crossover design, 20 healthy subjects each were exposed to oscillating red, green and blue light. heart rate, heart rate variability (hrv) and subjective wellbeing were measured. significant effects of the oscillating color light exposure were observed for heart rate and cardio-autonomic control rhythms, derived from hrv (p <= .001). these effects on hrv were replicated in the second experiment in comparison to a similar white light exposure protocol (p <= .05). vigilance showed improvement over the two weeks (p <= .001) in the longitudinal study. external color light cycling at the wavelength of blood pressure oscillations appears to amplify the endogenous autonomic oscillations. this leads to an optimization of cardio-autonomic control; an effect that was reflected shortly after the onset of the light exposure sessions by the increase of heart rate variability. from the results, we conclude that it takes repeated light exposure session to foster the positive effects on the psychological aspects, as we observed an increase of subjectively perceived mood only in the longitudinal study, not for the crossover design study. the results of our study imply some possible health effects of a color light exposure that is adjusted to 10 s and 1 min oscillations of humans' ultradian rhythms. these novel results show possible applications of oscillating visual inputs to the activation of processes connected to physiological regulation.

attention	despite the sustained media attention surrounding internet trolling, academic studies investigating its occurrence are rare. this study aimed to provide a case study analysis of the behaviours and strategies of a group of alleged twitter trolls referred to as the anti-mccanns due to their continual abuse of kate and gerry mccann as well as those who support them and thus identify as pro-mccann. the way in which language was used to construct the anti-mccanns group identity, enhance in-group cohesion and facilitate out-group disassociation from the pro-mccann group was additionally explored, given that previous research has implicated group processes in the propagation of aggressive online conduct. a multi-method approach involving a combination of ethnographic observations and the collection of online commentary was employed. the data was then analysed using quantitative content analysis and discourse analysis, which indicated that language was utilised in a variety of ways by the anti-mccanns to construct a salient group identity and negatively stereotype and disassociate from the pro-mccann group. findings additionally revealed that several strategies were employed by the anti-mccann trolls to provoke and derogate members of the pro-mccann group, supporting previous findings which have linked trolling to both western media culture and the characteristics of anti-social personality disorder. the implications of these findings both theoretical and practical are discussed, alongside recommendations for future research.

child_abuse	we conducted an exploratory review of the current literature on child sexual abuse disclosure in everyday contexts. the aim of this study was to provide an overview of relevant publications on the process of child sexual abuse disclosure, in order to generate new directions for future research and clinical practice. the findings of the exploratory review show that disclosure is a relational process, which is renegotiated by each interaction and evolves over an extended period of time. the characteristics and reactions of the interaction partner appear to be as critical to this process as the behavior and words of children themselves. methodological limitations of the review and the publications are discussed, as well as directions for future research and implications for practice.
attention	generalized additive mixed models are introduced as an extension of the generalized linear mixed model which makes it possible to deal with temporal autocorrelational structure in experimental data. this autocorrelational structure is likely to be a consequence of learning, fatigue, or the ebb and flow of attention within an experiment (the 'human factor'). unlike molecules or plots of barley, subjects in psycholinguistic experiments are intelligent beings that depend for their survival on constant adaptation to their environment, including the environment of an experiment. three data sets illustrate that the human factor may interact with predictors of interest, both factorial and metric. we also show that, especially within the framework of the generalized additive model, in the nonlinear world, fitting maximally complex models that take every possible contingency into account is illadvised as a modeling strategy. alternative modeling strategies are discussed for both confirmatory and exploratory data analysis.

borderline_personality_disorder	early life stress in rodents is associated with increased amygdala volume in adulthood. in humans, the amygdala develops rapidly during the first two years of life. thus, disturbed care during this period may be particularly important to amygdala development. in the context of a 30-year longitudinal study of impoverished, highly stressed families, we assessed whether disorganization of the attachment relationship in infancy was related to amygdala volume in adulthood. amygdala volumes were assessed among 18 low-income young adults (8m/10f, 29.33 +/- 0.49 years) first observed in infancy (8.5 +/- 5.6 months) and followed longitudinally to age 29. in infancy (18.58 +/- 1.02 mos), both disorganized infant attachment behavior and disrupted maternal communication were assessed in the standard strange situation procedure (ssp). increased left amygdala volume in adulthood was associated with both maternal and infant components of disorganized attachment interactions at 18 months of age (overall r=0.679, p < 0.004). later stressors, including childhood maltreatment and attachment disturbance in adolescence, were not significantly related to left amygdala volume. left amygdala volume was further associated with dissociation and limbic irritability in adulthood. finally, left amygdala volume mediated the prediction from attachment disturbance in infancy to limbic irritability in adulthood. results point to the likely importance of quality of early care for amygdala development in human children as well as in rodents. the long-term prediction found here suggests that the first two years of life may be an early sensitive period for amygdala development during which clinical intervention could have particularly important consequences for later child outcomes.

attention	holographic algorithms, alternatively known as pfaffian circuits, have received much attention for giving polynomial-time algorithms to a subset of problems in #p. much work has been done determining the power of this machinery. one intriguing aspect is that these circuits must be planar. we investigate relaxations of this planarity condition. we show that an approach using orbit closures does not work, but give a different technique that allows one swap gate to be used in a pfaffian circuit given suitable bases and restricted types of graphs. this is done by exploiting the fact that pfaffian gates lie in a hyperplane.

attention	social networking sites (sns) are a popular internet-based technology that enable users to communicate and interact with each other. sns have attracted a great deal of scholarly attention and have been used as an educational tool in recent years. however, there has been little research examining motivations and obstacles to teaching with sns in higher education. therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate why faculty members in higher education prefer to use or not to use sns for educational purposes. to this end, faculty members' current sns usage, their purposes for using sns, and the opinions of faculty members about their uses of sns for education were investigated. a mixed method approach was utilized to collect data from a total of 658 faculty members from eight different state universities in turkey. the findings show that nearly half of the faculty members who possessed an sns account reported that they use sns for educational purposes. their greatest motivating factor to use sns is that sns provide a means for fast and effective communication. the main factor which impeded sns usage by faculty members is their concerns about privacy.

depression	objective: our objective was to determine whether a score of >11 on the edinburgh postnatal depression scale (epds) at the initial prenatal visit was associated with an increased use of acute medical visits when compared to pregnant women with an initial epds score of 11.methods: this was a retrospective cohort study comparing the utilization of acute medical care during pregnancy and the first eight weeks after delivery amongst 200 women with an epds score >11 at their initial prenatal visit compared with 200 women with an epds score 11. super-utilization was defined as 4 acute or unscheduled medical visits during pregnancy and the first eight weeks after delivery (90th percentile). logistic regression was used to control for confounders.results: women with an initial epds score >11 were significantly more likely to engage in super-utilization of acute medical care compared with those women scoring 11 (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.53-3.90).conclusions: pregnant women scoring >11 on the epds at their initial prenatal visit are more likely to super-utilize acute medical care in the perinatal period. this subset of patients at-risk for increased utilization can be identified early during prenatal care. interventions to better meet the medical and psychosocial needs of these women warrant future research.
media_violence	the issue of potential media effects on psychological health of youth and young adults has been debated for decades. research on media effects has not always been consistent. one issue that has been raised regards whether the relatively modest media effects found in some research might be explained through mediating personality variables. this hypothesis was examined in three samples of young adults: mexican-americans (n = 232), croatians (n = 455) and english (n = 150). results indicated that trait aggression was a consistent predictor of both violent crimes and depression across samples. general personality variables were less consistent predictors of violence. although neuroticism consistently predicted depression across samples. media violence exposure did not predict negative outcomes except among croatians for whom exposure to violent video games predicted fewer violent crimes, and exposure to television violence predicted increased violent crimes.

attention	three-dimensional (3d) carbon materials derived from waste biomass have been attracted increasing attention in catalysis and materials science because of their great potential of catalyst supports with respect to multi-functionality, unique structures, high surface area, and low cost. here, we present a facile and efficient way for preparing 3d heterogeneous catalysts based on vertical mno2 wires deposited on hemp-derived 3d porous carbon. the 3d porous carbon materials are fabricated by carbonization and activation processes using hemp (cannabis sttiva l). these 3d porous carbon materials are employed as catalyst supports for direct deposition of vertical mno2 wires using a one-step hydrothermal method. the xrd and xps results reveal the crystalline structure of alpha-mno2 wires. the resultant composites are further employed as a catalyst for glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (pet) with high conversion yield of 98%, which is expected to be expressly profitable for plastics recycling industry.

seasonal_affective_disorder	objective: the goals of the meta-analysis were to investigate the overall effectiveness of cognitive behavioral group therapy (cbgt) for depression and relapse prevention in depression from 2000 to 2010, and to investigate how the variables (episode, residual symptoms, group size, control group, group manual, therapist experience, therapy frequency, session length, and take-home assignment) of a cbgt study could affect the effect size. method: this study collected actual study designs sought of cbgt for depression published from 2000 to 2010. these studies were then cross-referenced using medical subject headings (mesh) with the following keywords: group therapy, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral group therapy, psychotherapy, depression, relapse, and recurrence. the quality of the studies was evaluated using cochrane collaboration guidelines. the effect size of cbgt on depression and relapse prevention in depression used the formula devised by hedges and olkin (1985). results: the study investigated the results of 32 studies on the effect of cbgt for depression. the cbgt had an immediate (g = -0.40) and continuous effect over 6 months (g = -0.38), but no continuous effect after 6 months (g = -0.06). the cbgt lowered the relapse rate of depression (rd = 0.16). variables significantly different from each other in terms of immediate effect were: cbgt versus usual care, therapy sessions lasting longer than 1 hour, and take-home assignments. preintervention severity of depression and patient turnover rate were found to be significantly related to the size of the immediate effect. the relapse rate after 6 months was significantly related only to ""participants have no residual symptoms/participants did not mention residual symptoms."" conclusions: researchers and clinicians should take note that cbgt had a moderate effect on the level of depression and a small effect on the relapse rate of depression. the results of this study suggest that the patient should receive a course of therapy at least every 6 months.
prosocial_behavior	people regularly take prosocial actions, making individual sacrifices for the greater good. similarly, people generally avoid causing harm to others. these twin desires to do good and avoid harm often align, but sometimes they can diverge, creating situations of moral conflict. here, we examined this moral conflict using a modified dictator game. participants chose how much money to allocate away from a recipient who was designated as an orphan, creating a sense of harm. this money was then reallocated to either the participant or a charity. people were strongly prosocial: they allocated more money away from the orphan for charity than for themselves. furthermore, people left more money with the orphan when the harm was framed as a means (taking) than as a side effect (splitting). as is predicted by dual-process theories of moral decision making, response times were longer with the take action and were positively correlated with the amount taken from the orphan. we concluded that just as people take positive actions for the greater good, they are similarly more willing to cause harm when it benefits others rather than themselves.
child_abuse	aim: the aim of this study was to determine nigerian parents' views about the causes and treatment of childhood enuresis. methods: parents of children aged 5-17 years were individually interviewed in an urban community in nigeria using a pretested questionnaire. their responses about the causes and treatment of enuresis were grouped under common themes. results: we included 448 respondents in the study: 75.5% were mothers, 44.2% had at least one child with enuresis and only 1.3% had spoken to a doctor about it. enuresis was thought to be due to playing too much and drinking too much fluid at night by 69.7% and 21.2% of the respondents, respectively. the two most common treatment methods that parents were aware of for enuresis were waking to void (23.7%) and urinating on hot charcoal (20.8%). the most common methods that parents actually employed included waking to void (49.0%), punishing the child (36.9%) and doing nothing (28.8%). conclusion: most of the respondents believed that playing too much and drinking or eating too much were responsible for childhood enuresis. parents rarely discussed childhood enuresis with their doctors and some of the self-help measures that were employed may be harmful and could constitute child abuse.
social_cognition	the concepts expressed by social role terms such as artist and scientist are unique in that they seem to allow two independent criteria for categorization, one of which is inherently normative (knobe, prasada, & newman, 2013). this study presents and tests an account of the content and structure of the normative dimension of these dual character concepts. experiment 1 suggests that the normative dimension of a social role concept represents the commitment to fulfill the idealized basic function associated with the role. background information can affect which basic function is associated with each social role. however, experiment 2 indicates that the normative dimension always represents the relevant commitment as an end in itself. we argue that social role concepts represent the commitments to basic functions because that information is crucial to predict the future social roles and role-dependent behavior of others.
gender_roles	purpose - there are assumptions in gender-related media research that increased female status would be accompanied by more and better representation of women. there are also expectations that an increase in the number of women working in the news media will increase the positive representation of women. the aim of this paper is to critique the representation of women leaders and managers in the nigerian press to assess the extent to which these factors have influenced the representation of women in the west african country. design/methodology/approach - using two methods, qualitative content analysis and interview, this chapter critiques the representation of women leaders and managers in nigerian guardian life and vanguard allure (over a period of six months - the last half of 2014) to determine the way women in leadership and management are constructed by checking for frames on stereotypes, gender roles and trivialisation themes. the editors of the two publications are then interviewed to consider the philosophies behind the coverage patterns and assess their knowledge and awareness of the implications of the coverage patterns on the status of women in the sub-saharan african country. findings - it was discovered that the nigerian press are focusing on re-enforcing traditional gender roles and norms rather than challenging them, and women in leadership and management in the country do not apply sufficient agency in challenging the status quo. research limitations/implications - even though information derived from this study cannot be said to represent the realities in all of africa, it surely provides a good context within which issues about media representation of women in leadership and management in africa can be better understood to assess how the cultures on the continent 's various countries affect the realities of the lives of women. originality/value - the bulk of feminist research is situated in the north. not much feminist research is being done in the south, and there appears to be an inadequate engagement with the available few in the literature. this chapter bridges the gap by presenting much needed information about gender, media and organisation in nigeria; a highly populous multi-ethnic and multi-cultural sub-saharan african country. even though information derived from this study cannot be said to represent the realities in all of africa, it will surely provide a good context within which issues about media, gender and organisation in africa can be better appreciated.
media_violence	video games have become one of the favorite activities of american children. a growing body of research is linking violent video game play to aggressive cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors. the first goal of this study was to document the video games habits of adolescents and the level of parental monitoring of adolescent video game use. the second goal was to examine associations among violent video game exposure, hostility, arguments with teachers, school grades, and physical fights. in addition, path analyses were conducted to test mediational pathways from video game habits to outcomes. six hundred and seven 8th- and 9th-grade students from four schools participated. adolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile, reported getting into arguments with teachers more frequently, were more likely to be involved in physical fights, and performed more poorly in school. mediational pathways were found such that hostility mediated the relationship between violent video game exposure and outcomes. results are interpreted within and support the framework of the general aggression model.

seasonal_affective_disorder	background: depressed individuals often exhibit impaired inhibition to negative input and identification of positive stimuli, but it is unclear whether this is a state or trait feature. we here exploited a naturalistic model, namely individuals with seasonal affective disorder (sad), to study this feature longitudinally. aim: the goal of this study was to examine seasonal changes in inhibitory control and identification of emotional faces in individuals with sad. method: twenty-nine individuals diagnosed with winter-sad and 30 demographically matched controls with no seasonality symptoms completed an emotional go/nogo task, requiring inhibition of prepotent responses to emotional facial expressions and an emotional face identification task twice, in winter and summer. results: in winter, individuals with sad showed impaired ability to inhibit responses to angry (p = .0006) and sad faces (p = .011), and decreased identification of happy faces (p = .032) compared with controls. in summer, individuals with sad and controls performed similarly on these tasks (ps >.24). conclusion: we provide novel evidence that inhibition of angry and sad faces and identification of happy faces are impaired in sad in the symptomatic phase, but not in the remitted phase. the affective biases in cognitive processing constitute state-dependent features of sad. our data show that reinstatement of a normal affective cognition should be possible and would constitute a major goal in psychiatric treatment to improve the quality of life for these patients.
prejudice	background: despite global efforts, hiv-related stigma continues to negatively impact the health and well-being of people living with hiv/aids. even in healthcare settings, people with hiv/aids experience discrimination. anecdotal evidence suggests that healthcare professionals in the lao people 's democratic republic, a lower-middle income country situated in southeast asia, stigmatize hiv/aid patients. the purpose of this study was to assess hiv stigmatizing attitudes within laotian healthcare service providers and examine some of the factors associated with hiv/aids-related stigma among doctors and nurses. methods: a structured questionnaire, which included a hiv-related stigma scale consisting of 17 items, was self-completed by 558 healthcare workers from 12 of the 17 hospitals in vientiane. five hospitals were excluded because they had less than 10 staff and these staff were not always present. the questionnaire was pre-tested with 40 healthcare workers. descriptive statistical analysis was performed and comparisons between groups undertaken using chi-square test and t-test. bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to examine the associations between stigmatizing attitudes and independent variables. results: out of the 558 participating healthcare workers, 277 (49.7%) were doctors and 281 (50.3%) were nurses. nearly 50% of doctors and nurses included in the study had high levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with hiv/aids. across the different health professionals included in this study, lower levels of hiv/aids knowledge were associated with higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with hiv/aids. stigmatizing attitudes, including discrimination at work, fear of aids, and prejudice, were lower in healthcare workers with more experience in treating hiv/aids patients. conclusions: this study is the first to report on hiv/aids-related stigmatization among healthcare workers in lao pdr. stigmatizing attitudes contribute to missed opportunities for prevention, education and treatment, undermining efforts to manage and prevent hiv. reversing stigmatizing attitudes and practices requires interventions that address affective, cognitive and behavioral aspects of stigma. alongside this, health professionals need to be enabled to enact universal precautions and prevent occupational transmission of hiv.
seasonal_affective_disorder	the confinement of critically ill patients in intensive care units (icu) imposes environmental constancy throughout both day and night (continuous light, noise, caring activities medications, etc.), which has a negative impact on human health by inducing a new syndrome known as circadian misalignment, circadian disruption or chronodisruption (cd). this syndrome contributes to poor sleep quality and delirium, and may impair septic states frequently observed in critically ill patients. however, and although the bidirectional crosstalk between cd with sleep impairment, delirium and inflammation in animal models has been known for years and has been suspected in icu patients, few changes have been introduced in the environment and management of icu patients to improve their circadian rhythmicity. delirium, the most serious condition because it has a severe effect on prognosis and increases mortality, as well as sleep impairment and sepsis, all three of them linked to disorganization of the circadian system in critically ill patients, will be revised considering the functional organization of the circadian system, the main input and output signals that synchronize the clock, including a brief description of the molecular circadian clock machinery, the non-visual effects of light, and the icu light environment. finally, the potential usefulness of increased light/dark contrast and melatonin treatment in this context will be analyzed, including some practical countermeasures to minimize circadian disruption and improve circadian system chronoenhancement, helping to make these units optimal healing environments for patients.
child_abuse	the experience of maltreatment during childhood is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in adulthood. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this pro-inflammatory phenotype remain unclear. mitochondria were recently found to principally coordinate inflammatory processes via both inflammasome activation and inflammasome-independent pathways. to this end, we hypothesized that alterations in immune cell mitochondrial functioning and oxidative stress might be at the interface between the association of maltreatment experiences during childhood and inflammation. we analyzed pro-inflammatory biomarkers (levels of c-reactive protein, cytokine secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in vitro, pbmc composition, lysophosphatidylcholine levels), serum oxidative stress levels (arginine:citrulline ratio, l-carnitine and acetylcarnitine levels) and mitochondrial functioning (respiratory activity and density of mitochondria in pbmc) in peripheral blood samples collected from 30 women (aged 22-44 years) with varying degrees of maltreatment experiences in form of abuse and neglect during childhood. exposure to maltreatment during childhood was associated with an increased ros production, higher levels of oxidative stress and an increased mitochondria! activity in a dose-response relationship. moreover, the increase in mitochondrial activity and ros production were positively associated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc. decreased serum levels of lysophosphatidylcholines suggested higher inflammasome activation with increasing severity of child maltreatment experiences. together these findings offer preliminary evidence for the association of alterations in immune cell mitochondrial functioning, oxidative stress and the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in individuals with a history of maltreatment during childhood. the results emphasize that the early prevention of child abuse and neglect warrants more attention, as the experience of maltreatment during childhood might have life-long consequences for physical health.

prosocial_behavior	this meta-analysis examined the relationship between moral identity and moral behavior. it was based on 111 studies from a broad range of academic fields including business, developmental psychology and education, marketing, sociology, and sport sciences. moral identity was found to be significantly associated with moral behavior (random effects model, r = .22, p < .01, 95% ci [.19, .25]). effect sizes did not differ for behavioral outcomes (prosocial behavior, avoidance of antisocial behavior, ethical behavior). studies that were entirely based on self-reports yielded larger effect sizes. in contrast, the smallest effect was found for studies that were based on implicit measures or used priming techniques to elicit moral identity. moreover, a marginally significant effect of culture indicated that studies conducted in collectivistic cultures yielded lower effect sizes than studies from individualistic cultures. overall, the meta-analysis provides support for the notion that moral identity strengthens individuals' readiness to engage in prosocial and ethical behavior as well as to abstain from antisocial behavior. however, moral identity fares no better as a predictor of moral action than other psychological constructs.
prosocial_behavior	the objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the measurement structure of the perceived empathic and social self-efficacy scale amongst 194 individuals with serious mental illness (smi) and (2) to establish construct validity for the perceived empathic and social self-efficacy scale. confirmatory factor analysis yielded a two-factor measurement structure of the perceived empathic and social self-efficacy scale, which was positively associated with insight, social support, and life satisfaction. the perceived empathic and social self-efficacy scale is a useful measure to assess social skills amongst individuals with smi in rehabilitation counselling.
person_perception	it might seem a reasonable assumption that when we are not actively using our faces to express ourselves (i.e., when we display nonexpressive, or neutral faces), those around us will not be able to read our emotions. herein, using a variety of expression-related ratings, we examined whether age-related changes in the face can accurately reveal one 's innermost affective dispositions. in each study, we found that expressive ratings of neutral facial displays predicted self-reported positive/negative dispositional affect, but only for elderly women, and only for positive affect. these findings meaningfully replicate and extend earlier work examining age related emotion cues in the face of elderly women (malatesta et al., 1987a). we discuss these findings in light of evidence that women are expected to, and do, smile more than men, and that the quality of their smiles predicts their life satisfaction. although ratings of old male faces did not significantly predict self-reported affective dispositions, the trend was similar to that found for old female faces. a plausible explanation for this gender difference is that in the process of attenuating emotional expressions over their lifetimes, old men reveal less evidence of their total emotional experiences in their faces than do old women.
media_violence	in an effort to minimize the harmful effects of violent tv, a yearlong intervention was undertaken with children in grades 1 through 3 (n = 177). the classroom-based intervention consisted of 31 brief lessons that emphasized the many ways in which television distorts violence. as hypothesized, the intervention resulted in a reduction in children 's viewing of violent tv as well as in less identification with violent tv characters. while the intervention was more successful with girls, boys receiving the intervention were judged by their classmates to, have reduced their behavioral aggression following the intervention. the importance of this research project is that it provides encouraging evidence that tv literacy programs can reduce some harmful effects of violent tv on young viewers.

prenatal_development	epigenetic events establish a particular gene expression signature for each cell type during differentiation and fertilization. disruption of these epigenetic programs in response to environmental stimuli during prenatal exposure dysregulates the fetal epigenome, potentially impacting susceptibility to disease later in life (the fetal basis of adult disease). maternal dietary modifications during gestation and lactation play a pivotal role in the period of fetal (re)programming. recently, many studies have demonstrated the impact of maternal nutrition on the fetal epigenome. this review discusses the complex interplay among various environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms that have been found to affect offspring in human and animal models. further, it summarizes the impact of various dietary phytochemicals capable of modulating the epigenome with regard to diverse human cancers and childhood cancer, specifically those with potential environmental etiology through maternal consumption during pregnancy and lactation. other dietary agents that are still untested as to their effectiveness in transplacental studies are also discussed. the recent developments discussed herein enhance current understanding of how chemopreventive agents act and their potential to impact the prenatal epigenome; they may also aid efforts to identify dietary interventions that can be beneficial in treating and preventing disease.
eating_disorders	introduction: given that youth with chronic pain frequently experience disruptions in eating patterns that may place them at risk for disordered eating, the purpose of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and illness course of adolescents with chronic pain and comorbid eating disorders. methods: using a retrospective chart review, 34 adolescents with chronic pain and concurrent eating disorders were identified. these adolescents were compared with 34 age-, gender-, and eating disorder symptom-matched adolescents who had an eating disorder without chronic pain. results: the majority of adolescents with chronic pain and an eating disorder had a primary medical diagnosis of abdominal pain (n = 14), followed by autonomic dysfunction n = 10) and headache (n = 6). although in 41.2% of teens with chronic pain, eating disorder symptoms developed after the onset of their pain, 35.3% reported having eating disorder symptoms before they experienced chronic pain. body mass index did not differ between the groups, but the duration of eating disorder symptoms was significantly longer for the chronic pain group (p < .001). discussion: despite comparable severity, eating disorders are undetected for longer periods in patients with chronic pain, which may contribute to a poorer prognosis. implications for eating disorder conceptualization, detection, and treatment are discussed.
social_cognition	schizophrenia patients have impaired performance and abnormal brain activation during facial emotion recognition, which may represent a marker of genetic liability to schizophrenia. however, it remains unclear whether the impairment is specific to recognizing emotion from faces or is instead attributable to more generalized dysfunction. the current study aimed to distinguish between specific and generalized neural dysfunction underlying impaired facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and examine associations with genetic liability. twenty-eight schizophrenia patients, 27 nonpsychotic first-degree relatives, and 27 community controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while making judgments about either the emotion or age of emotional faces. patients had performance deficits during the emotion and age discrimination conditions compared to relatives and controls, while relatives had intact performance. patients had hypoactivation compared to controls across conditions, mainly in medial prefrontal cortex. unlike controls, patients demonstrated a failure to recruit the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in social cognition and decision-making, and relatives had a pattern of recruitment intermediate between patients and controls. compared to controls, relatives had greater deactivation of regions associated with the default mode network, and patients had similar findings during age discrimination. the common patterns of performance deficits and activation abnormalities during emotion and age discrimination in schizophrenia suggest that generalized cognitive impairment, notably in social cognition and decision-making, contributes to impaired facial emotion recognition. similar functional activation patterns in relatives, despite intact performance, suggest that brain activation may represent a more sensitive marker of genetic liability than behaviour. hyperdeactivation of default mode network regions in relatives may represent cognitive inefficiency, or compensatory mechanisms that help maintain intact performance.
gender_roles	adolescent girls and boys use online networking sites differently, and girls have a higher risk of being harmed by non-adaptive use. the aim of the study was to assess the extent to which adolescents portray themselves according to gender stereotypes on their facebook profiles. participants were 623 facebook users of both sexes who responded to the bem sex role inventory (bsri) and the personal well-being index (pwi). in the first step, the adolescents responded to the bsri with respect to how they view a typical adult in terms of gender stereotypes. in the second step, half of them responded to the bsri with respect to how they view themselves and the other half responded with respect to their self-presentation on facebook. the results show that adolescents consider themselves to be less sexually differentiated than a typical adult of their own sex, both in their self-perception and their self-portrayal on facebook. the study confirms that the psychological well-being of girls decreases considerably with age and that it is associated with a greater degree of masculinity. we conclude that adolescents produce accurate self-representations on their facebook profiles, and both boys and girls tend to offer a less sexually differentiated self-concept and self-portrayal than that of the typical adult, with a slight preference for masculine traits; moreover, masculinity is associated with a greater degree of psychological well-being.
prosocial_behavior	objectives: research on the role of sport as a context for the acculturation of young migrants has mainly focused on migrant populations. considering that acculturation is a two-way process involving both the migrant and the host populations, research investigating the perspective of the hosts will enhance our understanding of the acculturation process. the purpose of the present study was to explore acculturation attitudes and perceptions of adolescents from the host population as a function of sport participation. furthermore, for those adolescents participating in sport, the role of the sport motivational climate and its relation to acculturation attitudes was investigated. design and method: a cross-sectional quantitative design was adopted. participants were 626 (316 girls) greek, high school students (13.88 +/- 1.01 years of age). among them, 271 (92 girls) were athletes competing in individual and team sports. while all participants completed measures of acculturation attitudes, the athletes additionally completed measures of motivational climate, basic need satisfaction, and controlling coaching behavior. results: athletes scored higher than non-athletes on attitudes towards multicultural contact. analysis of structural models revealed that a motivational climate characterized by a mastery climate, supportive of the needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, was positively linked to attitudes favoring migrants' maintenance of their culture and development of interaction with the host culture, whereas a motivational climate characterized by a performance climate and controlling coaching behavior was negatively linked to such attitudes. conclusion: these findings provide useful insights concerning the perspectives of the host population regarding migrants' acculturation and the role motivational climate play in promoting integration.

prejudice	taiwan is not only inhabited by ethnic chinese, as many who are not so familiar with this island might think; it also has a substantial number of aboriginal peoples who have lived on the island for millennia, long before the chinese, europeans and finally the japanese colonisers arrived. the aboriginal peoples of taiwan are austronesian, with linguistic and genetic ties to ethnic groups found in the pacific nations of the philippines, malaysia, indonesia, new zealand, the islands of oceania, and also on madagascar in the indian ocean. this article looks at some of the challenges faced by this indigenous population, due in large part to the ethnic or racial prejudice of the taiwanese which was reinforced by the national government. it also examines recent curriculum reforms and the educational discourses that reject racism and affirm the ideals of ethnic and cultural freedom and equality, thereby exemplifying moral education in the truest sense.
schizophrenia	our systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies indicated that the use of antipsychotics was associated with a nearly 1.5-fold increase in the risk of fracture. first-generation antipsychotics (fgas) appeared to carry a higher risk of fracture than second-generation antipsychotics (sgas). the risk of fractures associated with the use of antipsychotic medications has inconsistent evidence between different drug classes. a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate whether there is an association between the use of antipsychotic drugs and fractures. searches were conducted through the pubmed and embase databases to identify observational studies that had reported a quantitative estimate of the association between use of antipsychotics and fractures. the summary risk was derived from random effects meta-analysis. the search yielded 19 observational studies (n = 544,811 participants) with 80,835 fracture cases. compared with nonuse, use of fgas was associated with a significantly higher risk for hip fractures (or 1.67, 95% ci, 1.45-1.93), and use of second generation antipsychotics (sgas) was associated with an attenuated but still significant risk for hip fractures (or 1.33, 95% ci, 1.11-1.58). the risk of fractures associated with individual classes of antipsychotic users was heterogeneous, and odds ratios ranged from 1.24 to 2.01. chlorpromazine was associated with the highest risk (or 2.01, 95% ci 1.43-2.83), while risperidone was associated with the lowest risk of fracture (or 1.24, 95% ci 0.95-1.83). fga users were at a higher risk of hip fracture than sga users. both fgas and sgas were associated with an increased risk of fractures, especially among the older population. therefore, the benefit of the off-label use of antipsychotics in elderly patients should be weighed against any risks for fracture.
prosocial_behavior	the feeling of synchrony is fundamental for most social activities and prosocial behaviors. however, little is known about the behavioral correlates of this feeling and its modulation by intergroup differences. we previously showed that the subjective feeling of synchrony in subjects involved in a mirror imitation task was modulated by objective behavioral measures, as well as contextual factors such as task difficulty and duration of the task performance. in the present study, we extended our methodology to investigate possible interindividual differences. we hypothesized that being in a romantic relationship or being a professional musician can modulate both implicit and explicit synchronization and the feeling of synchrony as well as the ability to detect synchrony from a third person perspective. contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find significant differences between people in a romantic relationship and control subjects. however, we observed differences between musicians and control subjects. for the implicit synchrony (spontaneous synchronization during walking), the results revealed that musicians that had never met before spontaneously synchronized their movements earlier among themselves than control subjects, but not better than people sharing a romantic relationship. moreover, in explicit behavioral synchronization tasks (mirror game), musicians reported earlier feeling of synchrony and had less speed errors than control subjects. this was in interaction with tasks difficulty as these differences appeared only in tasks with intermediate difficulty. finally, when subjects had to judge synchrony from a third person perspective, musicians had a better performance to identify if they were present or not in the videos. taken together, our results suggest that being a professional musician can play a role in the feeling of synchrony and its underlying mechanisms.
depression	the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between socially prescribed perfectionism (spp) and aggressiveness according to their components: physiological-emotional( anger), motor (physical and verbal aggression), and cognitive (hostility). the sample included 776 children from the 3rd to 6th year of primary school (m = 9.72 years; sd = 1.14). the child and adolescent perfectionism scale and the aggression questionnaire were used to assess, respectively, spp and components of aggressive behaviour: anger, hostility, physical and verbal aggression. the mean difference analysis showed that students with high levels of spp scored significantly higher on all 4 sub-scales of aggression questionnaire, compared with their peers with lower levels of spp. moderate effect sizes were obtained for all cases, except for hostility, where the magnitude of the differences was small. logistic regression analysis revealed that the 4 dimensions of aggression questionnaire predicted significantly and positively high scores on spp, with the or ranging from 1.07 to 1.12. the results showed that there is a close relationship between the spp and manifestations of aggression.

schizophrenia	several lines of evidence suggest that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( pacap) is a neuropeptide playing an important role as a neuromodulator. it has been indicated that pacap is associated with mental diseases, and that regulation of the pacapergic signals could be a potential target for the treatment of such psychiatric states as schizophrenia. recent studies have suggested that action of neuroleptic drugs is mediated not only by dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, but also via neuropeptides which may act both as neurotransmitters and as neuromodulators. the present study examines whether currently-used neuroleptics influence the action of pacap receptors, whose expression is altered in a schizophrenic patient. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to examine the effects of haloperidol, olanzapine and amisulpride on the expression of genes coding pac1/ vpac type receptors in the t98g glioblastoma cell line, as an example of an in vitro model of glial cells. pac1 mrna expression fell after 24-h incubation with haloperidol or olanzapine; however the effect was not maintained after 72 h, and haloperidol even up-regulated pac1 mrna expression in a dose- dependent manner. all the examined drugs decreased vpac2 mrna expression, especially after 72-h incubation. haloperidol (typical neuroleptic) was distinctly more potent than atypical neuroleptic drugs (olanzapine and amisulpride). in addition, pacap increased pac1 and vpac2 mrna expression. in conclusion, our findings suggest pacap receptors may be involved in the mechanism of typical and atypical neuroleptic drugs.
seasonal_affective_disorder	sleep problems, especially nightmares and insomnia, often accompany depression. this study investigated how nightmares, symptoms of insomnia, chronotype and sleep duration associate with seasonal affective disorder, a special form of depression. additionally, it was noted how latitude, a proxy for photoperiod, and characteristics of the place of residence affect the prevalence of seasonal affective disorder and sleep problems. to study these questions, data from finrisk 2012 study were used. finrisk 2012 consists of a random population sample of finnish adults aged 25-74 years (n = 4905) collected during winter from finnish urban and rural areas spanning the latitudes of 60 degrees n to 66 degrees n. the seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire was used to assess symptoms of seasonal affective disorder. participants with symptoms of seasonal affective disorder had significantly increased odds of experiencing frequent nightmares and symptoms of insomnia, and they were more often evening chronotypes. associations between latitude, population size and urbanicity with seasonal affective disorder symptoms and sleep disturbances were generally not significant, although participants living in areas bordering urban centres had less sleep problems than participants from other regions. these data show that the prevalence of seasonal affective disorder was not affected by latitude.
person_perception	introduction: research has reported that smiles facilitate social relationships. however, the effect of a smile on driving behavior has received less interest. method: this study attempts to evaluate how a pedestrian 's smile influences an oncoming driver 's behavior. in the first part of our study, male and female research assistants waiting at several pedestrian crossings were asked to smile or not at oncoming drivers. results: it was found that a smile increases the number of drivers who stop. the same effect was observed when the pedestrian tries to cross outside the pedestrian crossing. finally, this study shows that motorists drive slower after they see a pedestrian smile, suggesting that a smile can induce a positive mood. practical applications: this leads to motorists stopping more readily and driving more carefully. these results also suggest that pedestrians may increase their own safety by using appropriate nonverbal signals toward drivers.

eating_disorders	the aim of this study was to examine relations among missing and discrepant data on the eating disorders examination questionnaire (ede-q; fairburn & beglin, 1994) and individual demographic factors and eating disorder symptoms. data from 3968 men and women collected in five independent studies were examined. descriptive statistics were used to detect the quantity of missing and discrepant data, as well as independent samples t-tests and chi-square analyses to examine group differences between participants with and without missing or discrepant data. results indicated significant differences in data completeness by participant race/ethnicity and severity of eating disorder symptoms. white participants were most likely to provide complete survey responses, and asian american participants were least likely to provide complete survey responses. participants with incomplete surveys reported greater eating disorder symptoms and behaviors compared with those with complete surveys. similarly, those with discrepant responses to behavioral items reported greater eating disorder symptoms and behaviors compared with those with congruent responses. practical implications and recommendations for reducing and addressing incomplete data on the ede-q are discussed.

problem-solving	adaptive management is a well-established approach to managing natural resources, but there is little evidence demonstrating effectiveness of adaptive management over traditional management techniques. peer-reviewed literature attempts to draw conclusions about adaptive management effectiveness using social perceptions, but those studies are largely restricted to employees of us federal organizations. to gain a more comprehensive insight into perceived adaptive management effectiveness, this study aimed to broaden the suite of disciplines, professional affiliations, and geographic backgrounds represented by both practitioners and scholars. a questionnaire contained a series of questions concerning factors that lead to or inhibit effective management, followed by another set of questions focused on adaptive management. using a continuum representing strategies of both adaptive management and traditional management, respondents selected those strategies that they perceived as being effective. overall, characteristics (i.e., strategies, stakeholders, and barriers) identified by respondents as contributing to effective management closely aligned with adaptive management. responses were correlated to the type of adaptive management experience rather than an individual 's discipline, occupational, or regional affiliation. in particular, perceptions of characteristics contributing to adaptive management effectiveness varied between respondents who identified as adaptive management scholars (i.e., no implementation experience) and adaptive management practitioners. together, these results supported two concepts that make adaptive management effective: practitioners emphasized adaptive management 's value as a long-term approach and scholars noted the importance of stakeholder involvement. even so, more communication between practitioners and scholars regarding adaptive management effectiveness could promote interdisciplinary learning and problem solving for improved resources management.
social_cognition	despite a wealth of knowledge about the neural mechanisms behind emotional facial expression processing, little is known about how they relate to individual differences in social cognition abilities. we studied individual differences in the event-related potentials (erps) elicited by dynamic facial expressions. first, we assessed the latent structure of the erps, reflecting structural face processing in the n170, and the allocation of processing resources and reflexive attention to emotionally salient stimuli, in the early posterior negativity (epn) and the late positive complex (lpc). then we estimated brain-behavior relationships between the erp factors and behavioral indicators of facial identity and emotion-processing abilities. structural models revealed that the participants who formed faster structural representations of neutral faces (i.e., shorter n170 latencies) performed better at face perception (r = -.51) and memory (r = -.42). the n170 amplitude was not related to individual differences in face cognition or emotion processing. the latent epn factor correlated with emotion perception (r = .47) and memory (r = .32), and also with face perception abilities (r = .41). interestingly, the latent factor representing the difference in epn amplitudes between the two neutral control conditions (chewing and blinking movements) also correlated with emotion perception (r = .51), highlighting the importance of tracking facial changes in the perception of emotional facial expressions. the lpc factor for negative expressions correlated with the memory for emotional facial expressions. the links revealed between the latency and strength of activations of brain systems and individual differences in processing socio-emotional information provide new insights into the brain mechanisms involved in social communication.
schizophrenia	objectiveto examine sex and age distributions in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms) patients based on a systematic literature review. methodembase and pubmed databases were searched to identify any observation of nms published from january 1, 1998 through november 1, 2014 that was accessible and interpretable (using language translation software). redundant and equivocal reports were excluded. sex ratio and age distributions were examined using standard graphical techniques and measures of association. resultstwenty-eight independent sex ratio estimates were included. males predominated in most (75%) estimates with an overall median sex ratio of 1.47 (95% ci, 1.20-1.80). nms incidence peaked at age 20-25 years and declined steadily thereafter, with males consistently outnumbering females at all but the oldest age intervals. conclusionnms patients are 50% more likely to be males, and nms is most likely to occur in young adulthood.
nonverbal_communication	autism spectrum disorders (asd) are highly heterogeneous developmental conditions characterized by deficits in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and obsessive/stereotyped patterns of behavior and repetitive movements. social interaction impairments are the most characteristic deficits in asd. there is also evidence of impoverished language and empathy, a profound inability to use standard nonverbal behaviors (eye contact, affective expression) to regulate social interactions with others, difficulties in showing empathy, failure to share enjoyment, interests and achievements with others, and a lack of social and emotional reciprocity. in developed countries, it is now reported that 1%-1.5% of children have asd, and in the us 2015 cdc reports that approximately one in 45 children suffer from asd. despite the intense research focus on asd in the last decade, the underlying etiology remains unknown. genetic research involving twins and family studies strongly supports a significant contribution of environmental factors in addition to genetic factors in asd etiology. a comprehensive literature search has implicated several environmental factors associated with the development of asd. these include pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, solvents, air pollutants, fragrances, glyphosate and heavy metals, especially aluminum used in vaccines as adjuvant. importantly, the majority of these toxicants are some of the most common ingredients in cosmetics and herbicides to which almost all of us are regularly exposed to in the form of fragrances, face makeup, cologne, air fresheners, food flavors, detergents, insecticides and herbicides. in this review we describe various scientific data to show the role of environmental factors in asd.

problem-solving	there is an increasing use of social interaction contexts in the cross-enterprise manufacturing problem solving. to transform these massive and unstructured data into decision-support information for cross-enterprise manufacturing demand-capability matching, we present automated solutions to two phases: 1) extracting relationships based on a semi-supervised learning approach to derive formalized heterogeneous manufacturing network from the unstructured text-based context that contains high levels of noise and irrelevant information and 2) matching group-level relationships among the entities in the established manufacturing network. the extracting phase formulates network data using multiattributed graph that can encode various entities and relationships. the matching phase is based on probabilistic multiattributed graph matching, and implemented using distributed message passing algorithm. we developed a prototype system to verify the proposed model, which is also flexible to new domains of contexts and scale to large datasets. the ultimate goal of this paper is to facilitate knowledge transferring and sharing in the context of cross-enterprise social interaction, thereby supporting the integration of the resources and capabilities among different enterprise.
prosocial_behavior	purpose this study draws from social comparison theory to explore why and under which circumstances individuals receiving idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) are likely to help their co-workers. design data were collected with an alumni association of engineers. participants completed two questionnaires (n = 182 at time 2). findings we find that the relationship between i-deals and helping behavior is not direct, but is mediated by organizational-based self-esteem. this relationship is stronger when i-deal recipients believe that their co-workers do not have the opportunity to get i-deals for themselves. implications i-deal recipients are expected to help their colleagues because helping colleagues is consistent with the positive self developed thanks to i-deals. when co-workers have the opportunity to get i-deals for themselves, social comparison between the i-deal recipient and colleagues is likely to be more salient, which strengthen the indirect relationship between i-deal and helping behavior. originality this study tests i-deals from the vantage point of social comparison theory rather than from the perspective of social exchange. we thereby provide a richer account of the complexities involved in helping behavior. by exploring contextual variables that are likely to trigger social comparisons, we also expect to better understand the circumstances under which i-deals are likely to be associated with helping behavior.
attention	cooking oils are an integral part of a human diet as they are used in almost all types of culinary practices. they serve as sources of lipids with a significant nutritive value and health benefits which can be attributed to their fatty acid compositions and biological antioxidants. however, cooking oils are usually subjected to thermal oxidation which occurs when fresh cooking oil is heated at high temperatures during various food preparations. repeated use of cooking oils in the commercial food industry is also common to maximize profit. thermal oxidation of edible oils had since attracted great attention of nutritionist and researchers given the deteriorative effect such as generation of very cytotoxic compounds, loss of carotenoid, phenolics and vitamins thus reducing the overall antioxidant properties of the oils. furthermore, several in vivo studies had suggested that consumption of thermally-oxidized cooking oils might not be healthy as it might negatively influence the lipid profile (increased low density lipoprotein (ldl), decreased high density lipoprotein (hdl) and elevated cholesterol level), haematological system (alteration in concentration of heamoglobin (hb), packed cell volume (pcv), white blood cell (wbc) count, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), kidney function, and induce lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress which have been associated with the pathogenesis of various degenerative diseases. therefore, thermal oxidation seems not to provide any health benefit, as it deteriorates cooking oils and the consumption of the oils may predispose consumers to various disease conditions that may ensue from free radical generation, thereby having deleterious effect on human health.
schizophrenia	human health is beset with a legion of ailments, which is exacerbated by lifestyle errors. out of the numerous enzymes in human body, aromatase, a tytochrome p450 enzyme is particularly very critical. occurring at the crossroads of multiple signalling pathways, its homebstasis is vital for optimal health. unfortunately, medications, hormone therapy, chemical additives in food, and endocrine-disrupting personal care products are oscillating the aromatase concentration beyond the permissible level. as this enzyme converts androgens (c19) into estrogens (c18), its agitation has different outcomes in different genders and age groups. some common pathologies associated with aromatase disruption include breast cancer, prostate cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos), endometriosis, osteoporosis, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pituitary cancer, alzheimer 's disease, schizophrenia, male hypogonadism, and transgender issues. several drugs, cosmetics and pesticides act as the activators and suppressors of this enzyme. this carefully-compiled critical review is expected to increase public awareness regarding the threats resultant of the perturbations of this enzyme and to motivate researchers for further investigation of this field.

prosocial_behavior	can the positivity bias, observed across various social network sites (snss), predict the use of prosocial lies in a sns such as facebook? the positivity bias may be a product of politeness norms (i.e., positive face concern) that have influenced communication phenomena before these sites existed. in addition, positive face concern may also be affected by unconscious cues or primes that promote prosocial behavior on facebook. we conducted an online experiment using current facebook users to examine how positive face concern and surveillance primes affect prosocial lying in public and private facebook contexts. although positive face concern and publicness predicted the use of prosocial lying, positive face concern was not affected by the publicness and surveillance primes did not affect positive face concern or the use of prosocial lies in our study. this hints towards the nuance of positive face concern and the potential limitations of surveillance primes on prosocial lying behavior.

depression	a large number of asthmatic patients, particularly females, present inadequate disease control. depressive symptoms are reportedly common in asthma and have been related to poor disease control, but the mechanism of this association is still unclear. poor quality sleep, frequently observed in asthmatics, is also a manifestation of depression and has been related to uncontrolled asthma. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and asthma control. this was a cross-sectional study of 123 women with previous diagnosis of asthma from a reference center in fortaleza, brazil. depressive symptoms were assessed by the beck depression inventory (bdi); quality of sleep was evaluated by the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi), daytime sleepiness by the epworth sleepiness scale (ess), and asthma control by the asthma control test (act). inadequate asthma control (act5) in 99 (80.49 %), and excessive daytime sleepiness (ess >= 10) in 34 (27.64 %). depressive symptoms were associated with both poor quality sleep (r = 0.326) and inadequate asthma control (r = -0.299). regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms and sleep quality were independent predictors of the level of asthma control. asthma control in women is independently associated with depressive symptoms and quality of sleep, suggesting that these patients might benefit from simple measures to promote healthy sleep behavior and sleep hygiene and also that routine screening for depression can be relevant, particularly, in poorly controlled cases.
antisocial_personality_disorder	psychopathy is a complex developmental personality disorder. recent theories have linked psychopathy to impairment in the frontostriatal circuitry linking the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc). similar neural regions have been implicated in decision-making. given the importance of decision-making in the context of personal and societal problems, together with the convergence of brain regions important in both decision-making and psychopathy, the study of decision-making in psychopathy has the potential to illuminate important cognitive and neurobiological bases for psychopathy. in this review, we synthesise past research on psychopathy and decision-making, and then describe three decision-making tasks that we predict would be useful for understanding cognitive decisional processes in psychopathy.
antisocial_personality_disorder	despite multiple risk factors for mortality among people who inject drugs (pwid), more research is warranted that examines sub-populations within pwid. mortality data from pwid participating in longitudinal hiv prevention research in denver were obtained from the colorado department of public health and environment. risk factors for both all-cause and acute-toxicity related mortality were analyzed using cox proportional hazards regression. two-thousand seven individuals were interviewed at baseline. eighty-six individuals died during the time frame of the study, 58 of which were due to acute-toxicity. disabled (hr = 3.3, p < 0.001), gay/lesbian-identified (hr = 2.6, p = 0.03), white race/ethnicity (hr = 2.4, p = 0.003), and use of a shared cooker (hr = 2.1, p = 0.01) were important adjusted risk factors. these suggest that drug and hiv interventions should utilize techniques that can address the needs of marginalized populations in addition to hiv drug risk behaviors.
gender_roles	using a combination of scholarly literature and media reports, this paper classifies instances of subtle bias, or microaggressions, toward female athletes in the united states. we identify three common microaggression themes against these athletes based on sue 's (2010) taxonomy: assumption of inferiority, objectification, and restrictive gender roles. we apply each of these themes to explore the ways in which female athletes in the u.s. experience pervasive and subtle gender-based biases. women are assumed to be inferior athletes and therefore receive media coverage that is dismissive of their abilities, if they receive coverage at all. the media also focus primarily on the appearance of female athletes regardless of their athletic successes, and are quick to recoil at women who do not fit into the traditional feminine mold. we examine how these microaggressions are associated with deleterious biological, cognitive, and behavioral consequences among athletes. we also explore the effect of these microaggressions on the self-image and physical fitness of female non-athletes. finally, potential avenues for future research are discussed.
leadership	complex offerings and evolving customer needs increase the demand for market-driven salespeople. yet many of today 's managers struggle to effectively deploy this selling approach. in light of this reality, we develop and test a multi-level market capabilities framework to examine team-level drivers and boundary conditions of market driven salesperson behaviors, norms, and performance. data collected in a lagged, multi-source, cross-level field study of 246 salespeople nested within 54 sales teams provide evidence that investments in team social capital (itsc) support the self-correcting, customer-centric, learning behaviors needed for performance. results show that managers' itsc are positively associated with team goal monitoring, commitment to service quality, and learning effort. further, goal monitoring and learning effort increase commitment to service quality, which helps drive sales performance. we also find that transactive memory systems (tms) can be an efficient team knowledge resource that strengthens the learning effort-to-performance and service quality-to-performance relationships.

child_abuse	adverse social conditions in early life have been linked to increased expression of proinflammatory genes and reduced expression of antiviral genes in circulating immune cells-the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (ctra). however, it remains unclear whether such effects are specific to the western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (weird) cultural environments in which previous research has been conducted. to assess the roles of early adversity and individual psychological resilience in immune system gene regulation within a non-weird population, we evaluated ctra gene-expression profiles in 254 former child soldiers and matched noncombatant civilians 5 y after the people 's war in nepal. ctra gene expression was up-regulated in former child soldiers. these effects were linked to the degree of experienced trauma and associated distress-that is, posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) severity-more than to child soldier status per se. self-perceived psychological resilience was associated with marked buffering of ctra activation such that ptsd-affected former child soldiers with high levels of personal resilience showed molecular profiles comparable to those of ptsd-free civilians. these results suggest that ctra responses to early life adversity are not restricted to weird cultural contexts and they underscore the key role of resilience in determining the molecular impact of adverse environments.
eating_disorders	objectiveour aims were to investigate the relationship between food addiction and mental disorders including eating disorders (ed), eating-related psychopathology and body mass index-standard deviation score in a sample of adolescent psychiatric inpatients. methodsfood addiction was assessed with the yale food addiction scale (yfas). eating-related psychopathology was measured with the three-factor eating questionnaire (tfeq). psychiatric diagnoses were assessed according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition. the sample consisted of n=242 adolescent psychiatric inpatients, of which n=37 (15.3%) met criteria for an ed. multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association between yfas symptom count, tfeq scales and ed controlling for age and gender. resultsfood addiction frequency was 16.5%, and the mean yfas symptom count was 2.39 (sd: 1.60). in patients with food addiction, tfeq scale scores were significantly higher than patients without food addiction. frequency of ed was 42.9% in patients with and 9.9% in patients without food addiction. the tfeq subscales disinhibition and hunger as well as diagnosis of ed were associated with yfas symptom count. discussionfood addiction in adolescent psychiatric inpatients occurs with rates higher than those seen in community samples of children, adolescents and adults. food addiction might be associated with eating styles related to susceptibility to hunger and feelings of loss of control. the implications of high-yfas scores in restricting-type anorexia nervosa warrant further investigations to explore which and how the respective items are interpreted in this ed subgroup. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd and eating disorders association.
person_perception	the ability to differentiate individuals from their group memberships (individuation) is useful in forming impressions when social categorization fails to do so. this method is particularly valuable when encountering incongruent social category conjunctions (e.g., female bricklayer). we tested the notion that individuation is initiated when applying cognitively effortful explanatory, emergent attributes to incongruent conjunctions. incongruent category conjunctions were more likely to be comprised of emergent attributes and individuation moderated the application of these attributes in experiment 1. in experiment 2, individuation again moderated emergent attribute application for incongruent conjunctions, but cognitive load attenuated the relationship. allowing or preventing the generation of attributes did not affect individuation for incongruent conjunctions in experiment 3. this ruled out the possibility that emergent attributes cause increased individuation, but does not rule out the notion that individuation precedes such explanatory attributes. together these findings suggest that individuating those whose category memberships clash may be applied in the effortful application of explanatory emergent attributes.
depression	objective: to explore the effect of depression on the sleep quality, and the circadian rhythm of ambulatory blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. methods: a total of 73 older patients with hypertension were screened for depression and divided into two groups. the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) and the circadian rhythm of ambulatory blood pressure were compared between the non-depressed (control) and depressed (case) group. results: in the case group, 24 h ambulatory sbp and dbp, and nocturnal sbp and dbp were higher than in the control group, and the circadian rhythm of non-dipper was higher (67.22% vs 40.13%, p < 0.01). there was a positive correlation between psqi and depression (r = 0.432, p < 0.01). conclusion: there was a significant correlation between sleep quality and depression in older patients with hypertension. depression increases the circadian rhythm of non-dipper in older patients with hypertension.

prejudice	purpose: researchers are increasingly using national population surveys (nps) to understand the health of gay and bisexual men (gbm). however, valid inference from these surveys depends on accurate identification of gbm. methods: we asked 8126 gbm in an anonymous, online, community-recruited survey about their willingness to reveal their sexual orientation in nps. results: overall, 30% indicated that they would not reveal their sexual orientation; however, there were differences in frequencies according to sexual orientation, relationship status, age, hiv status, living environment, education, income, and ethnicity. conclusion: nps might not be fully representative of gbm due to misclassification errors stemming from unwillingness to disclose.
leadership	this paper investigates the effect of leader 's relational transparency on follower organizational deviance through followers' perception of leader 's behavioral integrity and their trust in leader. multi-level modeling results from a multisource survey-based field-study with 24 hospitality student project teams (n=149) show that behavioral integrity mediates the relationship between leader 's relational transparency and follower 's trust in leader. furthermore, multi-level path analysis suggests that leader 's relational transparency, a team-level construct, exerts a cross-level effect on follower 's organizational deviance through the mediating roles of behavioral integrity and follower 's trust in leader. the study has yielded theoretical and practical implications that are useful for hospitality leaders. published by elsevier ltd.
child_abuse	the high prevalence of child sexual abuse (csa) is concerning, particularly as survivors are at increased risk for multiple adverse outcomes, including poor mental health across the lifespan. children born at an extremely low birth weight (elbw;2500 g) participants at ages 22-26 and 29-36. at age 22-26, csa was associated with increased odds of clinically significant internalizing (or= 7.32, 95% ci: 2.31-23.23) and externalizing (or = 4.65, 95% ci: 1.11-19.51) problems among elbw participants exposed to csa compared to those who did not, though confidence intervals were wide. at age 29-36, csa was linked to increased odds of any current (or = 3.43, 95% ci: 1.08-10.87) and lifetime (or= 7.09, 95% ci: 2.00-25.03) non -substance use psychiatric disorders, however, this did not hold after adjustment for covariates. statistically significant differences in mental health outcomes were not observed in nbw participants exposed to csa compared to nbw participants who were not exposed. survivors of significant perinatal adversity who are also exposed to csa may be at higher risk for psychopathology through the fourth decade of life.

child_abuse	aimchildhood maltreatment (cm) has been related to a persistent reprograming of stress-response. copeptin is a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation; however, few studies have examined copeptin levels in children exposed to cm. the aim of this study was to compare serum copeptin levels in children reporting child abuse and/or neglect and children with no history of cm. methodsthis study included 65 children with a positive history of moderate to severe cm, as reported by themselves and their parent(s) during a clinical interview, and 71 children with no history of cm as a comparison group. cm was considered moderate to severe based on the child-reported frequency of being exposed to events related to sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and/or physical neglect. child psychopathology symptoms were assessed using the child behavior checklist (cbcl). we measured serum copeptin concentration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. resultschildren exposed to cm exhibited higher levels of serum copeptin compared to children without cm when controlling for sex, age, and psychiatric morbidity. the cbcl total score, including internalizing and externalizing symptoms, was higher in children with cm. we found no correlation between copeptin and cbcl scores for internalizing symptoms and externalizing symptoms. conclusion cm is associated with copeptin serum levels independently of age, sex, and symptom severity. copeptin is a promising new biomarker for children with a history of abuse and/or neglect.
child_abuse	much of the fabric in today 's society is at odds with planning a robust and generative public health response to child maltreatment prevention. a critical component of this problem is the absence of a public policy framework and related infrastructure that can create common ownership of the problem while recognizing the vast differences in individual willingness and capacity to alter their parenting behaviors. to address this challenge, it seems prudent to begin building a universal system of assessment and support that will touch all children and all families at multiple points in the developmental process. such a system would not simply identify those at highest risk. rather this system would be built on the premise that all parents have issues and concerns and differ only in the extent to which they have the capacity to address these issues. this commentary outlines the key elements of such a system and its benefits in strengthening both the impacts of interventions and the collective will to support all children.
eating_disorders	clinicians currently use different low-weight cut-offs both to diagnose anorexia nervosa (an) and to determine an severity in adolescent girls. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of existing cut-offs and severity criteria by determining which are most strongly associated with risk for low bone mineral density (bmd). height adjusted bmd z scores were calculated for 352 females: 262 with an and 90 healthy controls (controls) (12-20.5 years), using data from the bmd in childhood study, for the lumbar spine, whole body less head, and total hip. for most cut-offs used to define low weight (5th or 10th bmi percentile, bmi of 17.5 or 18.5, and 85 or 90% of median bmi), an had lower bmd z scores than controls. an at >85 or >90% expected body weight for height (ebw-ht) did not differ in bmd z scores from controls, but differed significantly from an at 85 or 90% ebw-ht. among an, any amenorrhea was associated with lower bmd. an had lower bmd than controls across dsm-5 and the society for adolescent health and medicine (sahm) severity categories. the sahm moderate severity classification was differentiated from the mildly malnourished classification by lower bmd at hip and spine sites. amenorrhea and %ebw-ht85 or90% are markers of severity of bone loss within an. among severity categories, bmi z scores (sahm) may have the greatest utility in assessing the degree of malnutrition in adolescent girls that corresponds to lower bmd.
borderline_personality_disorder	neural underpinnings of emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (bpd) are characterized by limbic hyperactivity and disturbed prefrontal activity. it is unknown whether neural correlates of emotion regulation change after a psychotherapy which has the goal to improve emotion dysregulation in bpd, such as dialectical behavioral therapy (dbt). we investigated distraction as a main emotion regulation strategy before and after dbt in female patients with bpd. thirty-one bpd patients were instructed to either passively view or memorize letters before being confronted with negative or neutral pictures in a distraction task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. this paradigm was applied before and after a 12-week residential dbt-based treatment program. we compared the dbt group to 15 bpd control patients, who continued their usual, non-dbt-based treatment or did not have any treatment, and 22 healthy participants. behaviorally, bpd groups and healthy participants did not differ significantly with respect to alterations over time. on the neural level, bpd patients who received dbt-based treatment showed an activity decrease in the right inferior parietal lobe/supramarginal gyrus during distraction from negative rather than neutral stimuli when compared to both control groups. this decrease was correlated with improvement in self-reported borderline symptom severity. dbt responders exhibited decreased right perigenual anterior cingulate activity when viewing negative (rather than neutral) pictures. in conclusion, our findings reveal changes in neural activity associated with distraction during emotion processing after dbt in patients with bpd. these changes point to lower emotional susceptibility during distraction after bpd symptom improvement.
leadership	distributed leadership has been explored internationally as a leadership model that will promote and advance excellence in learning and teaching in higher education. this paper presents an assessment of how effectively distributed leadership was enabled at five australian institutions implementing a collaborative teaching quality development scheme called the peer assisted teaching scheme. the scheme brings together expertise from teams of academics, coordinators, and institutional learning and teaching portfolio holders to the shared goal of enhancing learning and teaching quality. a distributed leadership benchmarking tool was used to assess the scheme 's effectiveness, and we found that (i) the scheme is highly consistent with the distributed leadership benchmarks, and that (ii) the benchmarking tool is easily used in assessing the alignment (or otherwise) of teaching and learning quality initiatives with distributed leadership benchmarks. this paper will be of interest to those seeking to assess implementations of distributed leadership to improve teaching quality and leadership capacity.
depression	objective: depression screening should be increased when prevailing knowledge underscoring medication associated mental health risk is highest. depression screening in primary care practices when medications with mental health risk were prescribed was estimated while considering the absence and presence of clinical decision support systems. materials and methods: a cross-sectional, descriptive study using the national ambulatory medical care survey (namcs) data from 2008 to 2010 was conducted. primary care physician visits were classified based on whether a medication prescribed had a contraindication, severe warning, moderate warning, adverse event only, or no documented mental health risk. adjusted odds of depression screening for each risk warning level were estimated while controlling for important sociodemographic factors and presence of computerized systems for medication warnings and guideline recommendations. results: depression screening at primary care practice visits when medications were prescribed was 2.1% and increased to 2.8% or higher when medications had a moderate or severe mental health risk warning or medication-disease contraindication. depression screening was increased at visits when at least one medication was prescribed that had a contraindication (aor = 6.31, p < 0.001), severe warning (aor = 2.04, p = 0.003), or moderate warning (aor = 2.50, p = 0.012) for mental health risk, but not for mental health adverse event only warnings alone (aor = 1.54, p = 0.074). discussion: depression screening is increased when medications were prescribed with a documented mental health risk. presence of clinical decision support systems may help discern between minor and major medication-associated mental health risks. conclusions: appropriately, positioned warning systems with targeted content, workflow redesign, and health information exchange may improve depression screening in at-risk patients.

problem-solving	previous research has demonstrated the critical role communication plays in a group 's ability to recognize its expert members. this study looks broadly at the different forms of communication that might influence expertise recognition and considers how structural, relational, and communicative factors are related to individuals' success in having their expertise recognized by other group members. in addition, we advance a view of expertise recognition in terms of expertise sharing and consider the circumstances under which an individual 's self-perceived expertise is likely to match the perceptions of other group members. drawing on survey data from 99 employees at a financial services company, we find that it is communication practices, and not structural influences, that primarily relate to group members having their expertise recognized by coworkers. the findings extend theory that views attributions of individuals' expertise in organizations as a communicative phenomenon that emerges through work practices.
depression	we examined the intergenerational transmission of parent-child relationship qualities in a population-based finnish sample of 1418 participants (g2) and their mothers (g1). at baseline, g1 (mage=38) reported qualities of the parent-child relationship in terms of emotional warmth and acceptance towards g2 (age range 3-18). after 28years, g2 (mage=39) rated the qualities of the parent-child relationship regarding their own children using the same questionnaire. emotional warmth and acceptance were transmitted across generations even after controlling for demographic and family characteristics in both generations. the transmission was stronger for emotional warmth than acceptance. for emotional warmth, intergenerational transmission was stronger for men than women. the findings provide evidence for the long-term transmission of parenting quality across generations.
prejudice	this article analyses the public responses in china to shanghai 's performance in the 2012 programme for international student assessment (pisa). based on data obtained from media accounts and other materials published between 2013 and 2016, the research findings show that the responses in china are generally reflective, measured and self-critical. drawing upon gadamer 's notions of tradition', horizon' and prejudice', this paper contends that the responses reflect the prevailing worldviews in china that perceive shanghai 's education system to be academically rigorous but too exam-oriented and burdensome. it is further argued that confucian knowledge traditions and structures in china shape the chinese interpretations of the pisa assessment format, leading them to downplay shanghai 's success. this study introduces the metaphor of triadic eyes' and highlights the mediating effects of the local eyes' of policy actors in an era of global educational governance.
antisocial_personality_disorder	approximately half of the people with psychotic disorders from the schizophrenia group also develop a comorbid addictive disorder during their lifetime. these so-called dual diagnosis patients (dd) are difficult to treat. they have poor compliance and frequent relapses, they often present with aggressive behavior towards themselves and others and the long- term sociorehabilitative outcomes are poor. in this article the different models for the understanding of the high comorbidity between psychoses and substance use disorders are explained and the principles for an integrated treatment of dd patients are outlined. low-threshold, motivational, integrated treatment programs with psychoeducative and behavioral therapeutic elements are helpful and should be more extensively implemented; however, long- term treatment methods are needed and therapeutic goals must be realistic and not set too high.
attention	organic-inorganic nano-materials have attracted growing attention due to their potential applications for optoelectronic devices, sensors, and heterogeneous catalysts. we reported here on the preparation of polynary nanocomposites composed of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (p4vp) functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (mwntp4vp), silica nanoparticles (nano-sio2), viologens, and/or phosphomolybdic acid (pma), in which the mwntp4vp, nano-sio2, and viologens were covalently connected while pma was electrostatically adsorbed. thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the nanocomposites were composed of about 40-45% mwnts, 40-45% nanosio(2), as well as 10-15% organic species and others. the preparation processes and compositions of the nanocomposites were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. field emission transmission electron microscopic images revealed that the nano-sio(2)benv particles were strongly attached to the mwntp4vp surfaces to form mwntp4vp@nano-sio(2)benv triad nano-cores. cyclic voltammo-grams of the mwntp4vp@nano-sio(2)benv casting films showed three couples of redox waves in the potential range between -0.8 and 0 v (vs ag/agcl), designated to the electron transfer process of viologen substituents of mwntp4vp@nano-sio(2)benv(2+)mwntp4vp@nano-sio(2)benv(+center dot) and their dimers. further, three couples of redox waves were recorded for the casting films of mwntp4vp@nanosio(2)benv/pma polynary nanocomposites in the potential range between -0.2 and 0.8 v, designated to three successive electron transfer processes of pma. finally, it was revealed that the present mwntpvp@nano-sio(2)benv/pma polynary composites could act as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of bromate.

nonverbal_communication	physician implicit racial bias has been found to predict racial minority patients' reports of satisfaction and trust immediately after engaging in racially discordant medical interactions. this suggests physician implicit racial bias is somehow manifested in physician communication behaviors and noticed by patients during the medical interactions. however, it is unclear exactly how physician implicit racial bias manifests behaviorally during racially discordant medical interactions. the authors argue that such lack of understanding might be due to several limitations with the existing patient-physician coding systems. in order to further advance research on patient-physician communication during racially discordant medical interactions, new coding systems tailored for racially discordant medical interactions are required. specifically, it is suggested that these coding systems need to be capable of assessing physician nonverbal/paraverbal communication behaviors that were found to be positive or negative by racial minority patients themselves. this likely requires innovative research approaches, such as a mixed-methods approach.
gender_roles	dominant discourses of immigrant value in taiwan and across asia distinguish marital immigrants from desirable professional immigrants who are assumed to contribute their talents and economic productivity to their new home. this article examines national anxieties about the compromised value of marital immigrants and it illustrates the strategies adopted by immigrant spouses as they carve out new means of producing value through productive and reproductive labors. focusing on mainland chinese spouses in taiwan, the article argues that contested political relations between taiwan and china foster immigration policies that construct chinese marital immigrants as familial dependents whose material desires and suspect political commitments are held in check by their identification with reproductive and care labors. the article asks how this complex devaluation system affects the life strategies of comparatively elite marital immigrants, chinese women and men with postsecondary degrees and former professional careers in china. the article analyzes how these immigrants maneuver around policies that restrict their access to skilled employment, yet without necessarily rejecting their reproductive contributions to taiwanese society. elite spouses experience new forms of precariousness produced by the intersection of intimate life decisions with heteronormative gender roles, aspirations for self-fulfillment, and the insecurities of immigrant status.
child_abuse	child sexual abuse (csa) affects over 62,000 children annually in the united states. a primary obstacle to the success of a public health prevention strategy is the lack of knowledge around community level risk factors for csa. we evaluated community level characteristics for children seeking care for suspected csa in the greater houston area for 2009. there was a total incidence rate of medical evaluations for suspected csa of 5.9/1000 children. we abstracted the medical charts of 1982 (86 %) children who sought a medical evaluation for suspected csa at three main medical systems in the greater houston area for 2009. we evaluated 18 community level variables from the american community survey for the 396 zip codes these children lived in. the mean number of cases per greater houston zip code was 2.77 (range 0-27), with 62 % of zip codes not having a case at any of the three sites surveyed. zip codes with a higher than houston average rate of vacant houses, never married females and unemployed labor force with high family poverty rate, were associated with an increased rate of children seeking care for suspected csa. we demonstrated zip codes level characteristics which were associated with an increased rate of children seeking care for suspected csa. our modelling process and our data have implications for community based strategies aimed at improved surveillance or prevention of csa. the process of identifying locally specific community level factors suggests target areas which have particular socioeconomic characteristics which are associated with increased rate of seeking csa evaluations.
gender_roles	church organization, the notion of person, and the charismatic discourse on value in pentecostal denominations deeply influence gender relations among church members. in turn, gender relations influence the ways in which the charismatic discourse is received and concretised. my analysis explores this complex process of mutual transformations of gender roles and conversion meanings among pentecostal christians in an illegal settlement on the outskirts of honiara, solomon islands. in particular, i focus on how husband and wife in pentecostal households change the way they look at each other as they undertake a process of charismatic renewal. my aim is to illustrate how the statement of a kwara'ae man reveals the meaning of conversion as a long-term process that takes place relationally and under the influence of gendered values.
leadership	while psychopathy research has been growing for decades, a relatively new area of research is corporate psychopathy. corporate psychopaths are simply psychopaths working in organizational settings. they may be attracted to the financial, power, and status gains available in senior positions and can cause considerable damage within these roles from a manipulative interpersonal style to large-scale fraud. based upon prior studies, we analyze psychopathy research pertaining to 23 moral emotions classified according to functional quality (positive vs. negative signal) and target (self vs. other). based upon our review, we suggest that psychopaths are high in moral emotions associated with other-directed negative signals, low in self-directed negative signals, and low in other-directed positive signals. we found no empirical articles related to self-directed positive signals. this understanding of the specific moral emotion deficits of corporate psychopaths provides greater theoretical understanding and practical implications of knowing which individuals not to promote, though more research is needed on moral emotions that are faked for manipulative reasons.
prenatal_development	current research suggests that incidence and heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (asd) symptoms may arise through a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous factors. while subject to routine clinical practice and generally considered safe, there exists speculation, though no human data, that diagnostic ultrasound may also contribute to asd severity, supported by experimental evidence that exposure to ultrasound early in gestation could perturb brain development and alter behavior. here we explored a modified triple hit hypothesis [williams & casanova, ] to assay for a possible relationship between the severity of asd symptoms and (1) ultrasound exposure (2) during the first trimester of pregnancy in fetuses with a (3) genetic predisposition to asd. we did so using retrospective analysis of data from the ssc (simon 's simplex collection) autism genetic repository funded by the simons foundation autism research initiative. we found that male children with asd, copy number variations (cnvs), and exposure to first trimester ultrasound had significantly decreased non-verbal iq and increased repetitive behaviors relative to male children with asd, with cnvs, and no ultrasound. these data suggest that heterogeneity in asd symptoms may result, at least in part, from exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during early prenatal development of children with specific genetic vulnerabilities. these results also add weight to on-going concerns expressed by the fda about non-medical use of diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy. autism res2017, 10: 472-484.

prosocial_behavior	an approach-avoidance model of social withdrawal (asendorpf, 1990) identifies 3 types of social withdrawal including shyness, unsociability, and avoidance. each appears to be uniquely associated with varying indicators of maladjustment in emerging adulthood (nelson, 2013) but little, if any, work has been done to see how they might be linked to media use in the third decade of life. therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine longitudinally the links between subtypes of social withdrawal, connective media (e.g., e-mail, social networking) and problematic (forms of media such as violent video games that, when used in high amounts, have been found to be linked to indices of maladjustment) media use, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. the participants in the study (m-age = 20.70, sd = 1.98, range = 18-29 at time 2) consisted of 204 undergraduate students (58% female) recruited from 2 large public universities in the united states who completed questionnaires at 2 points of time separated by 1 year. results revealed that avoidant individuals use problematic forms of media more than average, unsociable, and shy individuals. furthermore, problematic media use predicted more withdrawn behavior at time 2 and mediated the relation between avoidance and externalizing behaviors over time. few problems were found for unsociable behavior. the need to differentiate between multiple forms of withdrawal in emerging adulthood and their links with problematic forms of media and subsequent risk factors is discussed.
attention	type 4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (pde4) are major members of a superfamily of enzymes (pde) involved in modulation of intracellular signaling mediated by camp. broadly expressed in most human tissues and present in large amounts in the liver, pdes have in the last decade been key therapeutic targets for several inflammatory diseases. recently, a significant body of work has underscored their involvement in different kinds of cancer, but with no attention paid to liver cancer. the present study investigated the effects of two pde4 inhibitors, rolipram and dc-ta-46, on the growth of human hepatoma hepg2 cells. treatment with these inhibitors caused a marked increase of intracellular camp level and a dose- and time-dependent effect on cell growth. the concentrations of inhibitors that halved cell proliferation to about 50% were used for cell cycle experiments. rolipram (10 mu m) and dc-ta-46 (0.5 mu m) produced a decrease of cyclin expression, in particular of cyclin a, as well as an increase in p21, p27 and p53, as evaluated by western blot analysis. changes in the intracellular localization of cyclin d1 were also observed after treatments. in addition, both inhibitors caused apoptosis, as demonstrated by an annexin-v cytofluorimetric assay and analysis of caspase-3/7 activity. results demonstrated that treatment with pde4 inhibitors affected hepg2 cell cycle and survival, suggesting that they might be useful as potential adjuvant, chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents in hepatocellular carcinoma.

prosocial_behavior	self-determination theory introduces a multidimensional view of motivation and explains how the different types of motivation can be promoted or hindered. following gagne et al. (2014), the purpose of this study was to create an abbreviated version of the multidimensional work motivation scale (mwms) and to study the psychometric properties of the instrument using data from 1,035 workers from three mediterranean countries (greece, italy, and spain). factorial analyses indicated that the 18-item scale has the same factor structure across the three mediterranean languages, reflecting common cultural idiosyncrasies and influences. convergent and discriminant validity indicated that intrinsic and integrated forms of autonomous motivation had a positive relationship with job satisfaction, affective and normative commitment, prosocial behavior, perceived organizational support, job autonomy, and leader-member exchange. controlled forms of motivation (e.g., social and material) were unrelated or negatively related to most of the variables examined, with the exception of continuance commitment (positive association). lastly, amotivation was negatively related to all employee-related variables, except for continuance commitment. practical implications and suggestions for the development of future research based on self-determination theory are discussed.
attention	singular value decomposition (svd), as an effective signal denoising tool, has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. the basic idea behind svd denoising is to preserve the singular components (scs) with significant singular values. however, it is shown that the singular values mainly reflect the energy of decomposed scs, therefore traditional svd denoising approaches are essentially energy-based, which tend to highlight the high-energy regular components in the measured signal, while ignoring the weak feature caused by early fault. to overcome this issue, a reweighted singular value decomposition (rsvd) strategy is proposed for signal denoising and weak feature enhancement. in this work, a novel information index called periodic modulation intensity is introduced to quantify the diagnostic information in a mechanical signal. with this index, the decomposed scs can be evaluated and sorted according to their information levels, rather than energy. based on that, a truncated linear weighting function is proposed to control the contribution of each sc in the reconstruction of the denoised signal, in this way, some weak but informative scs could be highlighted effectively. the advantages of rsvd over traditional approaches are demonstrated by both simulated signals and real vibration acoustic data from a two-stage gearbox as well as train bearings. the results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully extract the weak fault feature even in the presence of heavy noise and ambient interferences.

false_memories	the capability of adult and child witnesses to accurately recollect events from the past and provide reliable testimony has been hotly debated for more than 100 years. prominent legal cases of the 1980s and 1990s sparked lengthy debates and important research questions surrounding the fallibility and general reliability of memory. but what lessons have we learned, some 35 years later, about the role of memory in the judicial system? in this review, we focus on what we now know about the consequences of the fallibility of memory for legal proceedings. we present a brief historical overview of false memories that focuses on three critical forensic areas that changed memory research: children as eyewitnesses, historic sexual abuse and eyewitness (mis)identification. we revisit some of the prominent trials of the 1980s and 1990s to not only consider the role false memories have played in judicial decisions, but also to see how this has helped us understand memory today. finally, we consider the way in which the research on memory (true and false) has been successfully integrated into some courtroom procedures.
problem-solving	background: today, patients are expected to take an active role in the form of self-management. given the burden of a rheumatic disorder, the patients cannot be expected to self-manage on their own. in order to develop self-management interventions that fit patients' needs and preferences, it is essential to examine patients' perspective on how support can be optimized. this study aimed to identify support needs of outpatients with rheumatic disorders and preferences for who should provide self-management support. methods: a qualitative study was conducted using focus groups and individual interviews with outpatients with rheumatic disorders treated in a dutch university hospital. interview data was analysed with directed content analysis and coded with predetermined codes derived from our model about support needs of chronically ill patients. this model distinguished three types of support: instrumental, psychosocial and relational support. results: fourteen patients participated in two focus group interviews and six were interviewed individually. most patients preferred an active role in self-management. nonetheless, they notably needed support in developing skills for self-managing their rheumatic disorder in daily life. the extent of support needs was influenced by disease stage, presence of symptoms and changes in one 's situation. a trusted relationship and partnership were conditional for receiving any kind of professional support. patients wanted to be seen as experienced experts of living with a rheumatic disorder. acquiring specific disease-related knowledge, learning how to deal with symptoms and fluctuations, talking about emotional aspects, and discussing daily life issues and disease-related information were identified as important elements of self-management support. it was considered crucial that support be tailored to individual needs and expertise. professionals and relatives were preferred as support givers. few patients desired support from fellow patients. conclusion: self-management was primarily seen as patient 's own task. above all, patients wanted to be seen as the experienced experts. professionals' self-management support should be focused on coaching patients in developing problem-solving skills, for which practical tools and training are needed.
social_cognition	the sociological interpretation of reality and the processes occurring in it is determined by various approaches to understanding its nature. the diversity of these approaches is eventually reduced to its definition as a reality of the social world, which reflects, on the one hand, objectively existing phenomena and processes and, on the other hand, people 's subjective perceptions about the objective reality. social actuality as objective social reality exists beyond the subject of social cognition, i.e. objectively. each new generation inherits from their parent generations a complex system of economic, social and political structures, institutions, organizations and t5he established relationships which form the social infrastructure of objective reality (social reality). but people perceive directly only the part of objective reality in which they have their own knowledge. due to knowledge of its particular sphere or different objects of reality, people get its more or less adequate subjective perception. therefore, the study of social reality focuses on the process of formation of subjective ideas about the objects of social actuality and attitudes to it, which is included in the subject area of sociology of knowledge. that is, from the standpoint of sociology of knowledge, the research object is not reality, but ideas about the reality. based on subjective perceptions of reality, people construct their own reality. these perceptions change under the influence of various factors affecting the changes in social reality in the process of its formation. a significant change factor is the crisis which affects all spheres of the russian society. the article analyzes the impact of the crisis on the changes in social reality in different population groups in russia and the way it is reflected on people 's attitudes to each other, to family, work and education. based on analysis of data from nationwide studies it has been revealed that there is a contradiction between russians' traditional attitudes to each other, family, work and education and the emerging modern attitudes. amid crisis, this contradiction tends to exacerbate due to the impossibility of maintaining the traditional principles underlying the old way of life, which leads to uncertainty and formation of new forms of certainty through the change in life paradigm.
seasonal_affective_disorder	in the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the individual synaptic constituents of all assessed neurotransmitter systems by subjecting all available in vivo imaging studies on patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (mdd) and bipolar depression (bd) to a retrospective analysis. in acute mdd, findings revealed significant increases of prefrontal and frontal da synthesis, decreases of thalamic and midbrain sert, increases of insular sert, decreases of midbrain 5-ht1a receptors and decreases of pre-frontal, frontal, occipital and cingulate 5-ht2a receptors, whereas, in remission, decreases of striatal d-2 receptors, midbrain sert, frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital and cingulate 5-ht1a receptors and parietal 5-ht2a receptors were observed. in bd, findings indicated a trend towards increased striatal d-2 receptors in depression and mania, decreased striatal da synthesis in remission and decreased frontal d-1 receptors in all three conditions. additionally, there is some evidence that ventrostriatal and hippocampal sert may be decreased in depression, whereas in remission and mania elevations of thalamic and midbrain sert, respectively, were observed. moreover, in depression, limbic 5-ht1a receptors were elevated, whereas in mania a decrease of both cortical and limbic 5-ht2a receptor binding was observed. furthermore, in depression, prefrontal, frontal, occipital and cingulate m2 receptor binding was found to be reduced. from this, a complex pattern of dysregulations within and between neurotransmitter systems may be derived, which is likely to be causally linked not only with the subtype and duration of disease but also with the predominance of individual symptoms and with the kind and duration of pharmacological treatment(s).

leadership	the antibacterial resistance leadership group (arlg) laboratory center (lc) leads the evaluation, development, and implementation of laboratory-based research by providing scientific leadership and supporting standard/specialized laboratory services. the lc has developed a physical biorepository and a virtual biorepository. the physical biorepository contains bacterial isolates from arlg-funded studies located in a centralized laboratory and they are available to arlg investigators. the web-based virtual biorepository strain catalogue includes well-characterized gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains published by arlg investigators. the lc, in collaboration with the arlg leadership and operations center, developed procedures for review and approval of strain requests, guidance during the selection process, and for shipping strains from the distributing laboratories to the requesting investigators. arlg strains and scientific and/or technical guidance have been provided to basic research laboratories and diagnostic companies for research and development, facilitating collaboration between diagnostic companies and the arlg master protocol for evaluating multiple infection diagnostics (mastermind) initiative for evaluation of multiple diagnostic devices from a single patient sampling event. in addition, the lc has completed several laboratory-based studies designed to help evaluate new rapid molecular diagnostics by developing, testing, and applying a mastermind approach using purified bacterial strains. in collaboration with the arlg 's statistical and data management center (sdmc), the lc has developed novel analytical strategies that integrate microbiologic and genetic data for improved and accurate identification of antimicrobial resistance. these novel approaches will aid in the design of future arlg studies and help correlate pathogenic markers with clinical outcomes. the lc 's accomplishments are the result of a successful collaboration with the arlg 's leadership and operations center, diagnostics and devices committee, and sdmc. this interactive approach has been pivotal for the success of lc projects.
nonverbal_communication	autonomous mobile service robots move in our buildings, carrying out different tasks across multiple floors. while moving and performing their tasks, these robots find themselves in a variety of states. although speech is often used for communicating the robot 's state to humans, such communication can often be ineffective. we investigate the use of lights as a persistent visualization of the robot 's state in relation to both tasks and environmental factors. programmable lights offer a large degree of choices in terms of animation pattern, color and speed. we present this space of choices and introduce different animation profiles that we consider to animate a set of programmable lights on the robot. we conduct experiments to query about suitable animations for three representative scenarios of our autonomous symbiotic robot, cobot. ourwork enables cobot tomake its state persistently visible to humans.
child_abuse	intimate partner violence (ipv) and teen dating violence (tdv) are widespread, preventable public health problems in the united states. children exposed to ipv between their caregivers and adolescent victims of tdv suffer not only immediate risks to their physical safety, but also long-term health sequelae. the emergency department presents a unique opportunity for physicians to screen for various forms of family violence and intervene on behalf of the victims. screening for ipv and tdv is widely recommended by national health organizations including the american college of emergency physicians. effective screening protocols require a multidisciplinary approach informed by knowledge of local community resources.
gender_roles	this article introduces a new dataset of historical family characteristics based on ethnographic literature. the novelty of the dataset lies in the fact that it is constructed at the level of the ethnic group. to test the possibilities of the dataset, we construct a measure of family constraints on women 's agency from it and explore its correlation to a number of geographical factors.
problem-solving	using the turkish portion of the programme for international student assessment dataset (n=4,848; 51% boys, 49% girls; age, m=15.81 years, sd=0.28), this study investigated factors associated with mathematics achievement among turkish students. three different models were estimated using the method of balanced repeated replication with fay 's method and taking into account the presence of five plausible values of the dependent variable. results showed that male students and older students had better mathematics proficiency. socio-economic status and school resources also played a significant role in explaining student achievement in mathematics. finally, students who were more open to problem solving, who attributed their failure to external factors, and who were intrinsically motivated to learn mathematics achieved higher scores. policy implications are provided.
prejudice	the tangram help/hurt task is a laboratory-based measure designed to simultaneously assess helpful and hurtful behavior. across five studies we provide evidence that further establishes the convergent and discriminant validity of the tangram help/hurt task. cross-sectional and meta-analytic evidence finds consistently significant associations between helpful and hurtful scores on the tangram task and prosocial and aggressive personality traits. experimental evidence reveals that situational primes known to induce aggressive and prosocial behavior significantly influence helpful and hurtful scores on the tangram help/hurt task. additionally, motivation items in all studies indicate that tangram choices are indeed associated with intent of helping and hurting. we discuss the advantages and limitations of the tangram help/hurt task relative to established measures of helpful and hurtful behavior.

seasonal_affective_disorder	circadian rhythms are strongly associated with affective disorders and recent studies have suggested utilization of diurnal rodents as model animal for circadian rhythms-related domains of these disorders. previous work with the diurnal fat sand rat and nile grass rat demonstrated that short photoperiod conditions result in behavioral changes including anxiety- and depression-like behavior. the present study examined the effect of manipulating day length on activity rhythms and behavior of the diurnal degu. animals were housed for 3 weeks under either a short photoperiod (5-h:19-h ld) or a neutral photoperiod (12-h:12-h ld) and then evaluated by sweet solution test and the forced swim test for depression-like behavior, and in the light/dark box and open field for anxiety-like behavior. results indicate that short photoperiod induced depression-like behavior in the forced swim test and the sweet solution preference test and anxiety-like behavior in the open field compared with animals maintained in a neutral photoperiod. no effects were shown in the light/dark box. short photoperiod-acclimated degu showed reduced total activity duration and activity was not restricted to the light phase. the present study further supports the utilization of diurnal rodents to model circadian rhythms-related affective change. beyond the possible diversity in the mechanisms underlying diurnality in different animals, there are now evidences that in three different diurnal species, the fat sand rat, the grass nile rat and the degu, shortening of photoperiod results in the appearance of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.
person_perception	facial hair, like many masculine secondary sexual traits, plays a significant role in perceptions of an array of sociosexual traits in men. while there is consensus that beards enhance perceptions of masculinity, age, social dominance, and aggressiveness, the perceived attractiveness of facial hair varies greatly across women. given the ease with which facial hair can be groomed and removed entirely, why should some men retain beards and others choose to remove them? we hypothesized that men with relatively sexist attitudes would be more likely to allow their facial hair to grow than men with less sexist attitudes. men from the usa (n = 223) and india (n = 309) completed an online survey measuring demographic variables, ambivalent sexism, and facial hair status. after controlling for demographic variables, men with facial hair were significantly higher in hostile sexism than clean-shaven men; hostile sexism was a significant predictor of facial hair status over and above demographic variables; and facial hair was more frequent among ambivalent and hostile sexists than among benevolent and non-sexists. it is suggested that sexist men choose to grow facial hair because it maximizes sexual dimorphism and augments perceived masculinity and dominance.
person_perception	the current study examines how discrete emotions function in the manifestation of the third-person effect of news coverage of election poll results. an online survey was conducted employing a sample of undergraduate students from the united states (n = 197) and south korea (n = 178) before the 2012 presidential elections in the two countries. results demonstrate that third-person perception is negatively associated with pride, which, in turn, is positively linked to political participation intention only for the supporters of a losing candidate. for u.s. respondents, third-person perception is positively associated with anger, which is positively associated with support for restrictions on polling news. for south korean respondents, the mediation of anxiety between third-person perception and political participation intention is significant for the supporters of a losing candidate. implications of the findings are discussed.
prosocial_behavior	we examined the effects of belief in pure evil (bpe) and belief in pure good (bpg) on perceptions and evaluations of a stereotypically altruistic (vs. egoistic) hero who apprehended a criminal perpetrator. overall, participants appreciably supported formal, public accolades for the altruistic hero because they more greatly deified (i.e., venerated) the altruistic hero. greater levels of bpg were associated with greater deification only of the altruistic hero, and levels of bpg did not predict support for awards or rewards for either hero. levels of bpe were not associated with deification of either the altruistic or egoistic hero, although greater levels of bpe were associated with greater support for rewarding the hero because such individuals more strongly believe that rewards foster prosocial behavior. ultimately, characterizing others as altruistic meaningfully impacts perceptions of their heroic behavior, but preexisting beliefs about good and evil importantly appear to impact such perceptions as well.

schizophrenia	there is a growing body of research focused on the relationship between childhood trauma and the risk of developing psychosis. numerous studies, including many large-scale population-based studies, controlling for possible mediating variables, provide persuasive evidence of a dose-response association and are indicative of a causal relationship. existing evidence supports the specificity model, showing differential associations between particular adversities and clinical symptoms, with cumulative adversity causing less favorable clinical and functional outcomes in psychotic patients. to date, several psychological and biological models have been proposed to search for underlying developmental trajectories leading to the onset of psychosis, influencing psychopathological manifestation and negative functional outcomes due to a history of childhood trauma. in this article, we provide a unified review on the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis by integrating results of epidemiological, clinical, neuropsychological and biological studies. the question whether psychosis with a positive history of childhood trauma should be considered as a new psychotic phenotype, requiring specific therapeutic interventions, warrants further investigation.

attention	omeprazole is one of the world-wide most frequently prescribed and administered pharmaceuticals in humans for the relief of gastro-intestinal disorders. despite its high worldwide consumption, omeprazole is rarely detected in urban wastewaters and environmental waters. on the other hand, its human urinary metabolites and transformation products formed through abiotic processes in the environment have been recently documented. despite these available data, however, there is still a lack of information on the extent of environmental fate and occurrence, on elimination mechanisms and efficiencies in waste water treatment plants. in this study, the relevance of photodegradation processes on the environmental persistence of omeprazole under simulated and solar irradiation was investigated. photodegradation experiments were performed in distilled water, lake, river and seawater, and revealed that the different matrix in natural waters significantly affect the photolytic behavior of the investigated compound. overall, the results highlight that photodegradation process by solar irradiation significantly contributes to omeprazole degradation and elimination from the aquatic environment. tps formed through the process were identified and elucidated by using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry. in total seven tps were identified, among of which four were also detected as hydrolysis tps. the microtox bioassay showed that solar photolysis is efficient to detoxify omeprazole and its tps in aqueous solutions. finally, a systematic investigation was conducted in order to provide information on removal efficiency and occurrence of omeprazole and its metabolites/tps in 8 wwtps in north west greece by performing target and suspect screening analysis. the findings revealed the presence of both parent compound and metabolites/tps in wastewaters. given, however, the scarce detection of omeprazole at fairly low concentration levels, from analytical and environmental point of view, further attention should be given to metabolites/fps instead of the parent compound.

prosocial_behavior	the aim of this study was to test whether the association between belief in a just world (bjw) and internet altruistic behavior (iab) was mediated by gratitude and self-esteem in a sample of chinese undergraduates. a total of 238 participants (aged from 18 to 25) completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire which assessed their bjw, self-esteem, gratitude, and internet altruistic behavior. mplus 7.0 was used to conduct structural equation modeling to estimate direct and indirect effects. path analysis showed that self-esteem and gratitude partially mediated the relationship between bjw and iab. the final model also revealed a significant path from bjw thorough self-esteem and gratitude to iab. limitations and implications for research and practical application of the present study were discussed.

prenatal_development	skeletal muscle satellite cells play a critical role during muscle growth, homoeostasis and regeneration. selective induction of the muscle determination genes myf5, myod and mrf4 during prenatal development can potentially impact on the reported functional heterogeneity of adult satellite cells. accordingly, expression of myf5 was reported to diminish the self-renewal potential of the majority of satellite cells. in contrast, virtually all adult satellite cells showed antecedence of myod activity. here we examine the priming of myogenic cells by mrf4 throughout development. using a cre-lox based genetic strategy and novel highly sensitive pax7 reporter alleles compared to the ubiquitous rosa26-based reporters, we show that all adult satellite cells, independently of their anatomical location or embryonic origin, have been primed for mrf4 expression. given that mrf4(cre) and mrf4(nlacz) are active exclusively in progenitors during embryogenesis, whereas later expression is restricted to differentiated myogenic cells, our findings suggest that adult satellite cells emerge from embryonic founder cells in which the mrf4 locus was activated. therefore, this level of myogenic priming by induction of mrf4, does not compromise the potential of the founder cells to assume an upstream muscle stem cell state. we propose that embryonic myogenic cells and the majority of adult muscle stem cells form a lineage continuum.

schizophrenia	background: recently, it was reported that antipsychotic treatment reverted contactin associated protein-like 3 (caspr3, same as cntnap3) mrna expressions in leukocytes of schizophrenia (scz) subjects to the same levels as healthy controls. caspr3 was expressed in various regions of the mice brain (cortex, frontal lobes, corpus callosum, hippocampus, etc.). thus, this study evaluated caspr3 mrna expression in scz subjects to find a new clue of schizophrenia pathogenesis.methods: one hundred scz subjects and 100 age-matched controls were compared. levels of caspr3 mrna in leukocytes were analysed with a quantitative real-time pcr method using taqman probes.results: caspr3 mrna expression was significantly higher in leukocytes of scz subjects than controls. however, there were no significant correlations between expression level and any clinical parameters in 50 scz subjects.conclusion: considering that caspr3 is involved in building the brain neural network and autophagy in circulating leukocytes, abnormal caspr3 expression in scz subjects may be associated with the pathogenesis of scz.
prejudice	as labor markets become increasingly global, competition among industrialized nations to attract highly skilled workers from abroad has intensified. spurred by concerns over future economic needs caused by the demographic challenges of an aging population, both japan and sweden have joined this global competition. this article examines japanese and swedish immigration policies for highly skilled migrants and compares the highly skilled migrants' experiences in the two countries through interviews with these migrants. despite japan and sweden 's completely different approaches to immigration itself, both countries' policies, as well as the experiences of the skilled migrants, are strikingly similar. highly skilled migrants experience language barriers and prejudice in both countries, making it difficult to build social networks with natives. career development seems to be perceived as a common problem, although less so in sweden, where labor markets are more flexible. overall, these issues reduce both japan 's and sweden 's ability to retain skilled migrants. while they share similarities, sweden 's famed work-life balance and gender equality give it an edge in the competition for skilled migrants, which japan does not share. this comparison identifies which social conditions facilitate or impede skilled migrant settlement.
prejudice	lesbian, gay, and bisexual (lgb) individuals have begun to gain an acceptance that transgender people have yet to achieve. previous literature has found the significant effect of allport 's contact hypothesis on reducing negative attitudes toward lgb individuals. attention has recently turned to the implications of social contact for reduction of transphobic attitudes, with one study demonstrating efficacy. the present study examined the relationships between cisgender heterosexual college students' social contact with transgender individuals, operationalized as number of friendships, and self-reported attitudes and behavioral intentions toward transgender individuals. a sample of 342 undergraduate students at a mid-sized public university completed questions about attitudes and behaviors toward transgender individuals and their transgender friendship experiences. in multivariate analysis of variance, significant differences between participants who reported having zero versus at least one transgender friend across negative intentions, negative attitudes, positive intentions and views, and supportive public intentions toward transgender individuals were found, supporting the contact hypothesis. these findings suggest that having friendships with transgender individuals is associated with reduced prejudice and discrimination and, moreover, greater acceptance and support of transgender people. implications for increasing acceptance of transgender individuals are discussed.
depression	we previously reported that higher education protects against executive dysfunction related to higher body mass index (bmi) in younger, but not older, adults. we now extend the previous analyses to verbal and nonverbal memory. fifty-nine healthy, dementia-free community-dwelling adults ranging in age from 18 to 81years completed the hopkins verbal learning test - revised (hvlt-r) and the brief visuospatial memory test - revised (bvmt-r). self-reported years of education served as a proxy for cognitive reserve. we found that more highly educated individuals maintained their bvmt-r immediate recall performance across the range of bmi, but in less educated individuals, higher bmi was associated with worse performance. our findings suggest that education may play a protective role against bmi-related nonverbal learning deficits, similar to previous reports for verbal memory and executive functioning. results highlight the importance of considering educational background when determining the risk for bmi-related cognitive impairment in clinical settings.
false_memories	confabulation is often observed in amnesic patients after brain damage. however, evidence regarding the relationship between confabulation and other neuropsychological functions is scarce. in addition, previous studies have proposed two possibilities of the relationship between confabulation and false memory, in which patients with confabulation are likely to retrieve false memories, or confabulations are relatively independent of false memories. the present study investigated how confabulation is related to various cognitive functions, including orientation, attention, frontal lobe function, memory, and mental status, and to false memories, as assessed by the deese-roediger-mcdermott (drm) paradigm. patients with organic amnesia participated, and confabulations were evaluated using the confabulation battery. amnestic patients were classified into two groups: confabulating (cp) and nonconfabulating patients (ncp). the cp group was significantly impaired in time orientation, attention, and verbal memory, compared to the ncp group and age-matched healthy controls (hc). results of the drm paradigm revealed no significant difference in false memory retrieval induced by critical lures across cp, ncp, and hc groups. confabulating responses in organic amnesia could be in part induced by disturbance of time consciousness and attention control in severe impairment of verbal memories, and confabulation and false memory could be modulated by different cognitive systems.
prejudice	meinong 's thought has been rediscovered in recent times by analytic philosophy: his object theory has significant consequences in formal ontology, and especially his account of impossible objects has proved itself to be decisive in a wide range of fields, from logic up to ontology of fiction. rejecting the traditional 'prejudice in favour of the real', meinong investigates what there is not: a peculiar non-existing object is precisely the fictional object, which exemplifies a number of properties (like sherlock holmes, who lives in baker street and is an outstanding detective) without existing in the same way as flesh-and-blood detectives do. fictional objects are in some sense incomplete objects, whose core of constituent properties is not completely determined. now, what does it imply to hold that a fictional object may also occur in true statements? we shall deal with the objections raised by russell and quine against meinong 's view, pointing out limits and advantages of both perspectives.
depression	background: neuroimaging, immunologic, and pharmacologic studies have emphasized the role of 5-ht2a and 5-ht3a serotonin receptors in the pathophysiology of major depression.aim: the aim of this study was to measure the relative expression of 5-ht2a and 5-ht3a receptor mrna in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of patients with major depressive disorder (mdd).method: 5-ht2a and 5-ht3a receptor mrna expressions were examined in pbmcs of 25 medication-naive-patients with mdd, 25 medication-free mdd patients, and 25 healthy controls. 5-ht2a and 5-ht3a receptor mrna expressions were measured using real-time quantitative pcr. this study evaluated patients' clinical symptoms using the hamilton depression rating scale-17 items (hdrs) and the beck depression inventory (bdi).results: relative 5-htr2a mrna expression was significantly higher in pbmcs of all mdd patients when compared with healthy controls (z = -3.875, p0.05). mdd patients showed significant correlations between 5-htr2a mrna expression and hdrs scores (rs=0.902, p<0.001) and bdi scores (rs=0.878, p<0.001).conclusion: this study showed that depressed patients, irrespective of treatment, have higher 5-htr2a mrna levels in pbmcs than healthy subjects. it also provided evidence that 5-htr2a mrna levels in pbmcs of mdd patients could be associated with the severity of depression and the duration of the illness.
attention	this paper draws attention to a fundamental problem for a version of the tracing strategy defended by a number of theorists in the current literature (rosen in philos perspect 18(1):295-313, 2004; fischer and tognazzini in noa >>s, 43(3):531-556, 2009). i argue that versions of the tracing strategy that require reasonable foreseeability (rather than actual foresight) are in tension with the view that blameless ignorance excuses. a stronger version of the tracing strategy (i.e., one that requires actual foresight) is consistent with the view that blameless ignorance excuses and is therefore preferable for those tracing theorists who wish to continue maintaining that it does.
prosocial_behavior	previous research mostly defines the benefits of work as the absence of unemployment 's negative outcomes or as benefits to employers, such as increased productivity. this study uses mixed methods to investigate the ways that work can enhance the well-being of the worker. two hundred and two participants from a rural area participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. participants' qualitative discussions of work in the interviews were coded with grounded theory. the majority (74.8 %) of participants mentioned work at least once during the interview, which focused on prominent moments in their life stories, and 53.3 % of work mentions were positive. two main themes encompassing the protective benefits of work arose: self-oriented benefits and other-oriented benefits. each main theme was further divided into three subthemes. self-oriented subthemes were autonomy, personal development, and empowerment; other-oriented subthemes were providing for dependents, generativity, and helping others. participants spoke about how each of these benefits enhances their well-being and happiness. the empowerment subtheme was positively correlated with workplace integration and negatively correlated with financial strain. this study uncovered protective benefits of work that have not been addressed by previous scholarship. qualitative data provided the flexibility to explore work-related domains for which quantitative scales do not currently exist. work is one of the main activities of most adults, and the study of the psychological benefits of work can improve our understanding of adult well-being and happiness.
leadership	appraisal interviews (ais) are one of the most commonly used human resource practices in organizations. however, they are often criticized for comprising conflicting purposes. in this study, we focus on contextual factors of the appraisal process. specifically, we propose that ais follow a two-phase model of performance evaluation and development planning. these two phases trigger different levels of employee appraisal participation which, in turn, affects employees' perception of voice. in a sample of 48 audiotaped ais, we coded employees' objective appraisal participation throughout the entire interview session and linked it to subsequent ratings of perceived voice. results showed that interviews were highly leader-centered and mainly concentrated on performance evaluation. employees' appraisal participation was significantly lower during performance evaluation than during development planning. appraisal participation during development planning, but not during performance evaluation, was related to subsequent ratings of perceived voice. in addition, this relationship was moderated by supervisor trust.
eating_disorders	aim: the aims of this study were to determine whether the serum levels of precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (probdnf), mature bdnf (mbdnf), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) are altered in patients with eating disorders (ed), including anorexia nervosa (an) and bulimia nervosa (bn), and to explore whether those levels are associated with decision-making abilities. methods: nineteen women with an, 28 women with bn, and 22 age-matched healthy control women (hc) were enrolled in the current study. all participants had their decision-making abilities assessed using the iowa gambling task (igt). their eating-related pathophysiology and depressive/anxiety symptoms were also evaluated. results: the mmp-9 level in an was significantly lower than that in either bn or hc, but the serum levels of probdnf and mbdnf did not differ among the three groups. investigation of the serum levels of probdnf and mmp-9 in patients with ed and controls revealed a significant correlation between them. in the bn, there were positive correlations between mbdnf level and igt performance and also between mmp-9 level and igt performance, but these correlations did not occur in an. the mmp-9 level was positively associated with the symptom scale, one of the subscales of the bulimic investigatory test, edinburgh, only in an. conclusion: these results suggest that the serum level of mmp-9 plays a role in the pathophysiology of an, and both the serum levels of mbdnf and mmp-9 may be associated with decision-making abilities in patients with bn.
gender_roles	the tradition of the wife adopting her husband 's surname continues to be widely endorsed within the u.s. and many other nations. the current research focuses on perceptions of heterosexual women who violate this tradition. specifically, we examined how women who retain their surname are evaluated with respect to their marriage commitment and personality attributes. we also tested for sources of individual variation in these evaluations. three studies were carried out with a total of 1201 undergraduates (912 women and 289 men) at two u.s. universities. participants in study 1 rated a woman who retained her surname as lower in marriage commitment than a woman who adopted her husband 's surname. they also allocated her a high proportion of agentic traits. studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that both women and men high in social dominance orientation (sdo) were especially likely to rate a woman who retained her surname as lower in marriage commitment. collectively, findings indicate that women who violate the marital surname tradition may encounter negative stereotypes about their marriage commitment and that these stereotypes may be particularly likely to originate from people with a preference for group-based inequality. implications center on links between marriage traditions and broader patterns of gender inequality.
social_cognition	introduction: being able to understand other people 's emotions and intentions is crucial for social interactions and well-being. deficits in theory of mind (tom) functioning hamper this ability and have been observed in depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. however, results of previous research in depression have been inconclusive, possibly due to the presence of comorbid disorders and the disregarding of other modulating factors. methods: thirty-eight patients with a major depressive disorder (mdd) and forty healthy matched controls were assessed with a tom task using animated triangles. results were correlated with attachment styles, empathy abilities and neurocognitive performance. results: our findings show that 1) healthy female controls performed significantly stronger on the tom task than female mdd patients, 2) these performance differences were driven by attachment styles and 3) depression severity did not impact task performance. limitations: the pharmacological treatment of the majority of patients might limit the generalizability of this study. discussion: results indicate a gender-specific impact of attachment styles on tom performance. future studies should investigate whether impairments in social cognitive tasks pose a risk factor for depression and/or interactional styles or vice versa. moreover, with regard to remediation programs gender-specific needs should be taken into account.
media_violence	recent research reveals that playing prosocial video games increases prosocial cognitions and helpful behaviors [gentile el al., 2009; greitemeyer and osswald, 2009; 2010; 2011]. these results are consistent with social-cognitive models of social behavior [e.g., the general learning model, buckley and anderson, 2006]. the social-cognitive learning models suggest that in addition to influencing cognitions, media content may also influence affect. however, past studies on prosocial video games have failed to find a significant effect on affective measures [greitemeyer and osswald, 2010]. the present research examined the effects of prosocial, neutral, and violent video games on state hostility and positive affect. also examined were moderating effects of trait aggressiveness, trait altruistic helping, and trait egoistic helping. prosocial games reduced state hostility and increased positive state affect. violent video games had the opposite effects. these effects were moderated by trait physical aggression. altruistic participants reported relatively more positive affect and less state hostility. egoistic participants reported relatively more aggravated and mean feelings. aggr. behav. 38:263271, 2012.

seasonal_affective_disorder	the physical mechanism by which light is absorbed in the eye and has antidepressant and energizing effects in seasonal affective disorder and other forms of psychiatric major depression is of scientific interest. this study was designed to explore one specific aspect of a proposed humoral phototransduction mechanism, namely that carbon monoxide (co) levels increase in retinal venous blood in response to bright light. eleven mature male pigs approximately six months of age were kept for 7 days in darkness and fasted for 12 h prior to surgery. following mild sedation, anesthesia was induced. silstic catheters were inserted into the dorsal nasal vein through the angular vein of the eye to reach the ophthalmic sinus, from which venous blood outfiowing from the eye area was collected. the animals were exposed to 5000 lx of fluorescent-generated white light. co levels in the blood were analyzed by gas chromatography before and after 80 min of light exposure. at baseline, mean co levels in the retinal venous blood were 0.43 0.05 (se) nmol/ml. after bright light, mean co levels increased to 0.54 0.06 nmol/ml (two-tailed t-test p < 0.05). this study provides preliminary mammalian evidence that acute bright light exposure raises carbon monoxide levels in ophthalmic venous blood.

seasonal_affective_disorder	objective: daylight is an important zeitgeber for entraining the circadian rhythm to a 24 h clock cycle, especially within the polar circle, which has long polar nights several months each year. phase delays in sleep timing may occur, but the mean shift is normally small. however, the individual variation in phase shifts is large, implicating moderating factors. here we examined the role of several self-regulatory variables (mood and fatigue, behavioral habits, and psychological self-regulation) as moderators of seasonality in sleep timing and chronotype. methods: a sample of 162 young adults (76% females; mean age: females 23.4 years, males 24.3 years) participated in a prospective study across three seasons (september, december, march) in tromso/norway at 69 degrees 39'n. sleep diary and sleep/health-related questionnaire data were collected at each time-point. results: sleep timing and chronotype were delayed during the dark period (december) compared with brighter photoperiods (september and march). comparable effects were observed for insomnia, fatigue, mood (depression and anxiety), subjective health complaints, physical activity, and school-related stress. most importantly, depression and fatigue moderated the degree of seasonal shifting in sleep timing, whereas the other self-regulation indicators did not (ie eating habits, physical activity, and psychological self-regulation). conclusion: seasonality in sleep timing and chronotype was confirmed, and it seems that depressive symptoms during the dark period exacerbate phase-shifting problems for people living in sub-arctic regions.

attention	the purpose of this study was to determine whether the superior colliculus (sc) of the microbat has the same neurochemical makeup as that of other mammals. we examined the organization of choline acetyltransferase (chat)- and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (th-ir) fibers/cells using standard immunohistochemistry with antibodies against chat and th. chat-ir fibers observed in the superficial layers were denser than those in the deeper layers, and these fibers were classified into two types: small varicose fibers and large varicose fibers. chat-ir cells were predominantly located in the superficial layers with diverse morphologies. among the well-known sources of cholinergic fibers in the mammalian sc, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (pptn) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (ldtn) contained strongly labeled chat-ir cells, while no cholinergic structures were found in the parabigeminal nucleus (pbg) in the microbat brain. th-immunoreactivity was found within fibers but not within cells. the density of th-ir fibers was high in the zonal layer, moderate in the superficial gray and optic layers, and low in the deeper layers. well-labeled th-ir cells were also observed within area 13 and the locus coeruleus, known as the sources of catecholaminergic fibers in other mammalian sc. although there are some cytoarchitectural variations among species, our results clearly showed elaborately organized chat-ir and th-ir fibers/cells in the microbat sc. our findings will contribute significantly to the understanding of actively constructed microbat visual systems.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objectives. low serum bdnf levels have been found in depressed patients. no study has systematically investigated whether individual symptoms or symptom profiles within a depressed population contribute to low bdnf levels found in depressed subjects. methods. all 1070 patients with a past 6-month diagnosis of major depressive disorder from the netherlands study of depression and anxiety (nesda) were included. composite international diagnostic interview (cidi) and inventory of depressive symptoms (ids) items were tested individually in separate multiple regression analyses with serum bdnf level as the dependent and the cidi or ids item as independent variable. subsequently, we compared bdnf levels between patients with seasonal affective disorder (based on the seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire) and melancholic depression, atypical depression and moderate depression (based on a latent class analysis). all analyses were adjusted for confounders. results. only one item was significantly associated with serum bdnf levels, namely the cidi item ""loss of interest"" (beta = 0.14; p < 0.01). counterintuitively the presence of this symptom was associated with higher bdnf levels. other items and the comparison between different types of depression did not reveal significant differences. conclusions. decreased serum bdnf levels in depression cannot be attributed to a specific symptom or symptom cluster.
gender_roles	the recent world economic crises have accelerated the integration of women into the labor force. this has represented a new challenge in the achievement of work-family balance. the aim of the present study was to analyze the extent to which the feasibility to conciliate work and family influence career choice and the level of women employment from mexico and spain. in order to achieve this, data from the family and changing gender roles iv international research project was analyzed by using a multinomial logistic regression model. occupation was treated as the dependent variable while socioeconomic characteristics, stereotypes, gender roles and household division of labor were treated as independent variables. the main findings indicate that the lack of work-family conciliation increases the likelihood of women 's participation as housewives in both countries. the international comparison showed that gender bias and asymmetry in household division of labor did not lead to extra-domestic work. however, this activity was consistent with traditional gender roles that associate women with child rearing. we conclude that even though mexico and spain share certain cultural canons, these countries have differences in the way of conceptualizing the conciliation of family and work, which are also reflected in a differentiated regulatory framework.
antisocial_personality_disorder	objective:the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between alexithymia and aggression among men with substance dependence. in addition, we wanted to control the effect of variables such as depression and anxiety on this relationship. methods: participants were 200 consecutively admitted substance-dependent inpatients. patients were assessed with the toronto alexithymia scale-20, the buss-perry aggression questionnaire, the beck depression inventory and the state-trait anxiety inventory. results: of the substance-dependent inpatients, 34.0% (n=68) constituted a group suffering from alexithymia. rates of being unemployed, being married, duration of education, and current age did not differ between the groups, whereas age at onset of regular substance use was lower in the group with alexithymia. the alexithymic group had higher scores of aggression, depression, as well as trait and state anxieties. a hierarchical linear regression analysis demonstrated that the difficulty in identifying feelings (dif) factor of alexithymia was related with aggression, although chronic anxiety contributed to this relationship particularly in the anger and hostility dimensions of aggression. conclusion: trait dif may be directly related with aggression, whereas state dif may be a way of coping among those with chronic anxiety and may be indirectly related with cognitive and affective components of aggression. the relevance of these relationships for prevention and treatment of substance dependents deserves interest in further research.
child_abuse	commercial sexual exploitation of children (csec) is associated with child abuse, neglect, poverty, homelessness, and societal causes. sex trafficking is the participation in commercial sex acts in which force, fraud, or coercion occur. this article discusses the scope of csec and sex trafficking, and the necessary identification skills and medical evaluations needed to help these patients.
seasonal_affective_disorder	chronobiological therapies for mood disorders include manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle such as sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance and the controlled exposure to light and darkness. their antidepressant efficacy can overcome drug resistance and targets the core depressive symptoms including suicide, thus making them treatment options to be tried either alone or as adjunctive treatments combined with common psychopharmacological interventions. the specific pattern of mood change observed with chronobiological therapies is characterized by rapid and sustained effects, when used among themselves or combined with drugs. effects sizes are the same reported for the most effective psychiatric treatments, but side effects are usually marginal or absent. new treatment protocols are developed to adapt them in different clinical settings. this review deals with the general principles of clinical chronobiology and the latest findings in this rapidly developing field.
prosocial_behavior	across two studies, we found evidence supporting a positive feedback loop between positive activities, kindness and well-being. in study 1, participants were randomly assigned to one of four distinct positive activities (versus a neutral writing activity) before spending three weeks engaging in kind acts. we found that the positive activities served as triggers - that is, they predicted greater prosocial effort, which in turn predicted greater well-being immediately following the intervention and at a two-week follow-up. in study 2, we explored the specific effects of a gratitude trigger, and extended the intervention period to six weeks. although, we did not replicate the direct effect of the gratitude trigger on prosocial effort, people who wrote gratitude letters (versus writing about their week) reported relatively greater elevation, which predicted greater prosocial effort during the six weeks. in turn, replicating study 1, greater effort predicted higher well-being immediately following the study.
eating_disorders	evidence suggests that both dissociation and negative affect (na) may precipitate binge eating. the extent to which dissociation may impact the experience of na around binge eating is unclear. women with bulimia nervosa completed a 2-week ecological momentary assessment protocol of dissociation, na, and binge eating. multilevel modeling was used to examine dissociation as a moderator of na before and after binge eating. na was greater at the time of binge eating for participants higher in average dissociation (between subjects) and when momentary dissociation was greater than one 's average (within subjects). the trajectory of na was characterized by a sharper increase before binge eating for participants higher in average dissociation; the na trajectories were characterized by sharper increases before and decreases after binge eating when momentary dissociation was greater than one 's average. results support the salience of both dissociation and na in relation to the occurrence of binge eating.
eating_disorders	the aim of this study was to examine whether compulsive exercise mediates the relationship between clinical perfectionism and eating pathology, based on the cognitive behavioral model of compulsive exercise. participants were 368 adults who participated regularly in sport/exercise and completed online measures of perfectionism, compulsive exercise and eating disorders. in support of the well-established link between perfectionism and eating disorders, clinical perfectionism predicted eating pathology both directly and indirectly mediated by compulsive exercise. in addition, there were also direct effects of clinical perfectionism on the avoidance/rule-driven behavior, weight control, and mood improvement subscales of the compulsive exercise test (cet). there was a direct effect of the cet weight control subscale on eating pathology and a negative direct effect of the cet sub scale mood improvement on eating pathology. findings lend support to the cognitive behavioral model of compulsive exercise in which clinical perfectionism is conceptualized as related to eating disorders directly and indirectly through the mediation of compulsive exercise. compulsive exercise was also found to have a direct effect on eating disorders. compulsive exercise may be a symptom of eating pathology, rather than an antecedent, however causal inferences could not be established given the correlational design. longitudinal research using cross-lagged panel designs to examine a bidirectional relationship between compulsive exercise and eating disorders is needed.

depression	this study included 168 and 85 mother-infant dyads from asian and united states of america cohorts to examine whether a genomic profile risk score for major depressive disorder (gprs(mdd)) moderates the association between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms (or socio-economic status, ses) and fetal neurodevelopment, and to identify candidate biological processes underlying such association. both cohorts showed a significant interaction between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and infant gprs(mdd) on the right amygdala volume. the asian cohort also showed such interaction on the right hippocampal volume and shape, thickness of the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. likewise, a significant interaction between ses and infant gprs(mdd) was on the right amygdala and hippocampal volumes and shapes. after controlling for each other, the interaction effect of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and gprs(mdd) was mainly shown on the right amygdala, while the interaction effect of ses and gprs(mdd) was mainly shown on the right hippocampus. bioinformatic analyses suggested neurotransmitter/neurotrophic signaling, snap receptor complex, and glutamate receptor activity as common biological processes underlying the influence of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms on fetal cortico-limbic development. these findings suggest gene-environment interdependence in the fetal development of brain regions implicated in cognitive-emotional function. candidate biological mechanisms involve a range of brain region-specific signaling pathways that converge on common processes of synaptic development.
gender_roles	the current study investigates how descriptive and prescriptive gender norms that communicate work and family identities to be (in)compatible with gender identities limit or enhance young men and womens family and career aspirations. results show that young adults (n = 445) perceived gender norms to assign greater compatibility between female and family identities and male and work identities than vice versa, and that young men and women mirror their aspirations to this traditional division of tasks. spill-over effects of norms across life domains and cross-over effects of norms across gender-groups indicated that young women, more than young men, aimed to have it all: mirroring their career ambitions to a male career model, while keeping their family aspirations high. moreover, young women opposed traditional role divisions in the family domain by decreasing their family aspirations in face of norms of lower family involvement or higher career involvement of men. conversely, in line with traditional gender roles, young men showed lower family aspirations in the face of strong male career norms; and showed increases in their career aspirations when perceiving women to take up more family roles. young mens family aspirations were, however, more influenced by new norms prescribing men to invest more in their family, suggesting opportunities for change. together, these findings show that through social norms, young adults gender identity affects aspirations for how to manage the co-presence of their work and family identities. altering these norms may provide leverage for change to allow both men and women to combine their multiple identities in an enriching way.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: despite considerable progress in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), a large percentage of individuals remain symptomatic following gold-standard therapies. one route to improving care is examining affective disturbances that involve other emotions beyond fear and threat. a growing body of research has implicated shame in ptsd 's development and course, although to date no review of this specific literature exists. this scoping review investigated the link between shame and ptsd and sought to identify research gaps. methods: a systematic database search of pubmed, psycinfo, embase, cochrane, and cinahl was conducted to find original quantitative research related to shame and ptsd. results: forty-seven studies met inclusion criteria. review found substantial support for an association between shame and ptsd as well as preliminary evidence suggesting its utility as a treatment target. several design limitations and under-investigated areas were recognized, including the need for a multimodal assessment of shame and more longitudinal and treatment-focused research. conclusion: this review provides crucial synthesis of research to date, highlighting the prominence of shame in ptsd, and its likely relevance in successful treatment outcomes. the present review serves as a guide to future work into this critical area of study.
attention	recent environmental and economic considerations have made the focus of attention new treatment processes of the residual (tail) gas of claus plants, based on the oxidative decomposition of h2s to sulphur and hydrogen, in this work, the thermal, oxidative decomposition of h2s in an homogeneous phase has been studied by developing a comprehensive chemical kinetic model for the oxidation of h2s in a low oxygen atmosphere, by varying the o-2/h2s ratio (0.2-0.35), residence time (150-300 ms), and process temperatures (900-1100 c-omicron). the kinetic model has been developed by combining existing models for the oxidation of h2s, with no tuning of the parameters or kinetic constants and validated in relation to the experimental data. the results show a very good agreement with the experimental values at higher temperatures (1100 c-omicron). at 900 c-omicron, the h2s conversion is well predicted by the model, whereas the h-2 yield and so2 selectivity are consistently higher than the experimental values. a sensitivity analysis for the complex kinetic system has highlighted the importance of the reaction (o-2 + so + so) at lower temperatures.

eating_disorders	objectivethe objective is to evaluate a body and movement-oriented intervention on aggression regulation, specifically aimed towards reducing anger internalization in patients with an eating disorder. methodpatients were randomized to treatment-as-usual (tau) plus the intervention (n=38) or to tau only (n=32). the intervention was delivered by a psychomotor therapist. tau consisted of multidisciplinary day treatment (3-5days per week during 3-9months). anger coping (self-expression and control scale) and eating pathology (eating disorder examination-self-report questionnaire) were measured at baseline and follow-up. differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention scores were tested by using repeated measures anova. resultsthe intervention group showed a significantly larger decrease of anger internalization than the control group ((2)=0.16, p=0.001). both groups showed a significant reduction in eating pathology, but differences between groups were not significant. discussiona body and movement-oriented therapy seems a viable add-on for treating anger internalization in patients with an eating disorder. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd and eating disorders association.
problem-solving	the theory of inventive problem solving (triz) is one of emerging creative problem solving methodologies. this paper proposes a way to simplify triz for electrical domain usage, while making it feel less complex, more relevant and understand able for users in a specific sector. this research takes dynamic voltage restorer (dvr) device as a case from electrical engineering domain, to demonstrate the proposed triz based guidance framework development which will assist in solving problems of dvr devices. the proposed sector specific guidelines in particular segment of electrical engineering (e.g. power quality device dvr) will be closer, more comprehensible and particularly linked to key parameters of that sector. by using the derived guidance framework, field engineers with very basic triz knowledge may apply triz confidently for design and problem solving purpose.
child_abuse	objective. physicians have an ethical and legal mandate to identify abused children so that they may be protected from further harm and are simultaneously required to think broadly and objectively about differential diagnoses. the medical literature is replete with examples of medical diseases that mimic abuse, potentially leading to misdiagnoses and subsequent harm to children and families. conclusion. this review highlights some of the common and uncommon diseases that mimic physical and sexual abuse of children.
borderline_personality_disorder	borderline personality disorder (bpd) is a severe, challenging to treat mental disorder. schema therapy (st) as an individual therapy has been proven to be an effective psychological treatment for bpd. a group format of st (gst) has been developed and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in the united states and piloted in the netherlands. these results suggest that gst speeds up and amplifies treatment effects of st and might reduce delivery costs. however, feasibility in the german health care system and with bpd patients with high bpd severity and comorbidity, and frequent hospitalization, has not been tested to date. we investigated gst in 10 severely impaired, highly comorbid female patients with bpd, that needed frequent hospital admission. patients received an outpatient st-treatment program with weekly group and individual sessions for 1 year. outcome measures including bpd severity, general psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, quality of life, happiness, schemas, and modes, and days of hospitalization were assessed at the start of treatment and 6, 12, and 36 months later with semi-structured interviews and self-report measures. we observed significant decreases in severity of bpd symptoms, general symptom severity, dysfunctional bpd-specific modes and schemas, and days of hospitalization. functional modes, quality of live and happiness improved. the results of this feasibility study are promising and encourage further implementation of st outpatient treatment programs even for patients with severe bpd and high hospitalization risk. however, small sample size and the missing of a control group do not allow the generalizability of these findings.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the present study investigated the impact of diagnostic labels and traits, age, and gender of the defendant on various mock juror decisions. undergraduate students and members of the community (n=247) read a simulated trial transcript involving a case of aggravated assault. the transcript differed in terms of diagnosis (psychopathy vs. antisocial personality disorder (apd)/conduct disorder (cd) vs. no diagnosis), age (15 vs. 30), and gender (male vs. female) of the defendant. the effects of these variables on decisions regarding credibility, verdict choice, risk of future violence and recidivism, and treatment amenability were investigated. results indicated that psychopathic defendants were rated as being less credible than defendants in the other diagnostic conditions. defendants described as psychopaths and as having apd/cd were also more likely to be found guilty and were more likely to receive higher ratings of risk for future violence/recidivism regardless of their age and gender. there were no significant main effects or interactions concerning the age and gender variables. implications for the use of psychopathy evidence within the criminal justice system are discussed.
child_abuse	parental maltreatment of children has been steadily increasing in korea despite national efforts to curb it. children and adolescents who experience maltreatment develop psychological and social maladjustment. therefore, mediating variables alleviating the negative effects of parental maltreatment on child development should be investigated to develop effective intervention programs. we identified the direct effects of parental abuse and neglect on adolescents' school adjustment and the mediating effects of adolescents' self-esteem and peer attachment on the relationships between parental abuse and neglect and their school adjustment. we used data from 2351 middle school students who participated in the korean children and youth panel survey. structural equation modeling revealed the following: child neglect directly and negatively related with adolescents' school adjustment, whereas child abuse did not. further, while adolescents' self-esteem and peer attachment mediated the relationship between child neglect and school adjustment, adolescents' self-esteem alone mediated the relationship between child abuse and school adjustment. these findings imply that there is a need to develop different intervention programs based on child maltreatment types. finally, we suggested that the negative effects of parental neglect on adolescents' school adjustment could be alleviated by adolescents' self-esteem recovery resulting from peer support. on the other hand, in the case of adolescents experiencing parental abuse, self-esteem recovery through education and counseling provided by teachers or respected adults could be prioritized.
attention	researchers are concerned with identifying the risk and protective factors associated with adolescents' involvement in cyberharassment. one such factor is parental mediation of children 's electronic technology use. little attention has been given to how different parental mediation strategies (i.e., instructive, restrictive, co-viewing) relate to adolescents' cyberharassment (i.e., cyberbullying, cybertrolling) perpetration and victimization, and how gender might impact these associations. to this end, the present study examined the moderating effect of gender on the longitudinal association between parental mediation strategies and adolescents' cyberharassment involvement. this focus was examined using a sample of 568 (53% female) adolescents from the 8th grade in the united states. the association between restrictive mediation and cybervictimization was more positive for girls when compared to boys, while the relationship between instructive mediation and cybervictimization was more negative for girls than for boys. the findings underscore the importance of considering parents in adolescents' cyberharassment involvement.

prosocial_behavior	despite extensive literature on parental monitoring, few studies have focused on father-youth solicitation in particular and none on solicitation via communication technology. to address this gap, this study explored the relationships between fathers' online and in-person solicitation of their adolescent and emerging adult children, and the youth 's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. a sample of us fathers (n = 158) reported on solicitation patterns, use of technology, and their child 's behaviors. the results revealed differences by demographics, and an inverse trend between online and in-person solicitation in relation to internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. regression analyses revealed that online solicitation of information from the youth 's friends was related to greater internalizing and externalizing, and less prosocial behavior. these findings support research suggesting that some forms of online solicitation may be interpreted by adolescents and emerging adults as intrusive and a violation of privacy.
prosocial_behavior	research has consistently indicated that higher levels of materialism are associated with reduced wellbeing. currently, no studies have examined the underlying epistemic or metaphysical factors that may contribute to materialism and wellbeing. the current study used structural equation modelling to investigate the indirect influence of epistemic style and holistic/mechanistic perspectives on wellbeing via materialism and regulation. the first study (n = 397) indicated that an epistemic orientation towards complex (i.e., intellective position) rather than expedient, effortless (i.e., default position) thinking was directly associated with reduced materialism, which resulted in greater autonomous regulation, and subsequently to increased wellbeing. these findings were replicated in a second study (n = 214), which also suggested that higher levels of holism were indirectly associated with increased wellbeing.

social_cognition	communication between cortical regions is necessary for optimal cognitive processing. functional relationships between cortical regions can be inferred through measurements of temporal synchrony in spontaneous activity patterns. these relationships can be further elaborated by surveying effects of cortical lesions upon inter-regional connectivity. lesions to cortical hubs and heteromodal association regions are expected to induce distributed connectivity changes and higher-order cognitive deficits, yet their functional consequences remain relatively unexplored. here, we used resting-state fmri to investigate intrinsic functional connectivity (fc) and graph theoretical metrics in 12 patients with circumscribed lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) portion of the default network (dn), and compared these metrics with those observed in healthy matched comparison participants and a sample of 1139 healthy individuals. despite significant mpfc destruction, patients did not demonstrate weakened intrinsic fc among undamaged dn nodes. instead, network-specific changes were manifested as weaker negative correlations between the dn and attentional and somatomotor networks. these findings conflict with the dn being a homogenous system functionally anchored at mpfc. rather, they implicate a role for mpfc in mediating cross-network functional interactions. more broadly, our data suggest that lesions to association cortical hubs might induce clinical deficits by disrupting communication between interacting large-scale systems.
depression	sleep problems are common in chronic disorders like diabetes and are the result of poor diet and unhealthy lifestyles. comprehensive management of diabetes entails lifestyle management and restoration of good habits. sleep hygiene maintenance helps persons living with diabetes enjoy a better quality of life by restoring normal sleep patterns and thereby improving glycaemic control.
person_perception	across six studies, we examine how the magnitude of expressed happiness influences social perception and interpersonal behavior. we find that happiness evokes different judgments when expressed at high levels than when expressed at moderate levels, and that these judgments influence opportunistic behavior. specifically, people perceive very happy individuals to be more naive than moderately happy individuals. these perceptions reflect the belief that very happy individuals shelter themselves from negative information about the world. as a result of these inferences, very happy people, relative to moderately happy people, are more likely to receive biased advice from advisors with a conflict of interest and are more likely to be chosen as negotiation partners when the opportunity for exploitation is salient. our findings challenge existing assumptions in organizational behavior and psychology by identifying a significant disadvantage of expressing happiness, and underscore the importance of examining emotional expressions at different magnitudes. we call for future work to explore how the same emotion, experienced or expressed at different levels, influences judgment and behavior.

nonverbal_communication	alcohol dependent patients (ads) are known to encounter severe interpersonal problems. nonverbal communication skills are important for the development of healthy relationships. the present study aimed to explore emotional facial expression (efe) recognition and posed and spontaneous efe expressivity in male ads divided into two groups according to cloninger 's typology and the impact of their interpersonal relationship quality on the potential nonverbal deficits. twenty type i ads, twenty-one type ii ads, and twenty control participants took part in an efe recognition task and an efe expressivity task that considered personal emotional events (spontaneous expressivity) and efe in response to a photo or word cue (posed expressivity). coding was based on judges' ratings of participants' emotional facial expressions. participants additionally completed a questionnaire on interpersonal relationship quality. no difference between the three groups emerged in the efe recognition task. type ii ads showed heightened deficits compared with type i ads in efe expressivity: judges perceived less accurate posed efe in response to a cue word and less intense and positive spontaneous efe in type ii ads compared to control participants. in addition, type ii ads reported more relationship difficulties compared to both type i ads and control participants. these interpersonal relationship difficulties were related to some of the efe expressivity deficits of ad-iis. this study underlines the important differences between the interpersonal functioning of ad subtypes.
seasonal_affective_disorder	introduction. - bipolar disorders (bd) are frequent mood disorders associated with a poor prognosis mainly due to a high relapse rate. depressive relapses may follow a seasonal cyclicality, and bright-light therapy (blt) has been established as the treatment of choice for seasonal affective disorder (sad). the use of blt for seasonal unipolar depression is well known, but the scientific literature is much poorer on the management of seasonal depressive episodes in bd. in addition, some specificities related to bd must be taken into account. methods. - we conducted a comprehensive review using medline and google scholar databases up to august 2014 using the following keywords combination: ""bipolar disorder"" and ""light therapy"" or ""phototherapy"". papers were included in the review if (a) they were published in an english or french-language peer-reviewed journal; (b) the study enrolled patients with bd and sad; and (c) the diagnosis was made according to the dsm or icd criteria. results. - blt was considered among the first-line treatments for sad with a size effect similar to antidepressants. most of the studies did not distinguish between patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders. however, it has been demonstrated that the most significant risk of blt in patients with bd is the mood shift. thus, the most important therapeutic adaptation corresponds to the use of an effective mood stabilizer, as with any antidepressant. another therapeutic adaptation in first intention is that the times of exposure to light should be shifted from morning to midday. this review also includes therapeutic guidelines regarding the management of blt in seasonal bipolar depressive episodes. discussion. - there are very few specific data on seasonal bipolar depressive episodes. this literature review has highlighted that blt should be handled as a regular antidepressant treatment in patients suffering from seasonal bipolar depressive episodes.

leadership	given the potential dangers of unethical decisions in the workplace, it has become increasingly important for managers to hire, and promote into leadership positions, those who are morally inclined. behavioral ethics research has contributed to this effort by examining an array of individual difference variables (e.g., locus of control) that play a role in morality. however, past research has focused mostly on direct causal effects and not so much on the processes (including mediation) through which different factors, especially those that are morality based, decrease unethical choices. the purpose of the current research is to examine the process, which includes both subconscious and conscious decision pathways, through which moral attentiveness curbs unethical decision making at the individual level. the findings of a study employing about 200 participants and a cheating task reveal that both accurate ethical prototypes and moral awareness of the situation decreased unethical decisions, and moral attentiveness was found to be positively related to both of these constructs. in addition, having accurate ethical prototypes was found to be a partial mediator between perceptual moral attentiveness and less cheating, while moral awareness was found to be a partial mediator between reflective moral attentiveness and less cheating. the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.
borderline_personality_disorder	the aim of this study is to compare the features of two groups of cocaine dependent patients in treatment, one of them with co-morbid diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder and the other not. cross-sectional design, with 143 cocaine-dependent patients attending a drug unit, distributed in two groups: patients with and without antisocial personality disorder. as results, we found that the 15.38% of the sample were diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder. in relation to socio-demographic variables, antisocial personality disorder patients have less probability of being working or studying (9.1% vs. 47.9%). after multivariate analysis it was found that significantly antisocial personality disorder patients have more opiates dependence (or: 0.219; 95% ic 0.072-0.660), sedative dependence (or: 0.203; 95% ic 0.062-0.644) and in more cases show borderline personality disorder (or: 0.239; 95% ic 0.077-0.746). this study highlights significant differences between cocaine addicts with or without an antisocial personality disorder. all these differences are good indicators of the complexity of the patients with this personality disorder. better knowledge of their profile will help us to improve the design of specific treatment programs.
leadership	industry 4.0 and its impact in the manufacturing sector are well documented. however, the service sector is understudied, and it is also facing the challenges of mass customization, digital enhancement, smart work environment, and efficient supply chain. the aim of this study is to fill this research gap by exploring the issues of industry 4.0 in the service sector, with cases in the hospitality industry. all the challenges of industry 4.0 require continuous innovation and learning, which is dependent on people and the enterprise 's capabilities. appropriate management approaches can play a vital role in the development of dynamic capabilities, and an effective learning and innovation environment. this paper proposes a framework of management practices which can promote the environment of innovation and learning in an organization, and hence facilitate business to match the pace of industry 4.0 by facilitating technology acceptance e.g., digital enhancements and implementation of cyber physical systems (cps). this study integrates the literature with logical beliefs to suggest the appropriate management practices for industry 4.0. it represents one of the initial attempts to draw research attention towards the important role of management practices in industry 4.0, as most of the recent studies have been restricted to the technological aspects. semi-structured interviews of hospitality employees are conducted to explore the management practices suitable for meeting the challenges of industry 4.0, specifically for informing the service sector.
eating_disorders	the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an abbreviated, classroom-based, teacher-taught acceptance and commitment therapy (act) program as an intervention to improve mental health in adolescents. in a group-randomized controlled trial, students (n = 586, age 14-21) were nested within 34 classes, which were in turn nested within 14 schools. individual classes were randomly assigned to either a four-session act program or a usual-curriculum control condition. students were assessed using questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment, and a 12-month follow-up. questionnaires assessed quality of life, internalizing and externalizing problems, thought and attention problems, and psychological inflexibility. hierarchical linear modeling showed no significant improvements on any of the outcome measures compared with the control group. no substantive effect sizes for act across time were observed. these findings failed to support act in the format that was used in this current study, which was as an abbreviated, classroom-based, teacher-taught program to improve mental health for all students. we had a large sample and many outcome variables, but failed to find any statistically significant effects or substantive effect sizes. in this study, act was delivered by teachers as opposed to mental health professionals, so it is possible that professionally trained therapists are needed for act to be efficacious.
prosocial_behavior	young children share fairly and expect others to do the same. yet little is known about the underlying cognitive mechanisms that support fairness. we investigated whether children 's numerical competencies are linked with their sharing behavior. preschoolers (aged 2.5-5.5) participated in third-party resource allocation tasks in which they split a set of resources between 2 puppets. children 's numerical competence was assessed using the give-n task (sarnecka & carey, 2008; wynn, 1990). numerical competence-specifically knowledge of the cardinal principle-explained age-related changes in fair sharing. although many subset-knowers (those without knowledge of the cardinal principle) were still able to share fairly, they invoked turn-taking strategies and did not remember the number of resources they shared. these results suggest that numerical cognition serves as an important mechanism for fair sharing behavior, and that children employ different sharing strategies (division or turn-taking) depending on their numerical competence.
depression	objective: to examine the association between gestational age (ga) at birth across the normal ga spectrum (37-41 weeks) and the temperament and health of 3-month old infants.methods: the sample comprised 242 low-risk mothers and infants without chronic illnesses or severe pregnancy complications. infant temperament was defined by three constructs: negative affectivity (na), extraversion, and regulation, assessed by parents' reports on the infant behavior questionnaire. infants' health was defined as the number of nonroutine doctors' visits attended by the infants since their release from the hospital after birth. analyses employed a continuous measure of ga to assess outcomes across gas and a categorical measure (37, 38, 39-41 weeks ga) to examine contrasts.results: extraversion was positively related to ga primarily due to the lower scores of infants born at 37 weeks compared to infants born at 39-41 weeks ga. na showed a similar effect. the odds of infants born at 37 weeks attending a nonroutine medical visit were 2.8 times that of infants born full-term.discussion: infants born at 37 weeks ga express less affect and use more nonroutine medical services than do infants born at 39-41 weeks ga. the findings underscore the importance of considering the risks of pregnancy prolongation with the developmental risk associated with early-term delivery.
child_abuse	background: recent studies have suggested that the interactions among several factors affect the onset, progression, and prognosis of major depressive disorder. this study investigated how childhood abuse, neuroticism, and adult stressful life events interact with one another and affect depressive symptoms in the general adult population. subjects and methods: a total of 413 participants from the nonclinical general adult population completed the patient health questionnaire-9, the child abuse and trauma scale, the neuroticism subscale of the shortened eysenck personality questionnaire - revised, and the life experiences survey, which are self-report scales. structural equation modeling (mplus version 7.3) and single and multiple regressions were used to analyze the data. results: childhood abuse, neuroticism, and negative evaluation of life events increased the severity of the depressive symptoms directly. childhood abuse also indirectly increased the negative appraisal of life events and the severity of the depressive symptoms through enhanced neuroticism in the structural equation modeling. limitations: there was recall bias in this study. the causal relationship was not clear because this study was conducted using a cross-sectional design. conclusion: this study suggested that neuroticism is the mediating factor for the two effects of childhood abuse on adulthood depressive symptoms and negative evaluation of life events. childhood abuse directly and indirectly predicted the severity of depressive symptoms.
eating_disorders	objectiveto evaluate associations between binge-eating disorder (bed) and somatic illnesses and determine whether medical comorbidities are more common in individuals who present with bed and comorbid obesity. methodcases (n=850) were individuals with a bed diagnosis in the swedish eating disorders quality registers. ten community controls were matched to each case on sex, and year, month, and county of birth. associations of bed status with neurologic, immune, respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, circulatory, and endocrine system diseases were evaluated using conditional logistic regression models. we further examined these associations by adjusting for lifetime psychiatric comorbidity. amongst individuals with bed, we explored whether comorbid obesity was associated with risk of somatic disorders. resultsbed was associated with most classes of diseases evaluated; strongest associations were with diabetes [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=5.7 (3.8; 8.7)] and circulatory systems [1.9 (1.3; 2.7)], likely indexing components of metabolic syndrome. amongst individuals with bed, those with comorbid obesity were more likely to have a lifetime history of respiratory [1.5 (1.1; 2.1)] and gastrointestinal [2.6 (1.7; 4.1)] diseases than those without comorbid obesity. increased risk of some somatic disease classes in individuals with bed was not simply due to obesity or other lifetime psychiatric comorbidity. discussionthe association of bed with many somatic illnesses highlights the morbidity experienced by individuals with bed. clinicians treating patients with bed should be vigilant for medical comorbidities. nonpsychiatric providers may be the first clinical contact for those with bed underscoring the importance of screening in primary care.

child_abuse	the purpose of the study was to investigate types of childhood abuse in a sample of 60 inmates and to explore the relationships between childhood abuse, criminality, and drug addiction. overall, the sample inmates came from risky families with a high prevalence of crime, drug addiction, and mental health problems. the results showed that a history of child abuse was common, and emotional neglect was more prevalent than physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. the odds for childhood abuse were higher among inmates whose fathers had been addicted to drugs and involved in crime, and whose siblings suffered from mental health problems.
nonverbal_communication	in this article, the author presents a case in which she chose to accept a patient 's facebook ""friend request."" she describes an early ""model scene"" (lichtenberg, 1989) that shaped the patient 's sense of self and his relationships, and how a similar interpersonal dynamic was recreated in the analytic dyad. as the treatment progressed, the analyst found it necessary to revisit and reconceptualize the idea of the traditional psychoanalytic frame to better meet her patient 's developmental, selfobject, and relational needs. the author elaborates on how the frame changed (and why), how the expansion of the frame deepened the analyst-patient bond, and the ways in which the use of social media opened new therapeutic opportunities and relational possibilities in this treatment. the author discusses how this case illustrates bacal 's (1998, 2011; bacal & herzog, 2003) theories of ""optimal responsiveness"" and ""specificity,"" and addresses related topics that include the implicit mode of relatedness, nonverbal communication, and analyst self-disclosure and self-consciousness.
nonverbal_communication	in this paper we present our study concerning a new approach of automatic detection and analysis of body language in which we propose a method for extracting information related to nonverbal communication between persons. our approach is based on the kinect sensor that processes the image and provides us many image features that we study. the final goal is to provide blind users access to information that is completely hidden.
gender_roles	despite having more similar roles at work and home than ever before, us men and women continue to exhibit different travel behavior. an open question is whether the remaining gender differences in travel differ by traditional and emergent aspects of household structure such as spouse/partner presence, parenthood, and breadwinner status. using data from the 2003-2010 american time use survey, this study offers a unique, empirical travel time analysis of metropolitan workers stratified by household structure. results show that gender differences in travel time respond to multiple aspects of household structure in complex and interactive ways. gender difference in work travel time is only observable when spouse/partner presence and parenthood interact, i.e., in couple households with children. gender difference in household support travel reacts to parenthood but not spouse/partner presence. gender difference in travel time between employed females and employed males in single-breadwinner couples is no different from gender difference in double-breadwinner couples. the results call for policy initiatives and research inquiries that pay greater attention to the large gender disparities in work travel in couple households with children and the large gender disparities in household support travel in all households with children including single-parent households. although incapable of ruling out the influences of internalized gender differences (e.g., preference theory) and gendered structural contexts (e.g., labor market segmentation), the findings provide clear evidence that traditional gender roles and relations remain operative in contemporary households in the us.
media_violence	background: firearms are a major cause of injury and death. we sought to determine (1) the prevalence of movie scenes that depicted firearms and verbal firearm safety messages; (2) the context and health outcomes in firearm scenes; and (3) the association between the motion picture association of america ratings and firearm scene characteristics. methods: ten top revenue-grossing motion pictures were selected for each year from 1995 to 2004 in descending order of gross revenues. data on firearm scenes were collected by movie coders using dual-monitor computer workstations and real-time collection tools. results: seventy of the 100 movies had scenes with firearms and the majority of movies with firearms were rated pg-13. firearm scenes (n = 624) accounted for 17% of screen time in movies with firearms. among firearm scenes, crime or illegal activity was involved in 45%, deaths occurred in 19%, and injuries occurred in 12%. a verbal reference to safety was made in 0.8%. conclusions: depictions of firearms in top revenue-grossing movies were common, but safety messages were exceedingly rare. major motion pictures present an under-used opportunity for education about firearm safety.
attention	the increasing interest in thin flexible and bendable devices has led to a strong demand for mechanically robust and electrically reliable transparent electrodes. indium doped tin oxide (ito) and aluminium doped zinc oxide (azo) are among the most employed transparent conductive oxides (tco) and their reliability on flexible substrates have thus received a great attention. however, a high flexibility is usually achieved at very low thickness, which, unfortunately, compromises the electrical conductivity. here we report the effects of mechanical bending cycles on the electrical and optical properties of ultra thin azo/ag/azo multilayers (45 nm/10 nm/45 nm) and, for comparison, of azo and ito single layers whose thickness was, in both cases, 100 nm and 700 nm, deposited at room-temperature on flexible polyethylene naphthalate (pen) plastic substrates. the electrical stability of the films after several cycles of bending were evaluated by monitoring the relative variation of the electrical resistance with respect to the as prepared sample; the structural damage induced by bending was detected by scanning electron microscopy (sem). we observed an excellent electrical stability and high flexibility in the azo/ag/azo sample even after 100 cycles, whereas for the single azo and ito films the resistivity rapidly increases. the experimental results and numerical simulations provide clear evidences of the key role played by the ductile ag interlayer that provides improved robustness under mechanical strain.
attention	clergy members suffering from burnout face both personal and professional complications. this study assessed occupational burnout and stress coping mechanisms among ministers affiliated with the assemblies of god, a denomination that has received little attention in previous burnout-related studies. a cross-sectional design was employed using two instruments with acceptable psychometric properties. approximately 65 % of those surveyed were either suffering from burnout or on the verge of burnout. statistical differences in coping mechanism use were found between those who were and were not experiencing some level of burnout. the results of this study add to the existing understanding of occupational burnout among clergy members and ways in which burnout may be alleviated.
borderline_personality_disorder	the nature of consciousness and the autonomy of the individual 'smind have been a focus of interest throughout the past century and inspired many theories and models. revival of studies on psychological trauma and dissociation, which remained outside mainstream psychiatry, psychology, and psychoanalysis for the most part of the past century, has provided a new opportunity to revisit this intellectual and scientific endeavor. this paper attempts to integrate a series of empirical and theoretical studies on psychological consequences of developmental traumatization, which may yield further insight into factors which threaten the integrity of human consciousness. the paper proposes that an individual 's experience of distorted reality and betrayal precipitates a cyclical dynamic between the individual and the external world by disrupting the developmental function of mutuality which is essential for maintenance of the integrity of the internal world while this inner world is in turn regulated vis-a-vis external reality. dissociation - the common factor in all types of post-traumatic syndromes-is facilitated by violation of boundaries by relational omission and intrusion as represented by distinct effects and consequences of childhood neglect and abuse. recent research conducted on clinical and non-clinical populations shows both bimodal (undermodulation and overmodulation) and bipolar (intrusion and avoidance) neurobiological and phenomenological characteristics of post-traumatic response. these seem to reflect ""parallel-distinct structures"" that control separate networks covering sensori-motor and cognitive-emotional systems. this understanding provides a conceptual framework to assist explanation of diverse post-traumaticmental trajectories which culminate in a common final pathway comprised of partly overlapping clinical syndromes such as complex ptsd, dissociative depression, dissociative identity disorder (did), or ""borderline"" phenomena. of crucial theoretical and clinical importance is that thesemaladaptive post-traumatic psychological formations are regarded as processes in their own right rather than as a personality disorder innate to the individual. such mental division may perform in that internal detachment can serve to preserve the genuine aspects of the subject until such time as they can be reclaimed via psychotherapy. the paper attempts to integrate these ideas with reference to the previously proposed theory of the ""functional dissociation of self"" (sar and ozturk, 2007).
media_violence	youth violence is a growing problem worldwide. research on adolescent violence in india is limited. fifteen hundred high school students were investigated to study the prevalence and demographic characteristics of witnesses, victims and perpetrators of violence and to see the impact of violence exposure on their psychosocial adjustments. sixty nine percent of students had witnessed violence in real life and 28% were of serious nature. media violence exposure was universal. the prevalence of victims and perpetrators was 27% and 13% respectively. bullying was prevalent. male sex was the most important predictive risk factor for witnessing and perpetrating violence (p <= 0.001). victims were predominantly females. those having exposure to violence had poorer school performance and adjustment scores (p <= 0.05). thus violence exposure is prevalent even in the lives of indian adolescents and gender differences exist. its impact on their psychosocial adjustments is detrimental. early identification and corrective interventions of these adolescents is vital.
antisocial_personality_disorder	within the early/late start typology of offenders with schizophrenia, a third type, first offenders (fo), has been proposed. the aim of this study was to examine the justification of this first offender type. retrospective file study consisted of 97 early starters (es), 100 late starters, and 26 fo. variables in different domains were scored. there were significant differences between the groups within the domains life functioning, abuse and family-related problems, psychiatric functioning, substance misuse, antisocial personality, and offense characteristics. most differences were between the es and fo. the existence of the first offender type is justified by the present findings. these findings underscore the importance of offender subtyping for better offender treatment interventions.
depression	brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) val66met polymorphism has been associated with cortisol responses to stress with gender differences reported, although the findings are not entirely consistent. to evaluate the role of val66met genotype and gender on cortisol responses to stress, we conducted a 45-min mental stress protocol including four tasks and four rest periods. blood cortisol was collected for assay immediately before and after each task and rest period. a significant two-way interaction of val66met genotype x gender (p= 0.022) was observed on the total area under the curve (auc), a total cortisol response over time, such that the val/val genotype was associated with a larger cortisol response to stress as compared to the met group in women but not in men. further contrast analyses between the val/val and met group for each stress task showed a similar increased cortisol pattern among women val/val genotype but not among men. the present findings indicate the gender differences in the effect of val66met genotype on the cortisol responses to stress protocol, and extend the evidence for the importance of gender and the role of va166met in the modulation of stress reactivity and subsequent depression prevalence. further studies and the underlying mechanism need to be investigated, which may provide an insight for prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies that target those at high risk.

schizophrenia	this is a personal account of life in the philadelphia association from the late 1960s to the 1990s when some of the ideas of basaglia, cooper, deleuze, esterson, fanon, foucault, guattari, laing and szasz were put into practice. cooper 's psychiatry and anti-psychiatry (1967) was the inspiration for what appeared as an international movement within psychiatry, influenced, among other things, by foucault 's madness and civilization (1967). szasz believed mental illness to be a myth created by society; cooper believed that the family was an instrument of oppression perpetrating psychological violence on its members; laing believed that if one studied the specific forms of communication within families of schizophrenics one could make madness intelligible and therefore amenable to some form of psychotherapy. the paper highlights the evolving understanding of psychosis within the philadelphia association and the relationship of psychosis to psychoanalysis. it suggests that far from being a misguided blip in the history of psychiatry, anti-psychiatry' could be seen as having revolutionized our discourse in relation to psychosis in a way which has left a worthy and lasting legacy, linking treatment to how we treat one another.
seasonal_affective_disorder	notwithstanding its effects on the classical visual system allowing image formation, light acts upon several non-image-forming (nif) functions including body temperature, hormonal secretions, sleep-wake cycle, alertness, and cognitive performance. studies have shown that nif functions are maximally sensitive to blue wavelengths (460-480 nm), in comparison to longer light wavelengths. higher blue light sensitivity has been reported for melatonin suppression, pupillary constriction, vigilance, and performance improvement but also for modulation of cognitive brain functions. studies investigating acute stimulating effects of light on brain activity during the execution of cognitive tasks have suggested that brain activations progress from subcortical regions involved in alertness, such as the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem, before reaching cortical regions associated with the ongoing task. in the course of aging, lower blue light sensitivity of some nif functions has been reported. here, we first describe neural pathways underlying effects of light on nif functions and we discuss eye and cerebral mechanisms associated with aging which may affect nif light sensitivity. thereafter, we report results of investigations on pupillary constriction and cognitive brain sensitivity to light in the course of aging. whereas the impact of light on cognitive brain responses appears to decrease substantially, pupillary constriction seems to remain more intact over the lifespan. altogether, these results demonstrate that aging research should take into account the diversity of the pathways underlying the effects of light on specific nif functions which may explain their differences in light sensitivity.
eating_disorders	limited information exists on the application of evidence-based treatments for eating disorders among diverse populations. an increasing number of international and immigrant clients provides a pressing need for culturally responsive treatments. this case study highlights an eating disorder treatment that incorporates dialectical behavior therapy and cultural adaptation guidelines. this study explicates a culturally adapted dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) treatment of a 24-year-old female chinese international student suffering from an eating disorder, depression, and cultural adjustment issues. in particular, this case addresses chinese cultural values, including conformity, interdependence, and filial piety, and how these values intersect with the client 's presenting issues and treatment. cultural modifications made to the case conceptualization and dialectical behavior therapy are discussed. the client reported a significant decrease in distress, an increase in the quality of social relationships, and an increase in satisfaction with social roles. these results provide support for the effectiveness and importance of integrating cultural adaptation and evidence-based treatment. clinical implications and recommendations for clinicians and students are provided.
social_cognition	third-party punishment (tpp) for norm violations is an essential deterrent in large-scale human societies, and builds on two essential cognitive functions: evaluating legal responsibility and determining appropriate punishment. despite converging evidence that tpp is mediated by a specific set of brain regions, little is known about their effective connectivity (direction and strength of connections). applying parametric event-related functional mri in conjunction with multivariate granger causality analysis, we asked healthy participants to estimate how much punishment a hypothetical perpetrator deserves for intentionally committing criminal offenses varying in levels of harm. our results confirmed that tpp legal decisions are based on two domain-general networks: the mentalizing network for evaluating legal responsibility and the central-executive network for determining appropriate punishment. further, temporal pole (tp) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (pfc) emerged as hubs of the mentalizing network, uniquely generating converging output connections to ventromedial pfc, temporo-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate. in particular, dorsomedial pfc received inputs only from tp and both its activation and its connectivity to dorsolateral pfc correlated with degree of punishment. this supports the hypothesis that dorsomedial pfc acts as the driver of the tpp activation pattern, leading to the decision on the appropriate punishment. in conclusion, these results advance our understanding of the organizational elements of the tpp brain networks and provide better insights into the mental states of judges and jurors tasked with blaming and punishing legal wrongs.
nonverbal_communication	although authentic dialogue between teachers and young children is vital to the learning process, increasingly diverse student populations and a focus on high-stakes testing, challenge teachers' approaches to such conversations. this study examined the verbal and nonverbal interactions between five teachers and young children using child-taken photographs to promote conversation. analysis exposed how the teachers' nonverbal and verbal responsiveness opened and closed conversational spaces for the children to describe their home contexts. this teacher-child dance illuminates the necessary and effective pursuit of attending to both verbal and nonverbal communication in authentic dialogue and suggests a teacher choreograph that, when attended to, is positioned for effective and efficient use within the increasingly diverse and time-pressured classroom.
prejudice	initiatives in intercultural education have frequently involved the promotion of contact between members of different groups as a means of improving intergroup relations. experience from northern ireland suggests, however, that such schemes have often been organised and delivered in such a way that opportunities for sustained, high-quality contact are limited. this paper considers processes of contact in one relatively recent initiative, shared education, which involves collaboration between separate schools to deliver classes to catholic and protestant pupils in mixed groups. employing qualitative methods of observation and interviewing to capture participants' experiences of contact, the research explores the influences on the quality and frequency of cross-group interaction in the shared class. with findings highlighting the subject and pedagogy, teacher 's approach and classroom arrangement as key factors, the study offers suggestions for policy and practice to enhance opportunities for contact and relationship-building in mixed classes.
media_violence	although past research has documented effects of diverse types of media content on male body image, the effects of violent media content remain unexamined. in an experimental study, 97 college-age men were exposed to either violent or nonviolent narratives accompanied by either muscular-ideal or nonmuscular images of men. exposure to violent narratives predicted lower self-perceived physical attractiveness, greater body anxiety, and greater endorsement of body modification methods, though this last effect was moderated by self-monitoring. exposure to muscular-ideal images also predicted increased body anxiety and body modification endorsement. no violence x muscularity interaction effects were observed. mediation analyses indicated that the effect of violent narratives on body image was not mediated by activation of stereotypical masculinity, suggesting either direct cognitive links between violence and appearance or some as-yet unidentified process.
nonverbal_communication	mothers, fathers, and siblings from 87 multiplex (m-mothers, m-fathers, and m-siblings) and 41 simplex (s-mothers, s-fathers, and s-siblings) autism spectrum disorder families were assessed using the broader phenotype autism symptom scale. s-mothers, s-fathers, and s-siblings showed more social interest and were more expressive in their use of nonverbal communication compared to m-mothers, m-fathers, and m-siblings. conversational skills were also improved in s-fathers and s-siblings compared to m-fathers and m-siblings. s-siblings showed significantly lower rigidity and intense interests compared to m-siblings. the decreased number and intensity of broader autism phenotype traits observed in parents and siblings within simplex families provide behavioral evidence consistent with findings of increased de novo genetic events in simplex families.
schizophrenia	politics and policy: it is important to understand why, in the translational continuum from pilot research and randomised controlled efficacy trials to roll-out programmes and routine effectiveness studies, some service innovations are taken up by health service purchasers and providers, while others are not. why do some innovative interventions or models of care get to the stage of implementation, while others fail to be funded?
media_violence	although the association between media violence exposure (mve) and physical aggression (pa) has been well studied, few studies have examined the link between mve and other subtypes of aggression. the purpose of this study was to examine the relation between mve and reactive and proactive subtypes of both pa and relational aggression (ra). six hundred and forty-one third to fifth grade students reported on their exposure to media violence. ra and pa were assessed by peers and teachers. reactive and proactive subtypes of ra and pa were assessed by teacher reports. findings revealed a significant positive association between mve and overall pa and ra. the relation with ra was stronger for girls than for boys. when predicting the functional subtypes of aggression, higher mve was associated with lower reactive ra, higher proactive ra, and higher reactive pa, and mve was unrelated to proactive pa. the implications of the findings for future research are discussed.
depression	despite growing evidence in support of mindfulness as an underlying mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions (mbis), it has been suggested that nonspecific therapeutic factors, such as the experience of social support, may contribute to the positive effects of mbis. in the present study, we examined whether change in mindfulness and/or social support mediated the effect of mindfulness-based cancer recovery (mbcr) compared to another active intervention (i.e. supportive expressive group therapy (set)), on change in mood disturbance, stress symptoms and quality of life. a secondary analysis was conducted of a multi-site randomized clinical trial investigating the impacts of mbcr and set on distressed breast cancer survivors (mindset). we applied the causal steps approach with bootstrapping to test mediation, using pre- and post-intervention questionnaire data of the participants who were randomised to mbcr (n = 69) or set (n = 70). mbcr participants improved significantly more on mood disturbance, stress symptoms and social support, but not on quality of life or mindfulness, compared to set participants. increased social support partially mediated the impact of mbcr versus set on mood disturbance and stress symptoms. because no group differences on mindfulness and quality of life were observed, no mediation analyses were performed on these variables. findings showed that increased social support was related to more improvement in mood and stress after mbcr compared to support groups, whereas changes in mindfulness were not. this suggests a more important role for social support in enhancing outcomes in mbcr than previously thought.
problem-solving	adolescents with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for deteriorating glycemic control, poor quality of life, and depressive symptoms. stress and coping are related to these outcomes in adolescents with diabetes, yet few studies have examined these constructs longitudinally. this study aimed to describe stress and coping in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to examine coping strategies as predictors of adolescent adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, quality of life) and glycemic control. adolescents with type 1 diabetes completed measures of diabetes-related stress, coping, symptoms of depression, and quality of life at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. data on glycemic control were collected from the adolescents' medical charts. the adolescents' use of primary control coping (e.g., problem solving) and secondary control engagement coping (e.g., positive thinking) strategies predicted significantly fewer problems with quality of life and fewer depressive symptoms over time. in contrast, the use of disengagement coping strategies (e.g., avoidance) predicted more problems with quality of life and depressive symptoms. coping was not a significant predictor of glycemic control. coping mediated the effects of diabetes-related stress on depressive symptoms and quality of life. the ways in which adolescents with type 1 diabetes cope with diabetes-related stress predict quality of life and symptoms of depression but not glycemic control. through the use of screening to identify adolescent 's diabetes-related stress and targeted interventions to improve coping strategies, there is potential to improve outcomes.
prejudice	this article describes the ways in which music is an important part of identity, and hence serves some similar functions to other forms of identity-related communication (e. g., language). it will describe how music is used to incite intergroup hatred (e. g., among soccer fans, military music) and to support valued identities (anthems, etc.). relevant literature on stereotyping (including stereotyping of groups related to music) is included. the article also discusses how music is used to reduce intergroup hostility (e. g., via cross-cultural musical collaboration and contact). the article connects the various literatures from communication, social psychology, sociology, and ethnomusicology, providing a broad overview of the many connections between communication, music, and social identity. it closes with a research agenda for those interested in studying intergroup communication and music.
attention	objective. brain-computer interfaces (bcis) can help patients who have lost control over most muscles but are still conscious and able to communicate or interact with the environment. one of the most popular types of bci is the p300-based bci. with this bci, users are asked to count the number of appearances of target stimuli in an experiment. to date, the majority of visual p300-based bci systems developed have used the same character or picture as the target for every stimulus presentation, which can bore users. consequently, users attention may decrease or be negatively affected by adjacent stimuli. approach. in this study, a new stimulus is presented to increase user concentration. honeycomb-shaped figures with 1-3 red dots were used as stimuli. the number and the positions of the red dots in the honeycomb-shaped figure were randomly changed during bci control. the user was asked to count the number of the dots presented in each flash instead of the number of times they flashed. to assess the performance of this new stimulus, another honeycomb-shaped stimulus, without red dots, was used as a control condition. main results. the results showed that the honeycomb-shaped stimuli with red dots obtained significantly higher classification accuracies and information transfer rates (p < 0.05) compared to the honeycomb-shaped stimulus without red dots. significance. the results indicate that this proposed method can be a promising approach to improve the performance of the bci system and can be an efficient method in daily application.
prosocial_behavior	our various daily activities continually require regulation of our internal state. these regulatory processes covary with changes in high frequency heart rate variability (hf-hrv), a marker of parasympathetic activity. specifically, incidental increases in hf-hrv accompany positive social engagement behavior and prosocial action. little is known about deliberate regulation of hf-hrv and the role of voluntary parasympathetic regulation in prosocial behavior. here, we present a novel biofeedback task that measures the ability to deliberately increase hf-hrv. in two large samples, we find that a) participants are able to voluntarily upregulate hf-hrv, and b) variation in this ability predicts individual differences in altruistic prosocial behavior, but not non-altruistic forms of prosociality, assessed through 14 different measures. our findings suggest that self-induction of parasympathetic states is involved in altruistic action. the biofeedback task may provide a measure of deliberate parasympathetic regulation, with implications for the study of attention, emotion, and social behavior.

child_abuse	there is convincing evidence that many young people who are in the justice system have had contact with child protection services and that victims of childhood maltreatment are at increased risk of subsequent youth justice involvement. in australia, however, there have been few longitudinal studies that have examined these associations and relatively less is known in this area. this study examines the overlap between the child protection and youth justice involvement in south australia, and determines how substantiated maltreatment and variations in these experiences (e.g., the type, timing and recurrence of maltreatment) relate to criminal convictions as a youth. the results show that although the majority of child-protection involved youth do not become convicted offenders, the odds of subsequent convictions are significantly greater both for those with notifications and substantiated maltreatment and for those who had been placed in out-of-home care. multivariate analyses revealed that the strongest predictors for receiving a conviction among maltreated youth were: male gender, aboriginal and torres strait islander ethnicity, experiences of physical abuse and emotional abuse, a greater number of substantiations (recurrence), experiencing maltreatment that commenced in childhood and continued into adolescence, and placement in out-of-home care. the mechanisms through which maltreatment might be linked with behavior are then considered, along with directions for future research in this area.

prejudice	muwallads (native neo-muslims) were one of the groups that played an important role in political and social changes during the reign of the umayyads of andalusia. by conversion to islam, they called for equal rights with the arab minority. however, political exclusion, poverty, and economic pressure, social and racial discrimination applied against them by the arab umayyad rulers provided the context of their rebellion. initially, most muwallads began military struggle against the reign to obtain their rights. the conditions almost changed by the beginning of the third abul al-rahman 's governance (imprinted, 912-961 ad), and the peaceful politics as well as ethnic and religious tolerance of abdul nasser, the umayyad caliph and his son, the second sentence (imprinted; 961-972 ad) made opportunities for muwallads to participate in political and social structures of andalusia society. however, in the meantime, some of them emphasizing their ethnic identity did cultural and intellectual activities in the form of praising and advocating talent and ability of non-arab against arabs' racial prejudice and racial superiority. in addition, gradually, with the weakness of the umayyad rule in andalusia and the formation of independent states, the defensive mode changed into offensive and explicit denial of the arab 's race by the muwallads that culminated in the shu'ubiyya treatise of ibn garasiah. using an analytical approach, this article is intended, first, to examine the causes and context of the formation of shu'ubiyya thoughts in andalusia and then to survey the method and quality of writing treatises and writings of shu'ubiyya at the end of umayyad rule.
borderline_personality_disorder	this research investigated baseline impulsivity, rejection sensitivity, and reactions to stressors in individuals with borderline personality disorder compared to healthy individuals and those with avoidant personality disorder . the borderline group showed greater impulsivity than the avoidant and healthy groups both in a delay-discounting task with real monetary rewards and in self-reported reactions to stressors; moreover, these findings could not be explained by co-occurring substance use disorders. distress reactions to stressors were equally elevated in both personality disorder groups (relative to the healthy group). the borderline and avoidant groups also reported more maladaptive reactions to a stressor of an interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature, whereas the healthy group did not. finally, self-reported impulsive reactions to stressors were associated with baseline impulsivity in the delay-discounting task, and greater self-reported reactivity to interpersonal than non-interpersonal stressors was associated with rejection sensitivity. this research highlights distinct vulnerabilities contributing to impulsive behavior in borderline personality disorder.
prosocial_behavior	one avenue substantially researched and supported in early childhood research is the importance and the cultivation of self-regulation skills in the classroom. most educational research on self-regulation skills has illustrated the importance between the enhancement of these skills and long-term academic success. notwithstanding, there is little empirical research in early childhood that links the advancement of self-regulation skills to other contributing educational components, such as the cultivation of children 's pro-social skills.this review seeks to establish a link between children 's self-regulation and pro-social skills and discusses implications for future research and practice.
false_memories	the investigation of veridical mood-congruent memory (mcm) in major depressive disorder (mdd) has been subject of many studies, whereas mood-congruent false memory has received comparatively little attention. the present study examined the influence of valence, personal relevance and the valence of the context of the learning material on true and false mcm in 20 inpatients with mdd and 20 healthy controls. sixty positive, negative, neutral or personally relevant nouns were either combined with a positive, negative or neutral adjective. word pairs were presented to participants in a learning trial. in a recognition task, participants had to identify the previously studied word pairs. a mcm effect could not be found for hits. however, in exploratory analyses, word pairs containing personally relevant nouns were more rated towards old by the patient relative to the control group. furthermore, depressed patients tended to rate items more towards old than controls when the words were presented in a negative new context results are in line with previous findings in depression research emphasizing the role of mood-congruent false memories for mood disorders.

false_memories	a number of recent studies have identified an ""overconfidence effect"" in psychosis, whereby people with schizophrenia are overconfident in errors while simultaneously slightly underconfident when accurate. this effect may have implications for why delusions, which are based on inaccurate inferences, perceptions and judgements, are typically held with high conviction. given the importance the overconfidence effect may have in accounting for delusional conviction, the current narrative review aims to summarise and critique the recent evidence for the effect within schizophrenia. people with schizophrenia were consistently found to be overconfident in errors and slightly underconfident in correct appraisals, and this effect appears not to be an artefact of poor task performance. while the overconfidence effect has been linked to delusion-proneness in the general population, there was less direct evidence linking overconfidence to delusional symptoms in clinical populations. future studies need to adopt longitudinal designs and include additional measures of overconfidence to investigate this association more appropriately, and to also investigate possible mediators of this postulated relationship, such as dopaminergic activity.
borderline_personality_disorder	schizophrenia is characterized by increased mortality for which suicidality is the decisive factor. an analysis of cortical thickness and folding to further elucidate neuroanatomical correlates of suicidality in schizophrenia has not yet been performed. we searched for relevant brain regions with such differences between patients with suicide-attempts, patients without any suicidal thoughts and healthy controls. 37 schizophrenia patients (14 suicide-attempters and 23 non-suicidal) and 50 age-and gender-matched healthy controls were included. suicidality was documented through clinical interview and chart review. all participants underwent t1-weighted mri scans. whole brain node-by-node cortical thickness and folding were estimated (freesurfer software) and compared. additionally a three group comparison for prefrontal regions-of-interest was performed in spss using a multifactorial glm. compared with the healthy controls patients showed a typical pattern of cortical thinning in prefronto-temporal regions and altered cortical folding in the right medial temporal cortex. patients with suicidal behavior compared with non-suicidal patients demonstrated pronounced (p < 0.05) cortical thinning in the right dlpfc and the superior temporal cortex. comparing cortical thickness in suicidal patients with non-suicidal patients significant (p < 0.05) cortical thinning was additionally found in the right superior and middle temporal, temporopolar and insular cortex. our findings extend the evidence for neuroanatomical underpinnings of suicidal behaviour in schizophrenia. we identified cortical thinning in a network strongly involved in regulation of impulsivity, emotions and planning of behaviour in suicide attempters, which might lead to neuronal dysregulation in this network and consequently to a higher risk of suicidal behavior.

problem-solving	the aim of ecosystem-based management (ebm) is to maintain an ecosystem in a healthy, productive and resilient condition through the implementation of policies and management measures. although cross-sectoral planning may be led by a planning competent authority, it is up to the sector competent authority to implement the necessary management measures within their operations to achieve ebm goals and objectives. we suggest that scientific impediments to ebm are no longer significant to implement ebm operationally. instead, we consider that approaching ebm within current policy cycle approaches would provide the necessary policymaking process step to operationalize ebm. in addition to enabling and facilitating collaboration, exchange, understanding as promoted by ebm, policymaking processes also require that policy is to be implemented through programs, measures, procedures and controls that have expected outcomes to ""carry into effect"" the policy objective. we are of the view that moving ebm from planning and objective setting to operational implementation is a management problem solving issues instead of a scientific one.
attention	fucoidan, a sulfated marine polysaccharide, has many potential biological functions, including anticancer activity. recently, fucoidan has been reported to target p-selectin expressed on metastatic cancer cells. increasing research attention has been devoted to the developments of fucoidan-based nanomedicine. however, the application of traditional chitosan/fucoidan nanoparticles in anticancer drug delivery may be limited due to the deprotonation of chitosan at a ph greater than 6.5. in this study, a mutlistimuli-responsive nanoparticle self-assembled by fucoidan and a cationic polypeptide (protamine) was developed, and their ph-/enzyme-responsive properties were characterized by circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (dls), and zeta potential analysis. enzymatic digestion and acidic intracellular microenvironment (ph 4.5-5.5) in cancer cells triggered the release of an anticancer drug (doxorubicin) from the nanoparticles. the protamine/fucoidan complex nanoparticles with p-selectin mediated endocytosis, charge conversion and stimuli-tunable release properties showed an improved inhibitory effect against a metastatic breast cancer cell line (mda-mb-231).

false_memories	prospective memory refers to the ability to remember to execute future intentions (e.g., taking medication with dinner). although most prior research on prospective memory errors has focused on omission errors (i.e., failures to perform an intention in response to a target cue), there has been a recent surge in research on commission errors, the erroneous performance of a finished intention. existing studies have examined factors at retrieval that lead to commission errors; the present study extends this research by investigating the impact of encoding strength. we found that relative to standard encoding, implementation intention encoding doubled the risk of commission errors in our laboratory paradigm for both young and older adults. this novel finding demonstrates the impact of encoding strength on commission errors and documents the potential challenges of deactivating the effects of implementation intentions upon completion of a prospective memory task.
social_cognition	rationale social cognition influences social interactions. alcohol reportedly facilitates social interactions. however, the acute effects of alcohol on social cognition are relatively poorly studied. we investigated the effects of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer on emotion recognition, empathy, and sexual arousal using the dynamic face emotion recognition task (fert), multifaceted empathy test (met), and sexual arousal task (sat) in a double-blind, random-order, cross-over study in 60 healthy social drinkers. we also assessed subjective effects using visual analog scales (vass), blood alcohol concentrations, and plasma oxytocin levels. alcohol increased vas ratings of stimulated, happy, talkative, open, and want to be with others. the subjective effects of alcohol were greater in participants with higher trait inhibitedness. alcohol facilitated the recognition of happy faces on the fert and enhanced emotional empathy for positive stimuli on the met, particularly in participants with low trait empathy. pictures of explicit sexual content were rated as less pleasant than neutral pictures after non-alcoholic beer but not after alcoholic beer. explicit sexual pictures were rated as more pleasant after alcoholic beer compared with non-alcoholic beer, particularly in women. alcohol did not alter the levels of circulating oxytocin. alcohol biased emotion recognition toward better decoding of positive emotions and increased emotional concern for positive stimuli. no support was found for a modulatory role of oxytocin. alcohol also facilitated the viewing of sexual images, consistent with disinhibition, but it did not actually enhance sexual arousal. these effects of alcohol on social cognition likely enhance sociability. www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02318823 reftarget address=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02318823"" targettype=""url""/>
problem-solving	programing is difficult for beginners because they need to learn the new language of computers. developing software, especially complex software, is bound to result in problems, frustration, and the need to think in new ways. identifying the learning behavior behind programing by way of empirical studies can help beginners learn more easily. in this study, a flipped classroom combined with the blended learning mode was adopted by switching the in-class instructional time and the out-of-class edx lecture time. the research laboratory developed a system that collected the teacher and students discussion activities when adopting problem-solving strategies in online discussion. the participants were 44 third-year college students from the computer science course of a university in northern taiwan. the experiment was from 30th march to 4th may in 2015. a total of 120 initial comments were collected, along with 401 responding comments. these 521 comments were coded according to the problem-solving steps as posing questions, offering solutions, discussion, and sharing conclusions. the inter-rater reliability of the two coders reached a kappa value of 0.81. the results indicated that the flipped classroom combined with the problem-solving strategy was more effective than the previous problem-solving behavior sequence.
borderline_personality_disorder	although borderline personality disorder (bpd) is frequently characterized by nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (nssi), suicide attempts (sa), suicidal ideation (si), and/or suicide threats (st), it is unclear whether these behaviors are precursors of bpd in adolescence. this study examined self-harm/suicide-related behaviors in the development of bpd from adolescence to adulthood in psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. participants were 116 adolescents consecutively admitted for a psychiatric hospitalization for self-harm/suicide-related behaviors. adolescents completed self-report questionnaires assessing self-harm/suicide-related behaviors, maladaptive familial behavior, and peer victimization upon admission. admission diagnoses and history of sexual/physical abuse were abstracted from medical/psychiatric records. five years after index hospitalization, medical/psychiatric records were systematically reviewed and information on diagnoses was collected. using multivariable logistic regression analyses, st predicted bpd above and beyond nssi, sa, and si 5 years later (odds ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [ 1.06, 1.62], p >.01). traditional risk factors of bpd were not predictive of bpd at 5-year follow-up. suicidal threats are an important risk factor in adolescents who engage in self-harm/suicide-related behaviors that may differentiate those adolescents who go on to develop bpd as adults. implications for research and treatment are discussed.
media_violence	three experiments examined the impact of excessive violence in sport video games on aggression-related variables. participants played either a nonviolent simulation-based sports video game (baseball or football) or a matched excessively violent sports video game. participants then completed measures assessing aggressive cognitions (experiment 1), aggressive affect and attitudes towards violence in sports (experiment 2), or aggressive behavior (experiment 3). playing an excessively violent sports video game increased aggressive affect. aggressive cognition, aggressive behavior, and attitudes towards violence in sports. because all games were competitive, these findings indicate that violent content uniquely leads to increases in several aggression-related variables, as predicted by the general aggression model and related social-cognitive models.

eating_disorders	almost no research has tested whether risk factors interact in the prediction of future eating disorder onset, which might suggest qualitatively distinct etiologic pathways. accordingly, this prospective study tested for possible interactions between risk factors in the prediction of binge eating and purging eating disorders in adolescents. it also examined sex differences in pathways to risk. two analytical approaches were used: (1) classification tree analysis (cta), which is ideally suited to identifying non-linear interactions and the optimal cut-points for defining risk, with follow-up random forest analyses; and (2) two-way interaction terms in a series of logistic regression models. data were drawn from the western australian pregnancy cohort (raine) study, a population-based study that followed participants from pre-birth to young adulthood. this study involved 1297 adolescents (49% male), 146 (11%) of whom developed bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder or purging disorder in late adolescence. in cta, sex was the first and most potent predictor of eating disorder risk with females showing a 5-fold increase in risk relative to males. for males and females, weight and eating concerns were the next most potent predictor of risk and three risk groups emerged, reflecting non-linear risk. for females with intermediate weight and eating concerns, externalizing problems emerged as an additional predictor. interaction terms in logistic regression models did not produce significant results after correcting for multiple testing. findings advance knowledge on risk pathways to eating disorder onset, highlight non-linear risk processes, and provide cut-points for prospectively identifying high-risk youth for prevention programs.

eating_disorders	epidemiological studies on adolescents with eating disorders demonstrate a high prevalence of disordered eating behaviors, with a higher prevalence of eating disorders among girls. several studies have recently demonstrated an association between female adolescents' eating disorders, parental psychopathological risk, and an impaired family functioning with poor quality of the relationships among family members. on the basis of these premises, we conducted a cross-sectional study initially recruiting 243 families of female adolescents affected by anorexia nervosa (group a), bulimia nervosa (group b), and binge eating disorder (group c) (average age 14-17) to assess their psychological profile (scl90-r), specific representations of their family functioning (faces-iv), and the possible effect of adolescents' psychological profiles and parents' psychopathological risk on family functioning. our results indicate that adolescents and parents in groups a, b, and c show an unequivocal psychopathological profile; in particular, adolescents with anorexia present the most severe psychopathological risk. further, our results show that adolescents and their parents differ in their perception of their family functioning. more specifically, adolescents with anorexia perceive their family as highly disengaged, poorly interwoven, and rigid, in addition cohesion and communication qualities are perceived as low. interestingly, parental psychopathological risk predicts adolescents' specific perception of their family functioning. these findings may guide clinical interventions as they suggest that distinct maternal psychopathological symptoms can be associated with a variety of clinical configurations in their offspring, whereas paternal psychopathological risk may be present in adolescents suffering from all forms of eating disorders.
prejudice	improving mainstream perceptions of diversity in hong kong is fundamental to enhancing equality and human rights in the society in the future. the importance of mainstream members of society learning to recognize diversity with less prejudice undergirds many of the aims of a recent educational reform, liberal studies. this paper evaluates the capacity of liberal studies to educate for multicultural understanding of cultural difference. its primary data source is liberal studies textbooks, and it employs a qualitative content analysis to consider how diversity and ethnic, cultural, and religious differences are represented in the texts. the analysis is complemented by an examination of related resources teachers may use in the classroom (and are encouraged to use by the hong kong curriculum development council): mainstream news articles and resources from the (government-provided) web-based resource platform for liberal studies. the voices and views of some practicing teachers and pre-service teacher education students related to multicultural liberal studies resources are also included to provide a balanced picture. based on this analysis, multicultural education as provided in major resources within the liberal studies curriculum appears inadequate. as diversity is reflected upon in resources analyzed here most often as problematic and stereotypical, interventions are needed if liberal studies is to enable multicultural appreciation and understanding among students in hong kong in the future.
gender_roles	this exploratory online investigation sought to examine the links between african american college women 's gender role attitudes, black racial identity attitudes, and domestic violence attitudes toward african american women in heterosexual marital relationships where domestic violence occurs (n = 192). less sophisticated black racial identity attitudes (i.e., pre-encounter and immersion-emersion) predicted greater self-reports of justifying domestic violence toward african american women and believing that african american women benefit from abuse. pre-encounter and immersion-emersion attitudes also predicted less willingness to help victims. an afrocentric worldview (i.e., internalization afrocentricity) was positively predictive of believing that african american women benefit from domestic violence as well as greater willingness to help victims. appreciating one 's african american identity and other racial and ethnic groups (i.e., internalization multiculturalist inclusive) predicted less justification, fewer reports that african american women benefit from abuse, and a greater willingness to help victims. post hoc mediation analyses revealed that gender role attitudes and an investment in protecting african american male domestic violence perpetrators (i.e., black male victimage and justification beliefs) mediated the link between internalization afrocentricity attitudes and the belief that african american women benefit from abuse.
antisocial_personality_disorder	human aggression encompasses a wide range of behaviors and is related to many psychiatric disorders. we introduce the different classification systems of aggression and related disorders as a basis for discussing biochemical biomarkers and then present an overview of studies in humans (published between 1990 and 2015) that reported statistically significant associations of biochemical biomarkers with aggression, dsm-iv disorders involving aggression, and their subtypes. the markers are of different types, including inflammation markers, neurotransmitters, lipoproteins, and hormones from various classes. most studies focused on only a limited portfolio of biomarkers, frequently a specific class only. when integrating the data, it is clear that compounds from several biological pathways have been found to be associated with aggressive behavior, indicating complexity and the need for a broad approach. in the second part of the paper, using examples from the aggression literature and psychiatric metabolomics studies, we argue that a better understanding of aggression would benefit from a more holistic approach such as provided by metabolomics.

false_memories	this article examines the idea that believing that events occurred in the past is a non-memorial decision that reflects underlying processes that are distinct from recollecting events. research on autobiographical memory has often focused on events that are both believed to have occurred and remembered, thus tending to overlook the distinction between autobiographical belief and recollection. studying event representations such as false memories, believed-not-remembered events, and non-believed memories shows the influence of non-memorial processes on evaluations of occurrence. believing that an event occurred and recollecting an event may be more strongly dissociated than previously stated. the relative independence of these constructs was examined in 2 studies. in study 1, multiple events were cued, and then each was rated on autobiographical belief, recollection, and other memory characteristics. in study 2, participants described a nonbelieved memory, a believed memory, and a believed-not-remembered event, and they made similar ratings. in both studies, structural equation modeling techniques revealed distinct belief and recollection latent variables. modeling the predictors of these factors revealed a double dissociation: perceptual, re-experiencing, and emotional features predicted recollection and not belief, whereas event plausibility strongly predicted belief and weakly predicted recollection. the results show that judgments of autobiographical belief and recollection are distinct, that each is influenced by different sources of information and processes, and that the strength of their relationship varies depending on the type of event under study. the concept of autobiographical belief is elaborated, and implications of the findings are discussed in relation to decision making about events, social influence on memory, metacognition, and recognition processes.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the antisocial personality disorder (aspd) is characterized by an incapacity for an individual to adapt himself or herself to the social norms. these social norms are extremely important because they govern many aspects of behavior during adolescence and adulthood. patients with aspd typically have irritability problems and aggressive feelings toward other people. these aggressive feelings toward other people are expressed in a context of threat and intimidation. the aspd is less common in clinical settings comparing the total population, in which the prevalence is 1.1. the familial aggregation for aspd has been registered, in which the 40-50% of the variance can be explained to genetic influences. most of the studies of aspd in molecular genetics have been applying the hypothesis of association of candidate genes, focusing on genes associated with neurotransmission pathways. this has been greatly relevant to the monoamine oxidase gene (mao). genes that promote specific behavior between individuals must have been selected through the process of natural selection. aggressive behaviors and other types of behavior that have an evolutionary origin are similar in the fact that they have to be codified in the genes and will later be transmitted to their descendants.
schizophrenia	it has been 30 years since holzman introduced a special issue of the schizophrenia bulletin entitled ""thought disorder in schizophrenia."" he pointed out in his editor 's introduction that in contrast to the explosion of interest at that time in the biological aspects of schizophrenia, there were important areas of study that represented ""... relatively neglected aspects of the psychopathology of schizophrenia, namely the varieties of thinking disorders (emphasis added) characteristic of schizophrenic patients and their possible underlying mechanisms."" perhaps presciently, he ended his introduction by expressing hope that the articles included in that issue would lead to further intensive study of the cognitive (emphasis added) dysfunctions in schizophrenia. there has, indeed, been extensive research conducted in further understanding cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia, but considerably less so in understanding thought disorder.
child_abuse	the nature and quality of social work decision making have been highlighted in recent years by a number of high-profile child deaths. recognising and assessing child abuse is beset with uncertainties and complexities that profoundly shape practice yet are often overlooked by more official and distanced accounts. this paper draws on ethnographic data from a study of social workers' decision making to uncover some of the issues they faced in gathering and assessing information. workers faced problems with inaccurate or incomplete information, poorly defined situations, time pressures and heavy workloads. the paper draws attention to the ways in which the team organised itself to manage these issues which could provide a better understanding of how everyday decision making can be supported and improved.
false_memories	although some research suggests that misinformation provided by a co-witness could be more influential than that obtained from other sources, most of this research has compared the effect of co-witness information against non-social forms of misinformation only. to better understand the influence of co-witnesses we compared the influence of co-witness misinformation with the influence of misinformation provided by an interviewer. across two experiments using the mori paradigm we found no evidence that a co-witness is particularly influential relative to another social source of post-event misinformation. in fact, the source of the misinformation delivered by our interviewer was less likely to be correctly recalled than the source of the misinformation delivered by a co-witness. there was some evidence that misinformation delivered by both a co-witness and an interviewer has a stronger effect on witnesses' accuracy and confidence than misinformation obtained from either source alone. finally, our results suggest that the opportunity to provide an early individual memory account might protect against the effect of subsequently-encountered co-witness misinformation. these results have important implications for the way that criminal investigations are conducted.
eating_disorders	eating disorders are serious mental disorders as reflected in significant impairments in health and psychosocial functioning and excess mortality. despite the clear evidence of clinical significance and despite availability of evidence-based, effective treatments, research has shown a paradox of elevated health services use and, yet, infrequent treatment specifically targeting the eating disorder (i.e., high unmet treatment need). this review paper summarizes key studies conducted in collaboration with g. terence wilson and offers an update of the research literature published since 2011 in three research areas that undergirded our collaborative research project: unmet treatment needs, cost of illness, and cost-effectiveness of treatments. in regards to unmet treatment needs, epidemiological studies find that the number of individuals with an eating disorder who do not receive disorder-specific treatment continues to remain high. cost-of-illness show that eating disorders are associated with substantial financial burdens for individuals, their family, and society, yet comprehensive examination of costs across public sectors is lacking. cost measures vary widely, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. hospitalization is a major driver of medical costs incurred by individuals with an eating disorder. only a handful of cost-effectiveness studies have been conducted, leaving policy makers with little information on which to base decisions about allocation of resources to help reduce the burden of suffering attributable to eating disorders.

person_perception	this paper explores the effects of emotions embedded in a seller review on its perceived helpfulness to readers. drawing on frameworks in literature on emotion and cognitive processing, we propose that over and above a well-known negativity bias, the impact of discrete emotions in a review will vary, and that one source of this variance is reader perceptions of reviewers' cognitive effort. we focus on the roles of two distinct, negative emotions common to seller reviews: anxiety and anger. in the first two studies, experimental methods were utilized to identify and explain the differential impact of anxiety and anger in terms of perceived reviewer effort. in the third study, seller reviews from yahoo! shopping web sites were collected to examine the relationship between emotional review content and helpfulness ratings. our findings demonstrate the importance of examining discrete emotions in online word-of-mouth, and they carry important practical implications for consumers and online retailers.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: childhood trauma is an important factor in adverse mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate a hypothesized model describing a pathway of childhood trauma and its influence on psychiatric symptoms in patients with depressive disorder. in this model, childhood trauma was positively associated with current depression and anxiety symptoms, which were mediated by a cognitive emotional regulation strategy. method: patients with depressive disorder (n=585, 266 men, 316 women) completed the beck depression inventory (bdi), state-trait anxiety inventory (stai), childhood trauma questionnaire (ctq), and cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire (cerq). we divided the cognitive emotion regulation strategies into adaptive and maladaptive strategies using a cerq subscore. we employed structural equation modeling (sem) and simple/multiple mediation analyses. results: the indirect effect of maladaptive strategies was significant in the relationship between overall childhood trauma and depression/anxiety severity, whereas the mediation effect of adaptive strategies was limited to depressive symptoms. with respect to specific types of trauma, maladaptive strategies mediated the association between emotional abuse and current depression/anxiety, while the mediation effect of adaptive strategies was limited to emotional neglect. limitations: this study 's cross-sectional design does not allow establishment of causal relationships. childhood trauma recall bias may be possible. conclusions: these findings support the hypothesized model in which childhood trauma is associated with adulthood depression/anxiety symptoms in clinical samples, and mediated by emotion regulation strategies. these results suggest that cognitive emotion dysregulation is an important factor affecting depression/anxiety symptoms in patients with childhood trauma.
child_abuse	we conducted two separate, exploratory studies to evaluate the differences between the supervision of wraparound (in-home) and outpatient (office) child treatment interventions. study one (n = 96) examined the structure and norms of supervision between groups as well as rates of general disclosure to direct supervisors. study two (n = 116) specifically examined the frequency of child abuse and neglect encountered in each intervention setting, and the level of disclosure in supervision of these mandatory reporting events. findings from the first study suggest that wraparound clinicians received significantly less individual supervision and colleague consultation than their office-based counterparts. additionally, wraparound clinicians were significantly more likely to withhold information about client cases from their direct supervisors. in the second study, wraparound clinicians endorsed significant increases for observed child abuse, observed child neglect, and verbally reported child neglect compared to their office-based counterparts. in regards to mandatory reporting issues with children, wraparound clinicians were found to be significantly less likely to disclose issues pertaining to child neglect to their direct supervisors than office-based clinicians. our studies show preliminary evidence for a needed increase of individual supervision in wraparound practice, in addition to a greater focus on clinician disclosures related to incidents of child abuse and neglect.
eating_disorders	this armed forces & society issue is on women in the contemporary armed forces in the united states and other nations to include the south african national defense force and the australian defense force. this issue contains a collection of nine papers, each reviewing a current aspect of women serving in the military since the post-vietnam war era. there are also two review essays of megan mackenzie 's book, beyond the band of brothers: the us military and the myth that women ca n't fight. an overview of changing laws and the expanding role of women in the military is provided in this introduction, as well as summaries of the nine articles, and comments on the two book reviews mentioned above.
leadership	mission command is a command philosophy that denotes decentralized leadership; it is a philosophy of command that requires and facilitates initiative in all levels of command and encourages subordinates to exploit opportunities by empowering them to demonstrate initiative and exercise personal judgement. in its first decades of existence, military analysts portrayed the israeli command system as such and termed it optional control'. the primary objective of this article is to explore the rise and decline of optional control' in the idf. the first part of the article follows the development of optional control in the idf 's first decades of existence until the 1970s. the second part of the paper will describe its decline through the analysis of command in recent idf military campaigns. the last part is analysis; explanation for the decline in mission command is attributed to four major factors: the changes in israel 's society and thereof in civilmilitary relations; the changes in character of military operations; the lack of appropriate military education; and the role and impact of new technologies on the idf. the combined effect of these factors impedes the ongoing efforts of the idf to re-establish mission command as its preferred command philosophy.
gender_roles	the capability approach, as developed by amartya sen, has been criticized for an overly individualistic approach, while simultaneously being re-framed in alignment with the dominant social structure. we situate individual agency within the frame of social power structures, examining agency and empowerment gained by mobile phone usage from 26 vietnamese foreign brides in singapore. we use an intersectionality perspective from gender studies to find that, while facing multiple grounds of discrimination from the dominant group, the women constantly negotiate at the intersections of gender, ethnicity and social class, leading to two active strategies for positive well-being and empowerment: essentialization of gender and aspiration. the mobile phone was found to be an active agent in facilitating their aspiration for individual changes, autonomy, and more powerful decision making roles in domestic and social domains - a variety of communicative practices developed their capabilities. on the other hand, mobiles also mediated the enactment and practices of the foreign brides' essential beliefs of their own idealized femininity and traditional gender roles, in contrast with the dominant development discourse of women 's empowerment. the socio-cultural contexts influencing processes of technological appropriation is discussed from the perspective of development, particularly re-framing western notions of gender equality within the agentic framework.
attention	renewed attention is being paid to the quality of qualitative research in studies of development impact in the wake of intense debate over the role of randomised control trials. these debates raised the bar over quality while also provoking concerns about whose voices matter and the politics of evidence-based policymaking. this article argues that both of these issues can be addressed through guba and lincoln 's trustworthiness criteria, and particularly the principle of authenticity which was developed to respond to demands for research to be transformative and emancipatory. adopting these criteria in commissioned evaluations as checklist, artefacts' are a means to improve rigour and raise ethical standards.
problem-solving	the organization for economic co-operation and development 's (oecd) programme of international assessment of adult competencies (piaac) is put forward as a landmark development in the lifelong monitoring and international comparison of education. the first round of piaac 's survey of adult skills compared performance in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments across 24 countries. however, the translation of any oecd agenda into national policies is mediated by many actors, including the media. this paper examines and compares how the national media of japan, england and france reported on the piaac results of their countries and the extent to which these reports mirror key messages from the oecd 's country notes. it begins to trace how the oecd piaac agendas materialise into national policies. although their role in this initial period was limited, we argue the roles of the media together with other policy actors must be monitored as they interact to shape possibilities for sustainable adult education policies.
person_perception	women are less likely than men to engage in sexually agentic behavior (e.g., initiating sexual encounters), despite the benefits associated with sexual agency (kiefer & sanchez, 2007). two studies examined possible explanations, related to person perception, for gender differences in sexually agentic behavior. in study 1, participants viewed the dating profiles of targets who were either high or low on sexual agency and rated sexually agentic targets as more desirable but also riskier sexual partners (i.e., having more previous sexual partners), as well as more selfish partners overall. participants believed the agentic female targets to be the most desirable but also to have the highest number of previous sexual partners. in study 2, female participants weighed the importance and consequences of sexual agency differently than male participants. based on the two studies, we suggest that although men and women are judged similarly for sexual agency, women may refrain from sexual agency because they view the traits and characteristics that are perceived to go hand in hand with sexual agency more negatively.
gender_roles	this study examines the relationship between various aspects of female labor participation and people 's family role attitudes. following exposure theory, we expect that individuals may adopt more egalitarian family roles as they are more often exposed to employed women because it dispels negative ideas about women 's capabilities and brings them into contact with nontraditional networks. this study provides an elaborate test by examining the role of exposure to female colleagues and supervisors in three contexts: workplaces, occupational sectors, and countries. we found that the number of female colleagues at work and in occupational sectors was positively related to egalitarian family roles of employed men. our study further showed that this positive relationship between exposure to female colleagues at work and men 's egalitarian family roles was weaker in female-dominated sectors. remarkably, exposure to national female labor participation was not significantly related to the family roles of employed women.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: in spite of the availability of effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), many patients do not respond sufficiently or relapse. treatments using other potentially effective methods such as experiential techniques need to be investigated. we developed a 12-week inpatient treatment augmenting exposure and response prevention (erp) with schema therapy (st) called sterp. the feasibility and effectiveness of sterp was tested.. methods: in a pilot study, 10 inpatients with ocd who failed to respond to cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) with erp received sterp. the yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale (y-bocs) served as primary outcome. secondary outcome measures were the obsessive compulsive inventory-revised (oci-r) and the beck depression inventory (bdi-ii). treatment effects were assessed with t-tests for paired samples. results: significant reductions of the y-bocs, oci-r and the bdi-ii were found, with very large effect sizes (cohen 's d = 1.48-2.25). results remained stable at 6 months follow-up. five prior non-responders responded according to the 35% y-bocs symptom reduction criterion.. limitations: lack of control group, small sample size and lack of repeated outcome measures during baseline. conclusions: sterp may be a feasible and potentially effective treatment for prior non-responders among ocd patients and thus worth further investigation in randomized controlled trials..

schizophrenia	this study aims at assessing the relative contribution of employment specialist competencies working in supported employment (se) programs and client variables in determining the likelihood of obtaining competitive employment. a total of 489 persons with a severe mental illness and 97 employment specialists working in 24 se programs across three canadian provinces were included in the study. overall, 43% of the sample obtained competitive work. both client variables and employment specialist competencies, while controlling for the quality of se programs implementation, predicted job acquisition. multilevel analyses further indicated that younger client age, shorter duration of unemployment, and client use of job search strategies, as well as the working alliance perceived by the employment specialist, were the strongest predictors of competitive employment for people with severe mental illness, with 51% of variance explained. for people with severe mental illness seeking employment, active job search behaviors, relational abilities, and employment specialist competencies are central contributors to acquisition of competitive employment.
gender_roles	sexism is a stressor for many women and is related to a host of harmful psychosocial outcomes, including silencing oneself in social relationships. the present study examined the relationships among sexist experiences, endorsement of traditional feminine gender roles, commitment to social change, and self-silencing among a sample of 261 women. results revealed that recent sexist experiences and endorsement of traditional feminine gender roles significantly and positively predicted self-silencing, whereas a commitment to social change significantly and negatively predicted self-silencing. in addition, lifetime sexist experiences were associated with greater self-silencing for women with low levels of commitment to social change, but not for women with average or high levels, suggesting a buffering effect. women who were less committed to social change demonstrated higher levels of self-silencing when sexual objectification experiences were less frequent; women with higher levels of commitment to social change were less likely to self-silence, regardless of the frequency of sexual objectification experiences. thus, it is important to explore women 's sexist experiences and gender roles attitudes and to locate women 's self-silencing within a sexist sociocultural context. moreover, fostering a commitment to social change may be a promising intervention for reducing the impact of sexist events on women 's self-silencing.
seasonal_affective_disorder	the mammalian circadian timing system consists of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) and subordinate clocks that disseminate time information to various central and peripheral tissues. while the function of the scn in circadian rhythm regulation has been extensively studied, we still have limited understanding of how peripheral tissue clock function contributes to the regulation of physiological processes. the adrenal gland plays a special role in this context as adrenal hormones show strong circadian secretion rhythms affecting downstream physiological processes. at the same time, they have been shown to affect clock gene expression in various other tissues, thus mediating systemic entrainment to external zeitgebers and promoting internal circadian alignment. in this review, we discuss the function of circadian clocks in the adrenal gland, how they are reset by the scn and may further relay time-of-day information to other tissues. focusing on glucocorticoids, we conclude by outlining the impact of adrenal rhythm disruption on neuropsychiatric, metabolic, immune, and malignant disorders.
schizophrenia	objective: despite its extensive use for treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, computer-assisted cognitive remediation (cacr) currently lacks a standardized protocol. duration is an important feature to be defined, as it may contribute to heterogeneous outcome. this study compares 2 treatment durations, 3 versus 6 months, to analyze their effects on both cognition and daily functioning. method: fifty-seven outpatients with schizophrenia received 3 months of cacr and 41 received 6 months of cacr. all patients were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months with the brief assessment for cognition in schizophrenia and with the quality of life scale (qls). results: repeated measures anova showed significant improvements in all cognitive domains after 3 months. a significant effect of treatment duration was observed only for executive functions, with significantly higher scores among patients treated for 6 months. significant improvements in qls were also observed after 6 months in both groups, with a significant time by treatment interaction for qls total score. conclusions: results confirm the efficacy of 3-months cacr in terms of both cognitive and functional improvements, suggesting that an extended intervention may lead to further benefits in executive functions and daily functioning.
schizophrenia	phosphoinositides are essential components of lipid membranes and crucial regulators of many cellular functions, including signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, membrane receptor localization and activity, and determination of membrane identity. these functions depend on the dynamic and highly regulated metabolism of phosphoinositides and require finely balanced activity of specific phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. there is increasing evidence from genetic and functional studies that these enzymes are often dysregulated or mutated in autism spectrum disorders; in particular, phosphoinositide 3-kinases and their regulatory subunits appear to be affected frequently. examples of autism spectrum disorders with defective phosphoinositide metabolism are fragile x syndrome and autism disorders associated with mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (pten), but recent genetic analyses also suggest that select nonsyndromic, idiopathic forms of autism may have altered activity of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. isoform-specific inhibitors for some of the phosphoinositide kinases have already been developed for cancer research and treatment, and a few are being evaluated for use in humans. altogether, this offers exciting opportunities to explore altered phosphoinositide metabolism as a therapeutic target in individuals with certain forms of autism. this review summarizes genetic and functional studies identifying defects in phosphoinositide metabolism in autism and related disorders, describes published preclinical work targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinases in neurological diseases, and discusses the opportunities and challenges ahead to translate these findings from animal models and human cells into clinical application in humans.

eating_disorders	aims and objectivesthe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic conversation intervention in group and caregiver sessions on the supporting role of caregivers. backgroundcaregivers of people with eating disorders are known to suffer major difficulties and are in great need of support. unhelpful parental support strategies can delay the recovery of an individual with an eating disorder. skill training interventions can equip parents with skills, guidance and techniques by helping them to be a support person and making them one of the most important links in the treatment process. designthe therapeutic conversation intervention consisted of five group and caregiver sessions and three booster sessions. the calgary family assessment and calgary family intervention models, the illness beliefs model and the new maudsley method were used as theoretical frameworks. the content of the intervention consisted of work on difficult behaviours, feelings and helpful strategies. the participants (n=58) included primary and secondary caregivers of 12- to 24-year-old patients with eating disorders. eight caregivers dropped out of treatment. methodsthis study had a quasi-experimental design with one pre- and two post-test measures. resultsbetween 90-96% of caregivers rated the therapeutic conversation intervention as supportive. furthermore, the study revealed significant differences in caregiver emotional and cognitive support, illness beliefs, disruptive behaviour and quality of life, negative aspects of care giving demands and caregiver and patient behavioural difficulties after the intervention and/or at follow-up. conclusionstherapeutic conversation intervention with caregivers in group and private sessions proved to be beneficial. relevance to clinical practicethis outcome provides information for healthcare professionals on how they can help primary caregivers in their supporting role, which can, in turn, improve services in healthcare centres and psychiatric hospitals.
social_cognition	objective: individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate cognitive, social cognitive, and motivational deficits that contribute to impairment in real-world functioning. in the current study, we investigated the effects of supplementing computerized neurocognitive training with social cognitive exercises, as compared with neurocognitive training alone. method: in this ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 111 participants with psychosis, we compare the effects of supplementing intensive targeted cognitive training with social cognitive training exercises (tct + sct) with the effects of targeted cognitive training alone (tct-only). participants were assessed on cognition, symptoms, functional capacity, and functional outcomes, as well as social cognition and measures related to reward processing. results: both treatment groups showed significant improvement in multiple cognitive domains and improvement in functional capacity. however, as predicted, tct + sct group participants showed significant improvement in prosody identification and reward processing relative to tct-only participants. conclusions and implications for practice: our findings indicate that supplementing intensive computerized cognitive training with social cognitive exercises in people with psychosis confers greater benefits in prosody identification and reward processing relative to cognitive training alone, even though both approaches drive significant improvements in cognition and functional capacity. impairments in both prosody identification and reward processing have been associated with greater negative symptoms and poorer functional outcomes in schizophrenia, raising the possibility that this form of treatment may lead to better long-term outcomes than traditional cognitive training approaches. follow-up assessments will determine whether results are durable and generalize over time to improvements in symptoms and functioning.
attention	recent advances in sediment source tracing or fingerprinting procedures have focussed primarily on the use of novel sediment properties that are either easier to measure or provide improved source discrimination, or on improved procedures for representing and estimating the uncertainty associated with the final source apportionment results. spatial variability of source properties has long been recognised as a potential problem for the approach, but there have been few attempts to explore the nature and magnitude of such variability and its wider implications for source fingerprinting investigations. this contribution addresses this issue with particular reference to surficial sediment sources. it reports the results of an investigation aimed at documenting the magnitude and nature of the spatial variability of the geochemical properties of surface soils within a single 7 ha cultivated field and exploring the implications of the findings for sediment source fingerprinting procedures. samples of surface soil were collected from 52 points located within the field. particular attention is directed to the extent of the spatial variability of 53 geochemical properties of the surface soil which could potentially be used as fingerprints, the importance of the influence of soil redistribution rate on the properties of the surface soil, provision of guidelines for selecting sampling points and the degree of correlation between different soil properties and its implications for the numerical procedures employed in sediment source fingerprinting studies. a novel aspect of the study is that caesium-137 (cs-137) measurements were used to provide information on the magnitude and spatial pattern of the soil redistribution rate within the field, so that the influence of soil redistribution rate in causing systematic spatial variability of fingerprint properties could be further explored.

prejudice	using a person perception paradigm, two studies explored the interplay between target males' sociability and competence (the ""big two"" personality dimensions), gender role, and sexual orientation. study 1 (n = 180) showed that sociable men were considered more likely to be gay than were competent men, which was mediated by the attribution of lower masculinity. in study 2 (n = 120), target sexual orientation was considered as an independent variable. in the stereotype-congruent condition (gay/sociable vs. heterosexual/competent), gay men were rated more feminine and less masculine than were heterosexual men, whereas in the stereotype-incongruent condition (gay/competent vs. heterosexual/sociable), gay targets were rated less feminine but only equally masculine. across both studies, the apparent stereotype of the ""nice gay guy"" was uncorrelated with participants' attitudes toward or contact with gay men. results are discussed with regard to the gender-inversion hypothesis, the distinction between (anti) gay stereotypes and prejudice, and the stereotype content model.
borderline_personality_disorder	objective: borderline personality disorder (bpd) includes a heterogeneous constellation of symptoms operationalized with 9 categorical criteria. as the field of personality disorder (pd) research moves to emphasize dimensional traits in its operationalization, it is important to delineate continuity between the 9 dsm-iv/diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) categorical criteria for bpd and the trait dimensions in dsm-5 section iii. to date, no study has attempted such validation. methods: we examined the associations between the 9 categorical dsm-iv/dsm-5 criteria for bpd and the trait dimensions of the alternative dsm-5 model for pds in consecutively recruited psychiatric outpatients (n = 142; 68% female; age: mean 29.02, sd 8.38). this was investigated by means of bivariate correlations, followed by multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the categorical bpd criteria were associated with conceptually related dsm-5 section iii traits (p >0.001), except for the criterion of chronic feelings of emptiness. consistent with the proposed traits criteria for bpd in dsm-5 section iii, we found emotional lability, anxiousness, separation insecurity, depressivity, impulsivity, risk taking, and hostility to capture conceptually coherent bpd categorical criteria, while suspiciousness was also strongly associated with bpd criteria. at the domain level, this applied to negative affectivity, disinhibition, and psychoticism. notably, emotional lability, impulsivity, and suspiciousness emerged as unique predictors of bpd (p >0.05). conclusions: in addition to the proposed bpd traits criteria, suspiciousness and features of psychoticism also augment bpd features. provided that these findings are replicated in forthcoming research, a modified traits operationalization of bpd is warranted.
prenatal_development	methiozolin is a new herbicide to control annual bluegrass (poa annua l.) and large crabgrass (digitaria sanguinalis (l.) scop.) in various turfgrasses. the potential of methiozolin to induce maternal and developmental toxicity was investigated in the pregnant new zealand white rabbits. methiozolin was, at dose levels of 0, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg/day, administered by oral gavage to artificially inseminated rabbits (25 females per group) from days 6 to 28 of gestation. all does were subjected to cesarean section on day 29 of gestation. at 500 mg/kg/day, treatment-related toxicities including abortion (10/22), decreased mean body weight, weight gain, net body weight change, reduced food consumption and decreased fetal weight were observed. at 125 and 250 mg/kg/day, no signs of maternal and developmental toxicity were observed. there were no treatment-related external, visceral and skeletal abnormalities of fetuses at all doses tested. in the current experimental conditions, the no observed adverse effect levels (noaels) of methiozolin are considered to be 250 mg/kg/day for does and prenatal development.

borderline_personality_disorder	individuals with borderline personality disorder (bpd) are characterized by emotional instability, impaired emotion regulation and unresolved attachment patterns associated with abusive childhood experiences. we investigated the neural response during the activation of the attachment system in bpd patients compared to healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging writ eleven female patients with bpd without posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and 17 healthy female controls matched for age and education were telling stories in the scanner in response to the adult attachment projective picture system (aap), an eight-picture set assessment of adult attachment. the picture set includes theoretically derived attachment scenes, such as separation, death, threat and potential abuse. the picture presentation order is designed to gradually increase the activation of the attachment system. each picture stimulus was presented for 2 min. analyses examine group differences in attachment classifications and neural activation patterns over the course of the task. unresolved attachment was associated with increasing amygdala activation over the course of the attachment task in patients as well as controls. unresolved controls, but not patients, showed activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and the rostra cingulate zone (rcz). we interpret this as a neural signature of bpd patients' inability to exert top-down control under conditions of attachment distress. these findings point to possible neural mechanisms for underlying affective dysregulation in bpd in the context of attachment trauma and fear.
prenatal_development	metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mglur5) is expressed by neurons in zones of active neurogenesis and is involved in the development of neural stem cells in vivo and in vitro. we examined the expression of mglur5 in the cortex and hippocampus of rats during various prenatal and postnatal periods using immunohistochemistry. during prenatal development, mglur5 was primarily localized to neuronal somas in the forebrain. during early postnatal periods, the receptor was mainly present on somas in the cortex. mglur5 immunostaining was visible in apical dendrites and in the neuropil of neurons and persisted throughout postnatal development. during this period, pyramidal neurons were strongly labeled for the receptor. in the hippocampal ca1 region, mglur5 immunoreactivity was more intense in the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum, and lacunosum moleculare at p0, p5 and p10 relative to p60. mglur5 expression increased significantly in the molecular layer and decreased significantly in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus at p5, p10 and p60 in comparison with p0. furthermore, some mglur5-positive cells were also bromodeoxyuridine-or neurod-positive in the dentate gyrus at p14. these results demonstrate that mglur5 has a differential expression pattern in the cortex and hippocampus during early growth, suggesting a role for this receptor in the control of domain specific brain developmental events.
false_memories	metacognition, or the capacity to reflect upon one 's own knowledge, is a key trait in our cognitive repertoire which is developed during childhood. here, a direct comparison of metacognitive ability in children (n=188; 6-9 years old) and adults, (n=47) using a single perceptual task, was made. results showed that 6-9 years old children have a level of metacognitive access similar to that of adults. further, a signal detection theory model was applied in order to distinguish metacognitive ability from the propensity towards risk taking, two factors that have so far been confounded in studies. children presented a suboptimal tendency towards risky decisions and a natural predisposition to overconfidence that can be partially mitigated by imposing a conservative normative strategy.

antisocial_personality_disorder	aggressive behaviors have become a major public health problem, and early-onset aggression can lead to outcomes such as substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder among other issues. in recent years, there has been an increase in research in the molecular and genetic underpinnings of aggressive behavior, and one of the candidate genes codes for the catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt). comt is involved in catabolizing catecholamines such as dopamine. these neurotransmitters appear to be involved in regulating mood which can contribute to aggression. the most common gene variant studied in the comt gene is the valine (val) to methionine (met) substitution at codon 158. we will be reviewing the current literature on this gene variant in aggressive behavior.
person_perception	social perception is among the most important tasks that occur in daily life, and perceivers readily appreciate the social affordances of others. here, we demonstrate that sex categorizations are functionally biased towards a male percept. perceivers judged body shapes that varied in waist-to-hip ratio to be men if they were not, in reality, exclusive to women, and male categorizations occurred more quickly than female categorizations (studies 1 and 4). this pattern was corroborated when participants identified the average body shapes of men and women (study 2) and when we assessed participants' cognitive representations (study 3). moreover, these tendencies were modulated by emotion context (study 4). thus, male categorizations occurred readily and rapidly, demonstrating a pronounced categorization bias and temporal advantage for male judgements.
prosocial_behavior	a variety of studies on food sharing elucidate both its ultimate and proximate functions in non-human primates, especially in pan. for chimpanzees, food sharing serves as a means to strengthen social relationships. in contrast, little is known about food sharing in orangutans, since their semi-solitary lifestyle barely provides an opportunity to share food outside of the mother-offspring context. however, recent long-term studies suggest that social bonding might play a more important role for orangutans than previously assumed. in zoos, orangutans are often kept in groups and seem to cope with group living quite well. if captive orangutans use food sharing as a social tool, they are expected to share food frequently and selectively with close social partners and to engage frequently in active transfers. we provided three orangutan groups with monopolizable food and recorded all dyadic food-related interactions. for each dyad, we determined the relationship quality and tested whether it predicts food sharing. we found that, in support of our predictions, almost two thirds of interactions involving food resulted in sharing and that the probability for an individual to share food with a particular partner increased with the strength of their relationship. exceeding our expectations, food sharing occurred even between individuals from two neighboring groups. finally, a comparison with studies on captive chimpanzees revealed a significantly higher proportion of active transfers for orangutans suggesting species-specific sharing psychologies. sharing of food is a universal prosocial behavior in humans. recent research aims to elucidate its adaptive functions and proximate mechanisms by comparison with other species, especially non-human primates, in natural and captive settings. for bonobos and chimpanzees, our closest relatives, the quality of social relationships was revealed to be important for food sharing. in contrast, there is very limited knowledge on food sharing in orangutans, our most distant and semi-solitary living hominid relatives. this study provides the first systematic investigation of food-sharing patterns and the role of relationship quality in captive orangutans. the results demonstrate that group-living orangutans share frequently and selectively with close associates and even more actively than found for chimpanzees. these findings add further evidence supporting the hypothesis that social bonding played a role in the evolution of human prosocial behavior.
depression	aimsto explore the common effects of the clusterin (clu) rs11136000 variant on the default mode network (dmn) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci) subjects and remitted geriatric depression (rgd) subjects. methodsfifty-one amci subjects, 38 rgd subjects, and 64 cognitively normal elderly subjects underwent resting-state fmri scans and neuropsychological tests at both baseline and a 35-month follow-up. posterior cingulate cortex seed-based functional connectivity (fc) analysis was used to obtain the dmn patterns. resultsa clu genexdiseasextime interaction for amci subjects was mainly detected in the core cortical midline structures of the dmn, and the interaction for rgd subjects was mainly detected in the limbic system. however, they overlapped in two frontal regions, where consistent effects of the clu gene on fc alterations were found between amci and rgd groups. furthermore, the alterations of fc with frontal, parietal, and limbic regions compensated for episodic memory impairments in clu-ct/tt carriers, while no such compensation was found in clu-cc carriers. conclusionthe clu gene could consistently affect the dmn fc with frontal regions among individuals at risk for alzheimer 's disease, and the clu-t allele was associated with more compensatory neural processes in dmn changes.
social_cognition	pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement (pce) represents the non-medical use of prescribed medication for the improvement of cognitive functioning and academic performance. although there are some studies about pce prevalence, it is less clear how users and non-users of pce substances differ with respect to their positive and negative student experiences (e.g. academic burnout and engagement with studies) and in social cognitive variables that relate to decision-making and self-regulation of pce use. the present study assessed whether students with different experiences of pce substance use displayed differences in academic burnout, study engagement, and social cognitive variables relevant to pce use. three hundred and forty-seven university students (mean age (m) = 22.15years, sd = 1.69; 54% females) completed a battery of anonymous questionnaires on academic burnout, engagement with studies, social cognitive variables relevant to pce use, and self-reported use of pce substances and non-prescribed nutritional supplements. three user groups emerged, namely non-users (51.9%, n = 180), single users of non-prescribed dietary supplements (25.4%, n = 88), and dual users of both non-prescribed dietary supplements and pce (22.8%, n = 79). multivariate analysis of variance indicated significant differences among the three user groups in intentions, attitudes, social norms, and anticipated regret toward pce use. no significant differences were observed with respect to academic burnout and work engagement. the findings show that university students may engage in pce use independent of their student experiences. rather, a chemically assisted performance enhancement mindset seems to differentiate users from non-users of pce substances.
antisocial_personality_disorder	background: current categorical classification of personality disorders has been criticized for overlooking the dimensional nature of personality and that it may miss some sub-threshold personality disturbances of clinical significance. we aimed to evaluate the clinical importance of these conditions. for this, we used a simple four-level dimensional categorization based on the severity of personality disturbance. methods: the sample consisted of 352 patients admitted to mental health services. all underwent diagnostic assessments (scid-i and scid-ii) and filled in questionnaires concerning their social situation and childhood adversities, and other validated tools, including the beck depression inventory (bdi), alcohol use disorders identification test (audit), health-related quality of life (15d), and the five-item mental health index (mhi-5). the patients were categorized into four groups according to the level of personality disturbance: 0 = no personality disturbance, 1 = personality difficulty (one criterion less than threshold for one or more personality disorders), 2 = simple personality disorder (one personality disorder), and 3 = complex/severe personality disorder (two or more personality disorders or any borderline and antisocial personality disorder). results: the proportions of the groups were as follows: no personality disturbance 38.4% (n = 135), personality difficulty 14.5% (n = 51), simple personality disorder 19.9% (n = 70), and complex/severe personality disorder 24.4% (n = 86). patients with no personality disturbance were significantly differentiated (p < 0.05) from the other groups regarding the bdi, 15d, and mhi-5 scores as well as the number of axis i diagnoses. patients with complex/severe personality disorders stood out as being worst off. social dysfunction was related to the severity of the personality disturbance. patients with a personality difficulty or a simple personality disorder had prominent symptoms and difficulties, but the differences between these groups were mostly non-significant. conclusions: an elevated severity level of personality disturbance is associated with an increase in psychiatric morbidity and social dysfunction. diagnostically sub-threshold personality difficulties are of clinical significance and the degree of impairment corresponds to actual personality disorders. since these two groups did not significantly differ from each other, our findings also highlight the complexity related to the use of diagnostic thresholds for separate personality disorders.
nonverbal_communication	the impact of simulated embodied agent emotion has been explored in short-term studies, but no work to date has examined its impact in longer interactions that involve multiple interactions with agents. we present an embodied agent (rachael) that simulates a health professional and attempts to help people improve their fruit and vegetable consumption. emotional and unemotional versions of the agent were developed to examine how user perceptions of the agent changed over an intervention period of 49 days and in turn how this influenced fruit and vegetable consumption. results found that whilst participants consumed more daily portions of fruit and vegetables over the intervention period and reduced their consumption gains post-intervention, there was no significant difference in consumption gains over time between those who interacted with the emotional or unemotional agents. qualitative feedback, however, highlighted a strong preference for the emotional agent. a novelty effect was also observed where the agents were perceived more positively initially and less so over time.
eating_disorders	introduction. both children affected by nutritional and eating disorders (ed) and adults with bipolar disorder (bd) display symptoms of deficient emotional self-regulation, which can present in different forms. if we observe the clinical and developmental histories of individuals affected by eds and bd, based on a cognitive systemic post-rationalist approach, we can hypothesise a continuum between the two disorders. the aim of this pilot study is to support the hypothesis -from an explanatory rather than a non-descriptive approach -that eds and bd are the possible result of issues tied to biological and psychological self-regulation. when such an issue manifests during an individual 's early stages through an eating disorder, it is more likely to result in an actual affective disorder, such as bd, during an individual 's adult years. materials and methods. the study examined a total of 51 patients affected by an ed between the ages of 8 and 18. at least one of the parents had been diagnosed with a mental disorder. all of the subjects completed the child behavior checklist (cbcl) and the eating disorders inventory (edi) ii. each of the patients underwent a pediatric assessment using their bmi to establish the type of ed. the parents were divided into two groups: subjects with bd and subjects affected by other psychopathologies. results. although the comparison between patients with eds and parents with or without bd did not demonstrate a significant difference in any scale, it highlighted specific common characteristics between the disorder presented by the parent and the cognitive-emotional expressions of his or her child. in fact, the results indicate that the cbcl ""problems of thought"" scale explains much of the impulsivity variance obtained by the edi and that the cbcl ""high withdrawal/depression"" dependent factor highlighted a statistical significance for the edi 's ""low interoceptive awareness"" scale. conclusions. the study presented limitations, especially with respect to the sample size examined, but it suggests a field that can be further explored to understand the reasons for a significance in the aspects related to contrasting emotional adjustments, impulsivity and depression/withdrawal, highlighting a connection with the parents' distinctive relational model.
prejudice	like many development towns that were established in the aftermath of israel 's founding, kiryat shemona is situated on the demographic and geographic margins of the state: it sits on the border with lebanon, and is in the galilee region that has historically been a major center of israel 's palestinian population. particularly in moments of cross-border violence, kiryat shemona becomes a central margin, a place that is crucial to imagining the israeli nation. for this reason, its inhabitants are imagined by others and often by themselves as steadfast and strong qualities said to be at the center of lsraeliness. at the same time, like other development towns, kiryat shemona 's residents are mainly mizrahim who were pushed to populate these marginal regions, and who constitute a majority of the israeli jewish population but also in many respects constitute an under-class vis-a-vis the historically ashkenazi elite. mizrahim, in such development towns, are thus marginal to the center of power, and vulnerable to the insecurity and poverty associated with these towns. while inhabiting precarious borderlands, they are crucial to the imagining of a bounded jewish israeli nation that must defend itself. this article demonstrates how mizrahim strived to move themselves symbolically from the margins of exclusion to the center of inclusion by calling upon the nation and cosmopolitan connections. in everyday life, mizrahim marked ethicized boundaries against differentiated others, thus reinforcing the ethnoreligious logic of israeli nationalism that historically pushed them to the margins of the state.
borderline_personality_disorder	objectives: bipolar disorder requires psychiatric medications, but even guideline-concordant treatment fails to bring many patients to remission or keep them euthymic. to address this gap, researchers have developed adjunctive psychotherapies. the purpose of this paper is to critically review the evidence for the efficacy of manualized psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. methods: we conducted a search of the literature to examine recent (2007-present), randomized controlled studies of the following psychotherapy interventions for bipolar disorder: psychoeducation (pe), cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (ipsrt), dialectical behavior therapy (dbt), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (mbct), and family therapies such as family focused therapy (fft). results: all of the psychotherapy interventions appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. psychoeducation and cbt are associated with increased time to mood episode relapse or recurrence. mbct has demonstrated a particular effectiveness in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. online psychotherapy interventions, programs combining one or more psychotherapy interventions, and targeted interventions centering on particular symptoms have been the focus of recent, randomized controlled studies in bipolar disorder. conclusions: psychotherapy interventions for the treatment of bipolar disorder have substantial evidence for efficacy. the next challenge will to disseminate these psychotherapies into the community.

nonverbal_communication	objective: in order to guide curricular innovation, we looked at the feasibility and utility of performing a targeted needs assessment of the communication skills of pgy2 internal medicine (im) residents in their continuity clinic, utilizing faculty direct observation with a validated instrument for communication skills evaluation. methods: a convenience sample of pgy2 residents in the emory university school of medicine im residency program was invited to participate. using the segue framework, a checklist of medical communication tasks, faculty assessed residents during a clinic encounter. results: thirty out of 53 (57%) pgy2 residents were assessed. segue results indicate residents were most likely to ""maintain patient 's privacy"" (100%), ""greet patient appropriately"" (97%) and ""check/clarify information"" (100%). residents were least likely to ""acknowledge waiting time"" (7%), ""explore psychosocial/emotional factors"" (27%) and ""outline agenda for visit"" (33%). conclusion: the segue framework is a feasible tool to evaluate the communication skills of im residents in a clinic setting. many pgy2 im residents in a large, urban practice do not elicit important psychosocial information during outpatient clinic visits. practice implications: more observation and evaluation of residents' communication skills are needed, with emphasis on building skills to ""understand the patient 's perspective.""

schizophrenia	i offer some psychoanalytic perspectives and hypotheses to contribute to understanding why family interventions are rarely offered in psychosis. this is despite decades of evidence that family difficulties often predate onset of psychosis and that skilled family interventions are at least as effective as medication in reducing relapse rates. i contend that it is often unbearably disturbing for some families to even consider the possibility of having contributed to the vulnerability of a member to psychosis and that professionals fear accusations of blaming'. multisystem defences, involving both families and professionals, shift explanations for psychosis, reducing them as a disorder of brain chemistry and somewhat exclusively allowing the logical consequence that only pharmacological interventions make sense'. i summarize the unfortunate consequences of these defences and suggest that there is denial of the important difference between describing possible family environmental contributing factors in psychosis and attributing blame'. whole team training that involves families and social networks in a highly respectful and humane manner overcomes some of these obstacles. several decades of increasingly successful research in the finnish psychodynamically orientated need-adapted approach to psychosis' resulting in recent more global interest in open dialogue indicate an effective way of engaging families and of achieving superior outcomes in returning individuals to social engagement as students or to employment.
social_cognition	exogenous oxytocin administration is widely reported to improve social cognition in human and nonhuman primate adults. risk factors of impaired social cognition, however, emerge in infancy. early interventions-when plasticity is greatest-are critical to reverse negative outcomes. we tested the hypothesis that oxytocin may exert similar positive effects on infant social cognition, as in adults. to test this idea, we assessed the effectiveness of acute, aerosolized oxytocin on two foundational social cognitive skills: working memory (i.e., ability to briefly hold and process information) and social gaze (i.e., tracking the direction of others' gaze) in 1-month-old nursery-reared macaque monkeys (macaca mulatta). we did not predict sex differences, but we included sex as a factor in our analyses to test whether our effects would be generalizable across both males and females. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we found that females were more socially skilled at baseline compared to males, and that oxytocin improved working memory and gaze following, but only in males. these sex differences, while unexpected, may be due to interactions with gonadal steroids and may be relevant to sexually dimorphic disorders of social cognition, such as male-biased autism spectrum disorder, for which oxytocin has been proposed as a potential treatment. in sum, we report the first evidence that oxytocin may influence primate infant cognitive abilities. moreover, these behavioral effects appear sexually dimorphic, highlighting the importance of considering sex differences. oxytocin effects observed in one sex may not be generalizable to the other sex.
false_memories	conditional discriminations established using a linear series training structure were shown in a previous study to be intact when unreinforced trials assessing such performance were presented interspersed among stimulus equivalence test trials. experimenter-defined correct performance on these trials was seen both for participants responding in accordance with stimulus equivalence and for some participants who did not. the goal of the current study was to investigate the status of previously trained relations at the time of stimulus equivalence tests in further contexts. experiment 1 investigated this following many-to-one conditional discrimination training with 20 adult participants. experimenter-defined correct performance on probes for trained relations was observed for 16 out of 17 of participants who formed stimulus equivalence classes, as well as for all participants not responding in accordance with stimulus equivalence. in experiment 2, 18 adult participants received linear series, many-to-one, or one-to-many conditional discrimination training and tests for stimulus equivalence with interspersed training trials. subsequently, participants experienced three additional tests for derived and trained performance within a month of the original training. continued testing and the passage of time had little effect on the stability of both learned and derived performance for participants initially responding in accordance with stimulus equivalence. participants who failed to form stimulus equivalence classes in the initial test, but responded in line with the trained relations, displayed more varied performance over time. results from both experiments indicate that the lack of stimulus equivalence performance is not commonly caused by a breakdown of trained relations at the time of the stimulus equivalence test.
depression	there is evidence that both the centrality of a loss-event as well as reduced self-concept clarity are involved in emotional problems after the death of a loved one. one issue that is still unexplored is the relative importance of these two concepts in predicting bereavement outcome. the current study examined the degree to which both concepts contribute to emotional distress after loss, both concurrently and longitudinally. data were available from 124 individuals, all bereaved within the previous half year, who completed measures of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression at inclusion into the study and again 6 months later. loss-centrality and self-unclarity were associated with all three outcome measures, in cross-sectional analyses. longitudinal analyses indicated that loss-centrality predicted symptom levels of prolonged grief, self-unclarity predicted symptom levels of depression, and both loss-centrality and self-unclarity were associated with posttraumatic stress 6 months after baseline. implications of these findings are discussed.
depression	the present research examined how particular types of combat exposure may be associated not only with increased mental health symptoms but also with perceived benefits that are associated with decreased mental health symptoms. using a longitudinal sample of military personnel who had returned from combat in iraq or afghanistan, active combat experiences (such as shooting or directing fire at the enemy) were related to higher levels of perceived benefits following the deployment, whereas passive experiences (such as being the recipient of an attack or witnessing destruction) were not. perceived benefits 3 months postdeployment were associated with lower posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) symptoms 3 months later. a mediational analysis revealed that although active combat experiences were associated with greater ptsd symptoms, a portion of this relationship was reduced as a result of the association between active combat experiences and benefit finding. discussion focuses on additional research needed on the role of benefit finding in postcombat adjustment, and how employees may derive benefits from their work that predict future mental health symptoms.
antisocial_personality_disorder	alcohol use disorders, substance use disorders, and antisocial personality disorder share a common externalizing liability, which may also include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). however, few studies have compared formal quantitative models of externalizing liability, with the aim of delineating the categorical and/or continuous nature of this liability in the community. this study compares categorical, continuous, and hybrid models of externalizing liability. data were derived from the 2004-2005 national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions (n = 34,653). seven disorders were modeled: childhood adhd and lifetime diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (aspd), nicotine dependence, alcohol dependence, marijuana dependence, cocaine dependence, and other substance dependence. the continuous latent trait model provided the best fit to the data. measurement invariance analyses supported the fit of the model across genders, with females displaying a significantly lower probability of experiencing externalizing disorders. cocaine dependence, marijuana dependence, other substance dependence, alcohol dependence, aspd, nicotine dependence, and adhd provided the greatest information, respectively, about the underlying externalizing continuum. liability to externalizing disorders is continuous and dimensional in severity. the findings have important implications for the organizational structure of externalizing psychopathology in psychiatric nomenclatures.
borderline_personality_disorder	objectives: this study aimed to: (1) identify clusters based on the diagnostic status of mental disorders among individuals with problematic substance use treated in an addiction rehabilitation center (arc), and (2) characterize these clusters according to socio-demographic variables, neighborhood characteristics, and health service utilization. methods: data were compiled for 4526 individuals with problematic substance use who received services from an arc in 2004. the data were compiled by merging four databases: the arc data registry, the quebec health insurance board database, the quebec provincial database for hospitalizations, and the quebec national institute of public health database. a two-step cluster analysis was performed to generate distinct groups based on diagnostic categories of mental disorders. complementary comparative analyses were conducted to test differences among the clusters. results: three clusters were identified. the first cluster consisted of individuals who did not receive any diagnosis of a mental disorder, including substance use disorders (suds), and who were low users of health services. the second cluster was composed of individuals who received a diagnosis of mental disorder, but not of sud, and who primarily used mental health services. the third cluster included individuals who had a dual diagnosis (co-occurring sud and mental disorder), and who were high users of acute care services. conclusions: this study highlights the heterogeneity of individuals with problematic substance use treated in an arc treatment will be more effective, overall, if tailored to the varying needs of individuals with problematic substance use. recommendations of the study geared toward improving the effectiveness of care for this population include systematic diagnostic screening for suds by physicians, developing strong primary care for individuals with problematic substance use, and ensuring a continuing care model for individuals with a dual diagnosis.

antisocial_personality_disorder	a common criticism of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (american psychiatric association, 2013) is that its criteria are based more on behavioral descriptions than on underlying biological mechanisms. increasingly, calls have intensified for a more biologically-based approach to conceptualizing, studying, and treating psychological disorders, as exemplified by the research domain criteria project (rdoc). among the most well-studied neurobiological mechanisms is reward processing. moreover, individual differences in reward sensitivity are related to risk for substance abuse and depression. the current review synthesizes the available preclinical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging literature on reward processing from a transdiagnostic, multidimensional perspective. findings are organized with respect to key reward constructs within the positive valence systems domain of the rdoc matrix, including initial responsiveness to reward (physiological 'liking), approach motivation (physiological 'wanting'), and reward learning/habit formation. in the current review, we (a) describe the neural basis of reward, (b) elucidate differences in reward activity in substance abuse and depression, and (c) suggest a framework for integrating these disparate literatures and discuss the utility of shifting focus from diagnosis to process for understanding liability and co-morbidity. ultimately, we believe that an integrative focus on abnormal reward functioning across the full continuum of clinically heterogeneous samples, rather than within circumscribed diagnostic categories, might actually help to refine the phenotypes and improve the prediction of onset and recovery of these disorders.

prejudice	cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) is a life-saving medical practice with particular characteristics. on time initiation of cpr can increase survival in cases of sudden cardiac arrest. the main component of cpr is the application of external chest compressions. unfortunately, bystander cpr rates have remained low over the past decade. the unwillingness has been attributed to various causes among which complications are discussed in this paper. complications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation often occur even if the doctor is skilled and acts according to the guidelines. the iatrogenic manipulations of cpr contain a significant violation risk for both the patient and the physician. the scope of this paper is to review the main complications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the discussion of the points that characterize the ethico-legal approach of these complications. the ultimate objective is the prejudice of negative ""defensive medicine"" so that all doctors will not avoid the application of cpr, fearing malpractice litigation.
media_violence	the parents raising safe kids program (prsk) is a research-based manualized violence prevention curriculum designed to decrease coercive parenting behavior, encourage positive discipline, increase media violence literacy, and increase child development knowledge. this study is a multi-site pre-post comparison evaluation of prsk 's effectiveness with diverse parents, including those who are incarcerated, in drug treatment and both english and spanish speaking. results indicate that prsk was successful at improving media violence literacy, positive parenting behavior, child development knowledge, anger management, and prosocial problem solving. additionally, prsk was especially efficacious for spanish speaking participants, who improved more than english speakers. due to the need for appropriate and cost-effective programs for underrepresented groups, these results add to the growing evidence base supporting the use of prsk with diverse parents. prsk is effective in educating caregivers about nonviolent parenting behavior and child development. it is flexible, focuses on parents of very young children, and is cost effective. the program costs a fraction of other evidence-based practices yet statistical effect sizes for change over time are comparable.

social_cognition	background: evidence in the literature suggests that there is an impairment of social cognition in schizophrenia. theory of mind (tom) is defined as one 's ability to understand others' wishes, beliefs, intentions, and other psychological states and thereby to judge others' behavior, as an essential component of social cognition. however, there have been limited studies on social cognition, especially tom in adolescent onset schizophrenia (aos). the current study aims to investigate tom abilities in adolescent schizophrenia according to various tom subcomponents (cognitive tom and affective tom) and various tom orders (first order and second order). methods: this study examines tom in 35 adolescent schizophrenic patients and 35 healthy adolescents using the ""yoni task"" and ""faux pas recognition test"" to assess their affective and cognitive tom abilities. results: in the yoni task, patients with aos showed differences in tom abilities either on a different order or under different conditions. the faux pas recognition task results revealed that aos patients were not always able to recognize a faux pas or understand complicated emotions under the faux pas scenario. furthermore, as indicated by the correlation analysis, neither cognitive tom nor affective tom was related to the patients' symptoms, disease duration, dose of medication, or intelligence quotient (iq). conclusion: our findings showed aos impairment in the performance of tom tasks. it seemed that impairment in second-order-tom is more serious. moreover, these deficits are largely independent of symptom clusters, disease duration, dose of medication, and iq. it can be speculated that tom dysfunction may be a hallmark of adolescent schizophrenia.
prosocial_behavior	callous-unemotional (cu) traits designate an important subgroup of antisocial individuals at risk for early-starting, severe, and persistent conduct problems, but this construct has received limited attention among young children. the current study evaluated the factor structure, psychometric properties, and validity of scores on a comprehensive measure of cu traits, the inventory of callous-unemotional traits (icu), in relation to measures of antisocial/prosocial behavior and emotional processing, administered to preschool children. the sample included 214 boys (52 %) and girls (48 %, m age = 4.7, sd = 0.69) recruited from mainstream and high-risk preschools. confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor structure including callous and uncaring dimensions from 12 of the 24 original icu items. scores on the parent- and teacher-reported icu were internally consistent and combined cu scores showed expected associations with an alternate measure of cu traits and measures of empathy, prosocial behavior, conduct problems, and aggression. preschool children high on cu traits were less accurate, relative to children scoring low, in recognizing facial expressions. they were also less attentionally engaged by images of others in distress when co-occurring conduct problems presented. findings extend the literature by supporting the psychometric properties of the icu among young children, and open several avenues for studying early precursors to this severe personality disturbance.
eating_disorders	objective: although cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) represents the first-line evidence-based psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa (bn), most individuals seeking treatment do not have access to this specialized intervention. we compared an internet-based manualized version of cbt group therapy for bn conducted via a therapeutic chat group (cbt4bn) to the same treatment conducted via a traditional face-to-face group therapy (cbtf2f). method: in a two-site, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial, we tested the hypothesis that cbt4bn would not be inferior to cbtf2f. a total of 179 adult patients with bn (2.6% males) received up to 16 sessions of group cbt over 20 weeks in either cbt4bn or cbtf2f, and outcomes were compared at the end of treatment and at the 12-month follow-up. results: at the end of treatment, cbt4bn was inferior to cbtf2f in producing abstinence from binge eating and purging. however, by the 12-month follow-up, cbt4bn was mostly not inferior to cbtf2f. participants in the cbt4bn condition, but not cbtf2f, continued to reduce their binge-eating and purging frequency from the end of treatment to the 12-month follow-up. conclusions: cbt delivered online in a group chat format appears to be an efficacious treatment for bn, although the trajectory of recovery may be slower than face-to-face group therapy. online chat groups may increase accessibility of treatment and represent a cost-effective approach to service delivery. however, barriers in service delivery such as state-specific license and ethical guidelines for online therapists need to be addressed.

schizophrenia	background: caregiving in schizophrenia is a demanding and exhausting activity that challenges the physical and emotional resources of family caregivers. in traditional societies such as india, this is further compounded by illiteracy, ignorance and religious and cultural explanations attributed to mental illness.aims: this study aimed to assess primary caregivers of persons with schizophrenia in terms of their perceived burden, manifestation of psychological distress and quality of life (qol).methods: the study used a quantitative cross-sectional design and survey methodology to collect data from caregivers in a hospital setting in thanjavur, india. standardized instruments were used to collect data from patients and their caregivers.results: high perceived burden and lower qol were seen in the majority of caregivers. they also manifested high levels of anxiety and depression. patient characteristics such as age, gender, symptoms and duration of illness did not influence the perceived burden of caregivers, while positive and negative symptoms and the duration of illness were correlated with their qol.conclusions: findings indicate the need for intervention for family caregivers to enable them cope more effectively with the demands of caregiving. psychoeducation and participation in peer support groups are advocated as low resource and effective outcome strategies for caregivers in india.
prejudice	people living with hiv/aids (phas) are increasingly recognized as experts in hiv and their own health. we developed a simulated clinical encounter (sce) in which medical students provided hiv pre-and post-test counselling and point-of-care hiv testing for phas as patient instructors (pha-pis) under clinical preceptor supervision. the study assessed the acceptability of this teaching tool with a focus on assessing impact on hiv-related stigma among medical students. university of toronto pre-clerkship medical students participated in a series of sces facilitated by 16 pha-pis and 22 clinical preceptors. pre-and post-sce students completed the validated health care provider hiv/aids stigma scale (hpass). hpass measures overall stigma, as well as three domains within hiv stigma: stereotyping, discrimination, and prejudice. higher scores represented higher levels of stigma. an additional questionnaire measured comfort in providing hiv-related care. mean scores and results of paired t-tests are presented. post-sce, students (n = 62) demonstrated decreased overall stigma (68.74 vs. 61.81, p < .001) as well as decreased stigma within each domain. post-sce, students (n = 67) reported increased comfort in providing hivrelated care (10.24 vs. 18.06, p < .001). involving pha-pis reduced hiv-related stigma among medical students and increased comfort in providing hiv-related care.
child_abuse	the last 20 years have seen an explosion in the availability, ownership and use of devices used to access the internet. there has been a simultaneous increase in the number of people viewing child abuse images. the ease of access to this material online has removed a key inhibitor for offenders. technology has facilitated the distribution of child abuse images, but is also used to prevent and identify offending, as well as to manage offenders. there is a range of technological tools currently used in england and wales to manage those offenders who have been convicted of accessing child abuse images and who are living in the community. some are specific to the computer as the situation of the crime. this article analyses the evidence base for each. the article concludes that each tool has features which might contribute to the management of internet child sex offenders, but that none have yet been proven or disproven to be effective. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd. key practitioner messages: technology to help manage the risk posed by internet child sex offenders is developing and may offer promise. none of these technological tools have been proven or disproven to be effective management tools for internet child sex offenders. offender managers in the police and probation services should be mindful of this and not be overly reliant on them. robust evaluations of these types of technology for these offenders are needed.
child_abuse	in the united states, the judicial system response to violence between intimate partners, or intimate partner violence (ipv), typically mandates that adjudicated perpetrators complete a batterer intervention program (bip). the social science data has found that these programs, on the whole, are only minimally effective in reducing rates of ipv. the authors examined the social science literature on the characteristics and efficacy of bips. more than 400 studies were considered, including a sweeping, recently conducted survey of bip directors across the united states and canada. results of this review indicate that the limitations of bips are due, in large part, to the limitations of current state standards regulating these programs and, furthermore, that these standards are not grounded in the body of empirical research evidence or best practices. the authors, all of whom have considerable expertise in the area of domestic violence perpetrator treatment, conducted an exhaustive investigation of the following key intervention areas: overall effectiveness of bips; length of treatment/length of group sessions; number of group participants and number of facilitators; group format and curriculum; assessment protocol and instruments; victim contact; modality of treatment; differential treatment; working with female perpetrators; working with perpetrators in racial and ethnic minority groups; working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) perpetrators; perpetrator treatment and practitioner-client relationships; and required practitioner education and training. recommendations for evidence-based national bip standards were made based on findings from this review.
person_perception	although robots are becoming an ever-growing presence in society, we do not hold the same expectations for robots as we do for humans, nor do we treat them the same. as such, the ability to recognize cues to human animacy is fundamental for guiding social interactions. we review literature that demonstrates cortical networks associated with person perception, action observation and mentalizing are sensitive to human animacy information. in addition, we show that most prior research has explored stimulus properties of artificial agents (humanness of appearance or motion), with less investigation into knowledge cues (whether an agent is believed to have human or artificial origins). therefore, currently little is known about the relationship between stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy in terms of cognitive and brain mechanisms. using fmri, an elaborate belief manipulation, and human and robot avatars, we found that knowledge cues to human animacy modulate engagement of person perception and mentalizing networks, while stimulus cues to human animacy had less impact on social brain networks. these findings demonstrate that self-other similarities are not only grounded in physical features but are also shaped by prior knowledge. more broadly, as artificial agents fulfil increasingly social roles, a challenge for roboticists will be to manage the impact of pre-conceived beliefs while optimizing human-like design.
leadership	transformational leadership is a trending style and competency that has been embraced by many industries and nursing practice settings. similar positive influence on follower engagement, teamwork, and solidarity might be experienced if transformational leadership is employed by administration and faculty as a guiding framework for nursing education. the impact of embedding a teamwork culture in basic nursing education could be significant on students and ultimately on the nursing profession. further research is needed to develop and test application of the transformational leadership framework in nursing education.
child_abuse	removing a child from parental care is an important and difficult decision to make. there are far reaching consequences for the child and family. whilst there is a plethora of literature in relation to child protection practice generally, research on decision making is minimal. in this practice paper, i present 12 decision-making criteria to assist practitioners make decisions about child removal. it is important for child protection practitioners to apply the same set of principles and consider the same factors when making these decisions. these criteria are as follows: the severity of the abusive incident; the presence of cumulative harm; whether the perpetrator has access to the child; the functioning of the parent; whether the perpetrator has been responsible for child abuse or intimate partner violence in the past; the cooperation of the parent; the intent of the perpetrator; the age of the child; the functioning of the child; the voice and expressed wishes of the child; protective relationships available to the child and the statutory requirement to cause no further harm. referring to these criteria will assist practitioners be clear and explicit about how they reach a decision, and result in greater consistency of outcome for children and families.
eating_disorders	this is the first systematic review to synthesize the evidence concerning early postoperative variables predictive of later weight and psychosocial outcomes in bariatric surgery. eight electronic databases for empirical studies were searched ( 1954 to 2016). most of the 39 included studies reported solely on weight outcomes; eating and psychosocial outcomes were less common. a better early weight loss trajectory was the most consistent predictor of more successful medium-term weight outcome (<= 24 months); however, its relationship to longer term weight loss maintenance is less certain. early eating adaptation may be associated with later weight loss, but further research is needed. evidence is lacking for associations between early adherence or early psychosocial variables and later outcome. in particular, the relationship between early post-operative depression and later weight remains unclear. little research has considered early prediction of later eating or psychosocial outcomes. consideration of mediating or moderating relationships is lacking. the body of evidence is limited, and synthesis is hampered by heterogeneity in the type and time at which predictors and outcomes are measured and quality of statistical reporting. further research on prospective prediction of bariatric surgery outcome is needed to guide early post-operative intervention for those at greatest risk of poor outcomes.
prejudice	in the present times, the discrimination experiences of various marginalized groups tend to be characterized by subtle acts of disrespect and intolerance in addition to the traditional and more blatant incidents of violence. one such newer manifestation is microaggression. this research explored the impact of frequency of experiencing invisibility (i.e., feeling ignored or overlooked owing to one 's group membership) on distress among northeasterners residing in delhi. further, the role of individual self stereotyping as a moderator in the invisibility frequency-distress relationship was investigated. moderation analysis suggested a significant moderating effect of individual self-stereotyping in the relationship between frequency of experiencing invisibility acts and the distress experienced by northeasterners. in other words, experiencing invisibility caused distress for participants who saw themselves as prototypical of the northeasterners. interestingly, frequency of experiencing invisibility was associated with distress for all northeasterners, however the size of this relationship was greater for northeasterners who saw themselves as typical of their group.
prejudice	people with epilepsy are prone to be sedentary compared with the general population. the causes of inactivity are ignorance, prejudice, overprotection, fear and shame. there is no scientific evidence supporting a limitation of physical exercise in persons with epilepsy. the benefits of exercise in these patients are huge. positive aspects are: physical conditioning, prevention of seizures, emotional wellbeing, social interaction, drug treatment adherence, osteoporosis prevention and better quality of life for patients and their families. having in mind the individual characteristics, physical exercise should be prescribed and guided. available evidence underlies the complementary therapeutic effects of physical activity with large positive results at a low cost. sports or regular physical activity should be a standard indication for persons with epilepsy.
nonverbal_communication	non-verbal communication incorporating visual, audio, and contextual information is important to make sense of and navigate the social world. individuals who have trouble with social situations often have difficulty recognizing these sorts of non-verbal social signals. in this article, we propose a training tool nocoa+ (non-verbal communiation for autism plus) that uses utterances in visual and audio modalities in nonverbal communication training. we describe the design of nocoa+, and further perform an experimental evaluation in which we examine its potential as a tool for computer-based training of non-verbal communication skills for people with social and communication difficulties. in a series of four experiments, we investigated 1) the effect of temporal context on the ability to recognize social signals in testing context, 2) the effect of modality of presentation of social stimulus on ability to recognize non-verbal information, 3) the correlation between autistic traits as measured by the autism spectrum quotient (aq) and non-verbal behavior recognition skills measured by nocoa+, 4) the effectiveness of computer-based training in improving social skills. we found that context information was helpful for recognizing non-verbal behaviors, and the effect of modality was different. the results also showed a significant relationship between the aq communication and socialization scores and non-verbal communication skills, and that social skills were significantly improved through computer-based training.
attention	the separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures is significant in chemical industry. pervaporation has attracted increasing attention due to its low energy consumption and environmentally friendly process. however, the formation of membranes mostly use toxic organic solvents, whereas in this study water was used instead to prepare membrane in separating aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. w3000 were dispersed in water to form micelles, which were then deposited onto the surface of the tubular porous ceramic substrate through the negative pressure-driven assembly method. the emulsion and composite membranes were characterized by tem, sem and ftir. the crosslinking density of w3000 was also tested using nmr xld analyzing system. the membranes were used for separating aromatic/aliphatic mixtures through pervaporation. the results showed that compared with the membrane prepared by dmf, the pervaporation separation index (psi) of the composite membrane formed using water as solvent was 3.3-fold increased for separating toluene/n-heptane mixtures. the as-prepared composite membranes showed a better comprehensive pervaporation performance. this facile strategy may have a potential in the application of pervaporation for separating aromatic/aliphatic mixtures in industry.

person_perception	person perception is a dynamic, evolving process. because other people are an endless source of social information, people need to update their impressions of others based upon new information. we devised an fmri study to identify brain regions involved in updating impressions. participants saw faces paired with valenced behavioral information and were asked to form impressions of these individuals. each face was seen five times in a row, each time with a different behavioral description. critically, for half of the faces the behaviors were evaluatively consistent, while for the other half they were inconsistent. in line with prior work, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmpfc) was associated with forming impressions of individuals based on behavioral information. more importantly, a whole-brain analysis revealed a network of other regions associated with updating impressions of individuals who exhibited evaluatively inconsistent behaviors, including rostrolateral pfc, superior temporal sulcus, right inferior parietal lobule and posterior cingulate cortex.
leadership	care coordination programmes are an important aspect of hiv management whose success depends largely on hiv primary care provider (pcp) and case manager collaboration. factors influencing collaboration among hiv pcps and case managers remain to be studied. the study objective was to test an existing theoretical model of interprofessional collaborative practice and determine which factors play the most important role in facilitating collaboration. a self-administered, anonymous mail survey was sent to hiv pcps and case managers in new york city. an adapted survey instrument elicited information on demographic, contextual, and perceived social exchange (trustworthiness, role specification, and relationship initiation) characteristics. the dependent variable, perceived interprofessional practice, was constructed from a validated scale. a sequential block wise regression model specifying variable entry order examined the relative importance of each group of factors and of individual variables. the analysis showed that social exchange factors were the dominant drivers of collaboration. relationship initiation was the most important predictor of interprofessional collaboration. additional influential factors included organisational leadership support of collaboration, practice settings, and frequency of interprofessional meetings. addressing factors influencing collaboration among providers will help public health programmes optimally design their structural, hiring, and training strategies to foster effective social exchanges and promote collaborative working relationships.
prenatal_development	six abomasums of yaks (bos grunniens) were studied with gross dissection and histological methods. it was found that the mucosa of the yak abomasum was covered with simple columnar epithelium. there were lots of spiral folds (>= 10) in the fundic glandular area. the developed membrane of lamina propria was occupied by high density glands. according to the morphological characteristics of the glands, the abomasum was divided into the cardiac, gastric and pyloric glands. cardiac glands were curved tubular glands with the intumescent bottom and small glandular cavity. fundic glands were simple tubular glands or branched tubular glands, where the chief, parietal and mucous neck cells can be observed clearly. pyloric glands were curled tubular glands, the closer to the deep of the lamina propria, the more obvious the glands curl. staining of glycoconjugate revealed that the mucosal epithelium of the cardiac gastric and pyloric glands and gastric pits epithelium mainly secreted neutral glycoconjugate, but other portions of cardiac and gastric glands secreted mixed and acid glycoconjugate respectively. by gordon-sweet 's reticular fiber staining, it was found that the mucous neck cells possessed the characteristic of argyrophilic phenomenon. there was a large number of argyrophilic granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm in contrast with the chief cells. furthermore, there were isolated lymphoid nodules and diffuse lymphoid tissue in the abomasum glands, especially in corpus abomasi. grimelius silver staining showed that the argyrophil cells were located in the glandular epithelium and lamina propria of glands, which can also be observed in connective tissue. these endocrine cells dispersed individually in epithelial cells, occasionally in 3-5 cell groups. therefore, the yaks were grazed throughout the year on diverse natural grassland and had evolved morphological characteristics of the abomasum enabling them to consume a wide variety of plant species, thereby better adapting them to harsh plateau environment.
prejudice	the fair exchange of resources provides a basis for developing morality, yet research has rarely examined the role of group processes that are central to children 's world. in this article, we describe a new perspective as well as research demonstrating that group processes play a key role in the fair allocation of resources among children and adolescents. we contend that when children allocate resources, group processes and moral judgments are relevant, a developmental shift occurs in children 's ability to coordinate moral and group concerns, and group processes contribute to intergroup bias regarding allocations but also to efforts to consider the status of disadvantaged groups. our perspective informs efforts to reduce prejudice as well as increase fairness and equality in situations in which group processes are relevant for allocating resources fairly.
borderline_personality_disorder	focused attention meditations have been shown to improve psychological health and wellbeing and are nowadays an integral part of many psychotherapies. while research on the neural correlates of focused attention meditation is increasing, findings vary on whether meditations are associated with high or low activity in the default mode network (dmn). to clarify the relationship between focused attention meditation and the activity in dmn regions, it may be helpful to distinguish internal and external attention as well as different phases within one meditation: during focused attention meditation, the practitioner switches between mindful attention, mind-wandering and refocusing. here, we employed a thought-probe paradigm to study the neural correlates of these different phases. twenty healthy, meditation naive participants were introduced to external (mindfulness of sound) and internal (mindfulness of breathing) attention meditation and then practiced the meditation at home for four consecutive days. they then performed the same focused attention meditations during fmri scanning, in four runs alternating between internal and external attention. at pseudorandom intervals, participants were asked whether they had just been focused on the task (mindful attention) or had been distracted (mind-wandering). during mindful attention, brain regions typically associated with the dmn, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and left temporoparietal junction showed significantly less neural activation compared to mind-wandering phases. reduced activity of the dmn was found during both external and internal attention, with stronger deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex during internal attention compared to external attention. moreover, refocusing after mind -wandering was associated with activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus. our results support the theory that mindful attention is associated with reduced dmn activity compared to mind-wandering, independent of the practitioner 's attention focus (i.e., internal vs. external).
problem-solving	undergraduate stem instruction increasingly uses educational technologies to support problem-solving activities. educational technologies offer two key features that may make them particularly effective. first, most problem-solving activities involve multiple visual representations, and many students have difficulties in understanding, constructing, and connecting these representations. educational technologies can provide adaptive support that helps students make sense of visual representations. second, many problems with visual representations involve collaboration. however, students often do not collaborate effectively. educational technologies can provide collaboration scripts that adaptively react to student actions to prompt them to engage in specific effective collaborative behaviors. these observations lead to the hypothesis we tested: that an adaptive collaboration script enhances students' learning of content knowledge from visual representations. we conducted a quasi-experiment with 61 undergraduate students in an introductory chemistry course. a control condition worked on a traditional worksheet that asked students to collaboratively make sense of connections among multiple visual representations. an experimental condition worked on the same problems embedded in an educational technology that provided an adaptive collaboration script. the experimental condition showed significantly higher learning gains on a transfer test immediately after the intervention and on complex concepts on a midterm exam three weeks later.

person_perception	introduction: individuals rate opposite sex faces as more attractive after consuming or being primed with alcohol. however, other traits such as intelligence and likeability have not been examined and might vary as a function of information about one 's drinking habits. we expected social drinkers to be rated more positively than heavy drinkers, abstainers, or recovering alcoholics. we further hypothesized that faces with similar drinking habits to participants would be rated as more appealing. methods: five hundred ninety-four undergraduates viewed 25 opposite sex faces randomly paired with drinking information, and rated each face on perceived appeal. results: hierarchical linear models revealed that social drinkers were rated as most appealing, as expected. unexpectedly, recovering alcoholics were rated as the next most appealing, followed by abstainers, then heavy drinkers. the interaction between drinker type and participants' own drinking predicting ratings indicated that the heavier the participant drinks, the more favorably they rated heavy drinkers compared to other types of drinkers. thus, as expected, ratings varied as a function of participants' own drinking; however, ratings did not vary as a function of participants' alcohol-related problems. conclusions: findings support hypotheses in that social drinkers were generally perceived as appealing compared to other drinker types, and ratings tended to be influenced by participants' own drinking. individuals' prototypes and norms regarding drinking may influence how they perceive others when others' drinking habits are known. this might be especially important to consider with heavy drinkers who may seek out others who drink similarly, which could reinforce problematic drinking. published by elsevier ltd.
media_violence	the internet movie database (www.imdb.com) is the largest and most successful website for movie information, yet crowdsourced contents of sites like these have rarely been studied. therefore, using imdb synopsis texts, reviewers' movie descriptions were analyzed regarding movie contents that have been the subject of many previous media studies: the violent behavior and victimization of male and female film characters over time. analysis of 1,396 synopsis texts reveals that both perpetrators and victims are mainly male (both 80%) and, against expectation, violence becomes less severe and more often nonlethal over the years. for the first time, our study using imdb texts identifies male and female stereotypes and suggests that viewers' descriptions of what they have seen could match the findings of traditional content analyses and actual crime figures.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the current study tested the hypothesis that substance abuse has features of both an internalizing and externalizing disorder. a confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) of data from 1,177 adjudicated delinquents supported a three-factor model (negative emotionality, fearlessness, and disinhibition) over alternate one- and two- (internalizing and externalizing) factor models; a second cfa indicated that self-reported offending and substance abuse formed separate dimensions rather than a single dimension. correlating several temperament/personality indicators with measures of substance misuse and offending revealed that substance misuse was significantly more aligned with the internalizing dimension (i.e., negative emotionality) and significantly less aligned with the fearlessness externalizing dimension.
prejudice	australian undergraduate programs are implementing curriculum aimed at better preparing graduates to work in culturally diverse settings, but there remains uncertainty over the role of extant student attitudes towards indigenous australians. to begin to address this, we obtained baseline data on student attitudes upon entry to tertiary education. 1175 health science first-year students (275 males, 897 females) completed an anonymous in-class paper questionnaire. on average, students reported positive attitudes towards indigenous australians, with female students reporting more positive attitudes than male and domestic students more positive than international. hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that after controlling for demographic variables, interactional diversity experiences and attitudes accounted for significant variance in a range of measures of preparedness to work in indigenous health contexts. the knowledge gained will inform the development of, and alignment between, curriculum and pedagogical approaches, leading to an improved facilitation model for educators in the indigenous studies context.
borderline_personality_disorder	a number of studies have evaluated the possibility of bias in the diagnostic criteria in borderline personality disorder as an explanation of gender differences in prevalence. previous studies have used both regression and latent trait approaches but the results have been inconsistent. the current study extended prior investigations in testing differential function of borderline diagnostic criteria using both regression and latent-trait methods in the same sample, examining both diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.; dsm-iv) and dsm-5 alternative model criteria for borderline personality. data were obtained from a national sample of 337 clinicians providing diagnostic information on 1 of their target patients. chronic feelings of emptiness was the only criterion that demonstrated consistent evidence of potential differential functioning across methods and diagnostic models. implications of these results for the conceptualization of borderline personality are discussed.
prosocial_behavior	although the vast majority of existing work on empathy focuses exclusively on the socio-emotional consequences of empathizing with others' negative emotions, mounting evidence supports the view that empathy for others' negative emotions and empathy for others' positive emotions are distinct capacities. the present work seeks to marry this burgeoning literature on the separability of positive and negative empathy to the influential literature on approach and avoidance motivation by examining how these two distinct empathic capacities relate to the (pro)social motivations to assist others to approach positivity vs. avoid negativity. the results of two studies show that whereas positive empathy is associated with an other-focused motivation to assist others to approach positive outcomes and is predictive of helping only when that help is framed as a means of propelling others toward greater positivity, negative empathy is associated with an other-focused motivation to assist others to avoid negative outcomes and is associated with helping only when that help is framed as a means of assisting others to avoid further suffering. in addition to contributing to the emerging literature on the separability of positive and negative empathy, these results also help to extend the influential approach/avoidance distinction to the domain of other-focused motivation.

social_cognition	schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder in which psychiatric symptoms are classified into two general subgroups positive and negative symptoms. current antipsychotic drugs are effective for treating positive symptoms, whereas negative symptoms are less responsive. since the neuropeptide oxytocin (ot) has been shown to mediate social behavior in animals and humans, it has been used as an experimental therapeutic for treating schizophrenia and in particular negative symptoms which includes social deficits. through eight randomized controlled trials (rcts) and three meta-analyses, evidence for an effect of intranasal ot (in-ot) has been inconsistent. we therefore conducted an updated meta-analysis that offers several advantages when compared to those done previously: (1) we used a multivariate analysis which allows for comparisons between symptoms and accounts for correlations between symptoms; (2) we controlled for baseline scores; (3) we used a fully bayesian framework that allows for assessment of evidence in favor of the null hypothesis using bayes factors; and (4) we addressed inconsistencies in the primary studies and previous meta-analyses. eight rcts (n = 238) were included in the present study and we found that oxytocin did not improve any aspect of symptomology in schizophrenic patients and there was moderate evidence in favor of the null (no effect of oxytocin) for negative symptoms. multivariate comparisons between symptom types revealed that oxytocin was not especially beneficial for treating negative symptoms. the effect size estimates were not moderated, publication bias was absent, and our estimates were robust to sensitivity analyses. these results suggest that in-ot is not an effective therapeutic for schizophrenia.

antisocial_personality_disorder	empathy may be defined as the ability to share and/or understand others' emotional state. it is a multi-faceted construct that relies on discrete psychological processes with specific neural correlates. these psychological processes might be impaired in some mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, borderline personality disorder or mood disorders. among these disorders, psychopathy is mainly characterized by a lack of empathy for others' distress associated with amygdala hypo-reactivity. in the context of doctor-patient relationships, clinical empathy also encompasses the physician 's ability to communicate his or her understanding of the emotional state of the patient. however, sharing the emotional states may elicit compassion fatigue and burnout symptoms among physicians and medical students and reduce their empathic capacities. a decline of these capacities is indeed observed during medical training. perspective-taking may protect physicians from such negative effects while allowing them to show sustained empathic concern. interventions to promote empathy among medical students should target both communication skills and humanist values: communication skill may depend on humanist values to grow.

prenatal_development	prenatal development of the epididymis was studied in bovine fetuses ranging from 10 to 90 cm crown-rump length (crl) (75-285 pcd). the studies aimed to apply both glycohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry for the detection of the differentiation of the developing prenatal epididymis. both conventional histological and histochemical techniques were applied on paraffin sections of the epididymis from different fetal stages. establishment of the urogenital junction between the extra-testicular rete testis and the mesonephric duct, via the growing efferent ductules (ductuli efferentes) was first evident in fetuses with 10 cm crl. at the fetal age of 110 pcd (24 cm crl), the mesonephric duct began to lengthen and coil forming three distinct regions (caput, corpus and cauda). in addition to the macroscopical modifications in the extra-testicular excurrent duct system, histological differentiation involved both the tubular epithelial and the peritubular mesenchymal cells. the epithelium lining the efferent ductules was differentiated into ciliated and non-ciliated columnar cells. the simple epithelium of the epididymal duct increased in height and developed stereocilia on the apical surface. additionally, some basal cells first appeared at 185 pcd (56 cm crl), within the epithelium lining the cauda only. lectin histochemistry (wga, pna, gsa-i) showed early immunostaining in epithelium of the efferent ductules and in peritubular mesenchymal structures. immunoreactivity for different proteins (s-100, fibroblast growth factor-1 and factor-2, angiotensin converting enzyme, laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin) was evident, both in the epithelial and in the peritubular mesenchymal cells as early as at 75 pcd. on the basis of our histochemical observations, we conclude that both glycohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry are useful tools to demonstrate that the differentiation in the peritubular structures and efferent ductular epithelium begins earlier than other components.

child_abuse	forensic clinical anatomy is a new practical application of the discipline of clinical anatomy for ascertaining and evaluating medicolegal questions. in particular, individual anatomy (normal anatomy, anatomical variations, age-, disease-, or surgery-related modifications) can acquire significant relevance in various fields of legal medicine such as child abuse, sudden death, medical responsibility and/or liability, personal injury and damage. anatomical data of forensic interest frequently arise from the correct application of methods of ascertainment; anatomical methods may then be required for further comprehensive analysis. the rigorous interpretation of anatomical data, derived from the ascertainment phase and analyzed on the basis of pertinent literature, can be pivotal for the correct application of evaluation criteria in various forensic contexts. clin. anat. 30:2-5, 2017.

antisocial_personality_disorder	the stabilization of human cognition via feedback from embedding social and cultural contexts is a dynamic process deeply intertwined with it, constituting, in a sense, the riverbanks directing the flow of a stream of generalized consciousness at different scales: cultural norms and social interaction are synergistic with individual and group cognition and their disorders. a canonical failure mode in atomistic cultures is found to be a 'ground state' collapse well represented by atomistic models of economic interaction that are increasingly characterized as divorced from reality by heterodox economists. that is, high rates of psychopathic and antisocial personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder emerge as culture-bound syndromes particular to western or westernizing societies, or to those undergoing social disintegration.
leadership	objective: to investigate what key stakeholders consider to be the advantages and the opportunities for improvement in using lean thinking and tools in the integrated project delivery (ipd) process. method: a detailed literature review was followed by case study of a lean-ipd project. interviews with members of the project leadership team, focus groups with the integrated team as well as the design team, and an online survey of all stakeholders were conducted. analysis: statistical analysis and thematic content analysis were used to analyze the data, followed by a plus-delta analysis. results: (1) learning is a large, implicit benefit of lean-ipd that is not currently captured by any success metric; (2) the cardboard mock-up was the most successful lean strategy; (3) although a collaborative project, the level of influence of different stakeholder groups was perceived to be different by different stakeholders; (4) overall, lean-ipd was rated as better than traditional design-bid-build methods; and (5) opportunities for improvement reported were increase in accurate cost estimating, more efficient use of time, perception of imbalance of control/influence, and need for facilitation (which represents different points of view). conclusion: while lean tools and an ipd method are preferred to traditional design-bid-build methods, the perception of different stakeholders varies and more work needs to be done to allow a truly shared decision-making model. learning was identified as one of the biggest advantages.
eating_disorders	aim. anorexia nervosa was long considered as a culture-bound syndrome of western countries. however, studies have found anorexics in other cultures, for instance in china. the prevalence and incidence of anorexia in china seem lower than in the west, but on the increase, which suggests an influence of cultural factors. anorexia could thus be a culture-change syndrome arising during fast sociocultural changes on individual scale, on the occasion of a migration, or on societal scale. transcultural psychiatrists consider that acculturation and culture clash (conflict between different cultural models) are risk factors for developing eating disorders. further to this, knowledge of male anorexia nervosa is limited, and there are few studies on this pathology in a transcultural setting. method. from a clinical illustration of male anorexia in china, our purpose is to show the impact of cultural and transcultural factors on the emergence, the psychopathology, the symptomatology and the care of male anorexia in a society experiencing rapid change. results. zang presented atypical symptoms: absence of denial of weight-loss, transitory fat phobia, and atypical food restrictions. he also presented symptoms that are found in descriptions of cases in western countries, such as perfectionism, obsessional disorders and autonomy difficulties. the development of zang 's anorexia seemed linked to a culture clash and an acculturation process. discussion. the absence of any denial of weight-loss by zang and his transitory fat phobia could be explained by the traditional non-valuation of thinness in china. abdominal pains could be an accepted idiom for distress in china for patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and might reflect social disharmony. with zang, the culture clash shows itself in his desire on one hand to decide for himself on his own future and on the other hand his filial duty. acculturation could explain the development of pathological eating behaviours via a valuation of dieting attitudes and the adoption of an ideal of thinness. concerning the therapeutic approach, family therapy adapted to the chinese setting seemed appropriate for this patient, mainly to redefine his own way of being a good son. conclusion. this clinical case questions the use of western diagnostic criteria, the meaning of symptoms, and the relevant therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from anorexia outside western countries. the transcultural approach enables a reconceptualization and an enrichment of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to male anorexia.

prenatal_development	in mammalian cerebrum there exist two distinct types of interneurons expressing nitric oxide synthase (nos). type i neurons are large in size and exhibit heavy nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (nadph-d) histochemical reaction, while type ii cells are small with light nadph-d reactivity. the time of origin of these cortical neurons relative to corticogenesis remains largely unclear among mammals. here we explored this issue in guinea pigs using cell birth dating and double labeling methods. bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) pulse-chasing (2 doses at 50 mg/kg, 12 h apart) was given to time-pregnant mothers, followed by quantification of nadph-d/brdu colocalization in the parietal and temporal neocortex in offspring at postnatal day 0 (po), p30 and p60. type i neurons were partially colabeled with brdu at po, p30 and p60 following pulsechasing at embryonic day 21 (e21), e28 and e35, varied from 2-11.3% of total population of these neurons for the three time groups. type ii neurons were partially colabeled for brdu following pulse-chasing at e21, e28, e35 and e42 at po (8.6%-16.5% of total population for individual time groups). at p60, type ii neurons were found to co-express brdu (4.8-11.3% of total population for individual time groups) following pulse chasing at e21, e28, e35, e42, e49, e56 and e60/61. these results indicate that in guinea pigs type i neurons are generated during early corticogenesis, whereas type ii cells are produced over a wide prenatal time window persisting until birth. the data also suggest that type ii nitrinergic neurons may undergo a period of development/differentiation, for over 1 month, before being nadph-d reactive.
false_memories	a dynamic interplay is known to exist between auditory processing and human cognition. for example, prior investigations of speech-in-noise have revealed there is more to learning than just listening: even if all words within a spoken list are correctly heard in noise, later memory for those words is typically impoverished. these investigations supported a view that there is a ""gap"" between the intelligibility of speech and memory for that speech. here, the notion was that this gap between speech intelligibility and memorability is a function of the extent to which the spoken message seizes limited immediate memory resources (e.g., kiellberg et al., 2008). accordingly, the more difficult the processing of the spoken message, the less resources are available for elaboration, storage, and recall of that spoken material. however, it was not previously known how increasing that difficulty affected the memory processing of semantically rich spoken material. this investigation showed that noise impairs higher levels of cognitive analysis. a variant of the deese-roediger-mcdermott procedure that encourages semantic elaborative processes was deployed. on each trial, participants listened to a 36-item list comprising 12 words blocked by each of 3 different themes. each of those 12 words (e.g., bed, tired, snore...) was associated with a ""critical"" lure theme word that was not presented (e.g., sleep). word lists were either presented without noise or at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 decibels upon an a-weighting. noise reduced false recall of the critical words, and decreased the semantic clustering of recall. theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
person_perception	in keeping with the special issue theme of ""remembering the future,"" this article provides a selective review of research on how memory for social information (i.e., social category representation) influences future processing and behavior. specifically, the authors focus on how categorization and stereotyping affect how we perceive others and ourselves. the first part of the article reviews research on how individuals perceive others. the authors review research on the determinants and outcomes of social categorization and stereotype activation, concluding with the influence of ingroup/outgroup categorization on face processing. the second part of the article reviews research on how individuals perceive themselves. the authors argue that stereotype threat-concerns about being judged or behaving in ways that confirm negative group stereotypes, leading to poor performance-is the result of both self-categorization and stereotype activation. overall, the article highlights the complex relationship between memory for social category information and future social perception and behavior.

social_cognition	background: responding to joint attention (rja) is reduced in young children with asd despite being vital to the early development of social communication. for this reason, rja is a frequent target in early intervention programs. clinical guidelines suggest that exaggerating facial expressions or gestural pointing may improve rja in children with autism by clarifying the meaning of the gaze or gesture. in the current study, we investigate the effect of intensity of emotional expression on rja in preschoolers with asd. method: twenty-five preschoolers with asd and 21 typically developing peers were administered a specifically designed eye-tracking task in which an actor directs attention to a moving object by looking at it with an expression that was either neutral, mildly surprised or intensely surprised. in a supplementary condition, gestural pointing was accompanied by a neutral gaze shift. results: commensurate with previous studies, children with asd oriented less to the face of the actor and were less responsive to rja when compared to their typically developing peers. however, children with autism differed in their response to rja according to the different task conditions. they demonstrated more frequent responses to rja when the actor 's facial expression was either intense or supported by gestural pointing. conclusions: we report initial evidence for the importance of clarifying content cues in order to help preschoolers with autism adhere to receptive joint attention (rja) opportunities. our findings inform knowledge about early treatment and attention to emotional expressions in autism and improve our understanding of how early interventions may work to increase rja in young children with asd.

nonverbal_communication	sex parties are environments where men who have sex with men (msm) have the opportunity to have sex with multiple partners over a brief period of time. dim lighting and nonverbal communication are the characteristics of sex parties that make sexual communication more challenging. we report on qualitative data from 47 msm who attended sex parties in new york city. participants responded to distinct hypothetical scenarios involving the use of color-coded wristbands to communicate (1) condom use preferences, (2) sexual position (e.g., top, bottom), and (3) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) status at sex parties. the majority had positive-to-neutral attitudes toward color-coded wristbands to indicate (1) condom use preference and (2) sexual position (70.8, 75.0 % hiv positive; 63.6, 81.8 %, hiv negative, respectively). these men cited that wristbands would facilitate the process of pursuing partners with similar interests while also avoiding the discomforts of verbal communication. in contrast, 41.7 % of hiv-positive and 50.0 % of hiv-negative men expressed unfavorable attitudes to using wristbands to communicate hiv status. these men cited the potential for hiv-status discrimination as well as suspicions around dishonest disclosure. although participants were receptive to utilizing color-coded wristbands at sex parties to convey certain information, it may be unfeasible to use wristbands to communicate hiv status.
prejudice	treatment of neuropathic pain using topical formulations is still in its infancy. only few topical analgesic formulations have become available for clinical use, and among these, analgesic creams are still rare. this is unfortunate because analgesic creams offer a number of advantages over patches, such as convenience, ease of adapting the frequency of application, and dose, and ""rubbing cream where it hurts"" involves the patient much more in the therapeutic process compared to patches and other localized treatment modalities. although the literature supporting the efficacy and safety of analgesic creams (mostly compounded) is growing since the last decade, most pain physicians have not yet noticed and appreciated the therapeutic potential and clinical value of these creams. this is most probably due to a prejudice that topical application should need to act transdermally, more or less as a slow-release formulation, such as in patches delivering opioids. we will discuss this prejudice and show that there are multiple important targets in the skin to be reached by topical analgesic or anti-inflammatory compounds, and that the keratinocyte is one of those targets. by specifically targeting the keratinocyte, analgesia seems possible, effective, and safe, and thus topical analgesic creams may hold promise as a novel treatment modality for neuropathic pain.
false_memories	memory researchers long have speculated that certain tactics may lead people to recall crimes that never occurred, and thus could potentially lead to false confessions. this is the first study to provide evidence suggesting that full episodic false memories of committing crime can be generated in a controlled experimental setting. with suggestive memory-retrieval techniques, participants were induced to generate criminal and noncriminal emotional false memories, and we compared these false memories with true memories of emotional events. after three interviews, 70% of participants were classified as having false memories of committing a crime (theft, assault, or assault with a weapon) that led to police contact in early adolescence and volunteered a detailed false account. these reported false memories of crime were similar to false memories of noncriminal events and to true memory accounts, having the same kinds of complex descriptive and multisensory components. it appears that in the context of a highly suggestive interview, people can quite readily generate rich false memories of committing crime.
schizophrenia	glutamine plus glutamate (glx), as well as n-acetylaspartate compounds (naac, n-acetylaspartate plus n-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate), a marker of neuronal viability, can be quantified with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (h-1-mrs). we used h-1-mrs imaging to assess glx and naac, as well as totalcholine (glycerophospho-choline plus phospho-choline), myo-inositol and total-creatine (creatine plus phosphocreatine) from an axial supraventricular slab of gray matter (gm, medial-frontal and medial-parietal) and white matter (wm, bilateral-frontal and bilateralparietal) voxels. schizophrenia subjects (n = 104) and healthy controls (n = 97) with a broad age range (16 to 65) were studied. in schizophrenia, glx was increased in gm (p < .001) and wm (p = .01), regardless of age. however, with greater age, naac increased in gm (p < .001) but decreased in wm (p < .001) in schizophrenia. in patients, total creatine decreased with age in wm (p < .001). finally, overall cognitive score correlated positively with wm neurometabolites in controls but negatively in the schizophrenia group (naac, p < .001; and creatine [ only younger], p < .001). we speculate the results support an ongoing process of increased glutamate metabolism in schizophrenia. later in the illness, disease progression is suggested by increased cortical compaction without neuronal loss (elevated naac) and reduced axonal integrity (lower naac). furthermore, this process is associated with fundamentally altered relationships between neurometabolite concentrations and cognitive function in schizophrenia.
prosocial_behavior	in recent decades, there has been a growing attention toward using teamwork and the commitment and productivity of teams to improve the quality of education and research in higher education institutes. to achieve these goals, the leadership style of team leaders and group organizational citizenship behavior (gocb) of team members who exceed their formal roles are of high importance. this article explores the effects of shared leadership on group commitment and productivity of 70 university teams. it also investigates whether gocb mediates the effect of shared leadership on team commitment and productivity. structural equation modeling (sem) and smartpls software are applied to investigate the relationship between variables. the results show that shared leadership has both direct and indirect (through gocb) effects on team commitment and productivity. shared leadership affects gocb, team commitment, and team productivity. furthermore, gocb affects team commitment and team productivity.
media_violence	previous research has shown that media violence exposure can cause desensitization to violence, which in theory can increase aggression. however, no study to date has demonstrated this association. in the present experiment, participants played a violent or nonviolent video game, viewed violent and nonviolent photos while their brain activity was measured, and then gave an ostensible opponent unpleasant noise blasts. participants low in previous exposure to video game violence who played a violent (relative to a nonviolent) game showed a reduction in the p3 component of the event-related brain potential (erp) to violent images (indicating physiological desensitization), and this brain response mediated the effect of video game content on subsequent aggressive behavior. these data provide the first experimental evidence linking violence desensitization with increased aggression, and show that a neural marker of this process can at least partially account for the causal link between violent game exposure and aggression.

person_perception	online behavioral advertising (oba) provides internet users with potential benefit (relevant ads) and harm (privacy infringement) through personalized covert persuasion tactics, making it an interesting case for understanding perceptions of media effects. in study 1 (survey), we found that subjective persuasion knowledge of oba was positively related to third-person perception (tpp). importantly, the assessment of the potential harm and benefit of oba mediated the relationship between subjective persuasion knowledge and tpp. objective persuasion knowledge however was only indirectly related to tpp via subjective persuasion knowledge. tpp related to personal (accept, avoid oba) but not social-level (pro-regulation) coping measures. study 2 (experiment) replicated study 1 and showed that the perceived effect of oba on self (not others) drove the tpp and the responses to personal outcome measures. implications for understanding perceived media effects and response to oba are discussed.

prenatal_development	the laboratory guinea pig, cavia porcellus, shares with humans many similarities during pregnancy and prenatal development, including precocial offspring and social dependence. these similarities suggest the guinea pig as a promising model of fetal behavioral development as well. using innovative methods of behavioral acclimation, fetal offspring of female iaf hairless guinea pigs time mated to nih multicolored hartley males were observed longitudinally without restraint using noninvasive ultrasound at weekly intervals across the 10 week gestation. to ensure that the ultrasound procedure did not cause significant stress, salivary cortisol was collected both before and after each observation. measures of fetal spontaneous movement and behavioral state were quantified from video recordings from week 3 through the last week before birth. results from prenatal quantification of interlimb movement synchrony and state organization reveal guinea pig fetal development to be strikingly similar to that previously reported for other rodents and preterm human infants. salivary cortisol readings taken before and after sonography did not differ at any observation time point. these results suggest this model holds translational promise for studying the prenatal mechanisms of neurobehavioral development, including those that may result from adverse events. because the guinea pig is a highly social mammal with a wide range of socially oriented vocalizations, this model may also have utility for studying the prenatal origins and trajectories of developmental disabilities with social-emotional components, such as autism.

schizophrenia	early enriched environment (ee) prevents several deficits associated with postnatal mk-801 [n-methylo-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist] treatment such as cognitive and locomotor deficits. we sought physiological correlates to such changes by looking at inhibitory synaptic inputs onto pyramidal cells in a prefrontal cortex slice preparation. pharmacologically isolated gamma-amino-butyric acid a (gaba(a)) receptor mediated currents were measured using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. wistar rats were raised in standard or ee from birth up to the time of experiments and were injected with saline or mk-801 (1 mg/kg) on postnatal days (p) 6-10. we recorded miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mipscs) of pyramidal cells in layer of prefrontal cortex and measured their frequency, amplitude and kinetics. in control animals, the amplitude and frequency of mipscs increased strikingly during development from p21 to p28. mk-801 accelerated the development of mipscs frequency but caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of mipscs on p28 suggesting a significant reduction of inhibition onto pyramidal cells. ee per se led to a significant increase in both frequency and amplitude of mipscs, but its application to mk-801-treated rats resulted in moderate rescue of gabaergic transmission on p28. we conclude that postnatal mk-801 leads to reduced inhibitory transmission onto pyramidal cells of prefrontal cortex at adolescence which may underlie behavioural and morphological differences detected in vivo in rats. ee presentation from birth rather prevents gabaergic alterations associated with postnatal mk-801 treatment at adolescence.

depression	backgroundalthough music therapy (mt) is considered an effective intervention for young people with mental health needs, its efficacy in clinical settings is unclear. we therefore examined the efficacy of mt in clinical practice. methodstwo hundred and fifty-one child (8-16years, with social, emotional, behavioural and developmental difficulties) and parent dyads from six child and adolescent mental health service community care facilities in northern ireland were randomised to 12 weekly sessions of mt plus usual care [n=123; 76 in final analyses] or usual care alone [n=128; 105 in final analyses]. follow-up occurred at 13weeks and 26weeks postrandomisation. primary outcome was improvement in communication (social skills improvement system rating scales) (ssis) at 13weeks. secondary outcomes included social functioning, self-esteem, depression and family functioning. resultsthere was no significant difference for the child ssis at week 13 (adjusted difference in mean 2.4; 95% ci -1.2 to 6.1; p=.19) or for the guardian ssis (0.5; 95% ci -2.9 to 3.8; p=.78). however, for participants aged 13 and over in the intervention group, the child ssis communication was significantly improved (6.1, 95% ci 1.6 to 10.5; p=.007) but not the guardian ssis (1.1; 95% ci -2.9 to 5.2; p=.59). overall, self-esteem was significantly improved and depression scores were significantly lower at week 13. there was no significant difference in family or social functioning at week 13. conclusionswhile the findings provide some evidence for the integration of music therapy into clinical practice, differences relating to subgroups and secondary outcomes indicate the need for further study. isrctn register; isrctn96352204.
prenatal_development	there is a definite pattern of the growth of seminiferous tubules at different post natal ages in mammals. the present work involves recording the changes of the seminiferous tubules, the cellular components of the seminiferous epithelium and the leydig cells in male assam goats. different micrometrical parameters of the seminiferous tubules were found to increase with the increase in age of the male goats and they showed a significant (p < .05) increase between the age of 6 and 8 months. also, the micrometrical parameters of different spermatogenic cells showed a significant (p < .05) increase between 6- and 8-month-old goats. the leydig cells could be marked in the intertubular tissue right from birth. various micrometrical parameters of the leydig cells were found to increase with the advancement of age of the male goats. the nuclear diameter of the leydig cells did not show a definite pattern during their postnatal growth. the other micrometrical measurements of the leydig cells denoted their highest values at the age of 8 months.
prenatal_development	objectives: the primary risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) are preterm birth, enteral feeding, and gut colonization. it is unclear whether feeding and colonization induce excessive expression of immune genes that lead to nec. using a pig model, we hypothesized that reduced gestational age would upregulate immune-related genes and cause bacterial imbalance after birth. methods: preterm (85%-92% gestation, n = 53) and near-term (95%-99% gestation, n = 69) pigs were delivered by cesarean section and euthanized at birth or after 2 days of infant formula or bovine colostrum feeding. results: at birth, preterm delivery reduced 5 of 30 intestinal genes related to nutrient absorption and innate immunity, relative to near-term pigs, whereas 2 genes were upregulated. preterm birth also reduced ex vivo intestinal glucose and leucine uptake (40%-50%), but failed to increase cytokine secretions from intestinal explants relative to near-term birth. after 2 days of formula feeding, nec incidence was increased in preterm versus near-term pigs (47% vs 0%-13%). a total of 6 of the 30 genes related to immunity (tlr2, il1b, and il8), permeability (cldn3, and ocln), and absorption (sglt) decreased in pretermpigs without affecting gram-negative bacteria-related responses (tlr4, ikba, nfkb1, tnfaip3, and pafa). bacterial abundance tended to be higher in preterm versus near-term pigs (p = 0.09), whereas the composition was unaffected. conclusions: preterm birth predisposes to nec and reduces nutrient absorption but does not induce upregulation of immune-related genes or cause bacterial dyscolonization in the neonatal period. excessive inflammation and bacterial overgrowth may occur relatively late in nec progression in preterm neonates.
seasonal_affective_disorder	the purpose of this work was to examine the relationships between geographical coordinates and the prevalence of winter depression (sad(w)), and to compare the sleep characteristics and chronotype of youths with and without sad(w). we conducted a cross-sectional study of self-reported sleep characteristics, chronotype and winter depression in northern european russia. two questionnaires, the munich chronotype questionnaire (mctq) and the seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire (spaq), were administered to a total of 3435 adolescents aged 10-20years (1517 males and 1918 females). the prevalence of sad(w) in the study population was 8.4% and sub-sad(w) 11.8%. four variables predicted the likelihood of sad(w) in youths: sex [higher in females: odds ratio (or): 1.87, p<0.0001], age (increases with age: or: 1.09, p<0.001), latitude (higher in the north: or: 1.49, p<0.029) and position in the time zone (higher in the west: or: 1.61, p<0.001). later sleeping and waking, longer sleep latencies, more severe sleep inertia, shorter total sleep times and lower sleep efficiencies were observed in both males and females with sad(w). the influence of sad(w) on sleep characteristics was more pronounced on school days. significant phase delays of the sleep-wake rhythm and severe social jetlag (the difference between the mid-point of sleep phase at weekends and on workdays) were observed in females with sad(w), but not in males. there are significant differences in sleep characteristics and chronotype between people with sad(w) and no-sad. we demonstrate that both latitude of residence and location within the time zone are significant predictors of sad(w) in young inhabitants of the north.
nonverbal_communication	with the increasingly frequent intercultural communication, the influence of intercultural pragmatic failures more and more clearly revealed. currently, many researchers and language teachers at home and abroad conducted researches on verbal conduct pragmatic failure, but they often overlooked the nonverbal communication pragmatic failure. this paper focuses on the types and causes of nonverbal pragmatic failure in intercultural communication, and then puts forward the strategy to avoid or reduce pragmatic failures in order to provide some useful reference for people engaging in intercultural communication.
gender_roles	employing gender role ideology theory, this research investigates australian consumer attitudes towards current advertisements portraying males as caregivers. results of an experiment demonstrate that consumers perceive in-ad gender role portrayals of males as caregivers as atypical of the current advertising environment. consumers who, in particular, hold a non-traditional (egalitarian) gender role ideology report a more positive attitude towards advertising that challenges traditional gender role ideologies (i.e., advertising that depicts males as caregivers). we suggest that non-traditional advertising that challenges traditional gender roles provides advertisers with an opportunity to stand out; however, advertisers must ensure that their key product-related message components are not overshadowed.
leadership	background: we evaluated a facilitation strategy to help clinical sites likely to experience challenges implement evidence-based primary care-mental health integration (pc-mhi) care models within the context of a department of veterans affairs (va) initiative. this article describes our assessment of whether implementation facilitation (if) can foster development of high quality pc-mhi programs that adhere to evidence, are sustainable and likely to improve clinical practices and outcomes. methods: utilizing a matched pair design, we conducted a qualitative descriptive evaluation of the if strategy in sixteen va primary care clinics. to assess program quality and adherence to evidence, we conducted one-hour structured telephone interviews, at two time points, with clinicians and leaders who knew the most about the clinics' programs. we then created structured summaries of the interviews that va national pc-mhi experts utilized to rate the programs on four dimensions (overall quality, adherence to evidence, sustainability and level of improvement). results: at first assessment, seven of eight if sites and four of eight comparison sites had implemented a pc-mhi program. our qualitative assessment suggested that experts rated if sites' programs higher than comparison sites' programs with one exception. at final assessment, all eight if but only five comparison sites had implemented a pc-mhi program. again, experts rated if sites' programs higher than their matched comparison sites with one exception. over time, all ratings improved in five of seven if sites and two of three comparison sites. conclusions: implementing complex evidence-based programs, particularly in settings that lack infrastructure, resources and support for such efforts, is challenging. findings suggest that a blend of external expert and internal regional facilitation strategies that implementation scientists have developed and tested can improve pc-mhi program uptake, quality and adherence to evidence in primary care clinics with these challenges. however, not all sites showed these improvements. to be successful, facilitators likely need at least a moderate level of leaders' support, including provision of basic resources. additionally, we found that if and strength of leadership structure may have a synergistic effect on ability to implement higher quality and evidence-based programs.
problem-solving	cognitive aspects of children 's executive function (ef) were examined as moderators of the effectiveness of parental guidance on children 's learning. thirty-two 5-year-old children and their parents were observed during joint problem-solving. forms of guidance geared towards cognitive assistance were coded as directive or elaborative, and children 's responses were recorded. children were then assessed on an independent version of the same task. a parent-rated composite of working memory and planning was used as a measure of ef. directive guidance by parents was associated with more child errors during the joint activity, whereas elaborative guidance was associated with better performance. parent-rated ef moderated the relation, such that the relation between elaborative guidance and better performance was only significant for children with low ef. during the independent task, ef again moderated the relation between parent guidance and children 's performance, such that children with low ef did worse when parents had provided more directive guidance; for children with high ef, directive guidance was associated with better independent performance. these findings suggest that the extent to which children 's performance relates to different forms of parents' guidance varies, and elaborative assistance may be more helpful for children with low ef. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
eating_disorders	there is considerable evidence for an association between obesity and impaired executive function (ef) in adolescents and adults. however, little research has examined ef in overweight or obese children. furthermore, data on ef in underweight individuals is lacking. in addition, there is no consensus on the directionality of the relationship between body mass index (bmi) and ef, and longitudinal studies are rare. thus, the present study examined whether children differ in their performance on a battery of ef tasks depending on their weight status (underweight, normal-weight, overweight), and investigated the longitudinal cross-lagged associations between ef and bmi. hot ef (delay of gratification, affective decision-making), cool ef (attention shifting, inhibition, working memory [wm] updating), and bmi were assessed in 1,657 german elementary-school children at two time points, approximately oneyear apart. overweight children exhibited slightly poorer attention shifting, wm updating, and affective decision-making abilities as compared to normal-weight children. unexpectedly, they did not show any deficits in inhibition or delay of gratification. ef levels of underweight children did not differ significantly from those of normal-weight children. furthermore, poor attention shifting and enhanced affective decision-making predicted a slightly higher bmi oneyear later, and a higher bmi also predicted poorer attention shifting and wm updating oneyear later. the latter association between bmi and subsequent ef scores, however, diminished when controlling for socioeconomic status. results indicate that hot and cool ef plays a role in the weight development of children, and might be a promising factor to address in preventive interventions.
prenatal_development	this study was carried out to investigate the morphological development of kidney in the foetal stage of camelus dromedaries by biometrical analysis. in the experiment, thirthy numbers of camelus dromedaries embryoes were selected based on their crown-rump length and subsequently divided into 6 age groups consisting of 5 animals in each group. group i (45 days), group ii (60 days), group iii (75 days), group iv (90 days), group v (105 days) and group vi (120 days). in foetus of about 45 days, kidneys demonstrated circle shape and no renal pelvis was evident in all kidneys under study. in the 60 days old foetuses, bean shape kidneys were present, renal pelvis was distinct and extensive with a well developed ureter that originated from the middle of the pelvis in both left and right kidneys. in 75-120 days old foetus, length, width and thickness of kidneys were more increased. significant variation in measurements of some parameters have been resulted.
gender_roles	the current study utilized longitudinal, self-report data from a sample of 109 dual-earner, working-class couples and their 6-year-old children living in the northeastern united states. research questions addressed the roles of parents' gender ideology and gendered behaviors in predicting children 's development of gender-role attitudes. it was hypothesized that parents' behavior would be more influential than their ideology in the development of their children 's attitudes about gender roles. parents responded to questionnaires assessing their global beliefs about women 's and men 's ""rightful"" roles in society, work preferences for mothers, division of household and childcare tasks, division of paid work hours, and job traditionality. these data were collected at multiple time points across the first year of parenthood, and during a 6-year follow-up. at the final time point, children completed the sex roles learning inventory (serli), an interactive measure that assesses gender-role attitudes. overall, mothers' and fathers' behaviors were better predictors of children 's gender-role attitudes than parents' ideology. in addition, mothers and fathers played unique roles in their sons' and daughters' acquisition of knowledge about gender stereotypes. findings from the current study fill gaps in the literature on children 's gender development in the family context-particularly by examining the understudied role of fathers in children 's acquisition of knowledge regarding gender stereotypes and through its longitudinal exploration of the relationship between parents' gender ideologies, parents' gendered behaviors, and children 's gender-role attitudes.
problem-solving	antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) has been demonstrated to decrease hiv acquisition in multiple efficacy trials, but medication adherence is critical, and was suboptimal in several studies. fifty hiv-uninfected at risk men who have sex with men (msm) were randomized to a cognitive behavioral intervention condition or a time and session-matched comparison counseling intervention. the experimental intervention entailed four nurse-delivered initial and two booster sessions based on life-steps, an art treatment adherence intervention. the comparison condition provided information and supportive counseling. the primary analyses compared adherence (wisepill and tenofovir plasma levels) at 3 and 6 months. fifty-eight msm were screened to enroll 50 participants. median age was 38.2 years old, 86% were white; 64% had completed college. wisepill adherence was high in both groups, and not statistically different. plasma tenofovir levels were significantly higher in the intervention group at 6 months using mean substitution analysis (i.e., computing missing variables) (p = 0.037), however, in the completer analyses (i.e., using only those completing all study visits), there were no statistically significant differences between randomization conditions. medication adherence was high across a cognitive-behavioral (life-steps) and time-matched counseling intervention for prep adherence, with some evidence suggesting superiority of life-steps in this pilot rct. further evaluation in a fully powered efficacy trial is warranted to assess the robustness of this intervention.
depression	background: electrocardiographic (ecg) monitored outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (op-cr) is routinely performed following a variety of cardiovascular procedures and conditions. objective: the aim of this study is to determine if diagnostic-quality ecg monitoring in patients with coronary artery disease (cad) during op-cr is useful in identifying asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, resulting in change(s) in care or medical management. methods: a retrospective analysis of ecg monitoring was done on all op-cr patients diagnosed with cad (n = 1213) from january 2000 through june 2013. results: nearly a quarter of the patients (24%; n = 288) displayed at least 1 mm of asymptomatic st-segment depression at 80 milliseconds after the j-point during at least 1 session of op-cr. of these patients, 57% had medical management change(s) compared with 24% for those who did not show ecg changes suggesting ischemia (p < .0001). in patients with asymptomatic ischemia having medical management change(s), 84% resulted directly from op-cr staff detection. fewer patients diagnosed with myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft surgery demonstrated ecg signs of ischemia, whereas more patients diagnosed with stable angina and percutaneous coronary interventions demonstrated ecg signs of ischemia. conclusion: this study demonstrates that most patients with cad showing asymptomatic ecg signs suggesting ischemia undergo medical management change(s) as a result of the finding. diagnostic-quality ecg monitoring during op-cr appears warranted in this population.
prenatal_development	aromatase inhibitors (als) area class of drugs that act by blocking the production of estrogens from androgens. the current review concentrates on the prenatal developmental toxicity of als in experimental models. available data indicate that als may affect pregnancy at human therapeutic or lower doses. the window of vulnerability to ais is not limited to organogenesis, but also includes the preimplantation stage and fetal periods. decreased embryo/fetal survival was the prominent treatment-related effect. morphological anomalies noted in fetuses exposed to als included skeletal anomalies, abnormal head morphology, increased ano-genital distance in female fetuses, and minor urinary tract system anomalies. placental enlargement was consistently reported in rats and non-human primates after maternal treatment with several ais. in conclusion, data from basic scientific research suggest that low intensity exposure to als applied during a wide gestational window can profoundly affect prenatal development.

attention	recently, wireless charging via magnetic resonance coupling has gained attention because it has the potential of efficient midrange wireless charging. here, functions such as sensing at the transmitter and wireless communication from the target are the essential elements to realize a standard wireless charging system. currently, the sensing and communication protocol of the hardware (i.e., the high-frequency power source and antenna configuration) compatible with wireless charging is gaining attention in terms of its cost and space reduction due to the use of common components for multiple functions. however, this protocol has the problem of narrow effective areas due to the fact that the sensing range depends on the fixed q factor of the antenna. to overcome this problem, the concept of wide-area sensing based on a q controllable antenna is proposed, and the effectiveness is verified through a theoretical analysis and an experiment. as a result, it is clarified that the effective area can be expanded up to a ratio of the distance g between the transmitting and receiving antennas to the inner diameter d of the antenna g/d = 5.0.

antisocial_personality_disorder	objective: to determine longitudinal associations between patterns of comorbid cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use and antisocial personality disorder (aspd), major depressive episode (mde), and generalized anxiety disorder (gad) in adulthood. method: a random community-based sample [(x) over bar age = 36.6 (sd = 2.8)] from the children and adults in the community study, an on-going investigation of substance use and psychiatric disorders. data were collected at six time waves. conjoint trajectories of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use spanning adolescence to adulthood were determined; multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed associations between trajectory group membership and having aspd, mde, or gad in adulthood. results: five conjoint trajectory groups were obtained: hhh (chronic cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use), ddd (delayed/late-starting cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use), lml (low/no smoking, moderate alcohol use, occasional marijuana use), hmn (chronic smoking, moderate alcohol use, no marijuana use), and non (occasional alcohol use only). compared with members of the non group, those in the hhh group had significantly greater odds for having aspd (adjusted odds ratio [aor] = 28.52, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 9.44-86.17), mde (aor = 2.67, 95% ci = 1.14-6.26), and gad (aor = 6.39, 95% ci = 2.62-15.56). members of the ddd, lml, and hmn groups had weaker and less consistent associations with the three psychiatric outcomes. conclusions: in a large, community-based sample, long-term concurrent use of more than one substance was associated with both externalizing and internalizing psychiatric disorders in adulthood. prevention and treatment programs might target individuals in the community and general clinical populations with comorbid substance use, even if they have n't been identified as having a substance use disorder.

gender_roles	men 's involvement in maternal and child healthcare especially in patriarchal societies such as ghana is increasingly being advocated. while a number of studies have been conducted to explore men 's views on their involvement, few studies have examined the perspectives of childbearing women. based on qualitative focus group discussions that were conducted between january and august 2014 with a total of 125 adult women in seven communities in the upper west region of ghana, this paper examines women 's perspectives on men 's involvement in maternal and child healthcare. findings suggest that although many women recognised the benefits of men 's involvement, few actually supported greater male involvement. the majority of women expressed negative attitudes and opinions on the involvement of men. these negative attitudes and opinions were framed by three broad factors: perceptions that pregnancy and child care should be a female role while men should be bread winners; women 's desire to avoid negative stereotyping; and fears that men 's involvement may turn hitherto secure social spaces for women into insecure ones. these narrative accounts largely challenge current programmatic efforts that seek to promote men 's involvement in maternal and child healthcare, and suggest that such male involvement programmes are less likely to succeed if the views and concerns of childbearing women are not taken into account.

false_memories	stereotype threat often incurs the cost of reducing the amount of information that older adults accurately recall. in the current research, we tested whether stereotype threat can also benefit memory. according to the regulatory focus account of stereotype threat, threat induces a prevention focus in which people become concerned with avoiding errors of commission and are sensitive to the presence or absence of losses within their environment. because of this, we predicted that stereotype threat might reduce older adults' memory errors. results were consistent with this prediction. older adults under stereotype threat had lower intrusion rates during free-recall tests (experiments 1 and 2). they also reduced their false alarms and adopted more conservative response criteria during a recognition test (experiment 2). thus, stereotype threat can decrease older adults' false memories, albeit at the cost of fewer veridical memories, as well.
eating_disorders	the aim of this study was to determine the characteristic features which contribute to inappropriate eating attitudes in people suffering from anorexia nervosa, based on an analysis of recent data. factors influencing these attitudes have a genetic, neurobiological, biochemical, affective-motivational, cognitive, and behavioral background. another important issue addressed in the paper is a description of the mechanism leading to continuous dietary restrictions. the altered activity of neurotransmitters modulating patients' moods after the consumption of food and a disturbed responsiveness to enterohormones enhance affective-motivational and cognitive aspects which, in turn, impede the improvement of eating behaviors. an understanding of the mechanisms behind the factors affecting the maintenance of inappropriate eating attitudes may contribute to greater effectiveness in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.
prenatal_development	this study sought to describe the morphological changes taking place in the goat reticulum during prenatal development, using histomorphometric and immunohistochemical techniques. a total of 140 goat embryos and foetuses were used, from the first stages of prenatal life until birth. differentiation of the reticulum as a separate compartment of the primitive gastric tube was observed at 35 days of prenatal life (23% gestation). by 38 days (25% gestation) the reticular wall comprised three layers: an internal epithelial layer, a middle layer of pluripotential blastemic tissue and an external layer or serosa. primary reticular crests were visible at 59 days (38% gestation) as evaginations of the epithelial stratum basale, marking the earliest histological differentiation of future reticular cells. secondary reticular crests were observed at 87 days (61% gestation). corneum papillae first became apparent on the lateral surface of primary reticular crests at 101 days (64% gestation). the muscularis mucosae was visible by 101 days (64% gestation) in primary reticular crests. neuroendocrine cells were detected by synaptophysin at 64 days (43% gestation), while glial cell markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin) were observed at 64 days (43% gestation) and 38 days (25% gestation), respectively. the peptidergic innervation markers such as neuropeptide y and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide were detected at 75 days (50% gestation). in conclusion, prenatal development of the reticulum - like that of the rumen - appears to take place somewhat earlier in goats than in sheep or cattle, but at a similar rate to that reported in deer.
eating_disorders	introduction. - the mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (mngie) disease is an extremely underrated syndrome beginning around the age of eighteen years. because of its severity, this diagnosis should be considered when a patient presents an atypical anorexia nervosa. mngie disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and related to mutations of the tymp gene (ch22q13.32-qter), encoding the thymidine phosphorylase. the mngie is often misdiagnosed and is associated with a time to diagnostic of about 12 years after first symptoms. thus this critical review aims to help clinicians better identify symptoms and paraclinical markers of the mngie as a differential diagnosis of atypical anorexia nervosa. methods. - a literature search was performed using pubmed and google scholar databases. results. - the clinical diagnosis of the mngie disease should be based on the association of severe loss of weight and some additional symptoms: (1) severe gastrointestinal dysmotility (nausea, vomiting, intestinal pseudo-obstruction), (2) ptosis or external ophtalmoplegia and (3) peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. when mngie disease is clinically suspected, paraclinical testing can help to validate the mngie diagnostic: (1) arterial blood test reveals lactic acidemia (e.g. an increased serum concentration of lactate without ph modifications), and (2) brain mri indicates leukoencephalopathy, usually asymptomatic. direct evidence of mngie disease is based on specific testing of: (1) the thymidine phopshorylase enzyme activity in leukocytes is less than 10% of the control, (2) the increase of plasmatic thymidine (>3 mu mol/l) and the increase of plamatic deoxyuridine (>5 mu mol/l), (3) the evidence of mutations of the tymp gene by molecular genetic testing. conclusion. - the mngie disease is a severe trouble with multisystemic complications. the thymidine phopshorylase enzyme activity in leukocytes should be measured as soon as possible when a patient presents atypical anorexia nervosa.

prejudice	research on intergroup contact has grown exponentially over the past decade. such research has typically extolled the benefits of positive interaction between members of historically divided communities, particularly on outcomes related to prejudice reduction. emerging work in the field, however, has qualified this optimistic picture by identifying three gaps in the existing literature. first, in everyday life, contact may be construed as a negative experience that increases rather than decreases responses such as prejudice, anxiety, and avoidance. second, in real-life settings, contact is often circumscribed by informal practices of (re)segregation that are easily overlooked if researchers rely primarily on examining structured contact and explicit processes using primarily laboratory and questionnaire methods. third, positive contact may have ironic effects on the political attitudes and behaviors of the historically disadvantaged, undermining their recognition of social injustice and decreasing their willingness to engage in collective action to challenge the status quo. although it is now a truism that intergroup contact can reduce intergroup prejudice, these developments emphasize the importance of maintaining a critical perspective on the contact hypothesis as a model for promoting social change in historically divided and unequal societies. they also lay the foundations for future developments in the field.
schizophrenia	growing clinical and pre-clinical evidence points to a critical role for cannabidiol (cbd), the largest phytochemical component of cannabis, as a potential pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders. in contrast to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc), which is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental pro-psychotic side-effects, cbd possesses no known psychoactive or dependence-producing properties. however, evidence has demonstrated that cbd strongly modulates the mesolimbic dopamine (da) system and may possess promising anti-psychotic properties. despite the psychotropic differences between cbd and thc, little is known regarding their molecular and neuronal effects on the mesolimbic da system, nor how these differential effects may relate to their potential pro vs. anti-psychotic properties. this review summarizes clinical and pre-clinical evidence demonstrating cbd 's modulatory effects on da activity states within the mesolimbic pathway, functional interactions with the serotonin 5-ht1a receptor system, and their downstream molecular signaling effects. together with clinical evidence showing that cbd may normalize affective and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, cbd may represent a promising treatment for schizophrenia, acting through novel molecular and neuronal mesolimbic substrates.

nonverbal_communication	research into individual differences in interpersonal accuracy (ipa; the ability to accurately judge others' emotions, intentions, traits, truthfulness, and other social characteristics) has a long tradition and represents a growing area of interest in psychology. measuring ipa has proved fruitful for uncovering correlates of this skill. however, despite this tradition and a considerable volume of research, very few efforts have been made to look collectively at the nature of the tests involved in assessing ipa, leaving questions of the broader structure of ipa unresolved. is ipa a single skill or a clustering of many discrete skills or some combination of partially overlapping skills? in a multi-level meta-analysis of 103 published and unpublished participant samples (13,683 participants), we analyzed 622 correlations between pairs of ipa tests (135 different ipa tests altogether). the overall correlation between ipa tests was r = .19, corrected for the nesting of correlations within the studies that administered more than two ipa tests and reported several correlations for the same participant sample. test domain and characteristics were evaluated to explain differences in effect sizes; in general, tests in similar domains and using similar methodologies were more highly correlated with each other, suggesting that there are domains within which individual differences cluster. implications for future research and ipa measurement were discussed.
nonverbal_communication	service providers have often used the mantra of ""service with a smile"" as a strategy to engender customer satisfaction. the findings of the current research indicate that a smile alone may not be sufficient in achieving service excellence. specifically, this work extends prior research suggesting that customers have more positive reactions to duchenne, or authentic, smiles compared to non-duchenne, or non genuine, smiles. two experimental vignette studies examined the influence of the type of smile a service provider displays (duchenne vs. non-duchenne) and gender of the service provider on perceptions of service quality, as well as the stereotype content model dimensions of competence and warmth. the results suggest that the type of smile (duchenne vs. non-duchenne) impacts evaluations of service providers in terms of their perceived level of competence, as well as their perceived service quality ratings. implications for the hiring and training of service providers are also discussed.

borderline_personality_disorder	background: despite links between early relational experiences and psychopathology, data regarding childhood emotional neglect among canadian mental health services users are scarce. aims: to explore the absence of emotional support experiences reported by canadian psychiatric outpatients, and to examine the relationship between childhood emotional support and borderline personality disorder (bpd) features. methods: a survey regarding childhood emotional support was completed by consecutively admitted adult outpatients, along with self-report assessments of symptom distress and bpd features. results: a substantial proportion of outpatients reported absent emotional support experiences. after controlling for the effects of age and symptom distress, childhood emotional support was found to be significantly negatively associated with bpd features. conclusion: the findings add further support to the need for clinical attention to the early relational experiences of mental health service users.
gender_roles	background: it is common that physicians go to work while sick and therefore it is important to understand the reasons behind. previous research has shown that women and men differ in health and health related behavior. in this study, we examine gender differences among general practitioners who work while sick. methods: general practitioners (gp 's) working in outpatient care in a swedish city participated in the study (n = 283; women = 63 %; response rate = 41 %). data were obtained from a large web-based questionnaire about health and organization within primary care. two questions about sickness presenteeism (going to work while sick) were included; life-long and during the past 12 months, and five questions about reasons. we controlled for general health, work-family conflict and demographic variables. results: female physicians reported sickness presenteeism more often than male physicians. work-family conflict mediated the association between gender and sickness presenteeism. women reported reasons related with ""concern for others"" and ""workload"" more strongly than men. men reported reasons related with ""capacity"" and ""money"" more strongly than women. these differences are likely effects of gender stereotyping and different family-responsibilities. conclusions: gender socialization and gender stereotypes may influence work and health-related behavior. because sickness presenteeism is related with negative effects both on individuals and at organizational levels, it is important that managers of health organizations understand the reasons for this, and how gender roles may influence the prevalence of sickness presenteeism and the reasons that female and male gps give for their behavior.
borderline_personality_disorder	the aim of this randomized pilot study is to investigate the effects of a short training programme in loving-kindness and compassion meditation (lkm/cm) in patients with borderline personality disorder. patients were allocated to lkm/cm or mindfulness continuation training (control group). patients in the lkm/cm group showed greater changes in acceptance compared with the control group. remarkable changes in borderline symptomatology, self-criticism and self-kindness were also observed in the lkm/cm group. mechanistic explanations and therapeutic implications of the findings are discussed. highlights: three weeks of loving-kindness and compassion meditations increased acceptance of the present-moment experience in patients with borderline personality disorder. significant improvements in the severity of borderline symptoms, self-criticism, mindfulness, acceptance and self-kindness were observed after the lkm/cm intervention. lkm/cm is a promising complementary strategy for inclusion in mindfulness-based interventions and dialectical behavioural therapy for treating core symptoms in borderline personality disorder. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
media_violence	purpose: to determine exposure of young adolescents to extremely violent movies. design: cross-sectional school-based survey of middle school students at 15 randomly selected new hampshire and vermont middle schools. each survey contained a unique list of 50 movies, randomly selected from 603 top box office hits from 1988 to 1999, 51 of which were determined by content analysis to contain extremely violent material. movie titles only were listed, and adolescents were asked to indicate which ones they had seen. each movie appeared on approximately 470 surveys. we calculated the percentage of students who had seen each movie for a representative subsample of the student population. we also examined characteristics associated with seeing at least one extremely violent movie. complete survey information was obtained from 5456 students. the sample was primarily white and equally distributed by gender. results: on average, extremely violent movies were seen by 28% of the students in the sample (range 4% to 66%). the most popular movie, scream, was seen by two-thirds of students overall and over 40% of fifth-graders. other movies with sexualized violent content were seen by many of these adolescents. examples include the general 's daughter (rated r for ""graphic images related to sexual violence including a rape scene and perverse sexuality"") and natural born killers (rated r for extreme violence and graphic carnage, shocking images, language, and sexuality""), seen by 27% and 20%, respectively. older students, males, those of lower socioeconomic status, and those with poorer school performance were all significantly more likely to have seen at least one extremely violent movie. conclusion: this study documents widespread exposure of young adolescents to movies with brutal, and often sexualized, violence. given that many of these films were marketed to teens, better oversight of the marketing practices of the film industry may be warranted.

leadership	we investigate the impact of a novel method called ""virtual mirroring"" to promote employee self-reflection and impact customer satisfaction. the method is based on measuring communication patterns, through social network and semantic analysis, and mirroring them back to the individual. our goal is to demonstrate that self-reflection can trigger a change in communication behaviors, which lead to increased customer satisfaction. we illustrate and test our approach analyzing e-mails of a large global services company by comparing changes in customer satisfaction associated with team leaders exposed to virtual mirroring (the experimental group). we find an increase in customer satisfaction in the experimental group and a decrease in the control group (team leaders not involved in the virtual mirroring process). with regard to the individual communication indicators, we find that customer satisfaction is higher when employees are more responsive, use a simpler language, are embedded in less centralized communication networks, and show more stable leadership patterns.

attention	introduction: previous studies have demonstrated that students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) struggle particularly with grasping the implicit, inferential level of narratives that is crucial for story comprehension. however, these studies used offline tasks (i.e., after story presentation), used indirect measurements (e.g., identifying main ideas), and/or yielded inconclusive results using think-aloud techniques. moreover, most studies were conducted with preschool or elementary school children with adhd, using listening or televised story comprehension. in this study, we were interested in examining the spontaneous, immediate activation and/or suppression of forward-predictive inferences, backward-explanatory inferences, and inference-evoking textual information, as they occur online during reading comprehension by adolescents with adhd. method: participants with and without adhd read short narrative texts, each of which included a predictive sentence, a bridging sentence that referred back to the predictive sentence via actualization of the predicted event, and two intervening sentences positioned between the predictive and bridging sentences that introduced a temporary transition from the main (predictive) episode. activation and suppression of inferential and/or textual information were assessed using naming times of word probes that were implied by the preceding text, explicitly mentioned in it, or neither when following control texts. in some cases, a true-false inferential or textual question followed the probe. results: naming facilitations were observed for the control but not for the adhd group, in responding to inference probes that followed the predictive and bridging sentences, and to text probes that followed the predictive sentences. participants with adhd were accurate, albeit slower, than controls in answering the true-false questions. conclusions: adolescents with adhd have difficulties in generating predictive and explanatory inferences and in retaining relevant textual information in working memory while reading, although they can answer questions after reading when texts are relatively short. these findings are discussed with regard to development of comprehension strategies for individuals with adhd.
child_abuse	this study aimed to identify and analyze the prevalence of physical and psychological family violence in a sample of children and adolescents with different categories of disabilities in a hospital in rio de janeiro, brazil. this was a cross-sectional observational study based on application of the parent-child conflict tactics scale in a sample of 270 parents or guardians. prevalence was 83.7% for psychological aggression and 84.4% for physical maltreatment, while 96.5% of the children and adolescents with disabilities that suffered physical punishment were also victims of psychological aggression ( p < 0.01) and 100% of those who suffered severe physical maltreatment also suffered psychological aggression ( p = 0.01). children and adolescents with disabilities showed increased risk of suffering family violence compared to those without disabilities. in conclusion, there is a need for greater awareness-raising and training of health teams for detection and notification of child abuse, and efforts should be made to support these families.
nonverbal_communication	objective: to determine the opinion of nursing faculty and a researcher on the effectiveness of non-verbal communication in the classroom. methods: this descriptive study included 11 nursing professors filmed for 220 minutes. fourteen aspects of non-verbal communication were evaluated. opinions about the effectiveness of non-verbal communication are expressed as simple frequencies. results: professors identified 71.43% of postures (as coherent, good, effective, and adequate), 62.5% of facial expressions (efficient, positive, and reinforcing/following the speech), 83.33% of voice rhythms (effective, good, and adequate speed), 61.11% of physical energy levels (good rhythm, active, attentive, effective, adequate, and alert), and 78.95% of body postures (kept moving, standing, remaining on feet, using hand movements to illustrate points, attention focused on students, position close to students' desks). a less frequent inefficient non-verbal communication was seen among. conclusion: nursing professors' opinions on non-verbal communication in the classroom were general and non-specific, indicating inadequate application of non-verbal communication. professors identified inefficient non-verbal communication behavior less often than did one of the current researchers.
antisocial_personality_disorder	aims to determine whether childhood physical abuse (cpa) histories were associated with age of onset of psychoactive substance use and injecting, and the extent of polydrug use among injecting drug users (idu). design cross-sectional. setting sydney, australia. participants and measurements a total of 300 idu were administered a structured interview examining the prevalence and severity of cpa and drug use histories. findings of the participants, 40.3% had experienced severe abuse (sa), 34.0% mild-moderate abuse (mma) and 25.7% no abuse history (na). after controlling for other variables, a history of severe cpa was a significant independent correlate of an earlier age at first alcohol intoxication compared to both the na (beta = -0.23, p < 0.01) and mma (beta = 0.20, p < 0.01) groups. severe cpa was also a significant independent correlate of an earlier age at first illicit drug use compared to both the na (beta = -0.16, p < 0.05) and mma (beta = -0.15, p < 0.05) groups. in contrast, cpa histories were not independently associated with the onset of injecting drug use. after controlling for potential confounders, both the mma (beta = 0.28, p < 0.001) and sa (beta = 0.27, p < 0.001) groups were associated with more extensive life-time polydrug use, but did not differ from each other (p = 0.82). after controlling for potential confounders, both mma (beta = 0.20, p < 0.01) and sa (beta = 0.33, p < 0.001) group membership were associated with more extensive recent polydrug use but, again, did not differ significantly from each other (p = 0.08). conclusions severe childhood physical abuse severity is associated with an earlier initiation into drug use. any level of abuse is associated with more extensive life-time and recent polydrug use.
eating_disorders	the salience network (sn) plays a central role in cognitive control by integrating sensory input to guide attention, attend to motivationally salient stimuli and recruit appropriate functional brain-behavior networks to modulate behavior. mounting evidence suggests that disturbances in sn function underlie abnormalities in cognitive control and may be a common etiology underlying many psychiatric disorders. such functional and anatomical abnormalities have been recently apparent in studies and meta-analyses of psychiatric illness using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) and voxelbased morphometry (vbm). of particular importance, abnormal structure and function in major cortical nodes of the sn, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (daco) and anterior insula (al), have been observed as a common neurobiological substrate across a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders. in addition to cortical nodes of the sn, the network 's associated subcortical structures, including the dorsal striatum, mediodorsal thalamus and dopaminergic brainstem nuclei, comprise a discrete regulatory loop circuit. the sn 's cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop increasingly appears to be central to mechanisms of cognitive control, as well as to a broad spectrum of psychiatric illnesses and their available treatments. functional imbalances within the sn loop appear to impair cognitive control, and specifically may impair self-regulation of cognition, behavior and emotion, thereby leading to symptoms of psychiatric illness. furthermore, treating such psychiatric illnesses using invasive or non-invasive brain stimulation techniques appears to modulate sn cortical-subcortical loop integrity, and these effects may be central to the therapeutic mechanisms of brain stimulation treatments in many psychiatric illnesses. here, we review clinical and experimental evidence for abnormalities in sn cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuits in major depression, substance use disorders (sud), anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and eating disorders (ed). we also review emergent therapeutic evidence that novel invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation treatments may exert therapeutic effects by normalizing abnormalities in the sn loop, thereby restoring the capacity for cognitive control. finally, we consider a series of promising directions for future investigations on the role of sn cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuits in the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders.
attention	sparked by the conjunction of food, fuel, and financial crises, there has been an increasing awareness in recent years of the scarce and finite character of natural resources. productive resources such as agricultural land have been touted by financial actors-such as merchant banks, pension funds, and investment companies-as providing the basis for a range of new ""alternative"" financial asset classes and products. while the drivers, motives, and rationales behind the increasing interest of turning farmland into a financial asset class have been traced by a number of scholars, the interpretations of, and interactions with, financial actors at the community level have received less attention. based on qualitative research in rural australia, this paper reveals the grounds on which finance-backed investments have been accepted and accommodated by communities in rural australia and delineates the reasons that have led to feelings of unease or refusal. the paper thereby demonstrates that the financialization of farmland is neither abstract nor one-sided but rather a multidimensional process that not only includes financial actors but also the impacted rural populations in various ways. positioning the activities of financial actors in australia within the emerging research on the financialization of farmland, the paper endorses context-sensitive analyses to better interpret these recent transformations of the agri-food system.
person_perception	two studies were conducted to test the predictions of a multi-component model of distinctiveness-based illusory correlation (ic) regarding the use of episodic and evaluative information in the production of the phenomenon. extending on the standard paradigm, participants were presented with 4 groups decreasing in size, but all exhibiting the same ratio of positive to negative behaviours. study i (n = 75) specifically tested the role of group size and distinctiveness, by including a zero-frequency cell in the design. consistent with predictions drawn from the proposed model, with decreasing group size, the magnitude of the ic effect showed a linear increase in judgments thought to be based on evaluative information. in study 2 (n = 43), a number of changes were introduced to a group assignment task (double presentation, inclusion of decoys) that allowed a more rigorous test of the predicted item-specific memory effects. in addition, a new multilevel, mixed logistic regression approach to signal-detection type analysis was used, providing a more flexible and reliable analysis than previously. again, with decreasing group size, ic effects showed the predicted monotonic increase on the measures (group assignment frequencies, likability ratings) thought to be dependent on evaluative information. at the same time, measures thought to be based on episodic information (free recall and group assignment accuracy) partly revealed the predicted enhanced episodic memory for smaller groups and negative items, while also supporting a distinctiveness-based approach. additional analysis revealed that the pattern of results for judgments though to be based on evaluative information was independent of interpersonal variation in behavioral memory, as predicted by the multi-component model,and in contrast to predictions of the competing models. the results are discussed in terms of the implications of the findings for the proposed mechanisms of illusory correlation.

person_perception	the present study is concerned with impression formation in a context in which the information about others is limited and at the same time private by its very nature. we examined the accuracy of judges' ratings of target individuals' basic personality traits, affective traits, and assertive self-presentation tactics based on the natural stream of thought of the latter. furthermore, we explored the moderating role of self-presentation in accurate evaluations of others. a group of 86 participants recorded their natural stream of thought, which then served as the basis for the judges' ratings. the participants also completed self-report measures of basic personality traits, affective traits, and assertive self-presentation tactics. the results partially confirmed that it is possible for judges to form an accurate impression of target individuals' personalities in a context in which the judges possess a small amount of relatively private information about the target individuals. it was even possible for the judges to detect the target individuals' self-presentation tactics, particularly self-promotion. in addition, individuals who use self-promotion and exemplification in a private context are often viewed differently than those who do so less often.
false_memories	empirical evidence suggests an increased production of false memories with advancing age. the activation-monitoring theory proposes that strategic monitoring processes influence the probability of false recall in the drm paradigm. in the present study, we examined the hypothesis that a low level of inhibition may impair the efficient use of monitoring processes during information retrieval and thus increase the production of false memories in aging. accordingly, we conducted a study in which older adults with low or high levels of inhibition performed a standard drm task or an inclusion drm task that disables monitoring processes. the results indicated that low inhibitory capacities were associated with fewer correct recalls and increased production of critical lures (false memories), suggesting difficulties in using monitoring processes at the time of retrieval. our findings also showed that the relationship between age and the production of critical lures in a standard drm task is mediated by inhibition. these results are interpreted as suggesting that inhibitory abilities may partly be linked to the impairment of monitoring processes in the elderly.
nonverbal_communication	there is little consensus regarding how verticality (social power, dominance, and status) is related to accurate interpersonal perception. the relation could be either positive or negative, and there could be many causal processes at play. the present article discusses the theoretical possibilities and presents a meta-analysis of this question. in studies using a standard test of interpersonal accuracy, higher socioeconomic status (ses) predicted higher accuracy defined as accurate inference about the meanings of cues; also, higher experimentally manipulated vertical position predicted higher accuracy defined as accurate recall of others' words. in addition, although personality dominance did not predict accurate inference overall, the type of personality dominance did, such that empathic/responsible dominance had a positive relation and egoistic/aggressive dominance had a negative relation to accuracy. in studies involving live interaction, higher experimentally manipulated vertical position produced lower accuracy defined as accurate inference about cues; however, methodological problems place this result in doubt.
gender_roles	this project tackles the history of the women group of the hoac (workers' brotherhood of catholic action) during franco dictatorship and the transitional period to democracy in spain through oral sources. this is a necessary methodology in order to analyze the public participation and social commitment of the catholic working women, thanks to their personal experiences as hoac members. additionally, the personal stories of the hoac women are an essential source to study not only the evolution of the organization, but also the difficulties that this group suffered considering that gender roles, as defined by the church and regime, marked and limited their field of action. finally, the present project sheds light on the individual evolution of many women who became aware of their inequality through the courses and activities organized by the hoac, thanks to which they began to participate, like their male counterparts, in the trade unions and social struggles during the last decades of franco dictatorship.
problem-solving	purpose -the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of investments in organisational resources and corporate governance features on market-based performance of islamic banks (ibs). design/methodology/approach -the required data to calculate different constituents of banks' investment strategies and governance mechanism were hand collected from 268 annual reports. different regression models were used to determine the impact of investment in human and structural capital and corporate governance features on market performance of ibs. findings -the paper finds that investments in knowledge resources (human capital, in particular) have a significantly positive impact on the market value of ibs. the results further reveal that ibs' strategy to rely on long-term human capital accumulation can be seen as idiosyncratic problem-solving knowledge capital. based on market measure, the paper finds role duality to have a significant positive impact and the size of the advisory board to have the opposite effect on market value. research limitations/implications -this study includes ibs only and ignores other islamic financial services providers such as takaful (insurance) companies. the study leaves this chasm to be filled by future researchers. practical implications -the findings may serve as a useful input for both islamic bankers and regulators to apply knowledge management in their institutions. furthermore, the dominant role of human capital also provides insight to managers with respect to business performance levers. originality/value -the main contribution of this paper is to provide insight into the islamic banking business model using a unique hand-collected data set, to identify the effect of investments in organisational resources and bank governance on market value in before, during and after financial crisis.
borderline_personality_disorder	borderline personality disorder is a complex disease model as it encompasses a diversity of pathological personality traits and psychopathological symptoms. it is not surprising, therefore, that it is often manifested by personality disorders across all three clusters and accompanied by other mental (axis i) disorders. this melange makes both psychological treatment and pharmacotherapy especially challenging, and this paper describes the case of a particularly complex case of a 33-year-old romanian patient, who has a history of severe deprivation in childhood, mood and substance use disorder in association with borderline pathology. in the course of treatment from many sources and interventions, it has become clear that dependence is a key component of the pathology and has been rewarded with a degree of success in management. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
false_memories	victims of trauma often remember their experience as being more traumatic later, compared to immediately after, the event took place. this finding the ""memory amplification effect"" is associated with increased re-experiencing symptoms. however, the effect has been found almost exclusively in field based studies. we examined whether the effect could be replicated in the laboratory. in two studies, we exposed participants to negative photographs and assessed their memory for the photographs and analogue ptsd symptoms on two occasions. in study 1, analogue symptoms at follow-up were positively associated with remembering more negative photos overtime. in study 2, we focused on ""memory amplifiers"": people whose memory of the photos amplified over time. consistent with field research, analogue re-experiencing symptoms were associated with memory amplification. overall, our findings confirm that analogue ptsd symptoms are also associated with an amplified memory for a trauma analogue.

social_cognition	some domestic animals are thought to be skilled at social communication with humans due to the process of domestication. horses, being in close relationship with humans, similar to dogs, might be skilled at communication with humans. previous studies have indicated that they are sensitive to bodily signals and the attentional state of humans; however, there are few studies that investigate communication with humans and responses to the knowledge state of humans. our first question was whether and how horses send signals to their potentially helpful but ignorant caretakers in a problem-solving situation where a food item was hidden in a bucket that was accessible only to the caretakers. we then examined whether horses alter their behaviours on the basis of the caretakers' knowledge of where the food was hidden. we found that horses communicated to their caretakers using visual and tactile signals. the signalling behaviour of the horses significantly increased in conditions where the caretakers had not seen the hiding of the food. these results suggest that horses alter their communicative behaviour towards humans in accordance with humans' knowledge state.
child_abuse	purpose: the purpose of this study was to explore the association between sexual orientation and teen pregnancy (before age 20 years) in a u.s. nationally representative cohort of young adult females aged 24-32 years. methods: a total of 5,972 participants in waves i and iv of the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health were included. self-reported sexual orientation identity was categorized as heterosexual, and three sexual minority (sm) groups: mostly heterosexual, bisexual, and lesbian (combining ""mostly homosexual"" and ""100% homosexual""). stepwise multivariate regression models were fit to compare odds of teen pregnancy and relative risk ratios of timing of teen pregnancy, between heterosexual and sm groups, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, sexual victimization history, and sexual risk behaviors. results: after adjusting for sociodemographics and sexual victimization, bisexual women had significantly higher odds than heterosexual peers of teen pregnancy (odds ratio [or] = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.05-2.75); this association was marginally significant after adjusting for sexual risk behaviors. bisexuals were also more likely to have an early (before age 18 years) teen pregnancy (or = 2.04; 95% ci = 1.17-3.56). in contrast, lesbian women were significantly less likely to have a teen pregnancy than heterosexual (or = .47; 95% ci = .23-.97), mostly heterosexual (or = .46; 95% ci = .21-.99), and bisexual (or = .29; 95% ci = .12-.71) women in final models. conclusions: expanding on extant literature, we found opposing risk patterns for teen pregnancy between bisexual and lesbian women, likely due to distinct patterns of sexual risk taking. findings suggest that sm-inclusive teen pregnancy prevention efforts tailored to meet the unique needs of sm young women, particularly bisexuals, are needed.

gender_roles	throughout history it has been seen that the concept of fatherhood has been modified due to the changes different societies have gone through, so that men 's patterns of behavior toward pregnancy, childbirth and parenting have evolved into more affective fatherhood forms and not only into those merely related to material suppliers. the aforementioned has brought about that in the case of the loss of a child in the perinatal period males experience a significant impact on psychological and psychosocial aspects that affects their quality of life. the purpose of this paper is to briefly present information on this topic as well as the clinical experience on the psychological management of parenthood and perinatal loss in men.
attention	the necessity for schools to implement human resources management (hrm) is increasingly acknowledged. specifically, hrm holds the potential of increasing student outcomes through the increased involvement, empowerment and motivation of teachers. in educational literature, however, little empirical attention is paid to the ways in which different hrm practices could be bundled into a comprehensive hrm system (content) and how hrm could best be implemented to attain positive teacher and student outcomes (process). regarding the content, and following the amo theory of performance', it is argued that hrm systems should comprise (a) ability-, (m) motivation- and (o) opportunity-enhancing hrm practices. regarding the process, and based on hrm system strength' literature, it is argued that when teachers perceive hrm as distinctive and consistent, and if they perceive consensus, this will enhance teachers' and schools' performance. by combining insights from educational studies on single hrm practices with hrm theories, this paper builds a conceptual framework which can be used to design hrm systems and to understand the way they operate.
antisocial_personality_disorder	background: individuals at high risk to develop alcoholism often manifest neurocognitive deficits as well as increased impulsivity. the goal of the present study is to elucidate reward processing deficits, externalizing disorders, and impulsivity as elicited by electrophysiological, clinical and behavioral measures in subjects at high risk for alcoholism from families densely affected by alcoholism in the context of brain maturation across age groups and gender. methods: event-related potentials (erps) and current source density (csd) during a monetary gambling task (mgt) were measured in 12-25 year old offspring (n = 1864) of families in the collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism (coga) prospective study; the high risk (hr,n = 1569) subjects were from families densely affected with alcoholism and the low risk (lr, n = 295) subjects were from community families. externalizing disorders and impulsivity scores were also compared between lr and hr groups. results: hr offspring from older (16-25 years) male and younger (12-15 years) female subgroups showed lower p3 amplitude than lr subjects. the amplitude decrement was most prominent in hr males during the loss condition. overall, p3 amplitude increase at anterior sites and decrease at posterior areas were seen in older compared to younger subjects, suggesting frontalization during brain maturation. the hr subgroups also exhibited hypofrontality manifested as weaker csd activity during both loss and gain conditions at frontal regions. further, the fir subjects had higher impulsivity scores and increased prevalence of externalizing disorders. p3 amplitudes during the gain condition were negatively correlated with impulsivity scores. conclusions: older male and younger female hr offspring, compared to their lr counterparts, manifested reward processing deficits as indexed by lower p3 amplitude and weaker csd activity, along with higher prevalence of externalizing disorders and higher impulsivity scores. significance: reward related p3 is a valuable measure reflecting neurocognitive dysfunction in subjects at risk for alcoholism, as well as to characterize reward processing and brain maturation across gender and age group.

person_perception	there has been recent interest on the impact of emotional expressions of computers on people 's decision making. however, despite a growing body of empirical work, the mechanism underlying such effects is still not clearly understood. to address this issue the paper explores two kinds of processes studied by emotion theorists in human-human interaction: inferential processes, whereby people retrieve information from emotion expressions about other 's beliefs, desires, and intentions; affective processes, whereby emotion expressions evoke emotions in others, which then influence their decisions. to tease apart these two processes as they occur in human-computer interaction, we looked at physiological measures (electrodermal activity and heart rate deceleration). we present two experiments where participants engaged in social dilemmas with embodied agents that expressed emotion. our results show, first, that people 's decisions were influenced by affective and cognitive processes and, according to the prevailing process, people behaved differently and formed contrasting subjective ratings of the agents; second we show that an individual trait known as electrodermal lability, which measures people 's physiological sensitivity, predicted the extent to which affective or inferential processes dominated the interaction. we discuss implications for the design of embodied agents and decision making systems that use emotion expression to enhance interaction between humans and computers.

eating_disorders	using a dot-probe discrimination task and a between-subjects design, we examined the time course of attentional biases (facilitated attention, delayed disengagement, and avoidance) toward thin versus fat bodies and explored the influence of body dissatisfaction (bd) on attention allocation among a sample of 163 women from the general population. three stimulus presentation times were used: 100 ms, 500 ms, and 1500 ms. we also used neutral body-shape-related stimuli as neutral stimuli related to the concept of interest to overcome the limitations of previous studies. at 500 ms, the results highlighted delayed disengagement from very thin and negatively assessed bodies among women with high bd. this mechanism, which leads to attentional focalization on bodies that are difficult to achieve, might be considered dysfunctional because it may maintain or reinforce bd. results at 100 ms and 1500 ms, as well as results for fat bodies, were not conclusive.

nonverbal_communication	social initiations make up a core deficit for children with autism spectrum disorder (asd). in particular, initiated questions during social interactions are often minimal or absent in this population. in the context of a multiple baseline design, the efficacy of using the motivational procedures of pivotal response treatment to increase social question-asking for three young children with autism was assessed. results indicated that participants initiated a greater number of targeted questions following intervention. additionally, all children exhibited increases in initiation of untargeted questions during social interaction in novel settings. furthermore, post intervention data revealed collateral gains in communication and adaptive behavior. theoretical implications of incorporating motivational strategies into intervention to improve social initiations in young children with asd are discussed.
leadership	this study investigated the processes and pathways of leadership development of teachers in different career stages as they participated in a professional development program. a multiple case study approach with conceptual frameworks of teacher leadership practice and identity was used. the leadership development process across all three teachers involved an alignment and synergy among their leadership views, leadership practices, and identity; however, the particular pathways of leadership development were unique for each teacher depending upon their personal priorities, school context and prior life experiences. this study contributes to the literature by documenting 'how' teachers develop as teacher leaders.

prenatal_development	aquaporin 5 (aqp5) is important in salivary fluid secretion, and has been found in acinar cells of salivary glands in several species. recently, studies have shown the aqp5 transcript and protein expression patterns as well as the temporal-spatial protein distribution during development of the mouse submandibular salivary gland. the aqp5 distribution pattern of the closely located sublingual gland (slg) is, however, not well known. thus, in this study, the aqp5 rna expression pattern and the temporal-spatial distribution of aqp5 protein in prenatal development and in adult mouse slg was investigated. slgs from embryonic day 14.5 (e14.5) to 18.5 and postnatal days 0 (p0), 25, and 60 were examined using real time pcr and immunohistochemistry. the aqp5 transcript was detected from e13.5 and was found to increase towards birth and in young adults. the protein was first detected in a scattered pattern in the canalicular stage and became more organized in the luminal membrane of the acinar cells towards birth. during all postnatal developmental stages studied, aqp5 was localized in the luminal and lateral membrane of acinar cells. aqp5 was also detected in the intercalated duct and additional apical membrane staining in the entire intralobular duct was found in the terminal bud stage. these results indicate that aqp5 plays a role during embryonic salivary gland development.
schizophrenia	the literature reported several factors which could impact the quality of life of caregivers and patients with psychiatric illnesses. this study aimed to determine the level of quality of life among a sample of 532 of caregivers and patients with psychiatric illness at two out-patient mental health clinics in northern jordan, and to examine the relationships of sociodemographic characteristics, stigma and caregiver perceptions of burden with quality of life. a correlational descriptive design was utilized. three self-administered questionnaires were used. results indicated that patients had low to moderate qol, and they suffered moderate to high stigma. also, family caregivers perceived low to moderate qol. patients' and family caregivers' stigma perception correlated negatively and significantly with whoqol-bref. family caregivers' burden correlated negatively and significantly with all domains of whoqol-bref, total qol-100, and self-reported general health. health care providers should assure the importance of focusing more toward minimizing stigma and promoting physical and general health to maintain a good quality of life of caregivers and patients with mental illnesses.
person_perception	according to theoretical approaches, such as the influence of presumed media influence approach, individuals' attitudes and behaviors are affected by the influences they believe the media has on others. politicians, for example, are thought to perform media relations activities because they ascribe great importance to the media. this has been tested regarding politicians' online activities using data from two surveys of members of germany 's national parliament, the bundestag ( n(t1/t2) = 194/149). it was hypothesized that parliamentarians use facebook and twitter more extensively when they believe that these social media tools have a strong political influence on the public, journalists, and other politicians. however, the results indicate that parliamentarians use facebook and twitter regardless of whether they expect it to have an impact on other people. therefore, politicians' online activities are determined by other reasons and not such strategic motives. thus, although ( or precisely because) the hypotheses are rejected, the findings are an important contribution to the research on politicians' motives for online communication.
person_perception	the goal of the current study was to examine whether differential neural attentional capture and evaluative responses for out-group homosexual relative to in-group heterosexual targets occur during social categorization. to this end, 36 heterosexual participants were presented with pictures of heterosexual and homosexual couples in a picture-viewing task that was designed to assess implicit levels of discomfort toward homosexuality and explicit evaluations of pleasantness toward the images. neural activity in the form of electroencephalogram was recorded during the presentation of the pictures, and event-related potentials resulting from these stimuli were examined. participants also completed questionnaires that assessed the degree to which they socialized with gays and lesbians. results demonstrated that relative to straight couples, larger p2 amplitude was observed in response to gay but not to lesbian couples. however, both gay and lesbian couples yielded a larger late positive potential than straight couples. moreover, the degree to which participants differentially directed early neural attention to out-group lesbian versus in-group straight couples was related to their familiarity with homosexual individuals. this work, which provides an initial understanding of the neural underpinnings of attention toward homosexual couples, suggests that differences in the processing of sexual orientation can occur as early as 200ms and may be moderated by familiarity.
person_perception	objectives: this study investigates how racial identity and phenotypicality (i.e., racial ambiguity) shape the perception of biracial individuals in both white and black perceivers. we investigated complex racial categorization and its downstream consequences, such as perceptions of discrimination. method: we manipulated racial phenotypicality (black or racially ambiguous) and racial identity (black or biracial) to test these cues' influence on black and white race categorizations in a sample of both white (n = 145) and black (n = 152) identified individuals. results: though racial identity and phenotypicality information influenced deliberate racial categorization, white and black participants used the cues in different ways. for white perceivers, racial identity and phenotypicality additively influenced black categorization. for black perceivers, however, racial identity was only used in black categorization when racial ambiguity was high. perceived discrimination was related to white (but not black) perceivers' distribution of minority resources to targets, however black categorization related to perceived discrimination for black perceivers only. conclusion: by demonstrating how black and white individuals use identity and phenotype information in race perceptions, we provide a more complete view of the complexities of racial categorization and its downstream consequences.
media_violence	purpose - this paper seeks to examine whether violence embedded in stories in ads can contribute to advertising effectiveness along the same lines as well-researched ad elements such as the celebrity endorser and the physically attractive ad model. more specifically, the paper aims to assess whether violent content in an ad story adds to excitement perceptions and to overall evaluations such as the attitude toward the ad and the attitude toward the advertised product. design/methodology/approach - the paper uses an experimental approach comprising two studies in which participants were randomly allocated to ads with different levels of violence in an ad story. findings - the main finding is that representations of real violence (as opposed to staged violence) produced higher levels of excitement, attitude toward the story, attitude toward the ad, and attitude toward the advertised product compared with no violence. such effects, however, were moderated by the level of congruence between the ad story and the advertised product; the highest response levels were obtained for ads with violent story content dealing explicitly with the advertised product. originality/value - the finding that violent stories in ads can have a positive charge is consonant with the assumption that violence is a narrative device that may heighten the excitement created by a story. it is also in accord with the observation that many consumers appear to relish stories with a violent content. yet the main finding challenges existing research on violent ads in which violence consists of an image visually co-exposed with a brand - and it questions the dominant approach in media violence research, which emphasizes the negative effects of media violence.
depression	importance: treatment augmentation is an important clinical decision in the pharmacotherapy for depression, yet few studies have examined the rates of treatment augmentation by medication class. objective: the aim of this study was to examine which initial pharmacotherapies for depression are more likely than others to result in subsequent treatment augmentation. methods: this study is a retrospective cohort analysis of administrative data of 214,705 privately insured us adults between the age of 18 and 64 years who were diagnosed with a new episode of depression in 2009. propensity score-adjusted logistic regression and cox regression were used to model the effect of the class of initial monotherapy on treatment augmentation. risk adjustors included depression severity, comorbidities, provider type, insurance, and demographic characteristics. exposure: the class of initial monotherapy and the health care provider type were the main independent variables of interest. main outcome: the outcome was the augmentation of monotherapy. results: thirty-four percent of individuals received treatment augmentation. compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy, second-generation antipsychotics as the initial treatment were associated with significant increase in the likelihood of augmentation compared with the other classes (hazards ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.51-2.68). this result was corroborated after propensity score adjustment (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% ci, 2.70-3.00) when comparing second-generation antipsychotics to the other classes of pharmacotherapy. the other significant predictor of treatment augmentation was the provider type. mental health specialists were 27% more likely to augment a treatment compared with generalists (hazards ratio, 1.27; 95% ci, 1.25-1.30). conclusions: the type of initial antidepressant therapy is associated with the chances of treatment augmentation. second-generation antipsychotics progressed to augmentation more rapidly than the other classes.
gender_roles	background: intimate partner violence (ipv) is highly prevalent and has detrimental effects on the physical and mental health of women across the world. despite emerging evidence on the impacts of cash transfers on intimate partner violence, the pathways through which reductions in violence occur remain under-explored. a randomised controlled trial of a cash and in-kind food transfer programme on the northern border of ecuador showed that transfers reduced physical or sexual violence by 30 %. this mixed methods study aimed to understand the pathways that led to this reduction. methods: we conducted a mixed methods study that combined secondary analysis from a randomised controlled trial relating to the impact of a transfer programme on ipv with in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with male and female beneficiaries. a sequential analysis strategy was followed, whereby qualitative results guided the choice of variables for the quantitative analysis and qualitative insights were used to help interpret the quantitative findings. results: we found qualitative and quantitative evidence that the intervention led to reductions in ipv through three pathways operating at the couple, household and individual level: i) reduced day-to-day conflict and stress in the couple; ii) improved household well-being and happiness; and iii) increased women 's decision making, self-confidence and freedom of movement. we found little evidence that any type of ipv increased as a result of the transfers. discussion: while cash and in-kind transfers can be important programmatic tools for decreasing ipv, the positive effects observed in this study seem to depend on circumstances that may not exist in all settings or programmes, such as the inclusion of a training component. moreover, the programme built upon rather than challenged traditional gender roles by targeting women as transfer beneficiaries and framing the intervention under the umbrella of food security and nutrition - domains traditionally ascribed to women. conclusions: transfers destined for food consumption combined with nutrition training reduced ipv among marginalised households in northern ecuador. evidence suggests that these reductions were realised by decreasing stress and conflict, improving household well-being, and enhancing women 's decision making, self-confidence and freedom of movement.
leadership	this study examines whether a mismatch between the positions that individuals hold in different status hierarchies results in symptoms of stress. prior research has focused on inconsistencies between socioeconomic status dimensions (e.g., education and income) and did not find a significant relation between status inconsistency and stress. in this paper, we build on research on role differentiation and propose to study the effect of inconsistencies between instrumental status and expressive status in group contexts. we hypothesize that people with an inconsistency between these status dimensions experience feelings of uncertainty and frustration in their interactions with others and this manifests in stress-related symptoms. we test this hypothesis with data collected in a medium-sized dutch childcare organization (n = 93). polynomial regression analysis, visualized in response surface plots, suggests that status inconsistent employees report higher levels of stress.

nonverbal_communication	previous research has documented sex differences in nonverbal communication. what has remained unknown is whether similar sex differences would exist with regard to olfactory communication via chemosignals, a relatively neglected nonverbal communication medium. because women generally have a better sense of smell and greater sensitivity to emotional signals, we hypothesized that compared with male participants and relative to a neutral control condition, female participants would emulate the fearful state of the sender producing the chemosignals. facial electromyography was used in a double-blind experiment to measure in the receiver a partial reproduction of the state of the sender, controlling for the moderating influence of the sex of the sender and receiver. the results indicated that only female participants emulated the fearful state of the sender. the present study revealed a boundary condition for effective chemosignaling by reporting behavioral evidence of sexual asymmetry in olfactory communication via chemosignals.
false_memories	this study examined whether participants could utilize re-study and perceptual elaboration to correct erroneous suggestions from their partner in the social contagion of memory paradigm. participants studied household scenes and then collaboratively recalled the scenes with a confederate who interjected erroneous items. before completing subsequent individual recall and recognition tests, participants were allowed to re-study the original items and/or to generate perceptual details of the items. across two experiments, participants who re-studied the original material were less likely to incorporate the confederate 's misleading suggestions. re-study reduced false recall and recognition and increased veridical recall and recognition (experiment 1) and the effect was especially pronounced with longer re-study episodes (experiment 2). items generated on the perceptual elaboration test offered no corrective benefit above and beyond the effects of re-study. these data demonstrate that participants can rely on self-initiated correction processes engaged during re-study to reduce socially suggested false memories.

depression	recent studies have examined non-suicidal self-injury in community and clinical samples, but there is no published research on non-suicidal self-injury in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. this lack of research is surprising, since individuals with autism spectrum disorder have high rates of risk factors for non-suicidal self-injury, including depression and poor emotion regulation skills. using an online survey, we examined non-suicidal self-injury methods, frequency, severity, functions, and initial motivations in adults with autism spectrum disorder (n=42). we also compared their non-suicidal self-injury characteristics to those of a gender-matched group of adults without autism spectrum disorder (n=42). of the participants with autism spectrum disorder, 50% reported a history of non-suicidal self-injury. this proportion is higher than non-suicidal self-injury rates previously reported for college students, adult community samples, and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, which suggests that adults with autism spectrum disorder have increased risk for engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. women with autism spectrum disorder were significantly more likely to endorse non-suicidal self-injury, relative to men with autism spectrum disorder. a history of non-suicidal self-injury was not related to current depression or emotion dysregulation for the participants with autism spectrum disorder. non-suicidal self-injury characteristics among the adults with autism spectrum disorder were similar to non-suicidal self-injury in adults without autism spectrum disorder. these preliminary findings highlight the need for increased awareness and further research about non-suicidal self-injury within autism spectrum disorder.
prosocial_behavior	background: aggression comprises a heterogeneous set of behavioral patterns that aim to harm and hurt others. empathy represents a potential mechanism that inhibits aggressive conduct and enhances prosocial behavior. nevertheless, research results on the relationship between empathy and aggression are mixed. subtypes of aggressive behavior, such as reactive and proactive aggression might be differently related to empathy. the aim of the present study was to investigate the interrelations of cognitive and affective empathy with reactive and proactive aggression. methods: we recruited a sample of 177 (33% female, m age 15.6) adolescents from socio-educational and juvenile justice institutions and a community sample of 77 (36% female, m age 13.1) adolescents from secondary schools. using bivariate correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis, we firstly investigated associations between cognitive and affective empathy and reactive and proactive aggression. subsequently, we performed cluster analysis to identify clusters of adolescents with meaningful profiles of aggressive behavior and compared derived clusters on measures of empathy. we applied the basic empathy scale and the reactive-proactive aggression questionnaire. results: bivariate analysis and hierarchical regression analysis showed that cognitive and affective empathy were negatively associated with proactive aggression, but not with reactive aggression. cluster-analysis revealed three clusters of adolescents with distinct aggression profiles: a cluster with elevated scores on reactive and proactive aggression, a clusters with high scores on reactive aggression only, and a low aggression cluster. cluster comparisons revealed that the reactive-proactive aggression cluster showed significantly lower scores on cognitive and affective empathy than both other clusters. results further indicated that within the reactive-proactive aggression cluster, girls did not differ significantly from boys in empathy. conclusions: the present study extends previously published findings, and possibly explains conflicting results in prior research. our results indicated that cognitive and affective empathy are reduced in adolescents with high levels of reactive and proactive aggression. our study may contribute to the development of tailored clinical interventions for different aggression clusters.
depression	objectiveto explore the prevalence and clinical profile of males and females who develop antidepressant treatment-emergent mania (atem). methodfrom an original sample of 754 patients with bd, we identified atem+ cases (n = 75) and atem- controls (n = 135) that met stringent criteria. we specifically examined the combinations of clinical factors that best classified males and females as atem+ cases. resultsseventy-five individuals were classified as atem+; 87% of atem events occurred during antidepressant monotherapy. regression analyses demonstrated that the presence of an alcohol and/or substance use disorder [odds ratio (or) 6.37], a history of one or more suicide attempts (or 4.19) and higher number of depressive episodes per year of illness (or 1.71) correctly classified 73% of males. in contrast, 84% of females were correctly classified on the basis of a positive history of thyroid disorder (or 3.23), a positive family history of bd i (or 2.68) and depressive onset polarity (or 2.01). conclusionusing stringent definitions of atem status to reduce the probability of inclusion of false-positive cases and false-negative controls, we identified for the first time that the risk profiles for the development of an atem differ significantly according to gender.
depression	posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is a psychiatric disorder. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) has been found to be effective for treating ptsd, but whether different frequencies have different effects remains controversial. we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to address this question. we searched the literature for studies written in english or chinese in 9 electronic databases from the databases' inception to august 1, 2016. additional articles were identified from the reference lists of identified studies and from personal reference collections. eighteen articles were included, and 11 were suitable for the meta-analysis (combined sample size was 377 (217 in active rtms groups, 160 in sham-controlled groups)). low-frequency (lf) rtms resulted in a significant reduction in the ptsd total score and the depression score (1. ptsd total score: pooled smd, 0.92; cl, 0.11-1.72; 2. depression: pooled smd, 0.54; ci, 0.08-1.00). high-frequency (hf) rtms showed the following results: 1. ptsd total score: pooled smd, 3.24; ci, 2.24-4.25; 2. re-experiencing: pooled smd, -1.77; ci, -2.49(-1.04); 3. avoidance: pooled smd, -1.57; ci, -2.50-(-0.84); 4. hyperarousal: pooled smd, -1.32; ci, -2.17-(-0.47); 5. depression: pooled smd, 1.92; ci, 0.80-3.03; and 6. anxiety: pooled smd, 2.67; ci, 1.82-3.52. therefore, both hf and lf rtms can alleviate ptsd symptoms. although the evidence is extremely limited, lf rtms can reduce overall ptsd and depression symptoms. hf rtms can improve the main and related symptoms of ptsd. however, additional research is needed to substantiate these findings.

leadership	under the increasing influence of trait-perspectives on leadership, the current study introduces a personality-based measure of charisma. in order to obtain a five-factor model (ffm) prototype for the charismatic leader, experts in the field of leadership and personality research were invited to participate in an expert panel. for each of the 30 neo pi-r facets, experts (n = 38) rated the prototypic case of a successful charismatic leader on a scale ranging between 1 (extremely low) and 9 (extremely high). based on the ffm count technique (miller, bagby, pilkonis, reynolds, & lynam, 2005), an easy-to-use count was developed in which facets that were rated as being prototypically high (>= 7) or low (<= 3) were summed together to calculate the ffm charisma score. to investigate the predictive validity of the ffm charisma count in terms of work-related outcomes, the 1994 ghent alumni sample was used in which college alumni (n = 262) were administered the neo pi-r before entering the labor market and 15 years later when their professional careers had unfolded. the results demonstrate that ffm charisma was positively related to extrinsic career outcomes 15 years later, including income, number of subordinates, and managerial level. moreover, ffm charisma was positively associated with adaptive performance, and with career roles that directly relate to charismatic leadership. it is concluded that the ffm charisma compound provides opportunities to map charismatic tendencies in a career-relevant way.

social_cognition	the current study examined the cultural factors (i.e., religious background, religious participation, parents' views of prayer, and parents' concepts of god) that contribute to children 's differentiation between the capabilities of human minds and god 's mind. protestant christian, roman catholic, muslim, and religiously non-affiliated parents and their preschool-aged children were interviewed (n=272). children of muslim parents differentiated the most between god 's mind and human minds (i.e., human minds are fallible but god 's is not), and children who had greater differentiation between god 's and humans' minds had parents who had the least anthropomorphic conceptions of god. additionally, there was a unique effect of being raised in a religiously non-affiliated home on the degree of children 's differentiation between god 's and human minds after religious context factors had been accounted for; in other words, children of religious non-affiliates differentiated between humans and god the least and their differentiation was unrelated to religious context factors. these findings delineate the ways in which religious context differences influence concepts of god from the earliest formation.
false_memories	eyewitness memory is widely believed to be unreliable because (a) high-confidence eyewitness misidentifications played a role in over 70% of the now more than 300 dna exonerations of wrongfully convicted men and women, (b) forensically relevant laboratory studies have often reported a weak relationship between eyewitness confidence and accuracy, and (c) memory is sufficiently malleable that, not infrequently, people (including eyewitnesses) can be led to remember events differently from the way the events actually happened. in light of such evidence, many researchers agree that confidence statements made by eyewitnesses in a court of law (in particular, the high confidence they often express at trial) should be discounted, if not disregarded altogether. but what about confidence statements made by eyewitnesses at the time of the initial identification (e.g., from a lineup), before there is much opportunity for memory contamination to occur? a considerable body of recent empirical work suggests that confidence may be a highly reliable indicator of accuracy at that time, which fits with longstanding theoretical models of recognition memory. counterintuitively, an appreciation of this fact could do more to protect innocent defendants from being wrongfully convicted than any other eyewitness identification reform that has been proposed to date.
problem-solving	the present paper studies the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (mrcpsp) wherein tasks have different execution modes, each implying a duration and different resource requirements. during execution, the project may encounter some problems that may cause schedule deterioration or even unfeasibility. its utmost goals are firstly the proposition of a set of new disruption measures that can be used in new objective functions, and then the resolution of a bi-objective problem minimizing the project makespan and a disruption measure. the latter is solved by an evolutionary algorithm and a new reactive multi-objective heuristic. considering that the project is in progress, the paper focuses mainly on problem feasibility, pareto front performance, and algorithm cpu time. given that the feasibility problem of static mrcpsp is np-complete (kolisch & drexl, 1997), we transform the bi-objective mrcpsp problem to a multi-objective problem by including a penalty to cope with the potential violation of non-renewable resource constraints, and enlarge the search space. we show that schedule adjustment is necessary for the problem solving process. a diverse set of non-time-consuming operators is also included in the algorithm.

child_abuse	non-accidental trauma is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. given the vulnerable state of the child, the radiologist can often provide valuable diagnostic information in the setting of suspected abuse. this review focuses on common findings of abusive trauma and serves as a guide to aid in clinical decision-making for providers of emergency medicine and pediatrics. amid this discussion is an assessment of modern controversies regarding reported mimicking pathologies, recapitulation of the current state of evidence with respect to radiologic findings of abuse, and examination of the contribution that spine imaging may add to the diagnosis of possible abusive head trauma in the acutely injured child. recommendations for avoiding pitfalls regarding the dating of intracranial injuries are discussed, and illustrated depictions of perpetrator-induced pathology are provided to aid in the understanding of these injuries. through the use of the appropriate approach to imaging and evidence-based guidelines regarding radiologic findings, the role of radiology is to provide fundamental clues to diagnose and prevent recurrence of abusive injury in patients who cannot speak for themselves.
borderline_personality_disorder	limited research has examined differences in well-established suicide correlates between individuals with various histories of suicidality within the ideation to action framework. we hypothesized that individuals without a history of elevated suicidality would exhibit lowest levels of suicide correlates (perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, emotion dysregulation, depressive symptoms), and group differences would not be present between those with a history of suicidal ideation relative to those with a history of suicide attempts on variables not theorized to contribute to the capability for suicide. lastly, we hypothesized that those with a prior history of suicide attempt(s) would exhibit higher levels of lifetime painful and provocative events and fearlessness about death relative to those with a history of ideation only. a community sample of adults (n=378) recruited in part on the basis of a history of suicidality completed self-report questionnaires online. the results were largely consistent with our hypotheses. however, there were no differences in fearlessness about death between those with a history of suicidal ideation and those with a history of attempts. many variables considered robust correlates of suicide may only directly relate to suicidal ideation rather than suicide attempts, thereby limiting their utility in understanding the transition from ideation to action.

person_perception	this research explored competing predictions for the relation between uncertainty and interpersonal attraction. two studies investigated whether uncertainty regarding another person 's interest is associated with an increase or decrease in attraction. study 1 revealed that when participants evaluated people whose expressed attraction was either certain or uncertain, participants experienced more liking for those who were associated with certainty. in study 2, compared to a control condition, uncertainty produced more attraction but the greater attraction was mediated by a desire to reduce uncertainty. we conclude by proposing an explanation for why different research paradigms have produced different conclusions regarding uncertainty and the situations necessary for uncertainty to produce interpersonal attraction.
media_violence	the purpose of this paper is to examine the relation of the frequency of watching television and playing video games, and the presence of violent contents in them, on the one hand, and direct (physical and verbal) and indirect peer aggression among students on the other hand the respondents were students (n = 501; 51.9% male and 49.1% female) of the seventh and eighth forms of elementary schools in urban and rural areas, of an average age of 13.6. the research was conducted in february 2010 using instruments for the assessment of students' media habits and direct & indirect aggression scales (bjorkqvist et al. 1992). the results of the correlation and regression analyses show that students who watch television more often are more likely to manifest physical and indirect violence towards their peers (r=0.15, p < 0.01 and r=0.12, p < 0.01), and those who more frequently watch violent programmes are more likely to manifest all three forms of violent behaviour towards other students (r=0.16, p < 0.01; r=0.24, p < 0.01; r=0.19, p < 0.01). the watching frequency and the amount of violent content are among the predictors of direct (physical and verbal) as well as indirect violent behaviour against peers. students who more frequently play computer or video games also more frequently manifest physical and verbal violence against their peers (r=0.28, p < 0.01 and r=0.09, p < 0.05). students who play games involving a significant amount of violence often manifest all three forms of violent behaviour against their peers (r=0.30, p < 0.01, r=0.24, p < 0.01; r=0.13, p < 0.01). the frequency of playing and the amount of violence in games are predictors of physical and verbal violence, while the relation of playing games with indirect violence (lid not appear to be significant. the results of this and other recent research suggest that exposure to violence in the media increases the risk of aggressive and violent peer behaviour in the real world. it must also be stressed that what might at first glance appear as minor statistical effects may in fact, have serious practical consequences, since a large part of the population is exposed to these risk factors.
media_violence	the objective of this article is to consider and discuss existing research and theory concerning copycat problem behaviors and copycat offending and how this may be applicable to populations of firesetting children and adolescents. the primary databases used to search for literature were psychinfo, medline, and eric. google scholar was used as an additional internet search engine. while the primary focus was on literature published since 1990, earlier literature considered to be important was also included. qualitative and quantitative studies suggest that consumption of violent media affects aggressive behaviors and supports the existence of a copycat effect within some offending populations. existing literature suggests that processes such as desensitization, observational learning, priming, and alteration of scripts are involved in copycat behaviors and are mediated by individual, environmental, and media factors. while literature concerning firesetters has largely overlooked the possibility of a copycat effect, given their young age, and the often antisocial nature and individual and environmental problems associated with firesetters, they may be a population particularly vulnerable to such an effect. there is a need for consideration of the potential role of the media in copycat behaviors and for care to be taken in the way that the media reports events.
attention	special attention is required to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous in treated wastewaters. although, there are a wide range of techniques commercially available for nutrient up-take, these processes entail high investment and operational costs. in the other hand, microalgae growth can simultaneously remove inorganic constituents of wastewater and produce energy rich biomass. among all the cultivation technologies, high rate algae ponds (hraps), are accepted as the most appropriate system. however, the optimization of the operation that maximizes the productivity, nutrient removal and lipid content in the biomass generated has not been established. in this study, the effect of two levels of depth and the addition of co2 were evaluated. batch essays were used for the calculation of the kinetic parameters of microbial growth that determine the optimum conditions for continuous operation. nutrient removal and lipid content of the biomass generated were analyzed. the best conditions were found at depth of 03 m with co2 addition (biomass productivity of 26.2 g tssm-2 d(-1) and a lipid productivity of 6.0 g lipids m(-2) d(-1)) in continuous mode. the concentration of nutrients was in all cases below discharge limits established by the most restrictive regulation for wastewater discharge.

prosocial_behavior	the concept of social exclusion has recently gained more attention in the context of online social interactions. however, there is only little data regarding the impact of virtual social exclusion on subsequent real-life social behaviors. thus, this study set out to examine a virtual version of the common social exclusion scenario, the cyberball-paradigm (williams & jarvis, 2006), and test for behavioral consequences in a sample of 45 students. both the virtual characters' agency and the experience of social presence were controlled for. findings indicate that ostracized individuals show less prosocial behavior in a helping task and keep more seating distance to a confederate than included participants. also, virtual social exclusion constitutes a significant threat to fundamental human needs like social control, selfesteem and belonging and causes an increase in uncertainty, sadness and anger as well as a decrease in happiness. avatars and agents seemed to equally endanger human needs and lead to the same seating distance. however, avatar excluded persons also had higher levels of sadness and were less helpful than avatar included persons, who in turn were more confident. thus, while the media equation concept (nass & moon, 2000) holds true for the immediate reaction to social exclusion (i.e., avatars and agents equally threaten fundamental needs), the delayed emotional and behavioral reactions differ for avatars and agents, possibly because they are preceded by cognitive evaluation (c.f.,temporal need-threat model; williams, 2009). implications of these findings for everyday online social interactions (i.e., in mmorpg5) are discussed.

child_abuse	objective spontaneous subaponeurotic fluid collection (ssfc) is an uncommon and newly described entity of unknown etiology, observed in infants less than 1 year of age. the authors report on series of infants who presented to the hospital for sick children (hsc) with ssfc, focusing on the natural history of this condition. methods data from the hospital for sick children were retrospectively reviewed for the period between january 2004 and june 2015. patient age and sex, birth history, medical history, laboratory findings, and symptoms were reviewed. ssfc location, imaging characteristics, management, and outcome were also analyzed. a medline and embase literature search was performed on the condition, yielding previously reported cases of ssfc in the english language. results nine cases involving patients who presented with ssfc during the study period were identified. the patients were 4 male and 5 female infants (age range 5 weeks to 11 months). all cases of ssfc developed spontaneously over a period of days, and the infants had no history of injuries, trauma, or hair manipulation in the immediate period preceding the development of the subgaleal collections. six patients underwent remote forceps- or vacuum-assisted instrumented births, although none of the patients developed scalp collections or skin discoloration immediately after birth. all of the cases were managed conservatively on an outpatient (6 cases) or inpatient (3 cases) basis. in 1 case, the size of the fluid collection fluctuated over 4 months, but in all of the cases, the collections resolved spontaneously without structural or infectious complications. conclusions this is the largest series describing ssfc to date and summarizes 9 cases managed at a large academic neurosurgical center. although the specific pathophysiology of ssfc remains unknown, in some cases the condition may be associated with a remote history of instrumented delivery. ssfc occurs spontaneously without immediate preceding trauma, and an extensive hematology or child abuse workup is not necessary. a conservative approach with outpatient follow-up is advocated.
social_cognition	the aim of this study was to examine differences in the neural processing of social information about kin and friends at different levels of closeness and social network level. twenty-five female participants engaged in a cognitive social task involving different individuals in their social network while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to detect bold (blood oxygen level dependent) signals changes. greater levels of activation occurred in several regions of the brain previously associated with social cognition when thinking about friends than when thinking about kin, including the posterior cingulate cortex (pcc) and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc). linear parametric analyses across network layers further showed that, when it came to thinking about friends, activation increased in the vmpfc, lingual gyrus, and sensorimotor cortex as individuals thought about friends at closer layers of the network. these findings suggest that maintaining friendships may be more cognitively exacting than maintaining kin relationships.
attention	we investigated whether attachment quality is related to infant-mother dyadic patterns in monitoring animated social situations. sixty 12-month-old infants and their mothers participated in an eye-tracking study in which they watched abstractly depicted distress interactions involving the separation of a baby and a parent character followed by reunion or further separation of the two characters. we measured infants' and their mothers' relative fixation duration to the two characters in the animations. we found that infant attachment disorganization moderated the correspondence between the monitoring patterns of infant-mother dyads during the final part of the animations resulting in reunion or separation. organized infants and their mothers showed complementary monitoring patterns: the more the mothers focused their attention on the baby character, the more the infants focused their attention on the parent character, and vice versa. disorganized infant-mother dyads showed the opposite pattern although the correlation was nonsignificant: mothers and their infants focused on the same character. the attachment-related differences in the nature of the synchrony in the attentional processes of infants and their mothers suggest that by 12months the dyads' representations of social situations reflect their shared social-emotional experiences.
gender_roles	female-dominated occupations tend to be lower paying, but also less time-consuming and more flexible than male-dominated occupations. women may pursue occupations with short, flexible workweeks because they expect to be primary caretakers of future children. in a pie-registered study we investigated how subtle reminders of child-raising intentions shape college students' occupational interests. we hypothesized that priming women with child-raising intentions reminds them of future caregiving responsibilities and decreases their interest in high-hour, low-flexibility (hh/lf) occupations. however, women reported less interest than men in hh/lf careers regardless of prime (intentions to raise kids versus have pets). reminding men of child-raising intentions decreased their interest in family-unfriendly hh/lf occupations, particularly among men low in hostile sexism. the results suggest that, whereas women may link child-raising intentions to occupational pursuits regardless of whether such intentions are made salient, reminders of child-raising intentions raise the awareness of nonsexist men of their future family responsibilities.

social_cognition	background & objective: rehabilitation focuses brain-behavior relationship which highlights interaction between psychological and neurobiological factors for better patient care. there is a missing link in the literature about socio-cognitive aspects of frontal lobe epilepsy. our objective was to examine prefrontal cortical functioning (pcf) and empathic abilities in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (fle). further, we analyzed whether any relationship between components of dispositional empathy and pcf exists in patients with fle. methods: the study was designed in an experimental paradigm. sixty patients with fle were recruited from sheikh zayed and jinnah hospital, pakistan. sixty healthy individuals in response to an advertisement took part in the study as control subjects. participants completed interpersonal reactivity index. following they performed clock drawing test and word-color identification task switching experiment. result: patients with fle demonstrated weaker pcf (i.e., cognitive flexibility and executive function) as compared to healthy control subjects. patients with fle scored lesser on cognitive empathy as compared to healthy control subjects. on contrary, there was no significant difference between patient and control group on affective empathy. cognitive not affective empathy was potential predictor of pcf. conclusion: cognitive empathy is a significant marker of prefrontal cortical functioning (pcf) in fle. higher cognitive empathy would lead to efficient pcf.
borderline_personality_disorder	background: co-occurring borderline personality disorder (bpd) features have a marked impact on treatment of patients with mood disorders. overall, high neuroticism, childhood traumatic experiences (tes) and insecure attachment are plausible aetiological factors for bpd. however, their relationship with bpd features specifically among patients with mood disorders remains unclear. we investigated these relationships among unipolar and bipolar mood disorder patients. methods: as part of the helsinki university psychiatric consortium study, the mclean screening instrument (msi), the experiences in close relationships-revised (ecr-r), the short five (s5) and the trauma and distress scale (tads) were filled in by patients with mood disorders (n=282) in psychiatric care. correlation coefficients between total scores of scales and their dimensions were estimated, and multivariate regression (mra) and mediation analyses were conducted. results: spearman 's correlations were strong (rho=0.58; p < 0.001) between total scores of msi and s5 neuroticism and moderate (rho=0.42; p < 0.001) between msi and tads as well as between msi and ecr-r attachment anxiety. in mra, young age, s5 neuroticism and tads predicted scores of msi (p < 0.001). ecr-r attachment anxiety mediated 33% (ci=17-53%) of the relationships between tads and msi. limitations: cross-sectional questionnaire study. conclusions: we found moderately strong correlations between self-reported bpd features and concurrent high neuroticism, reported childhood traumatic experiences and attachment anxiety also among patients with mood disorders. independent predictors for bpd features include young age, frequency of childhood traumatic experiences and high neuroticism. insecure attachment may partially mediate the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and borderline features among mood disorder patients.
social_cognition	this study adopted a social-ecological perspective to exploring perpetration of serious physical violence against others among arab-palestinian adolescents. a total of 3178 adolescents (aged 13-18) completed anonymous, structured, self-report questionnaire, which included selected items from several instruments that measured variables relating to the constructs examined in the study. we explored the association of individual characteristics (age, gender, normative beliefs about violence, and perceived ethnic discrimination), familial characteristics (parent-adolescent communication and socioeconomic status), and contextual characteristics (exposure to community violence in the neighborhood) with perpetration of serious physical violence against others. a moderation-mediation model was tested, and 28.4% of the adolescents reported that they had perpetrated serious physical violence against others at least once during the month preceding the study. the findings also show that exposure of youth to violence in their neighborhood correlated significantly and positively with their perpetration of serious physical violence against others. a similar trend was revealed with respect to personal perceptions of ethnic discrimination. these correlations were mediated by the adolescents' normative beliefs about violence. furthermore, the correlation of direct exposure to violence in the neighborhood and normative beliefs about violence with perpetration of serious physical violence against others was stronger among adolescents who have poor communication with their parents than among those who have strong parental communication.

person_perception	individuals often hold ambivalent attitudes (i.e., positive and negative attitudes at the same time) toward groups and social categories. the aim of the present research was to examine the differential effects of affective and cognitive dimensions of ambivalence on the (amplification of) responses towards a minority group. we asked 188 students from the university of perugia to read a short description of a fictitious group of immigrants. after expressing their affective and cognitive attitudes toward the target group, participants received positive, negative, or no supplementary information about this group. discrimination was assessed by asking participants to allocate to the target group a percentage of a financial support fund for poor people (both italian and immigrant) living in their regional area. as expected, we found that only affective ambivalence amplified either negative or positive responses toward the group.
antisocial_personality_disorder	human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection and methamphetamine (ma) dependence are associated with neural injury preferentially involving frontostriatal circuits. little is known, however, about how these commonly comorbid conditions impact behavioral presentations typically associated with frontal systems dysfunction. our sample comprised 47 hiv-uninfected/ma-nondependent; 25 hiv-uninfected/ma-dependent; 36 hiv-infected/ma-nondependent; and 28 hiv-infected/ma-dependent subjects. participants completed self-report measures of ""frontal systems"" behaviors, including impulsivity/disinhibition, sensation-seeking, and apathy. they also underwent comprehensive neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments that allowed for detailed characterization of neurocognitive deficits and comorbid/premorbid conditions, including lifetime mood and substance use disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounds (i.e., demographics and comorbid/premorbid conditions) showed that ma dependence was independently associated with increased impulsivity/disinhibition, sensation-seeking and apathy, and hiv infection with greater apathy. however, we did not see synergistic/additive effects of hiv and ma on frontal systems behaviors. global neurocognitive impairment was relatively independent of the frontal systems behaviors, which is consistent with the view that these constructs may have relatively separable biopsychosocial underpinnings. future research should explore whether both neurocognitive impairment and frontal systems behaviors may independently contribute to everyday functioning outcomes relevant to hiv and ma.

social_cognition	objective: there is increasing recognition that socio-cognitive skills, such as moral reasoning (mr), are affected in a wide range of developmental and neuropsychological conditions. however, the lack of appropriate measures available to neuropsychologists poses a challenge for the direct assessment of these skills. this study sought to explore age-related changes in mr using an innovative visual tool and examine the developmental sensitivity of the task. method: to address some of the methodological limitations of traditional measures of mr, a novel, visual task, the socio-moral reasoning aptitude level (so-moral), was used to evaluate mr in 216 healthy participants aged 6-20years. results: the findings show a linear increase in mr from childhood to late adolescence with significant group differences between childhood (6-8years) and preadolescence (9-11years), and between early adolescence (12-14years) and middle adolescence (15-17years). conclusions: interpreted in light of current brain development research, the results highlight age-related changes in mr that offer insight into typical mr development and opportunities for comparisons with clinical populations. the findings also provide evidence of the potential of the so-moral as a developmentally appropriate measure of mr throughout childhood and adolescence.
false_memories	in 2 experiments, younger and older adults witnessed a simulated robbery, received misleading information about the event, and then were interviewed with the cognitive interview about their memory for the robbery. in both experiments, older adults were disproportionately more confident than younger adults in the accuracy of incorrect information that they recalled than in the accuracy of correct information. critically, this age-related increase in high-confidence errors occurred even in comparison with younger adults who were matched with older adults on the overall amount and accuracy of the information remembered about the robbery. in addition, experiment 2 showed that retrieval warnings to disregard the misinformation were just as effective in older adults as compared with younger adults at reducing the reporting of misleading information. finally, both experiments showed that across the multiple retrieval stages of the cognitive interview, the final retrieval stage is roughly half as effective for older adults relative to younger adults at eliciting previously unreported information. these results indicate that investigators have much less to gain from older adults than they do from younger adults with repeated inquiries (during the same session) about a witnessed event.
leadership	the conventional wisdom in brazil is that foreign policy is a policy of state and, as such, not part of the daily political debate. the result is an understanding that foreign policy is largely driven by the foreign ministry, with the president generally only taking a role when needed to advance a particular initiative through presidential diplomacy. we challenge these assumptions, arguing that the engagement and authority of the president are the essential factors in bringing about not only substantive strategic change in brazilian foreign policy, but also alterations in the policy process that have democratized foreign policy and moved it from a policy of state to another area of public policy. to do this, we draw on and deepen sergio danese 's theory of presidential diplomacy and map out major strategic changes in post-authoritarian brazil 's foreign policy. we find that the major changes that have taken place were initiated by the truncated fernando collor presidency and then deepened and amplified by the highly internationally engaged presidencies of fernando henrique cardoso and lula. by contrast, the presidencies of itamar franco and dilma rousseff emerge as instances of inertial continuity lacking in dynamism and innovation.
seasonal_affective_disorder	in this qualitative phenomenological study we analyze seasonal affective disorder (sad) in adolescents. since the end of 2014 winter, a great number of adolescents diagnosed of winter depression were attended in a community mental health center in madrid (spain). another group of adolescents was attended in autumn. symptoms were always serious. specially, women deliberately injured themselves with no suicidal purpose. symptoms non described in sad appeared: intrusive flood of ruminative thoughts, marked variability in symptoms' intensity during irregular periods and self-injuries. self-injuries behaved as a distracting purpose in order to interrupt ruminative thought. we call this process cognitive-emotional maelstrom. the chance that this phenomenon could belong to a sad subtype that concerns hot climate 's countries is not ruled out. the approval that sad may concern to warmer countries could help to diagnosis and treatment.
nonverbal_communication	objective: to investigate the effectiveness of the micro expression training tool (mett) and the subtle expression training tool (sett) to help improve the non-verbal communication skills of medical students. methods: in a randomized controlled trial, all participants were randomly allocated to either a training (n = 41) or control group (n = 41) and were pre-tested before education with mett and sett at baseline. then, training students took second tests after a 1-h class about interpreting micro and subtle expressions and control students took the second tests without the class. results: mett pre-test scores were positively related with female gender, agreeableness, whereas sett pre-test scores were negatively related with age and positively related with female gender. mean mett score increases of 29.3% and mean sett score increases of 36.2% were observed after training, whereas the control group achieved only a mean mett score increase of 11.0% at second testing. increases in both test scores in the training group were significantly higher than in the control group. conclusion: mett and sett are effective, simple tools for improving the micro-and subtle-expression reading skills of medical students. practice implications: mett and sett can be effective for improving the non-verbal communication skills of medical students.

borderline_personality_disorder	internet gaming addiction (iga) is becoming a common and widespread mental health concern. although iga induces a variety of negative psychosocial consequences, it is yet ambiguous whether the brain addicted to internet gaming is considered to be in a pathological state. we investigated iga-induced abnormalities of the brain specifically from the network perspective and qualitatively assessed whether the internet gaming-addicted brain is in a state similar to the pathological brain. topological properties of brain functional networks were examined by applying a graph-theoretical approach to analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during a resting state in 19 iga adolescents and 20 age-matched healthy controls. we compared functional distance-based measures, global and local efficiency of resting state brain functional networks between the two groups to assess how the iga subjects' brain was topologically altered from the controls' brain. the iga subjects had severer impulsiveness and their brain functional networks showed higher global efficiency and lower local efficiency relative to the controls. these topological differences suggest that iga induced brain functional networks to shift toward the random topological architecture, as exhibited in other pathological states. furthermore, for the iga subjects, the topological alterations were specifically attributable to interregional connections incident on the frontal region, and the degree of impulsiveness was associated with the topological alterations over the frontolimbic connections. the current findings lend support to the proposition that the internet gaming-addicted brain could be in the state similar to pathological states in terms of topological characteristics of brain functional networks.
borderline_personality_disorder	to many observers, reactive violence can present as a puzzling phenomenon. offenders often report experiencing cognitive distortions during the event. offenders may have no history of violence, yet crime scenes are often described as horrific. when violence manifests, the motive often seems vastly disproportionate to any precipitating factor. reactive violence is fueled by intense emotions, although they may not be evident before or during the event. how best to reconcile these findings and provide a parsimonious and coherent explanation? psychoanalytic theory can illuminate the psychological processes that may underlie reactive violence. in particular, how narcissistic injury can generate impulsive aggression in vulnerable individuals. i draw upon stanley kubrick 's film the shining to study the phenomenon. while the shining is a fictional horror film in which a family is tormented by supernatural forces, i argue that the horror does not emanate from paranormal sources; rather, it is found within human psychology. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
media_violence	adolescents spend a significant part of their leisure time watching tv programs and movies that portray violence. it is unknown, however, how the extent of violent media use and the severity of aggression displayed affect adolescents' brain function. we investigated skin conductance responses, brain activation and functional brain connectivity to media violence in healthy adolescents. in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, subjects repeatedly viewed normed videos that displayed different degrees of aggressive behavior. we found a downward linear adaptation in skin conductance responses with increasing aggression and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. our results further revealed adaptation in a fronto-parietal network including the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lofc), right precuneus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules, again showing downward linear adaptations and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. granger causality mapping analyses revealed attenuation in the left lofc, indicating that activation during viewing aggressive media is driven by input from parietal regions that decreased over time, for more aggressive videos. we conclude that aggressive media activates an emotion-attention network that has the capability to blunt emotional responses through reduced attention with repeated viewing of aggressive media contents, which may restrict the linking of the consequences of aggression with an emotional response, and therefore potentially promotes aggressive attitudes and behavior.
eating_disorders	background: treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms (nps) in dementia is insufficient. antipsychotics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used generating symptomatic improvements in behavior and cognition, but few studies have investigated their effect on alzheimer 's disease (ad) biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). objective: this is a secondary analysis based on an earlier clinical trial comparing the treatment effects on nps. the aim of this study was to examine whether treatment with risperidone and galantamine affect levels of the biomarkers t-tau, p-tau, a beta(1-42), and a beta(42/40)-ratio in csf. the secondary aim was to test if baseline levels of these biomarkers are associated with the clinical course of nps. methods: 83 patients (mean + sd 77.9.6 +/- 7.7 years) with dementia and nps were randomized to galantamine (n = 44) or risperidone (n = 39) treatment. csf samples were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks. results: changes in levels of biomarkers between the two treatment groups did not differ significantly. low baseline levels of a beta(1-42) was significantly associated with reduction of irritability at follow up. low baseline levels of a beta(1-42), a beta(42/40), and p-tau were significant correlates of reduction in appetite and eating disorders. csf a beta(1-42) levels in patients treated with risperidone were significantly decreased at follow up, showing an 8% (40 pg/ml) reduction as compared with baseline (p = 0.03). conclusions: our results suggest that risperidone may affect the csf profile of ad biomarkers indicating more amyloid pathology. treatment with galantamine did not affect the csf biomarkers in any direction. the adcsf biomarkers displayed correlations with specific nps suggesting potential research questions to be pursued.
false_memories	studies suggest that age differences in false memories may be related to deficits in frontal lobe functioning (flf; butler, mcdaniel, dornburg, price, & roediger, 2004, psychonomic bulletin & review, 11, 921). in addition, research has demonstrated that item-specific encoding can reduce false memories in younger adults (arndt & reder, 2003, journal of experimental psychology: learning, memory, and cognition, 28, 830). in the present study we examined whether younger and older adults who perform poorly on tests designed to assess frontal function would be less likely to benefit from item-specific encoding in a false memory paradigm. in three experiments, participants studied categorized word or picture lists. encoding manipulations were designed to emphasize either item-specific or relational processing. younger adults and high flf older adults showed a reduction in false memories when item-specific processing was implemented. however, low flf older adults showed a reduction in false memories only when relational processing was impoverished. results suggest that frontal function directly influences the engagement in distinctive encoding processes.
eating_disorders	this study investigated the direct and indirect effects of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors in predicting disordered eating behaviors in girls with overweight/obesity. a total of 135 hispanic and african american girls ((x) over bar (age) = 11.13 +/- 1.54 years) completed surveys assessing the desire to be thinner, peer weight-related teasing, disordered eating behaviors, and demographic characteristics. percent body fat was assessed. structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the influence of the desire to be thinner and peer weight-related teasing on percent body fat and disordered eating behaviors. results indicated that percent body fat was directly related to the desire to be thinner (p < .01) and peer weight-related teasing (p < .01), and was indirectly related to disordered eating through its relationship with peer teasing (p < .05). these findings may be useful in guiding the design of interventions preventing the development of disordered eating behaviors in minority girls.
borderline_personality_disorder	the primary goals of compulsory, inpatient, psychiatric treatment are to decrease dangerous behaviors and help improve functioning so that a safe discharge to a less restrictive environment can be obtained. this study examined the aggression rates, levels of functioning, and treatment adherence for persons treated for schizophrenia (n = 506) compared with persons treated for borderline personality disorder (bpd) (n = 98) in an inpatient psychiatric facility. over half of persons engaged in at least one incident of aggressive behavior during hospitalization. differences in the types of aggression and functional deficits between these two clinical sub-groups were found. in addition, overall impairment increased the likelihood of aggressive behavior for persons diagnosed with schizophrenia, whereas irritability and social dependence increased the risk of aggression for persons diagnosed with bpd. treatment interventions that target the improvement of these deficits may help reduce the intensity and severity of aggressive behaviors and help improve functioning and discharge readiness.
person_perception	do therapists and potential clients similarly evaluate offices of practicing clinicians? furnishings in a therapist 's office can create a welcoming environment, yet little research examines perceptions of such furnishings, leading to the focus of this research. in a previous study with 30 color photographs of psychotherapists' offices, students favored clinical settings that were soft, personalized, and orderly (nasar & devlin, 2011). using the same 30 photographs, the present studies had 32 licensed psychotherapists evaluate the quality of care, comfort in the setting, and therapist qualities they expected clients to experience in each office. the judgments that therapists thought clients would make had high correlations with the earlier judgments of students; each group 's composite evaluation improved significantly as the office became softer and more orderly. this brief report concludes by recommending the features likely to create a welcoming therapeutic office.
problem-solving	objective: to perform a systematic review and meta analysis of studies investigating neurocognition in euthymic youths with bipolar disorder (bd) compared to healthy controls (hcs). method: a systematic literature search was conducted in the pubmed/medline, psycinfo, and embase databases from inception up until march 23, 2016, for original peer-reviewed articles that investigated neurocognition in euthymic youths with bd compared to hcs. effect sizes (es) for individual tests were extracted. in addition, results were grouped according to cognitive domain. this review complied with the prisma statement guidelines. results: a total of 24 studies met inclusion criteria (n = 1,146; 510 with bd). overall, euthymic youths with bd were significantly impaired in verbal learning, verbal memory, working memory, visual learning, and visual memory, with moderate to large ess (hedge 's g 0.76-0.99); significant impairments were not observed for attention/vigilance, reasoning and problem solving, and/or processing speed. heterogeneity was moderate to large (i-2 >= 50%) for most es estimates. differences in the definition of euthymia across studies explained the heterogeneity in the es estimate for verbal learning and memory. we also found evidence for other potential sources of heterogeneity in several es estimates including co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and anxiety disorders, and the use of medications. in addition, the use of different neuropsychological tests appeared to contribute to heterogeneity of some estimates (e.g., attention/vigilance domain). conclusion: euthymic youths with bd exhibit significant cognitive dysfunction encompassing verbal learning and memory, working memory, and/or visual learning and memory domains. these data indicate that for a subset of individuals with bd, neurodevelopmental factors may contribute to cognitive dysfunction.
prosocial_behavior	purpose: youth sport has the potential to be one of the healthiest and most beneficial activities in which children can partake. participation in a combination of adult-led and peer-led sport structures appears to lead to favorable outcomes such as enhanced physical fitness, as well as social and emotional development. the purpose of the present study was to examine the subjective and objective experiences of 27 recreational male soccer players aged 10 to 12 years old (m=10.11 years, sd=0.32) across adult-led and peer-led sport structures. method: direct video observation and experience-rating scales were utilized in an effort to shed light on the impact of adult-led and peer-led sport structures on the same athletes. results: in the adult-led structures, youth experienced high levels of effort and concentration while spending more time physically or mentally engaged. meanwhile, youth experienced high rates of prosocial behaviors, sport-related communication, and general communication during the peer-led structures. conclusions: the results of the present study indicate that rather than one approach being superior to the other, both adult- and peer-led sport structures have the potential to yield unique benefits toward children 's positive experiences in sport.
social_cognition	the human left inferior parietal lobule (lipl) plays a pivotal role in many cognitive functions and is an important node in the default mode network (dmn). although many previous studies have proposed different parcellation schemes for the lipl, the detailed functional organization of the lipl and the exact correspondence between the dmn and lipl subregions remain unclear. mounting evidence indicates that spontaneous fluctuations in the brain are strongly associated with cognitive performance at the behavioral level. however, whether a consistent functional topographic organization of the lipl during rest and under task can be revealed remains unknown. here, they used resting- state functional connectivity (rsfc) and task- related coactivation patterns separately to parcellate the lipl and identified seven subregions. four subregions were located in the supramarginal gyrus (smg) and three subregions were located in the angular gyrus (ag). the subregion- specific networks and functional characterization revealed that the four anterior subregions were found to be primarily involved in sensorimotor processing, movement imagination and inhibitory control, audition perception and speech processing, and social cognition, whereas the three posterior subregions were mainly involved in episodic memory, semantic processing, and spatial cognition. the results revealed a detailed functional organization of the lipl and suggested that the lipl is a functionally heterogeneous area. in addition, the present study demonstrated that the functional architecture of the lipl during rest corresponds with that found in task processing.

child_abuse	there is a growing interest in english-speaking jurisdictions, including australia, north america, canada, the united kingdom and new zealand, about the prevention of sexual abuse perpetrated by children against other children. the aim of this review was to identify opportunities for research, policy and practice which could enhance the prevention agenda relating to the perpetration of sexual abuse by children through conducting a critical interpretive synthesis. eleven electronic databases were searched in the period from 22 april to 23 may 2013 and included: socindex, social services abstracts, applied social sciences index and abstracts, family and society studies worldwide, project muse, psychinfo, family and society plus, jstor, expanded academic asap, web of science and google scholar. key individual journals were also searched, including child abuse and neglect and the journal of interpersonal violence, as well as the grey literature. the search was guided by the research question: how could the prevention agenda relating to sexual abuse perpetrated by children be enhanced? the systematic literature search yielded 3323 titles, and 34 of these papers were included in the final synthesis. the authors identified five domains operating in the evidence base: characteristics, causes, communications, interventions and treatments. a synthesising construct emerged from the review: prevention-enhancing interactions. this construct referred to the potential for enhancing the prevention agenda which exists as the evidence domains interact with one another, and with the public health model of prevention. the authors consider this review to be a timely contribution to the current agenda pertaining to sexual abuse perpetrated by children. it provides researchers, policy makers and practitioners in the field with an evidence-informed conceptualisation of opportunities for enhancing prevention work.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the research domain criteria (rdoc) address three types of aggression: frustrative non-reward, defensive aggression and offensive/proactive aggression. this review sought to present the evidence for genetic underpinnings of aggression and to determine to what degree prior studies have examined phenotypes that fit into the rdoc framework. although the constructs of defensive and offensive aggression have been widely used in the animal genetics literature, the human literature is mostly agnostic with regard to all the rdoc constructs. we know from twin studies that about half the variance in behavior may be explained by genetic risk factors. this is true for both dimensional, trait-like, measures of aggression and categorical definitions of psychopathology. the non-shared environment seems to have a moderate influence with the effects of shared environment being unclear. human molecular genetic studies of aggression are in an early stage. the most promising candidates are in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems along with hormonal regulators. genome-wide association studies have not yet achieved genome-wide significance, but current samples are too small to detect variants having the small effects one would expect for a complex disorder. the strongest molecular evidence for a genetic basis for aggression comes from animal models comparing aggressive and non-aggressive strains or documenting the effects of gene knockouts. although we have learned much from these prior studies, future studies should improve the measurement of aggression by using a systematic method of measurement such as that proposed by the rdoc initiative.

child_abuse	the concepts developed by ian hacking during his lectures at the collsge de france (2000-2006) have provided an important contribution to the debates within the field of philosophy of psychiatry. professor at the chair of philosophy and history of scientific concepts after michel foucault, hacking is the author of a reflection on the classification of mental disorders, which arises from the problem of the natural kinds. in order to explain the case studies developed in hacking 's paris lectures, we first go back to the definition of a series of concepts, then we discuss the status of his scientific metaphors. finally we analyze the relationship between the notions, respectively, of ""transient mental illness"" and ""culture-bound syndrome"". we emphasize that the latter derives from the canadian transcultural psychiatry.
prosocial_behavior	across three studies, we examined the relationship between narcissism, prosocial behaviors, and the reasons why people engaged in them. specifically, we examined how narcissistic people engaged in charitable donations, taking advantage of a naturally occurring mass charitable donation campaign, the als ""ice bucket challenge"" (study 1). we also examined how narcissism was related to volunteering and other types of prosocial behaviors (studies 2 and 3). moreover, we compared and contrasted the prosocial responses of more empathic versus more narcissistic people (studies 2 and 3). this paper can help scholars and practitioners to determine under which circumstances, and for which reasons, narcissistic people may exhibit prosocial behaviors.
child_abuse	background children that living with addicted parents are at risk for intentionally and unintentionally poisoning. present study aimed to evaluate the effect of parental addiction on unintentional childhood poisoning. materials and methods: totally, 140 admitted children with poisoning in loghman hospital, tehran-iran, as referral center were recruited from march 2013 to july 2014. cases were matched with 280 controls by age (within a caliper of six months), gender, and date of hospital attendance in tehran, iran. parents were interviewed using an objective checklist about the risk factors of childhood poisoning. conditional logistic regression with within-group varying weights was used to adjust for measured confounders. vary weights within the matched set was defined by inverse probability weighting (ipw). results: sixty-two of cases (74.7%) were poisoned with methadone. the odds ratio [or] 95% confidence interval [ci] of having addicted parents in poisoned children compared to the controls in three scenarios of ordinary, un-stabilized weighted and stabilized weighted conditional regression logistic ors (95% ci) were 17.3 (8.7, 34.6), 2.6 (1.9, 3.3) and 3.6 (2.9, 4.3) respectively. conclusion the results indicate that child abuse and neglect have been linked to parental substance abuse. education on preventive interventions such as safe storage of methadone and store poisoning product out of reach and sight of children are necessary in substance abusing families.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the effectiveness of treatment for individuals diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (aspd) has been questioned and debated for years. as individuals with aspd are considerably overrepresented in the criminal justice system, the ability of treatment to reduce recidivism is a prominent concern. the present meta-analysis identified six unique controlled and uncontrolled treatment outcome studies investigating the effectiveness of treatment in reducing general/any recidivism for individuals with aspd. results from the controlled studies indicated no significant differences in recidivism rates between individuals with aspd in treatment and those in treatment as usual; however, the direction of the odds ratios suggested lower recidivism for the treatment groups. results from the uncontrolled studies suggested equal effectiveness of treatment when comparing individuals with and without aspd; however, these effects may not be attributable to the treatment in question. interpretation of these findings and the generalizability of the general offender treatment literature to individuals with aspd is discussed.
social_cognition	neuroimaging techniques have greatly enhanced the understanding of neurodiversity (human brain variation across individuals) in both health and disease. the ultimate goal of using brain imaging biomarkers is to perform individualized predictions. here we proposed a generalized framework that can predict explicit values of the targeted measures by taking advantage of joint information from multiple modalities. this framework also enables whole brain voxel-wise searching by combining multivariate techniques such as relieff, clustering, correlation-based feature selection and multiple regression models, which is more flexible and can achieve better prediction performance than alternative atlas-based methods. for 50 healthy controls and 47 schizophrenia patients, three kinds of features derived from resting-state fmri (falff), smri (gray matter) and dti (fractional anisotropy) were extracted and fed into a regression model, achieving high prediction for both cognitive scores (mccb composite r = 0.7033, mccb social cognition r = 0.7084) and symptomatic scores (positive and negative syndrome scale [panss] positive r = 0.7785, panss negative r = 0.7804). moreover, the brain areas likely responsible for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, including middle temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, striatum, cuneus and cerebellum, were located with different weights, as well as regions predicting panss symptoms, including thalamus, striatum and inferior parietal lobule, pinpointing the potential neuromarkers. finally, compared to a single modality, multimodal combination achieves higher prediction accuracy and enables individualized prediction on multiple clinical measures. there is more work to be done, but the current results highlight the potential utility of multimodal brain imaging biomarkers to eventually inform clinical decision-making.

child_abuse	this study explored the influences on living arrangements of orphans and vulnerable children (ovc) housed at a community-based home in johannesburg, south africa. a total of 50 ovc (males = 36%, females = 64%; age range 11 to 18 years) completed an open-ended questionnaire, while some of them also participated in individual interviews and focus group discussions on how they became residents of the community-based home. the data were thematically analysed. findings suggest their choice to live in a community-based care setting to have been influenced by homelessness with accompanying poverty, health issues, experiences of child abuse and neglect, discrimination, and domestic violence. school psychologists working with ovc from community-based homes should consider pathways by which the children could be provided with needed support for resilient health and wellness.
leadership	antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria remains a challenge in infectious diseases. the mission of the gram-positive committee of the antibacterial resistance leadership group (arlg) is to advance knowledge in the prevention, management, and treatment of these challenging infections to improve patient outcomes. our committee has prioritized projects involving methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) due to the scope of the medical threat posed by these pathogens. approved arlg projects involving gram-positive pathogens include (1) a pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics study to evaluate the impact of vancomycin dosing on patient outcome in mrsa bloodstream infection (bsi); (2) defining, testing, and validating innovative assessments of patient outcomes for clinical trials of mrsa-bsi; (3) testing new strategies for ""stepdown"" antibiotic therapy for mrsa-bsi; (4) management of staphylococcal bsis in neonatal intensive care units; and (5) defining the impact of vre bacteremia and daptomycin susceptibility on patient outcomes. this article outlines accomplishments, priorities, and challenges for research of infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
false_memories	in prior work on how true and false memory are influenced by emotion, valence and arousal have often been conflated. thus, it is difficult to say which specific effects are caused by valence and which are caused by arousal. in the present research, we used a picture-memory paradigm that allowed emotional valence to be manipulated with arousal held constant. negatively valenced pictures elevated both true and false memory, relative to positive and neutral pictures. conjoint recognition modeling revealed that negative valence (a) reduced erroneous suppression of true memories and (b) increased the familiarity of the semantic content of both true and false memories. overall, negative valence impaired the verbatim side of episodic memory but enhanced the gist side, and these effects persisted even after a week-long delay.
depression	objectives: the brief version of the world health organization 's quality of life instrument (whoqol-bref) is widely used for evaluating the personal subjective quality of life (qol) of patients and particular populations. however, in the absence of sufficient studies among the general population, normative data for whoqol-bref remain scarce. to fill this gap, the present study explored more sociodemographic and health-related factors affecting the qol. study design: in total, 11,351 participants aged >= 35 years in rural areas of liaoning province were screened with a stratified cluster multistage sampling scheme in 2012-2013. anthropometric measurements, laboratory examinations, and self-reported information on disease history were collected by trained personnel. depression symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9. methods: stepwise multiple linear regression was used to explore the association between multiple factors and qol. results: females and single/widowed subjects had lower qol scores than males and married/cohabiting subjects, respectively. total qol scores and scores for each domain decreased as age increased, but a positive correlation was found between age and the environmental domain score. participants with higher annual incomes, education levels, and activity levels had higher qol scores. in the regression model, the coefficient for stroke was -2.17 (95% confidence interval [ci] -2.64, -1.71) for the total qol score. for a one-level increase in depression level, the total qol score decreased by 5.62 (95% ci -5.83 to -5.42), physical domain score decreased by 1.63 (95% ci -1.69 to -1.58), and psychological domain score decreased by 1.81 (95% ci -1.87 to -1.75). conclusions: socio-economic status including marital status is highly related to qol. regarding chronic diseases, stroke is an important factor of qol and depressive symptoms have a strong negative relationship with qol.

media_violence	in this study i investigated the effects of depicted character roles and wishful identification with the main character on aggression and game enjoyment among players in violent video games. the results (n = 36) showed that character roles (e.g., the police, gangster, and athlete) did not have any significant effect on post-game aggression. however, there was a significant association among depicted character roles, wishful identification, and game enjoyment. implications in terms of the level of aggression, identification with the game character, and game enjoyment are discussed.
problem-solving	this paper will discuss about an analysis based on interview session in teaching automotive practical work for vocational colleges. six teachers who are expert in automotive were interviewed and the three major themes discussed to analyze teachers' feedback. the interview was categorized into three major themes of teaching methods which are: introduction, body and conclusion. in discussion of how to start their teaching, teachers prefer to use demonstration, sketching and questioning technique in introduction. they chose demonstration, question and answer, hands-our and problem solving approach while teaching body or content of automotive practical work. at the end of teaching session teachers prefer to summarize the topic and ask students to write a report. all teachers agreed that they cannot deliver in a variety of methods or creative teaching methods because of time constraints, as students have to complete the task within two hours. but from the answers in teaching the bodies of teaching practical work some teachers give students other problems and let students solve it with their creativity. to enhance students' knowledge and give them the opportunity to explore current situations of automotive development in the reflection and conclusion session, respondents were asked how they encourage students in a particular way. in summary, teachers applied the method of teaching based on what the curriculum need and students need based on the level of difficulties in the task given.
child_abuse	objective the incidence of posttraumatic ventriculomegaly (ptv) and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus after nonaccidental head trauma (naht) is unknown. in the present study, the authors assessed the timing of ptv development, the relationship between ptv and decompressive craniectomy (dc), and whether ptv necessitated placement of a permanent shunt. also, naht/ptv cases were categorized into a temporal profile of delay in admission and evaluated for association with outcomes at discharge. methods the authors retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients diagnosed with naht throughout a 10-year period. cases in which sequential ct scans had been obtained (n = 28) were evaluated for evans' index to determine the earliest time ventricular dilation was observed. discharge outcomes were assessed using the king 's outcome scale for childhood head injury score. results thirty-nine percent (11 of 28) of the patients developed ptv. a low admission glasgow coma scale (gcs) score predicted early ptv presentation (within1 week). a majority of ptv/naht patients presented with a subdural hematoma (both convexity and interhemispheric) and ischemic stroke, but subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly associated with ptv/naht (p = 0.011). of 6 patients undergoing a dc for intractable intracranial pressure, 4 (67%) developed ptv (p = 0.0366). these patients tended to present with lower gcs scores and develop ventriculomegaly early. only 2 patients developed hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement. conclusions ptv presents early after naht, particularly after a dc has been performed. however, the authors found that only a few ptv/naht patients developed shunt-dependent hydrocephalus.
schizophrenia	psychosis in alzheimer 's disease (ad+p) represents a distinct clinical and neurobiological ad phenotype and is associated with more rapid cognitive decline, higher rates of abnormal behaviors, and increased caregiver burden compared with ad without psychosis. on a molecular level, ad+p is associated with greater reductions in the protein kalirin, a guanine exchange factor which has also been linked to the psychotic disease, schizophrenia. in this study, we sought to determine the molecular and behavioral consequences of kalirin reduction in appswe/psen1de9 mice. we evaluated mice with and without kalirin reduction during tasks measuring psychosis-associated behaviors and spatial memory. we found that kalirin reduction in appswe/psen1de9 mice significantly attenuated psychosis-associated behavior at 12 months of age without changing spatial memory performance. the 12-month-old appswe/psen1de9 mice with reduced kalirin levels also had increased levels of the active, phosphorylated forms of p21 protein (cdc42/rac) eactivated kinases (paks), which function in signaling pathways for maintenance of dendritic spine density, morphology, and function. published by elsevier inc.
prosocial_behavior	objectivesinterpersonal dysfunction is central to borderline personality disorder (bpd). recent research has focused on the role of oxytocin (ot) in bpd, particularly regarding associations of ot activity with symptoms, genetic polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor coding gene (oxtr) in bpd, and experimental modification of interpersonal core problems of patients with bpd such as hypervigilance towards threat detection, mistrust, and non-verbal behaviour during social interaction by intranasal application of ot. methodsa literature (medline') review was performed using the keywords oxytocin' and borderline personality disorder'. secondary literature on trauma and attachment in relation to ot was also considered relevant. resultstogether, findings suggest that in bpd ot is associated with enhanced defensive mechanisms and avoidance behaviour. moreover, gene-environment interaction concerning polymorphic variations of the oxtr gene and childhood adversity in bpd suggests that these genes convey developmental flexibility or differential susceptibility' to environmental contingencies, whereby bpd resides at the poor outcome end of the spectrum. conclusionsin view of the conflicting literature, it needs to be studied carefully whether ot can serve as a therapeutic agent given adjunct to psychotherapy in bpd. more research about the role of ot is also required with regard to the prevention of the non-genetic intergenerational transmission of bpd. clarifying the role of ot in bpd may also benefit from research in non-human animals targeting the interaction between early adversity and ot availability more directly. practitioner points the study of oxytocin can contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology of borderline personality disorder. oxytocin is critically involved in attachment security, and methylation of the oxytocin receptor may play a role in the epigenetic modulation of early adversity. the intranasal application of oxytocin may be a useful therapeutic adjunct to psychotherapy. insecure attachment and childhood adversity may produce differential neurobiological effects on the oxytocinergic system in borderline personality disorder. there is insufficient knowledge of how oxytocin interacts with vasopressin, testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin, which are also important key players in the experience of social reward and stress responsivity. it is unclear whether or not oxytocin could be beneficial in preventing the intergenerational (non-genetic) transmission of borderline personality traits.
prenatal_development	hyperosmotic stress affects cell growth, decreasing cell volume and increasing the uptake of organic osmolytes. however, the sensitivity of embryonic cells to osmotic treatment remains to be established. we have analysed some aspects of cell-cycle control and amino-acid transport in hypertonic conditions during prenatal life. the effects of hyperosmotic stress on amino-acid uptake mediated by system a, h-3-thymidine incorporation, and regulation of cell-cycle proteins were analysed in chick embryo hepatocytes. hypertonic stress increased system a activity and caused cell-cycle delay. effects on amino-acid transport involved p38 kinase activation and new carrier synthesis. cyclin d1, cdk4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) and pcna (proliferating-cell nuclear antigen) levels decreased, whereas cyclin e, p21 and p53 levels were unchanged. incorporation of h-3-leucine indicated decreased synthesis of cyclin d1 in contrast, analysis of mrna by qrt-pcr (quantitative real-time for) showed a net increase of cyclin d1 transcripts, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. the data show that chick embryo hepatocytes respond to hyperosmotic conditions by arresting cell growth to prevent dna damage and increasing osmolyte uptake to regulate cell volume, indicating that the adaptive response to environmental stress exists during prenatal life.
social_cognition	the door-in-the-face (ditf) sequential message strategy was investigated in a threestudy analysis of existing experimental findings. the current study predicted there would be a positive relationship between concession size and compliance rates in ditf studies. study 1 included 25 comparisons where size of concession was quantifiable as measured by percentage reduction from initial to target request in the ditf condition. study 2 data relied on a panel of undergraduate students to provide an index of concession size in 12 additional observations. a third study validated the panel procedure of rating concession size and also provided 9 additional independent observations from the pool of published studies on ditf. results from each study indicated a positive relationship between concession size and effect size (r = 0.35, 0.55, 0.68, respectively). study findings provide support for reciprocal concessions explanation for ditf effects.
social_cognition	many studies deal with the impact of prevention campaigns. whatever the method used, most of them postulate that people take the campaign into consideration as soon as they are exposed to it. the cognitive dissonance theory (festinger, 1957, 1964) postulates the principle of selective exposure. people tend to both expose themselves to consistent information to strengthen their attitude and behavior and avoid inconsistent one. avoiding inconsistent information prevents them from threatening position which could modify their attitude. the goal of this research consists in verifying a selective exposure effect concerning smoking prevention using a measure of implicit attitude. this research was conducted in a professional training institute. participants were recruited on the pretext of a consultation as part of a training design on addictions. they were either employees or trainees from the institute. forty-four smokers and 80 non-smokers took part in the experiment. they had to precise which prevention thematic (among six addictions) would interest them in order to construct a new training/formation program dealing with dangers of addiction the harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, drugs etc. people were asked what kind of topic would interest them most. then, their attitudes and behavior toward smoking were evaluated. to evaluate smoking attitudes, we used both an explicit (attitude toward smoking scale [ats]; etter et al., 2000) and an implicit measure (single category implicit association test personalized [sc-iat-p]; bardin et al., 2014). smoking habits were also recorded. results revealed that smokers have an implicit attitude less negative than non-smokers. implicit attitude of smokers also predicts selective exposure. the more their attitude is positive, the less people would like to expose themselves to smoking prevention information. at last, smokers who have already considered quitting are more inclined to expose to such information than other smokers. these results support the hypothesis of an effect on attitudes explicit and implicit in the expression of needs in the context of smoking prevention training design.

prejudice	this paper discusses contradictory imperatives in contemporary australian pedagogy - the notions of controversy' and diversity' as they relate the subjects of genders and sexualities. it is a common view that both gender and sexuality are important organising features of identity, society and politics. consistent effort is made in the australian educational context to combat discrimination, prejudice against sexually, and gender diverse' people. however, the state 's commitment to diversity policies must be balanced with a secondary focus on appeasing those who are hostile to non-heteronormative expression, or who view such expression as inherently political' in nature and therefore inappropriate for the school setting. australia has arguably demonstrated this dilemma recently in two notable controversies: an intervention in planned school screenings of gayby baby, a documentary exploring the experience of children in same-sex families, and media furore over the trans-positive all of us teaching kit. using these case studies, this paper explores the competing imperatives of controversy and diversity, commenting on the tendency for the lives and experiences of lgbtiq people becoming consequently politicised. to do so, is arguably detrimental to the meaningful participation of lgbtiq people as social citizens.
person_perception	the present study examined how big five personality ratings of the same target individuals differ as a function of the power relation between the target and the judge. our targets were 37 employees with leadership duties from two large organizations. the targets' subordinates (n = 352), peers (n = 186), and superiors (n = 62) constituted our groups of judges. the targets and judges also provided self-reports of personality. subordinate judges showed higher consensus but not higher self-other agreement than peer or superior judges. furthermore, the targets were judged as more extraverted, more emotionally stable, less agreeable, and less open to experience by their subordinates than by their superiors. the results suggest that (i) observer consensus, but not self-other agreement or assumed similarity varies as a function of real-life power; (ii) the effects of power on mean trait scores are mostly congruent with the previously observed effects of power on behaviour and on stereotypes. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd.
eating_disorders	although improvements in body image have been shown for longer-lasting resistance training, research on its short-term effects is currently lacking. the present study set out to test a hypothesized beneficial effect of a single bout of resistance training on global and specific (i. e., body fat-and muscularity-related) body image states of male exercisers. additionally, a moderating effect of drive for muscularity was explored. in a controlled crossover study, 42 experienced weight trainers received (a) a session of resistance training; (b) a session of aerobic exercise (cycling); and (c) a session of magazine reading. body image states were assessed before and immediately after each condition, and after 24 hr. as hypothesized, resistance training, but not cycling or reading, led to a significant increase in perceived muscularity on a silhouette measure of body image states (g = 0.31 or 3 kg). both exercise conditions led to a significant decrease in perceived body fat (g = -0.33 or -2.5% for resistance training), but for resistance training, this only held true for men lower in drive for muscularity (g =.58, p <.01). after 24 hr, scores had returned to baseline levels. even a single bout of resistance training yields short-term improvements in men 's body image states on both the muscularity and fat dimension, which may act as a reinforcer of exercise behavior. the present findings might foster the understanding of body-image factors that contribute to the development of excessive weight-lifting behavior.
antisocial_personality_disorder	previous research on response inhibition in psychopaths has failed to find consistent evidence for aberrant inhibitory ability, despite strong expectations to the contrary. however, previous examinations have utilised inhibition paradigms that suffer from critical shortcomings, such as a lack of ecological validity and overly simplistic response criteria. to assess inhibition under conditions close to the demands of everyday settings, the current study employs a parametric go/no-go task in male offenders (n77). additionally, rather than treating psychopathy as a categorical descriptor, a dimensional approach is taken to assess the relationship between individual psychopathic traits and response inhibition performance. results indicate significant relationships between response inhibition and individual facets of psychopathy as measured by the psychopathy checklist: screening version. a positive relationship was found between inhibitory ability and interpersonal aspects of psychopathy, reflecting an enhancement of inhibitory functioning for those scoring high on this facet. in addition, a negative association was found between psychopathic lifestyle characteristics and response inhibition. whereas the negative association mirrors the conceptualisation of the lifestyle facet, the positive association between interpersonal psychopathic aspects and response inhibition might reflect a propensity for adaptive behaviour that enables psychopaths to adequately manipulate their victims and mask their true nature.
schizophrenia	relevant biochemicals of the brain can be quantified in vivo, non-invasively, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (h-1 mrs). this includes metabolites associated with neural general functioning, energetics, membrane phospholipid metabolism and neurotransmission. moreover, there is substantial evidence of implication of the frontal and prefrontal areas in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. in particular, the anterior cingulate cortex (acc) plays an important role in cognitive control of emotional and non-emotional processes. thus the study of its extent of biochemistry dysfunction in the early stages of psychosis is of particular interest in gaining a greater understanding of its aetiology. in this review, we selected h-1 mrs studies focused on the acc of first-episode psychosis (fep). four studies reported increased glutamatergic levels in fep, while other four showed preserved concentrations. moreover, findings on fep do not fully mirror those in chronic patients. due to conflicting findings, larger longitudinal h-1 mrs studies are expected to further explore glutamatergic neurotransmission in acc of fep in order to have a better understanding of the glutamatergic mechanisms underlying psychosis, possibly using ultra high field mr scanners.
attention	the objective of this study was to develop a new elaborate method to evaluate infants' liking of foods that could be applied at home and to compare the results of this elaborate method with those of a basic method. mothers of infants aged 4 to 7 (n = 44) and 12-15 months (n = 46) participated in this study. for the basic method, mothers were asked to assess their infant 's global liking at the end of a meal. then, for the elaborate method, mothers received detailed instructions on how to feed their infant, how infants might express like/dislike and when to stop the meal. during the first nine spoons, they were asked to report the presence/absence of positive and negative behaviours after each spoon, and the infant 's initial liking was reported after each triplet of spoons. they also assessed their infant 's global liking at the end of the meal. both methods were applied using three commercial familiar baby foods adapted to each age range. in 4-7-month-olds, the elaborate method showed a significant difference across products for liking, whereas the basic method did not show any difference. in 12-15-month-olds, the elaborate method showed more differences across products for liking than the basic method. in both age groups, negative behaviours, despite being less frequently reported, provided better liking discrimination than positive behaviours. in conclusion, the elaborate method produced better product liking discrimination than the basic method by focusing maternal attention on infants' eating behaviours since the first spoons.

nonverbal_communication	arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages in older children. intracerebral hematoma can cause serious lasting neurologic, cognitive, and language deficits, or even possible death. we present the case of a 16-year-old boy who had language impairments after suffering a large hemorrhagic stroke in the left temporoparietal region. all language components, verbal and nonverbal communication, reading, and writing, were found to be affected. these impairments were expected as they are characteristic of the location of the hematoma. after a year of speech language rehabilitation, there was an almost complete recovery of language skills. quick diagnosis and adequate therapeutic interventions are important to diminish the influence of intracerebral hemorrhage on cognitive and language functions in children.
child_abuse	physical, emotional and sexual child abuse are major problems in south africa. this study investigates whether children know about post-abuse services, if they disclose and seek services, and what the outcomes of help-seeking behaviour are. it examines factors associated with request and receipt of services. confidential self-report questionnaires were completed by adolescents aged 10-17 (n = 3515) in south africa. prevalence of frequent (>weekly) physical abuse was 7.4%, frequent emotional abuse 12.4%, and lifetime contact sexual abuse 9.0%. 98.6% could name one suitable confidante or formal service for abuse disclosure, but only 20.0% of abuse victims disclosed. of those, 72% received help. most common confidantes were caregivers and teachers. of all abuse victims, 85.6% did not receive help due to non-disclosure or inactivity of services, and 14.4% received help: 4.9% from formal health or social services and 7.1% through community vigilante action. emotional abuse, sexual abuse and female gender were associated with higher odds of help-seeking. while children in south africa showed high knowledge of available services, access to and receipt of formal services among abused children was low. notably fewer children received help from formal services than through community vigilante action. urgent action is needed to improve service access for child abuse victims.
person_perception	people use impressions of an evaluative target 's self-esteem to infer their possession of socially desirable traits. but will people still use this self-esteem proxy when trait-relevant diagnostic information is available? we test this possibility in two experiments: participants learn that a target person has low or high self-esteem, and then receive diagnostic information about the target 's academic success or failure and positive or negative affectivity (study 1), or watch a video of the target 's extraverted or introverted behavior (study 2). in both experiments, participants' impressions of the target 's traits accurately tracked diagnostic information, but impressions also revealed an independent self-esteem proxy effect. evidently, the self-esteem proxy is robust and influences person perception even in the presence of vivid individuating information.
gender_roles	cardiovascular disease exerts an enormous burden on women 's health. the intake of a healthy diet may reduce this burden. however, social norms and economic constraints are often factors that restrain women from paying attention to their diet. underpinned by critical realism, this study explores how gender/sex influences decision-making regarding food consumption among women of low socioeconomic status (ses). the study was carried out at two cardiac facilities in karachi, pakistan, on 24 participants (male and female from different ethnic backgrounds), who had received health education. using an interpretive descriptive approach, the study identified major barriers to a healthy diet: proscribed gender roles and lack of women 's autonomy, power, male domination, and abusive behaviours. cardiovascular risk and disease outcomes for the pakistani women of low ses are likely to further escalate if individual and structural barriers are not reduced using multifactorial approaches.
social_cognition	kidd and castano (in press) critique our failure to replicate kidd and castano (2013) on 3 grounds: failure to exclude people who did not read the texts, failure of random assignment, and failure to exclude people who did not take the author recognition test (art). this response addresses each of these critiques. most importantly, we note that even when kidd and castano reanalyzed our data in the way that they argue is most appropriate, they still failed to replicate the pattern of results reported in their original study. we thus reaffirm that our replication of kidd and castano (2013) found no evidence that literary fiction uniquely and immediately improves theory of mind. our objective remains not to prove that reading literary fiction does not benefit social cognition, but to call for in- depth research addressing the difficulties in measuring any potential effect and to note the need to temper claims accordingly. this document is copyrighted by the american psychological association or one of its allied publishers. this article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.
antisocial_personality_disorder	objective: poor sleep is known to cause detrimental effects on the course of diverse psychiatric disorders and is a putative risk factor for hostility and aggression. thus, sleep may be crucial in forensic psychiatric practice. however, little is known about the prevalence of sleep disturbances in these complex psychiatric patients. methods: in this study we investigated the presence of sleep disorders and subjective sleep quality using the sleep diagnosis list (sdl), the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi), interviews addressing the causes of sleep complaints, and file information on sleep medications in 110 patients admitted to a forensic psychiatric hospital. results: almost 30% of the participants suffered from one or more sleep disorders, especially insomnia. an even larger proportion of the participants (49.1%) experienced poor sleep quality. interestingly, patients with an antisocial personality disorder or traits were particularly dissatisfied with their sleep. the most common causes of sleep problems were suboptimal sleep hygiene, stress or ruminating, negative sleep conditioning, and side effects of psychotropic medication. of the poor sleepers, 40.7% received a hypnotic drug. conclusion: despite intensive clinical treatment, sleep problems are experienced by a large number of forensic psychiatric patients. it would be worthwhile to examine the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions on both psychiatric symptoms and reactive aggressive behavior in forensic patients.

depression	the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between daytime activity (sedentary time, moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity [mvpa]) and indices of polysomnographically (psg) assessed sleep, including sleep-disordered breathing (sdb). one hundred and thirty-six adults (65% female, 59.8 +/- 9.1 years, body mass index [bmi] 30.3 +/- 6.9 kg m(-2)) provided daily estimates of time spent in light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity activity for 6-14 days (mean 9.9 +/- 1.8 days) prior to laboratory psg. daily sedentary time was calculated as the amount of time spent awake and not in light-, moderate-, or vigorous-intensity activity; time spent in moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity were combined for mvpa. indices of psg sleep included timing (sleep midpoint), duration (total sleep time), continuity (sleep efficiency), depth (% slow-wave sleep), and sdb (apnea-hypopnea index [ahi]). using median splits of sedentary time and mvpa, analyses of covariance examined their relationship with sleep following adjustment for age, sex, race, employment, education, bmi, existing cardiovascular disease, depression history, and mean daily wake time. binary logistic regression examined the odds of having at least mild-severity sdb (ahi ae 5) according to sedentary time, mvpa, and their combination. adults with above-median sedentary time (i.e., >841.9 min/day) had significantly greater ahi (p = .04) and lower odds of mild sdb (p = .03) compared to adults with low sedentary time; adults with high mvpa (>30.5 min/day) had significantly lower ahi compared to adults with low mvpa (p = .04). when examined in the same model, adults with high sedentary time and low mvpa had significantly higher ahi (p < .01) and higher odds of having mild sdb (p = .03) than all the other groups. no other sleep measures were related to sedentary time, mvpa, or their combination. sedentary time and mvpa were associated with sdb. whether reducing sedentary time leads to lower sdb severity deserves future exploration.
eating_disorders	aim: women with anorexia are often perceived very negatively-for example, as manipulative and deceitful-both by wider society and treatment providers. in this context, it is important for practitioners to understand the experience of living with this illness, but there is very little empirical research focused on the everyday phenomenology of anorexia. this study aimed to expand this limited literature by 'giving voice' to the lived experience of women with anorexia. method: a purposive sample of 12 women-11 with a formal diagnosis of an as a result of nhs treatment and one with a long behavioural history of dietary restriction who had received private treatment-who saw themselves as recovered, or in recovery, from anorexia nervosa participated in semi-structured interviews. the women were asked about the history of their eating disorder, their understandings of its cause and experiences of seeking help and treatment. results: the data were analysed with thematic analysis and three themes identified-shame, solitude and salvation-which, when taken together, describe the dual role of anorexia nervosa as both problem and solution, the cyclical nature of sufferers' behaviours and feelings and the way in which anorexia nervosa is a form of distress that can make its sufferers feel better as well as worse. conclusions: further light is shed on the ambivalence about recovery, and resistance to treatment, that are frequently experienced by sufferers. implications of these findings for those who work with eating disorders clients are discussed.
false_memories	gist-based processing has been proposed to account for robust false memories in the converging-associates task. the deep-encoding processes known to enhance verbatim memory also strengthen gist memory and increase distortions of long-term memory (ltm). recent research has demonstrated that compelling false memory illusions are relatively delay-invariant, also occurring under canonical short-term memory (stm) conditions. to investigate the contributions of gist to false memory at short and long delays, processing depth was manipulated as participants encoded lists of four semantically related words and were probed immediately, following a filled 3- to 4-s retention interval, or approximately 20 min later, in a surprise recognition test. in two experiments, the encoding manipulation dissociated stm and ltm on the frequency, but not the phenomenology, of false memory. deep encoding at stm increases false recognition rates at ltm, but confidence ratings and remember/know judgments are similar across delays and do not differ as a function of processing depth. these results suggest that some shared and some unique processes underlie false memory illusions at short and long delays.
prenatal_development	skeletal muscle development in vertebrates - also termed myogenesis - is a highly integrated process. evidence to date indicates that the processes are very similar across mammals, poultry and fish, although the timings of the various steps differ considerably. myogenesis is regulated by the myogenic regulatory factors and consists of two to three distinct phases when different fibre populations appear. the critical times when myogenesis is prone to hormonal or environmental influences depend largely on the developmental stage. one of the main mechanisms for both genetic and environmental effects on muscle fibre development is via the direct action of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (gh-igf) axis. in mammals and poultry, postnatal growth and function of muscles relate mainly to the hypertrophy of the fibres formed during myogenesis and to their fibre-type composition in terms of metabolic and contractile properties, whereas in fish hyperplasia still plays a major role. candidate genes that are important in skeletal muscle development, for instance, encode for igfs and igf-binding proteins, myosin heavy chain isoforms, troponin t, myosin light chain and others have been identified. in mammals, nutritional supply in utero affects myogenesis and the gh-igf axis may have an indirect action through the partitioning of nutrients towards the gravid uterus. impaired myogenesis resulting in low skeletal myofibre numbers is considered one of the main reasons for negative long-term consequences of intrauterine growth retardation. severe undernutrition in utero due to natural variation in litter or twin-bearing species or insufficient maternal nutrient supply may impair myogenesis and adversely affect carcass quality later in terms of reduced lean and increased fat deposition in the progeny. on the other hand, increases in maternal feed intake above standard requirement seem to have no beneficial effects on the growth of the progeny with myogenesis not or only slightly affected. initial studies on low and high maternal protein feeding are published. although there are only a few studies, first results also reveal an influence of nutrition on skeletal muscle development in fish and poultry. finally, environmental temperature has been identified as a critical factor for growth and development of skeletal muscle in both fish and poultry.
prosocial_behavior	many studies have seemingly demonstrated that anonymous individuals who are shown artificial cues of being watched behave as if they are being watched by real people. however, several studies have failed to replicate this surveillance cue effect. in light of these mixed results, we conducted two meta-analyses investigating the effect of artificial observation cues on generosity. overall, our meta-analyses found no evidence to support the claim that artificial surveillance cues increase generosity, either by increasing how generous individuals are, or by increasing the probability that individuals will show any generosity at all. therefore, surveillance cue effects should be interpreted cautiously.

prosocial_behavior	the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) is a widely used psychopathology screening tool that measures children 's emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and prosocial behavior. previous psychometric studies of the sdq focused primarily on older children in western cultures and suffered from several methodological limitations. this study examined the reliability, factor structure, convergent, and discriminant validity of the sdq by focusing on young asian american children and using more rigorous methods. the five-factor structure of the sdq was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. the coefficients indicated adequate reliability for all subscales except parent-rated peer problems and conduct problems. the correlated trait-correlated method minus one multitrait-multimethod model provided evidence for convergent validity and discriminant validity of all subscales except for conduct problems relative to hyperactivity/inattention. this study provided new evidence for the psychometric properties of the sdq in young children and cultural suitability of the sdq for asian americans.
child_abuse	this brief comment explores the significance of a number of current lawsuits brought against catholic church leaders in ballarat, victoria, australia, in the context of enduring failures of justice for australian victims of catholic clerical child sexual abuse. it examines the obstacles to criminal and civil justice that have prevented church superiors from being held to account for child sexual abuse perpetrated in catholic institutions, and explains the responsibility of australian governments, courts and the catholic church to further justice for survivors(1) in this context.
schizophrenia	several studies in patients with schizophrenia reported a marked reduction in sleep spindle activity. to investigate whether the reduction may be linked to genetic risk of the illness, we analysed sleep spindle activity in healthy volunteers, patients with schizophrenia and first-degree relatives, who share an enriched set of schizophrenia susceptibility genes. we further investigated the correlation of spindle activity with cognitive function in first-degree relatives and whether spindle abnormalities affect both fast (12-15 hz) and slow (9-12 hz) sleep spindles. we investigated fast and slow sleep spindle activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep in a total of 47 subjects comprising 17 patients with schizophrenia, 13 healthy first-degree relatives and 17 healthy volunteers. groups were balanced for age, gender, years of education and estimated verbal iq. a subsample of relatives received additional testing for memory performance. compared to healthy volunteers, fast spindle density was reduced in patients with schizophrenia and healthy first-degree relatives following a pattern consistent with an assumed genetic load for schizophrenia. the deficit in spindle density was specific to fast spindles and was associated with decreased memory performance. our findings indicate familial occurrence of this phenotype and thus support the hypothesis that deficient spindle activity relates to genetic liability for schizophrenia. furthermore, spindle reductions predict impaired cognitive function and are specific to fast spindles. this physiological marker should be further investigated as an intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia. it could also constitute a target for drug development, especially with regard to cognitive dysfunction.
schizophrenia	aim: the nrg1-erbb4 neurotransmitter signaling pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (sz). the intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism rs707284 in erbb4 links to pi3k-akt suppression in sz. another protein indirectly affecting nrg1-erbb4 signaling is beta-secretase, which is encoded by the bace1 gene, and activates nrg1 by proteolytic cleavage. in this study, we aimed to investigate the association of erbb4 rs707284 and bace1 rs490460 with the risk of sz in an iranian population. subjects and methods: a total of 973 subjects, including 480 sz patients and 493 healthy controls, matched by ethnicity, age, and gender, were recruited in a case-control study. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood of all subjects and genotyping of rs707284 and rs490460 was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (tetra-arms) pcr genotyping assays, respectively. results: a significant association was observed between the rs490460 t allele and sz (p = 0.0002, odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.84). there was no association between the risk of sz and rs707284. conclusion: our data indicate that rs490460 is associated with the risk of sz. in silico analysis indicates that rs490460 may be a potential splicing site, which affects protein structure. replication studies are needed to confirm our data.
schizophrenia	nmda receptors (nmdars) are ionotropic glutamate receptors that are crucial for neuronal development and higher cognitive processes. nmdar dysfunction is involved in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases; however, the mechanistic link between the human pathology and nmdar dysfunction is poorly understood. rare missense variants within nmdar subunits have been identified in numerous patients with mental or neurological disorders. we specifically focused on the glun2b nmdar subunit, which is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cortex throughout development. we analyzed several variants located in the glun2b c terminus and found that three variants in patients with autism (s1415l) or schizophrenia (l1424f and s1452f) (s1413l, l1422f, and s1450f in rodents, respectively) displayed impaired binding to membrane-associated guanylate kinase (maguk) proteins. in addition, we observed a deficit in surface expression for glun2b s1413l. furthermore, there were fewer dendritic spines in glun2b s1413l-expressing neurons. importantly, synaptic nmdar currents in neurons transfected with glun2b s1413l in glun2a/ b-deficient mouse brain slices revealed only partial rescue of synaptic current amplitude. functional properties of glun2b s1413l in recombinant systems revealed no change in receptor properties, consistent with synaptic defects being the result of reduced trafficking and targeting of glun2b s1413l to the synapse. therefore, we find that glun2b s1413l displays deficits in nmdar trafficking, synaptic currents, and spine density, raising the possibility that this mutationmaycontribute to the phenotype in this autism patient. morebroadly, our research demonstrates that the targeted study of certain residues in nmdars based on rare variants identified in patients is a powerful approach to studying receptor function.
social_cognition	most individuals at ultra-high risk (uhr) for psychosis do not transition to frank illness. nevertheless, many have poor clinical outcomes and impaired psychosocial functioning. this study used voxel-based morphometry to investigate if baseline grey and white matter brain densities at identification as uhr were associated with functional outcome at medium-to long-term follow-up. participants were help-seeking uhr individuals (n = 109, 54m: 55f) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline; functional outcome was assessed an average of 9.2 years later. primary analysis showed that lower baseline grey matter density, but not white matter density, in bilateral frontal and limbic areas, and left cerebellar declive were associated with poorer functional outcome (social and occupational functioning assessment scale [sofas]). these findings were independent of transition to psychosis or persistence of the at-risk mental state. similar regions were significantly associated with lower self-reported levels of social functioning and increased negative symptoms at follow-up. exploratory analyses showed that lower baseline grey matter densities in middle and inferior frontal gyri were significantly associated with decline in global assessment of functioning (gaf) score over follow- up. there was no association between baseline grey matter density and iq or positive symptoms at followup. the current findings provide novel evidence that those with the poorest functional outcomes have the lowest grey matter densities at identification as uhr, regardless of transition status or persistence of the at-risk mental state. replication and validation of these findings may allow for early identification of poor functional outcome and targeted interventions.
seasonal_affective_disorder	insomnia is common among elderly people and nearly 30 to 40% of the adult population also suffer from insomnia. pharmacological treatment of insomnia include the use of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs like zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone. although these drugs improve sleep, their usage is also associated with number of adverse effects, melatonin, the hormone secreted by the pineal gland of all animals and human beings has been used for treatment of insomnias, since the timing of its secretion in humans as well as in most of the animals coincides with the increase of nocturnal sleep propensity. because of its short half life, melatonin slow release preparations were introduced for treatment of insomnia. recently ramelteon, a selective mt1, mt2 receptor agonist with greater efficacy of action in treating insomnia has been used clinically and has been found effective in improving sleep quality, sleep efficacy and also in reducing the sleep onset time when compared to melatonin or slow melatonin preparations. the mechanism of action of ramelteon in improving sleep is discussed in the paper. another melatonergic drug agomelatine besides acting on mt1/mt2 receptors also displays 5-ht2c antagonism and this drug has been found effective as a novel antidepressant for treating major depressive disorders. agomelatine besides causing remission of depressive symptoms also improves sleep quality and efficiency. other antidepressants depressants that are in clinical use today do not improve sleep. there are other melatonergic drugs like tasimelteon,6-chloromelatonin. but ramelteon and agomelatine deserve special attention for treatment of insomnia and sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders and have promising role for treatment of sleep disorders.
media_violence	objective to measure impact of pediatricians' perceived self-efficacy and confidence on current practices and attitudes regarding four violence prevention (vp) topics (gun storage, gun removal, limiting exposure to media violence, discipline techniques) during health supervision for children ages 2 - 11. methods random sample survey of american academy of pediatrics fellows (n = 486; 53% response rate) providing health supervision for children ages 2 - 11. participants surveyed about vp issues regarding: (1) current counseling practices for 2 - 5 and 6 - 11 year olds; (2) amount of time spent addressing; (3) confidence in addressing; and (4) perceived self-efficacy at changing patients' behaviors. multivariate analyses explored relationships between pediatricians' perceived self-efficacy and confidence versus vp counseling frequency. results vp topics were not routinely discussed during health supervision. most pediatricians (64%) reported spending too little time addressing these topics. although most pediatricians felt confident discussing and effective at changing behaviors regarding limiting exposure to media violence (89% vs. 50%) and discipline techniques (91% vs. 76%), they were less so for safe gun storage (54% vs. 35%) and gun removal (51% vs. 17%). perceived self-efficacy was the mediating factor on self-reported vp counseling frequencies for all topics. conclusions pediatricians reported spending insufficient time on vp counseling. confidence and perceived self-efficacy levels varied by vp topic, but for all topics pediatricians felt more confident discussing than effective at changing behaviors. since pediatricians' self-efficacy was related to counseling practices, boosting self-efficacy could ultimately improve counseling frequencies. further research is needed to identify methods to build providers' perceived self-efficacy regarding these vp areas.
prosocial_behavior	the search for the prosocial personality has been long and controversial. the current research explores the general patterns underlying prosocial decisions, linking personality, emotion, and overt prosocial behavior. using a multimethod approach, we explored the links between the big five dimensions of personality and prosocial responding. across three studies, we found that agreeableness was the dimension of personality most closely associated with emotional reactions to victims in need of help, and subsequent decisions to help those individuals. results suggest that prosocial processes, including emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, may be part of a more general motivational process linked to personality.
prejudice	the aim of the paper is to present a specific context for the occurrence of sexual problems, i.e., sexual dysfunction in the population of homo - and bisexual men. sexual problems and revealing them are usually a big challenge for men. in case of homo - and bisexual men additional psychological and social factors may contribute to the occurrence of these problems, as well as make experiencing them more painful, but also impede looking for and receiving an adequate help. these factors are connected to the specific features of gay men sexuality, such as: lack of obvious sexual scripts for homosexual men, full reversibility of all sexual roles and positions in contacts between two men or no fear of unwanted pregnancy, but also with the unique psychosocial context such as: minority stress and internalized homophobia. clinicians - psychiatrists, sexologists and psychologists - should be aware of their existence to deliver a more effective professional and culturally competent care, which is free of prejudice, based on deepened reflection and void of automatic transference of experiences with work with heterosexual men. slowa klucze: dysfunkcje seksualne, homoseksualnosc
attention	purinergic signaling maintains local tissue homeostasis in blood vessels via the regulation of vascular tone, blood platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, and differentiation as well as inflammatory responses. extracellular purines are important signaling molecules in the vasculature, and both purine-hydrolysing as well as -phosphorylating enzymes are considered to selectively govern extracellular nucleotide/nucleoside metabolism. recent studies have provided some evidence for the existence of these enzymes in a soluble form in human blood and their secretion into the extracellular space under physiological and pathological conditions. however, the comprehensive analysis of endothelium-derived enzymes involved in purine metabolic pathways has received no attention so far. in the presented study, in vitro cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) are shown to be an abundant source of exo-nucleotidases comprising 5-nucleotidase (exo-5-nt), and nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (exo-ntpdase) as well as phosphotransferases, represented by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (exo-ndpk) and adenylate kinase (exo-ak). an attempt is also made to demonstrate that, in contrast to the metabolic pattern determined on the endothelial cell surface, exo-phosphorylating activities markedly predominate over exo-hydrolytic ones. we present for the first time the expression profiles of genes encoding isoenzymes belonging to distinct nucleotide kinase and nucleotidase families. the genes encoding ndpk1, ndpk2, ak1, and ak2 phosphotransferases have been shown to be expressed at the highest level in huvec cells. the data indicate the coexistence of secreted and cell-associated factors of endothelial origin mediating atp-consuming and atp-generating pathways with the predominance of exo-phosphotransferases activity. the described enzymes contribute to the regulation of purinergic signal duration and extent in the venous vasculature. j. cell. biochem. 118: 1341-1348, 2017.

schizophrenia	background. patients with bipolar disorder (bd) frequently exhibit impulsive behaviors independent of their mood state, and trait impulsivity is increasingly recognized as a crucial bd biomarker. this study aimed to investigate structural correlates of trait impulsivity measured using the barratt impulsiveness scale (bis) in healthy controls (hcs) and patients with bd. method. we recruited 59 patients diagnosed with bd i or bd ii (35.3 8.5 years) and 56 age- and sex-matched hcs (33.9 7.4 years). participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and clinical evaluations, and their bis scores were evaluated. an automated surface-based method (freesurfer) was used to measure cortical thickness and generate thickness maps for each participant. brain-wise regression analysis of the association between cortical thickness and bis scores was performed separately for bd and hc groups by using a general linear model. results. patients with bd obtained significantly higher bis scores than hcs. in hcs, higher bis scores were associated with a thinner cortex in the left inferior, middle and medial frontal cortices. by contrast, in bd patients, higher bis scores were associated with a thicker cortex in the right insula. patients with bd showed a thinner cortex than hcs in all these four structures. conclusions. the findings indicate that the left prefrontal cortex plays a cardinal role in trait impulsivity of healthy individuals. patients with bd have a different structural correlate of trait impulsivity in the right insula. however, the use of various psychotropics in patients with bd may limit our interpretation of bd findings.
eating_disorders	objectivesunfulfilled basic psychological needs have been associated with disordered eating behaviours, but the mechanisms underlying that associations are not well understood. this study examined a two-stage path model linking basic psychological need satisfaction to disordered eating behaviours via issues of control. methodsfemale university students (n=323; m-age=19.61), community participants (n=371; m-age=29.75), and women who self-reported having been diagnosed with an eating disorder (ed; n=41; m-age=23.88) completed measures of psychological need satisfaction (i.e., autonomy and competence), issues of control (i.e., feelings of ineffectiveness and fear of losing self-control [flc]), and ed pathology. resultspath analysis revealed that unsatisfied needs of autonomy and competence were indirectly related to disordered eating behaviours through feelings of ineffectiveness and flc. conclusionsthe results indicate that issues of control might be one of the mechanisms through which lack of psychological need satisfaction is associated with disordered eating. although the model was constructed using cross-sectional data, these findings suggest potential targets for prevention and treatment efforts aimed at reducing disordered eating in young females. practitioner points our results indicate that young women with chronically unfulfilled basic psychological needs might be vulnerable to developing disordered eating behaviours. the observed patterns suggest that persistent experience of need frustration may engender an internal sense of ineffectiveness and lack of control, which then compels individuals to engage in disordered eating behaviours in an attempt to regain autonomy and competence. interventions for eating disorders may be most effective when emphasizing the promotion of people 's needs for autonomy and competence. limitations the model was constructed using cross-sectional data. future experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the temporal sequence from basic psychological needs to issues of control. the sample only consisted of young women. further research should explore how thwarting of psychological need satisfaction functions in men. our clinical sample was small and diagnosis was not confirmed through clinical interview; therefore, those data should be interpreted with caution.
eating_disorders	mental health problems implicitly and particularly pose questions about the tensions of the social world. anorexia nervosa and bulimia, two eating behaviour disorders, are conceptualised in this article as exposing the social tensions particularly affecting young girls, and more frequently those from the middle and more affluent social classes. why are these three structuring characteristics of social position female sex, comfortable social milieu, and ""youth"" interpretable in terms of social relations, and are they thus closely intertwined in these syndromes? their configuration in eating disorders is atypical among health inequalities that more usually affect men and those from the poorer and older groups in the population. the sociological examination of these behavioural disorders shows that their foundations are not based on excessive conformity with the norms and values that would be expected of girls of the affluent classes but have more to do with a ""pathological use"" of the norms of excellence in response to the tensions encountered at this age.
problem-solving	we investigated family members' lived experience of parkinson 's disease (pd) aiming to investigate opportunities for well-being. a lifeworld-led approach to healthcare was adopted. interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to explore in-depth interviews with people living with pd and their partners. the analysis generated four themes: it 's more than just an illness revealed the existential challenge of diagnosis; like a bird with a broken wing emphasizing the need to adapt to increasing immobility through embodied agency; being together with pd exploring the kinship within couples and belonging experienced through support groups; and carpe diem! illuminated the significance of time and fractured future orientation created by diagnosis. findings were interpreted using an existential-phenomenological theory of well-being. we highlighted how partners shared the impact of pd in their own ontological challenges. further research with different types of families and in different situations is required to identify services required to facilitate the process of learning to live with pd. care and support for the family unit needs to provide emotional support to manage threats to identity and agency alongside problem-solving for bodily changes. adopting a lifeworld-led healthcare approach would increase opportunities for well-being within the pd illness journey.
false_memories	interpersonal reality monitoring (irm) refers to our ability to evaluate whether other people 's memories reflect real or imagined events. the current work examined irm and whether or not it can be affected by training and feedback. we found that people are better than chance and that the ability to accurately make this judgement can be improved or reduced with appropriate and inappropriate training, respectively. understanding irm has implications for applied psychologists interested in how people evaluate others' descriptions of past events (e.g., eyewitness testimony).
nonverbal_communication	in this paper, we conduct research on differences of uighur han chinese communication etiquette customs and the psychological characteristics under cross-cultural environment. empathy is the process of cross-cultural communication subject and adapts to each other and good a better means of communication. in cross-cultural communication, we must improve on the sensitivity of the taboo, taboo customs of different peoples and nations. in this way can eliminate communication barriers and conflict, to achieve smooth with the harmonious language communication. this article will use the theory of intercultural communication with the understanding of the uygur traditional culture as can dissolve the contradictions and obstacles of the communication. this article from two aspects of the language communication, nonverbal communication in the process of cross-cultural communication problems enumerated and analyzed which will be meaningful.
schizophrenia	methamphetamine (meth) is a widely abused stimulant drug, but this abuse is associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis. in addition to its well-known action on brain dopamine, meth also affects serotonergic (5-ht) neurons. the aim of this study was to investigate this role in mice, which lack one of the main serotonin receptors, the 5-ht1a receptor, which has been implicated in both schizophrenia and meth-induced psychosis. male and female wild-type or 5-ht1a knockout (ko) mice received daily treatment with increasing doses of methamphetamine from 6 to 9 weeks of age (1-4 mg/kg/ day twice a day). at least 2 weeks after the last injection, the mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests focusing on psychosis-related behaviors, including meth-induced hyperactivity, prepulse inhibition (ppi), social interaction, elevated plus maze (epm), and y-maze. meth pretreatment resulted in significantly increased hyperlocomotion in response to an acute meth challenge, but this effect was independent of genotype. chronic meth treatment resulted in decreased levels of anxiety in the epm in both sexes, as well as increased startle responses in female mice only, again independent of genotype. 5-ht1a ko mice showed an increased locomotor response to acute meth in both sexes, as well as increased ppi and decreased startle responses in female mice only, independent of meth pretreatment. in conclusion, the effects of chronic meth appear unaffected by the absence of the 5-ht1a receptor. these results do not support a role of the 5-ht1a receptor in meth-induced psychosis.
child_abuse	the mechanisms by which childhood socioeconomic status (cses) affects adult mental health, general health, and well-being are not clear. moreover, the analytical assumptions employed when assessing mediation in social and psychiatric epidemiology are rarely explained. the aim of this paper was to explain the intermediate confounding assumption, and to quantify differential recall bias in the association between cses, childhood abuse, and mental health (scl-10), general health (eq-5d), and subjective well-being (swls). furthermore, we assessed the mediating role of psychological and physical abuse in the association between cses and mental health, general health, and well-being; and the influence of differential recall bias in the estimation of total effects, direct effects, and proportion of mediated effects. the assumptions employed when assessing mediation are explained with reference to a causal diagram. poisson regression models (relative risk, rr and 99% cis) were used to assess the association between cses and psychological and physical abuse in childhood. mediation analysis (difference method) was used to assess the indirect effect of cses (through psychological and physical abuse in childhood) on mental health, general health, and well-being. exposure (cses) was measured at two time points. mediation was assessed with both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. psychological abuse and physical abuse mediated the association between cses and adult mental health, general health, and well-being (616% among men and 714% among women, p < 0.001). the results suggest that up to 27% of the association between cses and childhood abuse, 23% of the association between childhood abuse, and adult mental health, general health, and well-being, and 44% of the association between cses and adult mental health, general health, and well-being is driven by differential recall bias. assessing mediation with cross-sectional data (exposure, mediator, and outcome measured at the same time) showed that the total effects and direct effects were vastly overestimated (biased upwards). consequently, the proportion of mediated effects were underestimated (biased downwards). if there is a true (unobserved) direct or indirect effect, and the direction of the differential recall bias is predictable, then the results of cross-sectional analyses should be discussed in light of that.
seasonal_affective_disorder	major depressive disorder (mdd) presents with a variety of symptoms and responds to a wide range of treatment interventions. diagnostic criteria collapse multiple syndromes with distinct etiologies into the same disorder. mdd is typically understood as a malfunction of neurotransmission or brain circuitry regulating mood, pleasure and reward, or executive function. however, research from an evolutionary perspective suggests that the ""normal"" functioning of adaptations may also generate symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria. functioning adaptations may be an underappreciated etiological pathway to mdd. many adaptive functions for depressive symptoms have been suggested: biasing cognition to avoid losses, conserving energy, disengaging from unobtainable goals, signaling submission, soliciting resources, and promoting analytical thinking. we review the potential role of these adaptive functions and how they can lead to specific clusters of depressive symptoms. understanding mod from such a perspective reduces the heterogeneity of cases and may help to select the best intervention for each patient. we discuss the implications of different adaptive and maladaptive etiological pathways for the use of antidepressants and various modes of psychotherapy. in particular, instances of mdd caused by functioning adaptations may benefit most from treatments that support the adaptive function, or that target the precipitating causal stressor. we conclude that an evolutionary approach to the study of mdd may be one of the more promising approaches to reduce its heterogeneity and to better match patients and treatment.

prejudice	researchers have extensively documented sociodemographic predictors of race and gender attitudes, and the mechanisms through which such attitudes are formed and change. despite its growing recognition as an important status characteristic, sexual orientation has received little attention as a predictor of americans' race and gender attitudes. using nationally representative data from the american national election survey 2012 time series study, i compare heterosexuals' and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (lgb) people 's attitudes about sexuality, race, and gender. for most attitudes, lgb people hold significantly more liberal attitudes about sexuality, race, and gender than do heterosexuals, even upon controlling for other powerful sociodemographic determinants of social attitudes. however, a substantial proportion of these sexual orientation gaps in attitudes especially about race and gender - are explained by lgb people 's relatively liberal political ideology. the findings provide evidence for the necessity of incorporating sexual orientation in future assessments of americans' social and political attitudes.

prejudice	purpose: this study explored the utility of the california health interview survey (chis) to compare health-related outcomes among gay men, lesbians, and heterosexuals who reported being in a legally recognized partnership. methods: we regressed sexual identity and marriage/legally recognized partnership status on seven different outcomes related to health insurance coverage, medical services access and use, and general health and wellbeing using chis data collected between 2009 and 2013. results: there were 1432 respondents who identified as gay, lesbian, or homosexual, and 67,746 who identified as heterosexual. the percentage of participants who reported being married/ legally partnered was 54.06% for heterosexual women, 52.93% for heterosexual men, 38.83% for lesbians, and 23.56% for gay men. legally partnered/married gay and lesbian respondents were more likely to have health insurance and use healthcare than their counterparts not in such partnerships; few trends were statistically significant. gay men in legally recognized partnerships were more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report continuous health insurance coverage, a usual medical care source, and at least one provider visit within the past 12 months. we found statistically significant poorer health status outcomes among lesbians in legally recognized partnerships compared to married heterosexual women. conclusions: lesbians in legally recognized partnerships did not fare as well as married heterosexual women. gay men in legally recognized partnerships fared better than married heterosexual men on some measures. chis questionnaire structures limited our sample and analyses. we recommend that chis and other researchers ask partnered status-, marriage-, and sexual identity-related questions en bloc to ensure more robust representation, analyses, recommendations, and policy resolutions.
media_violence	this study investigated participant 's reactions to hate crime versus nonbiased crime incident reports that included more or less detail about the crime using a 2 (victim race: african american, unstated) x 2 (amount of information: vague, detailed) between-subjects factorial design. we hypothesized that participants would be more sympathetic, more distressed, and blame the victim less if the victim was african american (designating a hate crime) and if more detail was included in the incident report. the results generally showed greater psychological impact for a hate crime versus nonbiased crime and when more information was presented than with vague information, and these two manipulations did not interact in influencing participants' reactions. these results indicate that amount of detail provided about a crime should be considered when publishing incident reports.
schizophrenia	the association between social networks and improved mental and physical health is well documented in the literature, but mental health services rarely routinely intervene to improve an individual 's social network. this review summarises social participation intervention models to illustrate different approaches which practitioners use, highlight gaps in the evidence base and suggest future directions for research. a systematic search of electronic databases was conducted, and social participation interventions were grouped into six categories using a modified narrative synthesis approach. nineteen interventions from 14 countries were identified, six of which were evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. they were grouped together as: individual social skills training; group skills training; supported community engagement; group-based community activities; employment interventions; and peer support interventions. social network gains appear strongest for supported community engagement interventions, but overall, evidence was limited. the small number of heterogeneous studies included in this review, which were not quality appraised, tentatively suggests that social participation interventions may increase individuals' social networks. future research needs to use experimental designs with sufficient samples and follow-up periods longer than 12 months to enable us to make firm recommendations for mental health policy or practice.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the generalizability of the psychopathy construct to eastern european cultures has not been well-studied, and no prior studies have evaluated psychopathy in non-offender samples from this population. the current validation study examines the factor structure, internal consistency, and external validity of the bulgarian translation of the hare psychopathy checklist: screening version. two hundred sixty-two bulgarian adults from the general community were assessed, of which 185 had a history of substance dependence. confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit for the two-, three-, and four-factor models of psychopathy. zero-order and partial correlation analyses were conducted between the two factors of psychopathy and criterion measures of antisocial behavior, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, personality traits, addictive disorders and demographic characteristics. relationships to external variables provided evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the psychopathy construct in a bulgarian community sample.
depression	depression and hypertension frequently present together in clinical practice. evaluating the interaction between depression and hypertension would help stakeholders better understand the value of depression prevention in primary care. this retrospective study aimed to evaluate the excessive burden of depression on overall health and on health care utilization expenditure among hypertensive patients. a total of 7019 hypertensive patients (icd-9-cm: 401) were identified from the 2012 medical expenditure panel survey (meps 2012) data, of which 936 patients had depression (icd-9-cm: 311). hypertension with depression was associated with worse health status (physical component score, -3.97 [17.9% reduction]; mental component score, -9.14 [9% reduction]), higher utilization of health care services (outpatient visits, 6.4 [63.8% higher]; nights of hospitalization, 0.9 [100% higher]; medication prescription, 22.6 [76.8% higher]), and higher health care expenditures (inpatient, $1953.2 [72% higher]; prescription drugs, $1995.5 [82% higher]).
person_perception	the study aimed to assess whether showing emotion in an organizational inquiry into failure affects perceptions of truthfulness as a function of the match between the explanation of what caused the failure and the emotion expressed. two web-based studies were conducted. participants with work experience saw videos of an inquiry and rated the protagonist 's truthfulness. in both studies protagonists who expressed an emotion (anger or shame) were rated as less truthful than protagonists who expressed no emotion, regardless of what the failure was attributed to. in order to not confound effects of emotions with occupational stereotype effects only male protagonists were shown. showing emotions when questioned is normal. managers have to be aware of a tendency to count this against the employee. this is the only research focusing on the effects of showing emotions on perceptions of truthfulness in an organizational context.
antisocial_personality_disorder	background: young offenders are known to be a population with high prevalence of mental health disorders. in most cases, these disorders are neither identified nor treated properly, with the majority of them being chronic and difficult to treat. in many countries, the prevalence rates of psychopathology in male young offenders are still unknown and no psychotherapeutic interventions are delivered. therefore, the main goal of the present study was to assess mental health problems in portuguese male young offenders placed in either custodial or community-based programs and discuss treatment implications within the juvenile justice interventions. methods: participants in this study included 217 male young offenders aged between 14 and 20 years old that were randomly selected using a random number table. from the total sample, 122 (56.3 %) participants were placed in juvenile detention facilities, and 95 (43.7 %) were receiving community-based programs. participants were interviewed with the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview for children and adolescents, a structured interview that assesses dsm-iv axis i mental disorders. participants aged 18 years or older were also assessed with the antisocial personality disorder section from the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv axis ii personality disorders. results: results showed a high prevalence of mental health disorders, with a global prevalence of 91.2 % in the total sample. in both groups, global prevalence rates were equally high (93.4 % in youth in custodial versus 88.4 % in youth in community-based programs). substance-related disorders were more prevalent in youth placed in juvenile facilities, whereas anxiety and mood disorders were more often found in the community-based group. moreover, oppositional defiant disorder was more prevalent in youth from the community, whereas antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder were less prevalent than expected in this same group. a high comorbidity rate was also found, with the majority of participants from both groups' fulfilling criteria for two or more disorders. additionally, participants with conduct disorder were over four times more likely to fulfill criteria for substance abuse. conclusions: our findings inform about specific needs concerning mental health intervention that should be taken into account when deciding and planning rehabilitation programs for male young offenders, either from custodial or community-based programs.
seasonal_affective_disorder	we investigated whether transcranial bright light (tbl) affects nocturnal melatonin and cortisol secretion in sham-controlled crossover trial. young healthy adults were exposed in random order to 24 minutes of tbl or sham exposure via ear canals at 01:10 h. saliva and urine samples were collected hourly between 21 h-03 h and 06 h-09 h. there were no significant differences in melatonin or cortisol concentrations between tbl and sham exposures at any sampling point indicating that tbl via ear canals does not suppress nocturnal melatonin secretion. thus, non-visual effects of tbl are mediated via a pathway not involving melatonin suppression.
problem-solving	dha from diet or endogenous synthesis has been proposed to affect infant development, however, results are inconclusive. in this study, we aim to verify previously observed fatty acid desaturase gene cluster (fads) snp-specific associations with erythrocyte dha status in 9-month-old children and sex-specific association with developmental outcomes. the study was performed in 166 children (55 % boys) of obese mothers. erythrocyte fatty acid composition was analysed in blood-samples obtained at 9 months of age, and developmental outcomes assessed by the ages and stages questionnaire at 3 years. erythrocyte dha level ranged from 44 to 99 % of fatty acids, but did not show any association with fads snp or other potential determinants. regression analysis showed associations between erythrocyte dha and scores for personal-social skills ( 18 (95 % ci 03, 33), p=0019) and problem solving ( 34 (95 % ci 12, 56), p=0003). a tendency was observed for an association in opposite direction between minor alleles (g-variant) of rs1535 and rs174575 and personal-social skills (p=0062 and 0068, respectively), which became significant when the snp were combined based on their previously observed effect on erythrocyte dha at 9 months of age ( 26 (95 % ci 001, 51), p=0011). sex-snp interaction was indicated for rs174575 genotype on fine motor scores (p=0016), due to higher scores among minor allele carrying girls (p=0043), whereas no effect was seen among boys. in conclusion, dha-increasing fads snp and erythrocyte dha status were consistently associated with improved personal-social skills in this small cohort of children of obese mothers irrespective of sex, but the sample was too small to verify potential sex-specific effects.
gender_roles	women who experience gender-based violence (gbv) are at increased risk for hiv. to better understand causal mechanisms, qualitative interviews were conducted with 48 african american women, who reported recent gbv and who were recruited from areas in atlanta, ga, deemed high risk for hiv infection. women were tested for chlamydia (9.4%), gonorrhea (7.5%), and trichomoniasis (28.3%). key themes were history of abuse, stereotypical gender roles, concurrency, and social support. hiv prevention programs need to address societ al, cultural, and relational influences that play a role in men perpetrating gbv while also addressing risk and protective factors for women to engage in safer sex.
gender_roles	purpose - a number of postmodern consumer scholars have their attention on the consumption behaviour of neo-tribes. changing gender roles and households' consumption practices have also shaped new sets of cultural manifestations for the clothing consumption milieu. the purpose of this paper is to explore the clothing consumption culture of a neo-tribe, gay professionals within the subculture of gay consumers. design/methodology/approach - an extended conceptual framework built upon ajzen and fishbein 's (1980) theory of ""reasoned action"" served as the conceptual guideline for this study. specifically, the attitude-behaviour framework is proposed and employed to better understand the clothing consumption behaviour of a neo-tribe consisting of gay professionals. personal in-depth interviews were conducted in a metropolitan city as well as two small towns in canada. findings - stereotypical as well as non-stereotypical understandings are offered. the findings from this study portrayed the gay professions of this neo-tribe as rational and practical. personal psychological factors, social factors and marketplace factors relevant to a neo-tribe of gay professionals are documented and deeper insights are presented. research limitations/implications - findings challenge the existing understanding of fashion manifestation for this consumers group. however, this study may be of limited scope. future studies should further examine the clothing consumption cultural manifestations of other neo-tribes within the gay community. practical implications - the interviewees consistently demonstrated their positive attitudes towards quality, stylish and conservative clothing. for marketers it is crucial to perceive the gay community as a non-homogeneous market segment. there is a need to understand different consumption practices within this community and to tailor marketing mix elements accordingly. originality/value - this study has extended the understanding of the neo-tribes of gay consumers. in addition, this study offers the clothing consumption reality of a neo-tribe encompassing gay professionals. this study illuminates their rational and practical clothing consumption cultural manifestations and clothing consumption behaviour. these insights further enrich the general understandings that exist in the area of consumer research.
leadership	with the uptake of distance learning (dl), which has actually been marginal for most academics, teaching contexts, traditional power structures and relationships have been transformed, leaving lecturers potentially disenfranchised. institutional and cultural change is vital, particularly changes concerning academic roles. the advent of dl has caused role ambiguity; however published literature related to academic roles is confusing and lacks clear guidance. for academics involved in post graduate clinical education, information is even more incomplete. using a framework of communities, this study is a direct response to these concerns. the aim was to systematically and critically evaluate the implementation of clinical dl in an effort to improve practice. maintaining a practitioner inquiry methodology, this study investigated the development and delivery of a new dl module. data collection consisted of documentary analysis of meetings, interviews with staff and students, student evaluations and analytics. data analysis incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methods to triangulate the research findings. new competencies for academics emerged, including leadership and management. barriers to staff progress included: ambiguity in roles, lack of leadership and unpreparedness for responsibilities, time, and workload. student barriers included: time, fear, relevance of learning, isolation and increased autonomy. explicit planning, organisational support and working within communities were requisite to create a 'sustaining' technology. this study contributes to educational practice on two levels. firstly, by striving for rigour, it demonstrates that practitioner inquiry is a legitimate research approach that is accessible and valuable to teachers. secondly, it adds to useful and applied knowledge concerning dl practice. avoiding traditional workload assumptions that are erroneous and inaccurate, this study provides new models of organisational roles and responsibilities. the results challenge the evolutionary nature of academia, suggesting working in communities and new competencies are required whilst traditional roles and culture must be redefined.
problem-solving	according to cognitive load theory, using worked examples is an effective and efficient instructional strategy for initial cognitive skill acquisition for novice learners, as it reduces cognitive load and frees up cognitive resources to build task competence. contrary to this, productive failure (as well as invention learning, desirable difficulties and other problem-solving-first) frameworks suggest that scaffolded problem-solving activities (a generation phase) preceding explicit instruction enhance learners' performance. the reported experimental study investigated the effectiveness of different levels of instructional guidance provided to students during the learning phase preceding explicit instruction in standard solution procedures in enhancing students' engagement and transfer problem-solving skills. specifically, the study compared partially-guided or unguided attempts at generating problem solutions as opposed to comprehensive guidance, in the form of a worked example. levels of experienced cognitive load and learner motivation were evaluated in addition to delayed post-test performance scores. there were no differences between the three groups on the transfer post-test outcomes, even though the condition with fully-guided worked examples prior to the explicit instruction expectedly reduced cognitive load relative to the conditions without such guidance. there were also differences between the conditions on some sub-dimensions of the motivation scale. in general, the findings indicate that similar overall outcomes (delayed transfer performance) could be achieved by different sequences of instructional tasks aimed at achieving different sets of specific goals.
depression	social jet lag is a term describing misalignment between social and biological times. in this article, it is argued that the currently used formula for social jet lag captures not only this misalignment, but also sleep debt resulting from sleep deprivation during workdays. it is proposed to adopt the sleep-corrected formula for social jet lag, which takes the form of the difference between the sleep onset on free days and workdays in the case of subjects with longer sleep and later (or equal) sleep onset on free days compared to workdays; it takes the form of the difference between the sleep offset on free days and workdays for subjects with longer sleep and earlier (or equal) sleep offset on workdays compared to free days.
eating_disorders	the overall aim of this study is to specifically investigate how young adults make use of emotional relational food memories related to ""significant others"" during childhood when trying to build resilience and solve developmental tasks in this period of life. a theoretical sample of three semi-structured interviews drawn from a larger sample of 30 interviews with young adults in sweden formed the basis for analysis, guided by the steps of a phenomenologically oriented critical narrative analysis. the results illustrate three different overall directions in how the relationship to food can evolve throughout life among young adults: a relationship dominated by 1) positive emotional food memories associated with the use of food as a secure base and 2) negative emotional food memories associated with either a) being emotionally preoccupied with food orb) dismissing food. the results suggest that internalised memories related to food associated with positive emotions can be used to build resilience, by helping young people to adapt and better manage developmental stress. internalised food memories related to negative emotions can cause vulnerability, but also become the object of a person 's reconstruction. the implications and potential risks of using food practice for developing resilience and a healthy lifestyle are discussed.

prenatal_development	indian hedgehog (ihh) is widely recognized as an essential factor for proper skeletal development. previous in vivo studies using mutant ihh mouse models were limited by perinatal lethality or carried out after a growth plate formed. thus the important role of ihh in mesenchymal cell differentiation has not been investigated. in this study, we established prx1-cre;ihh(fl/fl) mice to ablate ihh specifically in limb mesenchyme to allow us to observe the phenotype continuously from prenatal development to 3 weeks of age. mutant mice displayed severe limb abnormalities characterized by complete lack of secondary ossification center and growth plate, indicating an essential role for ihh in the development of these structures. interestingly, we discovered that osteoblast differentiation and bone formation could occur in conditions of deficient ihh. this is a novel finding that has not been observed because of the early lethality of previous ihh mutants. mature osteoblasts expressing osteocalcin could be detected in the center of mutant bones at postnatal day 10 (p10). osteoclasts and blood vessel formation were also present, suggesting active bone remodeling. histomorphometric analyses show significant increase in osteoclast number with no major changes in bone formation rate at 3 weeks of age. mutant long bones in the limbs were deformed, with cortices comprised of irregular woven bone. also, there was a marked decrease in gene expression of osteoblastic and osteocytic markers. moreover, mutant long bones displayed bone dysplasia in which we observed increased osteoclast activity and partially reduced osteoblastic and osteocytic differentiation that lead ultimately to loss of bone structures at 3 weeks of age. in summary, our data show or the first time, the presence of mature osteoblasts in long bones of the limbs despite the complete loss of growth plate formation due to ihh deficiency. these data indicate an important function for ihh in regulating limb mesenchymal cell differentiation.

eating_disorders	introduction: eating disorders are an important factor in menstrual cycle disorders in girls. moreover, low self-esteem among adolescent girls may be a risk factor for eating disorders. the aim of the study was to assess the menstrual cycle, eating habits and self-esteem of polish adolescents.methods: the study was conducted from january 2014 to march 2015 and included 623 girls, aged 15-19, from randomly selected junior high schools in silesia, poland, in which their menstrual cycle, risk of eating disorders and self-esteem were evaluated. a five-part questionnaire was used to assess basic demographic data, lifestyle and physical activity, gynecological history, as well as rosenberg self-esteem scale (ses) and eating attitude test (eat-26).results: irregular menstrual cycles were observed in 236 (37.88%) girls; 5.20% presented secondary amenorrhea. based on the eat-26 test, 101 (16.21%) girls were indicated being at risk for an eating disorder. low self-esteem was observed in 340 (54.57%) study girls on the base of ses.discussion: girls with irregular menses had higher scores on the eat-26 test in subscales: eat-overall score, eat-diet and eat-bulimia, while lower scores on the ses. in our study, we did not observe a significant relationship between exercise intensity, body mass, bmi and menstrual cycle regularity. low self-esteem among adolescent girls may be a risk factor for eating disorders which could interrupt the menstrual cycle.
schizophrenia	this paper gives an overview of the most important german-language diagnostic instruments suitable for use in schizophrenia. the procedures are implemented in different phases of the disorder, depending on the nature of questions involved. in addition to clinical interviews for diagnostic classification, self-rating and observer rating scales of psychopathological symptoms are presented. the procedures described take into account psychotic phenomena (e. g., delusions, hallucinations) as well as quality of life, insight, and social consequences of the disorder.
schizophrenia	schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious neuropsychiatric disorders of uncertain etiology. recent studies indicate that immune activation may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. numerous studies in animal models indicate that the mucosal microbiome may influence cognition and behavior by altering the functioning of the immune system. it is thus likely that the microbiome plays a role in human psychiatric disorders. the study of immune alterations and the microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is in its infancy. two recent investigations of the oro-pharyngeal microbiota in schizophrenia found differences between cases and controls. other studies have found increased gastrointestinal inflammation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder based on measures of microbial translocation. several studies have also found an association between the receipt of antibiotics and an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders, perhaps due to alterations in the microbiome. studies to characterize the intestinal microbiome of individuals with these disorders are in progress. the ultimate test of the role of the microbiome and immune-mediated pathology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder will come from clinical trials of therapeutic agents which alter gut microbiota or gastrointestinal inflammation. the successful development of such modalities would represent a novel strategy to prevent and treat serious psychiatric disorders.

leadership	research summary: past inquiry has found that implementing complex competitive repertoires (i.e., diverse and dynamic arrays of actions) is challenging, but firms benefit from doing so. our examination of the antecedents and outcomes of complex competitive repertoires develops a more nuanced perspective. data from 1,168 firms in 204 industries reveal that complexity initially harms performance, but then becomes a positive factor, except at high levels. we use agency and tournament theories, respectively, to examine how key governance mechanismsownership structure and executive compensationhelp shape firms' competitive repertoires. we find that the principals of agency theory and the pay gap of tournament theory are both important antecedents of competitive complexity, and an interaction exists wherein firms build especially complex repertoires when both influences are strong.managerial summary: in boxing, the fight does not always go to the bigger or stronger person, or even to whomever throws the most punchesthe fight is sometimes won by the boxer who is unpredictable, such as throwing an uppercut when the opponent expected a right hook. similarly, when companies compete in the marketplace, advantage is afforded not only to those with more resources or who engage in more competitive activity, but also to those whose actions are unpredictable. in this study, we develop the notion of competitive complexity, which describes the diversity and changing nature of a company 's competitive moves. implementing complex competitive repertoires can be painful in the short term but, if done correctly, can help company performance in the long run. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
borderline_personality_disorder	while the public health burden posed by borderline personality disorder (bpd) rivals that associated with other major mental illnesses, the prevailing disposition of psychiatrists toward the disorder remains characterized by misinformation, stigma, aversive attitudes, and insufficient familiarity with effective generalist treatments that can be delivered in nonspecialized health care settings. residency training programs are well positioned to better equip the next generation of psychiatrists to address these issues, but no consensus or guidelines currently exist for what and how residents should be taught about managing bpd. instead, disproportionately limited curricular time, teaching of non-evidence-based approaches, and modeling of conceptually confused combinations of techniques drawn from specialty bpd treatments are offered. in this article, we (1) explain why training in a generalist model is sensible and why alternative approaches are not appropriate for residents, (2) propose a plan for giving residents adequate training via a generalist model, highlighting minimal didactic and clinical-training objectives (dubbed core competencies and milestones) and a model curriculum developed at the massachusetts general hospital/mclean hospital residency program, and (3) describe obstacles to implementation of effective generalist training posed by infrastructural, faculty-centered, and resident-centered variables.
leadership	background: chest compressions are a core element of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. despite periodic training, real-life chest compressions have been reported to be overly shallow and/or fast, very likely affecting patient outcomes. we investigated the effect of a brief crew resource management (crm) training program on the correction rate of improperly executed chest compressions in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. methods: final-year medical students (n = 57) were randomised to receive a 10-min computer-based crm or a control training on ethics. acting as team leaders, subjects performed resuscitation in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario before and after the training. team members performed standardised overly shallow and fast chest compressions. we analysed how often the team leader recognised and corrected improper chest compressions, as well as communication and resuscitation quality. results: after the crm training, team leaders corrected improper chest compressions (35.5%) significantly more often compared with those undergoing control training (7.7%, p = 0.03*). consequently, four students have to be trained (number needed to treat = 3.6) for one improved chest compression scenario. communication quality assessed by the leader behavior description questionnaire significantly increased in the intervention group by a mean of 4.5 compared with 2.0 (p = 0.01*) in the control group. conclusion: a computer-based, 10-min crm training improved the recognition of ineffective of chest compressions. furthermore, communication quality increased. as guideline-adherent chest compressions have been linked to improved patient outcomes, our crm training might represent a brief and affordable approach to increase chest compression quality and potentially improve patient outcomes.
borderline_personality_disorder	objective: building on recent models of anorexia nervosa (an) that emphasize the importance of impaired social cognition in the development and maintenance of the disorder, the present study aimed at examining whether women with an have more difficulties with inferring other people 's emotional and nonemotional mental states than healthy women. method: social cognition was assessed in 25 adult women with an and 25 age-matched healthy women. to overcome limitations of previous research on social cognition in an, the processing of social information was examined in a more complex and ecologically valid manner. the movie for the assessment of social cognition (masc) reflects complex real-life social interaction and allows for disentangling emotional and non-emotional mental state inference as well as different types of errors in mentalizing. results: women with an showed poorer emotional mental state inference, whereas non-emotional mental state inference was largely intact. groups did not differ in undermentalizing (overly simplistic theory of mind) and overmentalizing (overly complex or over-interpretative mental state reasoning). performance in the masc was independent of levels of eating disorder psychopathology and symptoms of depression and anxiety. discussion: the findings suggest that an is associated with specific difficulties in emotional mental state inference despite largely intact nonemotional mental state inference. upon replication in larger samples, these findings advocate a stronger emphasis on socio-emotional processing in an treatment.

leadership	after large hadron collider will be turned off, a new, more energetic machine will be needed in order to explore unknown regions of the high-energy physics. for this reason, the project future circular collider (fcc) has started, with the goal of developing a 100-km-circumference collider of 50 tev proton beams. the eurocircol collaboration is part of the fccstudy under the european community leadership, and it aims to develop a conceptual design of fcc till 2019. one of the main targets is to design a bending dipole able to reach 16 t operation magnetic field, in order to accomplish the size and energy constraints. such a magnetic field can be reached using nb3sn conductors. one option under exploration is the cos. dipole, by infn of milano and genova. because of the high stored energy and the large current densities due to the conductor performances, quench protection is one of the most challenging aspects of the design. in this paper, the quench protection of the cos. design is presented. a standard quench protection study is accompanied by a less conservative study which includes ac effects on the power dissipation inside the coils and on the magnet inductance, in order to not exclude preventively more convenient designs, and to develop a more performing magnet as possible.
prejudice	in 1988, jock collins boldly suggested that australia 's earlier migrant arrivals, the subject of prejudice themselves, often become the perpetrators of prejudice. indeed, as we collect oral histories from post-war migrants, we are regularly confronted with angry statements such as asylum seekers are just let in and given everything. what lies at the heart of this phenomenon? clearly, prejudice and stereotyping exists in all societies but seems to be particularly evident in societies where an ongoing flow of migrants continues to change and alter the ethnic and racial mix. this article reflects upon research conducted in the hostel stories project, where we frequently were confronted with stereotyped, prejudicial, and even racist comments about other migrants and refugees during interviews with migrants. these statements made us ask whether collins was correct in his observations. drawing on the literature from various disciplines, we consider various influences on migrant attitudes towards other migrants. we propose that it is critical to continue to progress beyond the conventional topics explored in migration studies and ask difficult questions in order to contribute to a growing global discussion on ethnicity and intergroup relations, especially in relation to prejudice and racism.
eating_disorders	anorexia nervosa (an) continues to remain poorly understood within eating disorders. recent research and theory have moved away from understanding its aetiological causes, addressing instead potential maintaining factors. this study is focused on interpersonal maintenance factors: the response of close others. relatives of those with an typically carry the main burden of care, and research has found high levels of carer distress and unmet needs. recent theories have proposed this emotional impact to contribute to expressed emotion and other unhelpful caregiver interactions which inadvertently maintain an. one such understudied response is accommodation, described as a process' whereby caregivers assist or participate' in symptomatic behaviours of the cared for individual. there is a dearth of research relating to accommodation within eating disorders, particularly qualitative accounts. this study utilized a grounded theory methodology to explore caregivers' responses to managing an, focusing particularly on carers' experience of accommodation. eight participants with experience of caring for an individual diagnosed with an were interviewed. participants were recruited from a national eating disorder charity and regional eating disorder service. a number of themes emerged, including the importance of caregivers' emotional resources in mediating accommodation responses. low-perceived efficacy over an contributed to caregiver burnout. decreased emotional resources influenced a shift in caregiving aims conducive with accommodation. nevertheless, carers perceived accommodation as counterproductive to recovery and consequently experienced internal conflict (cognitive dissonance). dissonance was reduced using a number of cognitive and behavioural strategies. the implications of these findings are discussed with reference to existing literature. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
person_perception	recent neuroimaging work has identified a network of regions that work in concert to update impressions of other people, particularly in response to inconsistent behavior. however, the specific functional contributions of these regions to the updating process remain unclear. using fmri, we tested whether increases in activity triggered by inconsistent behavior reflect changes in the stored representations of other people in response to behavioral inconsistency, or merely a response to the inconsistency itself. participants encountered a series of individuals whose behavior either changed in an attributionally meaningful fashion or was merely inconsistent with the immediately preceding behavior. we observed that left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlpfc) and left inferior frontal gyrus (ifg) were preferentially recruited in response to unexpected, immoral behavior, whereas a separate set of regions (including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal junction/inferior parietal lobule) was preferentially recruited in response to more mundane inconsistencies in behavior. these results shed light on the distributed systems supporting impression updating. specifically, while many regions supporting updating may primarily respond to moment-to-moment changes in behavior, a subset of regions (e.g. vlpfc and ifg) may contribute to updating person representations in response to trait-relevant changes in behavior.
eating_disorders	this article is about surviving life with help of comic books, with an abusive mother in the middle of a rural denmark in the 1980s.
nonverbal_communication	using a music therapy approach to assess emotional communication and parent-child interaction is new to the field of child protection. however, musical improvisations in music therapy has long been known as an analogue to affect attunement and early non-verbal communication between parent and infant, which called for an investigation of the value of music therapy within the field of family assessment and family therapy. more specifically, we wanted to investigate and further strengthen assessment of parenting competencies (apc). we developed scores and examined the psychometric properties of the apc-r (revised version) in a quantitative study including a small, embedded qualitative component. a total of 52 dyads of children and their parents participated of whom 18 were in residential center to address emotional neglect and 33 functioned as a non-clinical comparison (children aged 5-12). all dyads underwent two video recorded music therapy assessment sessions. video analyses focused on autonomy relationship, turns, and parental response types producing scores on mutual attunement, nonverbal communication skills and emotional parental response. psychometric analyses of the apc-r included interrater reliability, test re-test reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity. we concluded that apc-r is reliable and valid and adds to the existing observational instruments of parent-child interaction.
leadership	cultural values regarding gender roles encourage gender discrimination and the practice of sex selection. increasing political and work force participation of women challenges such norms. exploiting the implementation of an indian law that required one-third of local political seats to be reserved for women, i investigate the impact of female leadership on sex selection in rural india. i find an increase in the survival of higher birth order girls if political seats at the local level have been reserved for women. i argue that the likely underlying mechanism is a change in beliefs due to exposure to female leaders.
child_abuse	a correlation between socioeconomic disadvantage and child maltreatment has long been observed, but the drivers of this association are poorly understood. we sought to estimate the effects of economic factors on risk of child maltreatment after adjusting for other known influences using the australian temperament project, a population-based birth cohort of 2443 individuals and their parents. we used logistic regression to estimate associations of childhood economic factors (parental education, occupation, and unemployment; type of housing; and retrospective perception of poverty) with retrospective reports of perceived child maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and witnessing of domestic violence), controlling for demographic factors, parental mental health and substance use, and child health. we then used these estimates to approximate the proportions of child maltreatment population attributable fractions that are theoretically preventable by addressing childhood economic disadvantage. economic factors were associated with all types of child maltreatment. for the most part, these associations diminished only partially when controlling for noneconomic con-founders, supporting hypotheses of causal relationships. jointly, economic factors were significant predictors of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing of domestic violence but not of emotional abuse or neglect. retrospective perceptions of childhood poverty were, in particular, strongly associated with most forms of child maltreatment but not with sexual abuse after accounting for other economic factors. we estimated that 27% of all child maltreatment was jointly attributable to economic factors. these findings suggest that strategies that reduce economic disadvantage are likely to hold significant potential to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment.

gender_roles	in a simple theoretical framework, egalitarian gender role attitudes emerge as more and more women participate in the labor market. most advanced western nations enjoy relatively gender-egalitarian working environments, and consequently more egalitarian gender attitudes than their east asian counterparts. women in east asian societies, on the other hand, are said to support both the conditions resulting in stagnant female labor-force participation and traditional attitudes toward gender roles. in taiwan, however, women are more economically active than in two other east asian societies-japan and south korea-even though women in all three societies favor the traditional gender division of labor. thus, in taiwan, women experiencing inconsistencies between their active working lives and their traditional values. this study hypothesizes that this inconsistency, or the coexistence of the old and the new, is reflected in the very mind-set of women. using comparative data from the 2006 east asian social survey, we analyzed the gap between responses to questions on gender attitudes in relation to working conditions, and other general gender role attitudes. we found there were significant differences in the size of these gaps. taiwanese women expressed more egalitarian views insofar as the questions were concerned with practical economic interests, while they retained their basic traditional attitudes towards gender roles in their homes. this gap is larger in taiwan than in japan or south korea.
nonverbal_communication	the aim of this work is to model the behavior verbal and nonverbal behavior of a pedagogical agent (pa) can be integrated into an intelligent tutoring system. the following research questions were posed: what is the nonverbal component of an educational communication? how to study this component for a computational model of plausible behavior of a virtual agent? what correlations between educational actions and the direction of gaze of a human agent? to carry out exploratory work, a methodological approach based on multi-modal video corpus study was adopted. within a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and didactics of mathematics, an educational situation in which a virtual pedagogical agent is likely was developed. dyadic interactions between teachers and learners late second early third (15-16 years) in a skills assessment interview in mathematics following the resolution of exercises by students with a mathematics software was filmed. a multi-level annotation scheme to annotate the observed behavior was proposed. the multidisciplinary research subject (its, human-machine interfaces, educational sciences, educational, linguistic etc.) due to the development of the coding scheme a delicate but important work given the wealth of knowledge from different disciplines. after a portion of the collected work annotation corpus statistical measures derived from annotations carried out suggest different strategies for teachers in terms of gaze direction depending on the learner profile and pedagogical actions. these measures have enabled to extract rules to control the nonverbal behavior of a pa.
prenatal_development	prenatal development is highly plastic and readily influenced by the environment. adverse conditions have been shown to alter organ development and predispose offspring to chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. notably, it appears that the changes in glucocorticoid hormones or glucocorticoid receptor (gr) levels in peripheral tissues could play a role in the development of chronic diseases. we have previously demonstrated that in vitro fertilization (ivf) and preimplantation embryo culture is associated with growth alterations and glucose intolerance in mice. however, it is unknown if gr signaling is affected in adult ivf offspring. here we show that gr expression is increased in inbred (c57bl6/j) and outbred (cf-1 x b6d2f1/j) blastocysts following in vitro culture and elevated levels are also present in the adipose tissue of adult male mice. importantly, genes involved in lipolysis and triglyceride synthesis and responsive to gr were also increased in adipose tissue, indicating that increased gr activates downstream gene pathways. the promoter region of gr, previously reported to be epigenetically modified by perinatal manipulation, showed no changes in dna methylation status. our findings demonstrate that ivf results in a long-term change in gr gene expression in a sex-and tissue-specific manner. these changes in adipose tissues may well contribute to the metabolic phenotype in mice conceived by ivf.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: the study aimed to elucidate previously observed associations between morningnesseveningness and depressive symptomatology in university students. relations between components of depressive symptomatology and morningness-eveningness were analysed. methods: nine hundred and seventy-four university students completed polish versions of the centre for epidemiological studies- depression scale (ces-d; polish translation appended to this paper) and the composite scale of morningness. principal component analysis (pca) was used to test the structure of depressive symptoms. pearson and partial correlations (with age and sex controlled), along with regression analyses with morning affect (ma) and circadian preference as predictors, were used. results: pca revealed three components of depressive symptoms: depressed/somatic affect, positive affect, interpersonal relations. greater ma was related to less depressive symptoms in three components. morning circadian preference was related to less depressive symptoms in depressed/somatic and positive affects and unrelated to interpersonal relations. both morningness-eveningness components exhibited stronger links with depressed/somatic and positive affects than with interpersonal relations. three ces-d components exhibited stronger links with ma than with circadian preference. in regression analyses only ma was statistically significant for positive affect and better interpersonal relations, whereas more depressed/somatic affect was predicted by lower ma and morning circadian preference (relationship reversed compared to correlations). limitations: self-report assessment. conclusions: there are three groups of depressive symptoms in polish university students. associations of ma with depressed/somatic and positive affects are primarily responsible for the observed links between morningness-eveningness and depressive symptoms in university students. people with evening circadian preference whose ma is not lowered have less depressed/somatic affect.

social_cognition	background: designing evidence-based interventions to address socioeconomic disparities in health and health behaviours requires a better understanding of the specific explanatory mechanisms. we aimed to investigate a comprehensive range of potential theoretical mediators of physical activity (pa) and screen time in different socioeconomic status (ses) groups: a high ses group of high school students, and a low ses group of vocational school students. the com-b system, including the theoretical domains framework (tdf), was used as a heuristic framework to synthesise different theoretical determinants in this exploratory study. methods: finnish vocational and high school students (n = 659) aged 16-19, responded to a survey assessing psychological, social and environmental determinants of activity (pa and screen time). these determinants are mappable into the com-b domains: capability, opportunity and motivation. the outcome measures were validated self-report measures for pa and screen time. the statistical analyses included a bootstrapping-based mediation procedure. results: regarding pa, there were ses differences in all of the com-b domains. for example, vocational school students reported using less self-monitoring of pa, weaker injunctive norms to engage in regular pa, and fewer intentions than high school students. mediation analyses identified potential mediators of the ses-pa relationship in all of three domains: the most important candidates included self-monitoring (ci95 for b: 0.19-0.47), identity (0.04-0.25) and material resources available (0.01-0.16). however, ses was not related to most determinants of screentime, where there were mainly gender differences. most determinants were similarly related with both behaviours in both ses groups, indicating no major moderation effect of ses on these relationships. conclusions: this study revealed that already in the first years of educational differentiation, levels of key pa determinants differ, contributing to socioeconomic differences in pa. the analyses identified the strongest mediators of the ses-pa association, but additional investigation utilising longitudinal and experimental designs are needed. this study demonstrates the usefulness of combining constructs from various theoretical approaches to better understand the role of distinct mechanisms that underpin socioeconomic health behaviour disparities.
depression	objectivethe aim of our study was to investigate, in bipolar patients, whether affect lability was associated with suicidal ideation incidence during 2-year follow-up, and which subtype of affect lability was associated with suicidal ideation. methoda total of 319 euthymic or mildly depressed bipolar outpatients recruited in the french fondamental advanced centres of expertise for bipolar disorder were divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of suicidal ideation during a 2-year follow-up. affect lability was assessed by the french version of the affect lability scale. resultsbipolar patients with high affect lability were more likely to report suicidal ideation during follow-up, even after adjustment for age, study level, rapid cycling, current depression level, anxiety disorder, and lifetime history sa (or = 2.47; 95% ci [1.15-5.30], p = 0.01). the risk of suicidal ideation increased with the level of affect lability. more specifically, the propensity to switch from neutral to elation affect, from anxious to depressive affect (or inversely), and from neutral to anger affect predicted suicidal ideation. conclusionreducing affective lability could become a new therapeutic target of suicidal prevention in bipolar disorder.
prejudice	with donald trump the republican nominee and hillary clinton the democratic nominee for the 2016 u.s. presidential election, speculations of why trump resonates with many americans are widespread - as are suppositions of whether, independent of party identification, people might vote for hillary clinton. the present study, using a sample of american adults (n = 406), investigated whether two ideological beliefs, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (rwa) and social dominance orientation (sdo) uniquely predicted trump support and voting intentions for clinton. cognitive ability as a predictor of rwa and sdo was also tested. path analyses, controlling for political party identification, revealed that higher rwa and sdo uniquely predicted more favorable attitudes of trump, greater intentions to vote for trump, and lower intentions to vote for clinton. lower cognitive ability predicted greater rwa and sdo and indirectly predicted more favorable trump attitudes, greater intentions to vote for trump and lower intentions to vote for clinton.

media_violence	a small proportion of video game players develop uncontrolled gaming behavior. a dysfunctional cognitive control circuit may explain this excessive behavior. therefore, the current study investigated whether problem garners are characterized by deficits in various aspects of cognitive control (inhibitory control, error processing, attentional control) by measuring brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging during go-nogo and stroop task performance. in addition, both impulsivity and attentional control were measured using self-reports. participants comprised 18 problem garners who were compared with 16 matched casual gaming controls. results indicate significantly increased self-reported impulsivity levels and decreased inhibitory control accompanied by reduced brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (ifg) and right inferior parietal lobe (lpl) in problem garners relative to controls. significant hypoactivation in the left ifg in problem garners was also observed during stroop task performance, but groups did not differ on behavioral and self-reported measures of attentional control. no evidence was found for reduced error processing in problem garners. in conclusion, the current study provides evidence for reduced inhibitory control in problem garners, while attentional control and error processing were mostly intact. these findings implicate that reduced inhibitory control and elevated impulsivity may constitute a neurocognitive weakness in problem garners.

person_perception	background. interpersonal stress generation is an important maintaining factor in major depression; however, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that undermine interpersonal functioning. this study investigated the role of deficits in person perception to this regard. method. depressed patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) completed a false recognition task that measured participants' tendencies to make spontaneous trait inferences (stis), that is to spontaneously ascribe personality traits to other people. participants then reported interpersonal daily hassles for one week following the task. results. tendencies to make stis were significantly higher in depressed patients, particularly those with a history of childhood trauma. the degree to which participants made stis was significantly related to depression severity, and predicted the occurrence of interpersonal daily hassles during follow-up across, but not within groups. conclusions. the results suggest that depressed patients show characteristic biases in person perception that may contribute to the generation of interpersonal stress.
leadership	background: needle exchange programs are safe, highly effective programs for promoting health among people who inject drugs. however, they remain poorly funded, and often illegal, in many places worldwide due to fear and stigma surrounding drug use. continued advocacy, education, and implementation of new needle exchanges are thus essential to improve public health and reduce structural inequality. commentary: we argue that students, and especially professional and graduate students, have the potential to play an important role in advancing harm reduction. students benefit from the respect given to the professions they are training to enter, which gives them leverage to navigate the political hurdles often faced by needle exchange organizers, especially in areas that presently lack services. in addition, due to their relative simplicity, needle exchanges do not require much of the licensing, clinical knowledge, and infrastructure associated with more traditional student programs, such as student-run free medical clinics. students are capable of learning harm reduction cultural approaches and techniques if they remain humble, open-minded, and seek the help of the harm reduction community. consequently, students can generate tremendous benefits to their community without performing beyond their appropriate clinical limitations. students benefit from organizing needle exchanges by gaining applied experience in advocacy, organization-building, and political finesse. working in a needle exchange significantly helps erode stigma against multiple marginalized populations. students in health-related professions additionally learn clinically-relevant knowledge that is often lacking from their formal training, such as an understanding of structural violence and inequality, root causes of substance use, client-centered approaches to health services, and interacting with clients as peers, rather than through the standard hierarchical medical interaction. conclusion: we therefore encourage students to learn about and consider organizing needle exchanges during their training. our experience is that students can be successful in developing sustainable programs which benefit their clients, the broader harm reduction movement, and themselves alike.
attention	when interpreting results of a functional analysis, a clinician may conclude an automatic function either because problem behavior is elevated in the alone/ignore condition relative to other conditions or because problem behavior is elevated and undifferentiated across multiple conditions. in the latter, it is difficult to determine if problem behavior is maintained by automatic reinforcement alone or is multiply maintained. the current study tested for multiply-maintained self-injurious behavior exhibited by two participants by implementing functional analysis contingencies while controlling for automatic reinforcement through sensory extinction. results suggest that self-injury was maintained by automatic reinforcement alone for one participant and both automatic reinforcement and physical attention for another participant. these results were then used to create function-based treatments for self-injury that were successfully generalized across settings and caregivers.
nonverbal_communication	during tabletop gameplay, players monitor each other 's gaze throughout, providing a form of implicit nonverbal communication. a player can infer the intention and potential strategies by estimating the gaze of another, especially in co-located gameplay. this early work-in-progress paper details an exploratory study design that explores the effects of gaze awareness on gameplay, in particular when the gaze of one or more players is augmented over the game and revealed to others. we believe that players may very well change their strategies when gaze becomes 'common knowledge', but can also be used as a form of deception. we will explore these effects with the same game in two settings: a screen-based digital version with players in separate rooms and a co-located tabletop board game version augmented with a projector. this work evaluates the effects of gaze awareness in both settings, providing new insights towards the emerging research of eyeplay.
attention	with the progressive role of computers and their users as actors in social networks, computations alike social network analysis (sna) are gaining in attention. this work proposes an approach based on sna, not alone on social networks as supported by existing approaches, to estimate the tourists' satisfaction with individual points of interest (pois), and accordingly recommend those pois or not to that tourist or its tour planning system. moreover, instead of a common unimodal network, a bimodal tourist-reviewer network is modeled as suggested by the sna literature given tourists and poi reviewers act as two distinct classes of entities with links between them representing their (dis)similarities. both tourists and reviewers provide their personal attributes (like age), but reviewers then providing preferences for specific pois, whereas tourists only preferences for certain types or categories of pois (say archeology). further, an algorithm for grouping into ""islands"" of most similar reviewers to a certain tourist given the strength of corresponding links in the bimodal network is developed. additionally, a ranking algorithm based on in-degree or authority centrality is adopted to identify the highest ranked reviewers within the island and recommend their preferred pois to a given tourist. if there are more than single pois preferred per reviewer, and there remain more than requested pois of the highly ranked reviewers to select among for recommendation, a similar centrality algorithm is applied over a reviewer-poi network with links representing a certain reviewer prefers that certain poi. the evaluation initially with an exemplary real-life experiment, and then extended to a massive online dataset from foursquare, proves our approach as feasible in estimating the tourist 's satisfaction with individual pois. moreover, it is already promising since incorporating location influence remains yet our future work and might further improve its performance.
prosocial_behavior	we test an information theory of prosocial behavior whereby ego utility and self-signaling crowd out the effect of consumption utility on choice. the data come from two field experiments involving purchases of a consumer good bundled with a charitable donation. across experimental cells, we randomize the price level and the donation level. a model-free analysis of the data reveals nonmonotonic regions of demand when the good is bundled with relatively large charitable donations. subjects also self-report lower ratings of ""feeling good about themselves"" when offered bundles with large donations and price discounts. the evidence suggests that price discounts crowd out consumer self-inference of altruism. alternative motivation-crowding theories are rejected due to their inability to explain the nonmonotonic data moments. the standard use of interaction effects and other falsification checks to explore the underlying choice mechanism in an experimental setting is complicated in our self-signaling context. instead, a novel feature of our analysis consists of using the experimental data to estimate the structural form of a model of consumer demand with self-signaling. we specify a model in which consumers obtain both consumption and ego utility from their choices. ego utility derives from a consumer 's posterior self-beliefs after making her choice. an estimator is proposed that handles the potential multiplicity of equilibria that can arise in the self-signaling model. the model estimates allowus to quantify the economic role of ego utility and to explore the underlying signaling mechanism. nested tests reject the hypothesis of no self-signaling. alternative model specifications that potentially allow for nonmontonic demand without the self-signaling structure exhibit an inferior fit to the data. the model estimates imply that consumer response to the donations are mainly driven by ego utility and not by consumption utility (i.e., not by altruistic motives). the findings from the combination of a field experiment and a structural model contribute to a growing literature on self-signaling and consumer behavior by quantifying the magnitude of self-signaling on preferences and choices. the results also have implications for the design of a cause marketing campaign and the potential negative synergies between price and nonprice promotions.
leadership	large-scale initiatives to expand evidence-based practices are often poorly implemented and rarely endure. the purpose of this study was to identify the perceived barriers and facilitators to sustainment of an evidence-based supported employment program, individual placement and support (ips). within a 2-year prospective study of sustainment among 129 ips programs in 13 states participating in a national learning community, we interviewed ips team leaders and coded their responses to semi-structured interviews using a conceptual framework adapted from another large-scale implementation study. leaders in 122 agencies (95%) that sustained their ips programs identified funding, prioritization, and workforce characteristics as both key facilitators and barriers. additional key factors were lack of local community supports as a barrier and leadership and structured workflow as facilitators. within the ips learning community, team leaders attributed the sustainment of their program to funding, prioritization, workforce, agency leadership, and structured workflow. the actions of the learning community 's leadership, state governments, and local programs together may have contributed to the high sustainment rate.
nonverbal_communication	background. the use of electronic health records (ehrs) in dental care and their effect on dental care provider-patient interaction have not been studied sufficiently. the authors conducted a study to explore dental care providers' interactions with ehrs during patient visits, how these interactions influence dental care provider-patient communication, and the providers' and patients' perception of ehr use in the dental clinic setting during patient visits. methods. the authors collected survey and interview data from patients and providers at three dental clinics in a health care system. the authors used qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze data obtained from patients and dental care providers. results. the provider survey results showed significant differences in perceptions of ehr use in patient visits across dental care provider groups (dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants). patient survey results indicated that some patients experienced a certain level of frustration and distraction because of providers' use of ehrs during the visit. conclusions. the provider survey results indicated that there are different perceptions across provider groups about ehrs and the effect of computer use on communication with patients. dental assistants generally reported more negative effects on communication with patients owing to computer use. interview results also indicated that dental care providers may not feel comfortable interacting with the ehr without having any verbal or eye contact with patients during the patient 's dental visit. practical implications. a new design for dental operatories and locations of computer screens within the operatories should be undertaken to prevent negative nonverbal communication such as loss of eye contact or forcing the provider and patient to sit back to back, as well as to enhance patient education and information sharing.
social_cognition	individuals with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi) have been shown to experience significant problems in facial affect recognition (far). however, it is not known how these impairments relate to overall functioning and quality of life (qol) following tbi. the aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that worse performance on an far task would be associated with reduced qol (related to social and emotional functioning), worse mood, and increased fatigue. forty-seven individuals with tbi and 27 healthy controls (hcs) completed the facial emotion identification task (feit), as well as questionnaires assessing social and emotional qol, mood, and fatigue. the tbi group performed significantly worse than hcs on the feit. a significant relationship between far and fatigue and qol related to social and emotional functioning was documented, but in an unexpected direction: individuals who performed better on the feit reported poorer qol and greater fatigue. individuals who have better far may require increased effort to perform this task, and thus experience greater fatigue and poorer social and emotional qol.
prejudice	purpose: much like sexism, ageism is a multifaceted prejudice; it involves benevolent and hostile attitudes toward older adults. there are many scales designed to measure hostile ageism, yet none dedicated to measuring benevolent ageism. in the current studies, we developed and validated a 13-item measure: the ambivalent ageism scale (aas). design and methods: we employed four stages of scale development and validation. in stage 1, we created 41 benevolent ageist items adapted from existing ageism measures. in stages 2 and 3, we further refined the pool of items through additional testing and factor analysis and retained nine items loading strongly on two factors related to benevolent ageism: cognitive assistance/physical protection and unwanted help. in order to enable researchers to contrast benevolent and hostile attitudes, we then added four hostile ageist items. in stage 4, we assessed the test-retest reliability of the 13-item scale. results: the aas had good test-retest reliability (r =.80) and good internal consistency (alpha = .91). as predicted, the benevolent and hostile ageism subscales differentially predicted attitudes toward older adults: higher scores on the hostile subscale predicted lower competence and warmth ratings, whereas higher scores on the benevolent subscale predicted higher warmth perceptions. implications: the aas is a useful tool for researchers to assess hostile and benevolent ageism. this measure serves as an important first step in designing interventions to reduce the harmful effects of both hostile and benevolent ageism.
depression	introduction: it is important to elucidate the psychologically positive aspects of childbirth for mothers, and not only the negative aspects such as perinatal depression. this study aimed to examine psychological growth after childbirth and its related variables by focussing on five factors of posttraumatic growth: relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change and appreciation of life.methods: pregnant women during mid-pregnancy were consecutively recruited at a women 's hospital in japan and followed up 1 month after childbirth. psychological growth was assessed by the posttraumatic growth inventory.results: among 177 participants, 117 (66.1%) completed follow-up assessments 1 month after childbirth. multivariable regression analysis revealed that primipara, higher resilience and less fear at childbirth were associated with posttraumatic growth factors of relating to others and new possibilities. high resilience and less fear at childbirth were also associated with personal strength. on the other hand, being primiparous and high depressive symptoms were associated with greater appreciation of life. no variables were associated with spiritual change.discussion: these findings suggest that giving birth for the first time could be a highly challenging life event as well as an opportunity which leads to ptg, and that giving birth with low fear might lead to mothers' psychological growth. on the other hand, appreciation of life might need attention as it might signify some sorts of coping response. these findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological changes experienced by mothers.
nonverbal_communication	background: emerging evidence suggests that a subset of fmr1 premutation carriers is at an increased risk for cognitive, emotional, and medical conditions. however, because the premutation is rarely diagnosed at birth, the early developmental trajectories of children with a premutation are not known. methods: this exploratory study examined the cognitive, communication, and social-behavioral profiles of 26 infants with a premutation who were identified through participation in a newborn screening for fragile x syndrome pilot study. in this study, families whose newborn screened positive for an fmr1 premutation were invited to participate in a longitudinal study of early development. twenty-six infants with the premutation and 21 matched, screen-negative comparison babies were assessed using validated standardized measures at 6-month intervals starting as young as 3 months of age. the babies were assessed up to seven times over a 4-year period. results: the premutation group was not statistically different from the comparison group on measures of cognitive development, adaptive behavior, temperament, or overall communication. however, the babies with the premutation had a significantly different developmental trajectory on measures of nonverbal communication and hyperresponsivity to sensory experiences. they also were significantly more hyporesponsive at all ages than the comparison group. cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat length was linearly associated with overall cognitive development. conclusions: these results suggest that infants with a premutation may present with subtle developmental differences as young as 12 months of age that may be early markers of later anxiety, social deficits, or other challenges thought to be experienced by a subset of carriers.
leadership	japanese prime minister abe shinzo has emerged as the comeback kid of japanese politics and in his second term of office is now widely regarded as a rare example of strong leadership as he seeks to arrest and reverse his country 's perceived decline. the strategy to achieve these objectives has come to be known as the abe doctrine, which represents a radical but risky shift in foreign policy. this article outlines the tenets of the evolving abe doctrine and then applies them to the abe administration 's behaviour in the mechanisms of global governance, a highly pertinent but overlooked example. it argues that although a more strategic and coherent approach to global governance has emerged under abe than had been previously evident, this has been at the expense of the norm of internationalism that has traditionally shaped japan 's role.
attention	background friendships between people with and without intellectual disability remain elusive. little is known about factors that support the development of such friendships and what services can do to promote the likelihood that contact will develop into friendship.method a case study approach was used to explore the qualities and development of a long-term friendship between 2 women, 1 of whom has severe intellectual disability. qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were used including interviews and field notes from participant observation.findings the relationship progressed through 3 stages of introduction, consolidation, and autonomy supported by the working practices and culture of the disability support organisation. individualised activity, the role of a connector, and a culture of positive expectations underpinned the growth of the friendship.conclusions friendships do not happen by chance but require thought, attention, dedicated resources, and commitment to long-term outcomes to be achieved.
nonverbal_communication	introduction: standardized patients are a beneficial component of modern healthcare education and training, but few studies have explored cognitive factors potentially impacting clinical skills assessment during standardized patient encounters. this study examined the impact of a periodic (vs. traditional postencounter) evaluation approach and the appearance of critical verbal and nonverbal behaviors throughout a standardized patient encounter on scoring accuracy in a video-based scenario. methods: forty-nine standardized patients scored either periodically or at only 1 point in time (postencounter) a healthcare provider 's verbal and nonverbal clinical performance during a videotaped standardized patient encounter. the healthcare provider portrayed in this study was actually a standardized patient delivering carefully scripted verbal and nonverbal behaviors in their portrayal of an actual physician. the encounter itself was subdivided into 3 distinct segments for the purpose of supporting periodic evaluation, with the expectation that both verbal and nonverbal cues occurring in the middle segment would be more challenging to accurately report for participants in the postscenario evaluation group as a result of working memory decay. results: periodic evaluators correctly identified a significantly greater number of critical verbal cues midscenario than postencounter evaluators (p < 0.01) and correctly identified a significantly greater number of critical nonverbal cues than their postscenario counterparts across all 3 scenario segments (p < 0.001). further, postscenario evaluations exhibited a performance decrement in terms of midscenario correct identifications that periodic evaluators did not (p < 0.01). also, periodic evaluators exhibited fewer verbal cue false-positives during the first segment of the scenario than postscenario evaluators (p < 0.001), but this effect did not extend to other segments regardless of the cue type (ie, verbal or nonverbal). discussion: pausing lengthier standardized patient encounters periodically to allow for more frequent scoring may result in better reporting accuracy for certain clinical behavioral cues. this could enable educators to provide more specific formative feedback to individual learners at the session 's conclusion. the most effective encounter design will ultimately depend on the specific goals and training objectives of the exercise itself.
prejudice	one triumph of the human mind is the ability to place the multitudinous array of people we encounter into in-and out-group members based on racial characteristics. one fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether invisible own- and other-race faces can nevertheless influence subsequent affective judgments. here, we employed continuous flash suppression (cfs) to render own- and other-race faces unperceivable in an affective priming task. both on-line and off-line awareness checks were employed to provide more stringent control of partial awareness. results revealed that relative to own-race faces, imperceptible other-race faces significantly facilitated participants' identification of negative words, suggesting an other-race derogation bias. when faces were presented consciously, we found that not only other-race faces facilitated detection of negative words, but also own-race faces facilitated detection of positive words. these findings together provide novel and strong evidence suggesting that invisible racial faces can bias affective responses.

depression	it is well established that the maintenance of energy expenditure is linked to active hypothalamic neural mechanisms controlling adaptive stimuli such as food intake. variations of glucose levels and hormonal (leptin plus orexin-a) parameters, which are involved with energy homeostasis during different behavioral states, have not yet been fully defined. in this first study, behavioral analyses of an unpredictable stress model dealing with the actions of a sub-chronic administration of orexin-a (orx-a) and the anti-hunger neuropeptide, i.e., leptin (lep) within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic (sch) nucleus, were conducted on the valuable hibernating rodent (hamster; mesocricetus auratus) model noted for its distinct depression and anxiety states. treatment with lep accounted for a notable reduction (p < 0.01) of body weight in stressed hamsters that not only executed very evident (p < 0.001) movements to and from elevated plus maze (epm) but also spent less time in the dark area of the light-dark box test (ldt). conversely, orx-a predominantly evoked anxiogenic effects that were inverted by lep. interestingly, the anti-hunger neuropeptide accounted for both down-regulated npy1 transcripts in mostly lateral-posterior hypothalamic areas while up-regulated levels were detected in the parietal cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which largely behaved in an opposite manner to orx-a-dependent effects. overall, the present findings corroborate a predominating lepergic effect of the sch toward the reduction of hamster anxiety-like behaviors with respect to that of orx-a signaling, which may constitute useful therapeutic targets for stress-related obesity states.
problem-solving	background: problem-solving is a core ability that nursing students should develop during their education. there is a need to better understand the importance of problem-solving and the factors related to it among nursing students. objectives: this study aimed to identify the role of ego-resiliency in the relationship between social anxiety and problem-solving ability in korean nursing students. methods: data were collected from a total of 329 nursing students who were enrolled in three nursing programs in south korea, using a self-administrated questionnaire. data were mainly analyzed by baron and kenny 's three-step regression analysis and the sobel test. results: ego-resiliency played a partial mediating role in the relationship between social anxiety and problem solving ability. further, the sobel test suggested a mediating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between social anxiety and problem-solving (z = -9.079, p < 0.001). conclusions: to enhance problem-solving ability in nursing students, nursing educators should establish educational strategies that decrease social anxiety and improve ego-resiliency.

borderline_personality_disorder	despite continually increasing evidence for the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy in general, the empirical status of long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (ltpp) remains controversial. convincing outcome studies of ltpp were lacking for a long time. this article gives an overview of available systematic reviews addressing the evidence for ltpp. the findings suggest that ltpp can yield large and stable effects across a variety of diagnoses and particularly in complex mental disorders, which even tend to increase after termination of treatment. in comparison to other shorter or less intensive methods of psychotherapy, ltpp has proven to be significantly superior with respect to most outcome domains. first economic analyses suggest that ltpp may be cost-effective in the long run. the comparison of randomized controlled with observational studies revealed no significant differences in outcome; however, the evidence for ltpp is frequently challenged by proponents of other therapeutic approaches or scientific orientations. the criticisms were repeatedly answered and none of the concerns raised by critics identified an issue that would have affected the overall conclusions of the available reviews. nevertheless, further studies are urgently required to broaden the evidence base for ltpp in order to allow more refined analyses addressing the effects of specific forms of ltpp both in specific disorders and in comparison to specific forms of alternative therapies.
attention	fearful faces both capture our attention and hold it. however, little is known about the time-course for the capture and hold of spatial attention by fearful, and other emotional, faces. in three dot-probe studies we examined this time-course. experiments 1 and 2 used fearful and neutral faces. in experiment 1, dot-probe targets occurred 133, 266, and 532 ms post-face onset and in experiment 2, dot-probe targets occurred 84, 168, 336, and 672 ms post-face onset. in experiment 1, for both 133 and 266 ms conditions, reaction times were fastest for congruent trials and slowest for incongruent trials with reaction times for baseline trials falling between the two. the same pattern was found for the 84 and 168 ms conditions in experiment 2. for the later time-points in both experiments there were no significant differences between conditions. to examine whether this time-course is unique to fearful faces, a third dot-probe experiment using time-points identical to experiment 2 was conducted with happy and neutral faces. the results from experiment 3 suggest that happy faces captured and held attention in the 168 and 336 ms conditions. together, the results indicate that attention is captured and held by fearful faces at times earlier than approximately 300 ms, while happy faces also captured and held attention, but on a slightly different time-course from 168 to 336 ms.
schizophrenia	the treatment of schizophrenic disorders is still a major challenge, which concerns the acute treatment, long-term treatment and the early detection. new approaches in diagnostics and therapy can help to influence the course positively.
prenatal_development	cerebral cavernous malformation (ccm) is one of the most common types of vascular malformations of the central nervous system, affecting nearly one in 200 people. ccm lesions are characterized by grossly dilated vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelium. genetic linkage analyses have mapped three ccm loci to ccm1. ccm2 and ccm3. all three causative genes have now been identified allowing new insights into ccm pathophysiology. we focused on the ccm2 protein that might take place in blood vessel formation; we report here the expression patterns of ccm2 in prenatal development and adult human neocortex by means of immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. ccm2 was obviously detected in vascular endothelium and neuroglial precursor cells during development and also observed in arterial endothelium, neurons, some of the glial cells in adult neocortex. the expression patterns suggest that it could be one of the arterial markers whether this is a cause or a consequence of an altered vascular identity. ccm2 might play a role during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during human brain development. furthermore, with this study, ccm2 have been described for the first time in developing human neocortex.

nonverbal_communication	language is an important part of our culture and allows the exchange of thoughts and feelings as well as the acquisition of knowledge. deficits in language abilities can appear at different linguistic levels (phonetics/phonology, lexicon/semantics, syntax/morphology, and pragmatics). this can concern both language comprehension and speech production in different ways. the different linguistic levels should be considered in the diagnosis of developmental language disorders. in particular, the german guidelines ""interdisziplinare s2k-leitlinie"" support this approach. this paper gives an overview of the symptoms of specific language disorder as well as its classification in the dsm-5 and the icd-10. moreover, there is an outlook toward the icd-11, with explanations based on the beta-draft. the similarities and differences of the three diagnostic systems are pointed out and discussed. furthermore, reference is made to the interdisziplinare s2k-leitlinie. while there is a distinction between expressive and receptive language disorders in the icd-10, in the dsm-5 the two disorders are summarized in one clinical picture. in the current icd-11 beta-draft, the disorders are still divided; however, they are subordinate to a common category. this represents a compromise between the two approaches. additionally, the dsm-5 is supplemented by the diagnosis of social (pragmatic) communication disorder, and it is likely that the disorder will be included in the icd-11 (developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language), too. the disorder is characterized by deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication. future research should consider pragmatic aspects of language. the overview shows that there are no uniform diagnostic criteria. furthermore, none of the illustrated systems considered the individual linguistic level of language, as is suggested in the interdisziplinare s2k-leitlinie. although the icf-cy also cannot capture all the linguistic levels, it enables a comprehensive description of impairments and abilities. in the differential diagnosis, a mental retardation must be excluded by nonverbal intelligence diagnosis. this is controversial because it is difficult to implement in logopedics practice and speech therapy. moreover, in the diagnosis of specific language disorders the double discrepancy criterion must be scrutinized. in the current interdisziplinare s2k-leitlinie, this criterion was waived because of the controversy. in practice, the different definitions and classifications of specific language disorders lead to significant variations in the data on prevalence. additionally, the causal research and effectiveness tests of therapeutic interventions are complicated. moreover, for a long period there was no uniform standard in the design of assessments for diagnosis. the reliable diagnosis of language developmental disorders requires a comprehensive interdisciplinary classification.
attention	purposealthough much has been written about medicare part d enrollment, much less is known about beneficiaries' personal experiences with choosing a part d plan, especially among rural residents. this study sought to address this gap by examining geographic differences in part d enrollees' perceptions of the plan decision-making process, including their confidence in their choice, their knowledge about the program, and their satisfaction with available information. methodswe used data from the 2012 medicare current beneficiary survey and included adults ages 65 and older who were enrolled in part d at the time of the survey (n = 3,706). we used ordered logistic regression to model 4 outcomes based on beneficiaries' perceptions of the part d decision-making and enrollment process, first accounting only for differences by rurality, then adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and coverage characteristics. findingsoverall, half of all beneficiaries were not very confident in their part d knowledge. rural beneficiaries had lower odds of being confident in the plan they chose and in being satisfied with the amount of information available to them during the decision-making process. after adjusting for all covariates, micropolitan residents continued to have lower odds of being confident in the plan that they chose. conclusionspolicy-makers should pay particular attention to making information about part d easily accessible for all beneficiaries and to addressing unique barriers that rural residents have in accessing information while making decisions, such as reduced internet availability. furthermore, confidence in the decision-making process may be improved by simplifying the part d program.
nonverbal_communication	purpose: internet social media offers a rich source for soliciting the public 's views on health issues. this qualitative research, using youtube as a platform, aimed to explore the public 's perspectives on management of dental fear and anxiety (dfa) in pediatric patients. methods: using three keywords (""dental fear,"" ""dental phobia,"" and ""dental anxiety""), youtube videos were searched. twenty-seven videos related to dfa in children and adolescents were reviewed by three investigators, including a nondental layperson. inductive thematic analysis was adopted for interpreting the data. results: several strategies were considered useful for controlling dfa in pediatric patients, including: verbal and nonverbal communication to establish closeness and effective guidance (explanation, permission-seeking, reassurance, and negotiation); desensitization to dental settings and procedures; tell-show-do; positive reinforcement; distraction by imagination and thoughtful designs of clinic and parental presence and support. some self-coping strategies adopted by patients alleviated their dfa, such as self-reasoning and trust-building through long-term connection. dentists' clinical competence, favorable treatment outcomes, and state-of-the-art devices and technologies (dental lasers, intraoral camera, and adapted anaesthesia method) contributed to reducing dfa. conclusions: authentic testimonials in youtube videos endorsed and interpreted a variety of strategies adoptable by patients, parents, and dental professionals for managing children 's and adolescents' dental fears and anxieties.
seasonal_affective_disorder	seasonal affective disorder (sad) is a major depressive disorder that recurs in the fall and winter when day-length gets short. it is well accepted that day-length is encoded by the principal circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), but very little is known about day-length encoding in diurnal mammals. the present study utilized the grass rat, arvicanthis niloticus, to investigate how the circadian system responds to photoperiodic changes in a diurnal mammal that shows day-length-dependent mood changes. the animals were initially housed in equatorial day-length (12 h, ep) followed by either long (16 h, lp) or short (8 h, sp) photoperiods. the lp animals showed an expansion of the peak phase of the per1 and per2 rhythm in the scn as well as an extended behavioral active phase. in contrast, the sp animals did not show any compression of their active phase nor a change in the peak duration of per1 or per2 expression, compared to those in ep. the results suggest that the circadian system in the diurnal grass rats is less responsive when day-length gets short compared to when it gets longer. the depression-like behaviors were assessed using sweet solution preference (ssp) and forced swimming test (fst). animals in the sp group showed decreased ssp and increased immobility time in fst as compared to the ep group, suggesting a depressive phenotype. the present study serves as the first step toward exploring the role that the circadian system plays in sad using a diurnal rodent model.

attention	since communal violence erupted in myanmar 's rakhine state in 2012 between buddhist and muslim communities, the plight of the rohingya muslims has received much media attention both inside and outside of the country. rarely, however, do we get critical analyses of how such reporting is constructed. research on communal conflict and journalism tends to focus on the how-to of conflict-sensitive reporting and the dangers of employing local fixers and interpreters whose influence is seen to reduce the objectivity of news, rather than on the actual news gathering strategies used in specific conflicts. based on personal observations of a freelance reporter in myanmar, and interviews with journalists and fixers working in the country, this article analyses the news production processes in reporting on the conflict. the article maps out the various actors involved in the production of news, such as foreign and local journalists, local producers (the fixers) and interpreters, and the various challenges and limitations they face. these challenges function to perpetuate a familiar set of reporting routines and us vs them or binary narratives, with consequences for the de-escalation or perpetuation of the conflict.
antisocial_personality_disorder	mental health needs are common among community corrections offenders and many are enrolled in some form of supervised or mandated treatment. one category of mental health problem which may be germane to both treatment completion and recidivism among those in legally supervised treatment is the diagnosis of personality disorder (pd). this systematic review reports on sixteen studies comprised of full or mixed legally-supervised samples of offender in community-based treatment and examines the impact of pds on treatment completion. these studies were difficult to compare because of the differences in program setting, definition of treatment completion, definition of pd, method of pd assessment and type of treatment, among other variables. the impact of antisocial personality disorder in treatment was a common focus, and other pds were rarely assessed. the relevance of dsm pd categories to offender management in community corrections as well as the limitations of the current pd diagnostic categories is discussed.
attention	super-majorities have occurred frequently in congress but have escaped scholarly attention. this paper employs new measures of positive agenda control and a unique data set of 3,407 nontrivial bills from 1981 to 2008 to answer two questions: how did legislative leaders construct veto-proof coalitions, and what did presidents do with them? legislative leaders, we argue, deployed procedures to expand and sustain veto-proof coalitions, despite increasing polarization. the resulting history, which signaled members' commitment to a bill, provided information to the president that reduced uncertainty about possibilities for interbranch bargaining and the likely success of a veto. we find that positive agenda control increased the probability of vote tallies of two-thirds or more, especially after the 1994 election. in addition, we demonstrate that presidents concentrated veto activity on bills with outcomes of less than two-thirds, rejected some veto-proof bills for reputational gains, and deployed signing statements strategically. the analysis suggests that congressional leaders paradoxically gained capacity for nurturing large, bipartisan alliances as the institution became more polarized. moreover, it demonstrates that strategic activity by legislative leaders is critical to explaining variation in presidential options for veto bargaining and signing statements.
borderline_personality_disorder	the voices of mothers of color who have been affected by the child welfare system are typically marginalized and are largely left unheard. yet, attending to their experiences may yield a wealth of strategies for system change and for other women to change their path or avoid child welfare system involvement altogether. using augmented qualitative analytic methods from two phenomenological studies that utilized the life histories approach, the current study lifts up the voices of 15 women of color with past child welfare involvement as foster youth (and, for many, as mothers). the study findings highlight experiences within two broad themes: a) immense insecurity; and b) resilience, across domains in the lives of child welfare affected women. the mothers in this study share their insights into the aftermath of complex trauma and substance abuse within their families, particularly the relational, housing, and financial insecurity it wreaked as well as how they garnered resilience through perseverance, faith and empathy, and establishing stable homes. implications for practice, policy, and future research are discussed.

person_perception	how does the acquisition of information about a person affect the liking of that person? a recent set of studies suggests that liking decreases as people acquire more information (norton, frost, & ariely, 2007). we test this ""less-is-more"" hypothesis along with an alternative hypothesis based on information integration theory. according to this alternative, people average available person information in an unbiased manner so that the liking of a person described by a random sample of any number of traits from a trait universe approximates the degree of liking that would be obtained if all trait information were known. the correlation between liking and the number of traits should be zero. we present the results of computer simulation and 2 empirical person-judgment studies. using bayesian analyses, we find that the evidence is more consistent with the information-integration hypothesis than with the ""less-is-more"" hypothesis.
eating_disorders	progress in medical science and technology drastically improved physicians' ability to interact with patient 's physical body. nevertheless, medicine still addresses the human body from a hippocratic point of view, considering the organism and its processes just as a matter of mechanics and fluids. however, the interaction between the cognitive neuroscience of bodily self-consciousness (bsc), fundamentally rooted in the integration of multisensory bodily inputs, with virtual reality (vr), haptic technologies and robotics is giving a new meaning to the classic juvenal 's latin dictum ""mens sana in corpore sano"" (a healthy mind in a healthy body). this vision provides the basis for a new research field, ""embodied medicine"": the use of advanced technologies for altering the experience of being in a body with the goal of improving health and wellbeing. up to now, most of the research efforts in the field have been focused upon how external bodily information is processed and integrated. despite the important results, we believe that existing bodily illusions still need to be improved to enhance their capability to effectively correct pathological dysfunctions. first, they do not follow the suggestions provided by the free-energy and predictive coding approaches. more, they lacked to consider a peculiar feature of the human body, the multisensory integration of internal inputs (interoceptive, proprioceptive and vestibular) that constitute our inner body dimension. so, a future challenge is the integration of simulation/stimulation technologies also able to measure and modulate this internal/inner experience of the body. finally, we also proposed the concept of ""sonoception"" as an extension of this approach. the core idea is to exploit recent technological advances in the acoustic field to use sound and vibrations to modify the internal/inner body experience.
prosocial_behavior	this paper uses data from an attendance award program implemented at one of five industrial laundry plants to show the complex costs of corporate awards previously ignored in the literature. we show that although the attendance award had direct, positive effects on employees who previously had punctuality problems, it also led to strategic gaming behavior centered on the specific eligibility criteria for the award. the award program temporarily changed behavior in award-eligible workers but did not habituate improved attendance. furthermore, we show that the extrinsic reward from the award program crowded out the internal motivation of those employees who had previously demonstrated excellent attendance, generating worse punctuality during periods of ineligibility. most novelly, we show that the attendance award program also crowded out internal motivation and performance in tasks not included in the award program. workers with above average pre-program attendance lost 8% efficiency in daily laundry tasks after the program 's introduction. we argue that these motivational spillovers result from the perceived inequity of internally motivated workers' previously unrewarded superior attendance contributions. our paper suggests that even purely symbolic awards can generate gaming and crowding out costs that may spill over to other important tasks.
person_perception	an important yet untested assumption within personality psychology is that more important person characteristics are more densely reflected in language. we investigated how ratings of importance and other term properties are associated with one another and with a term 's frequency of use. research participants were asked to provide terms that described individuals they knew, which resulted in a set of 624 adjectives. these terms were independently rated for importance, social desirability, observability, stateness versus traitness, level of abstraction, and base rate. terms rated as describing more important person characteristics were in fact used more often by the participants in the sample and in a large corpus of online communications (close to 500 million words). more frequently used terms and more positive terms were also rated as being more abstract, more traitlike, and more widely applicable (i.e., having a greater base rate). we discuss the implications of these findings with regard to person perception in general.
antisocial_personality_disorder	psychopathy is considered one of the best predictors of violence and prison misconducts and is arguably an important clinical construct in the correctional setting. however, we tested whether psychopathy can be used to predict misconducts in prison environments for women as has been done for men. to date, few studies exist that examine and validate this association in female offender samples. the present study included 182 ethnically diverse female offenders. the aim was to prospectively predict violent and nonviolent misconducts over a 9-month period using official records of prior violent criminal history (e.g., homicide, manslaughter, assault), and self-report measures of psychopathy, impulsivity, and empathy. using negative binomial regression, we found that past violent criminal history, and callous and antisocial psychopathic traits were predictors of violent misconducts, whereas antisocial psychopathic traits and impulsivity best predicted nonviolent misconducts. although empathy was negatively associated with psychopathy it was not a significant predictor of violent or nonviolent misconducts. statistical models, which included impulsivity, were considered the most parsimonious at predicting misconducts. our findings demonstrate how risk-factors found to be reliable in male offender samples, such as psychopathic traits, impulsivity, and past violent criminal history, generalize to female offenders for predicting nonviolent and violent misconducts. one notable difference is the importance of callous psychopathic traits when predicting chronic violent misconducts by female offenders. in sum, there are more similarities in psychopathy and impulsivity than differences in the prediction of misconducts among men and women.
media_violence	five decades of research have shown clear links between exposure to violent visual media and subsequent aggression, however there has been little research that directly compares the effects of exposure to violent visual versus auditory media, or which has experimentally tested the effect of violent song lyrics with musical 'tone' held constant. in the current study 194 participants heard music either with or without lyrics, and with or without a violent music video, and were then given the chance to aggress using the hot sauce paradigm. musical tone was held constant across groups, and a fifth (control) group had no media exposure at all. experimental groups, on average, were significantly more aggressive than controls. the strongest effect was elicited by exposure to violent lyrics, regardless of whether violent imagery accompanied the music, and regardless of various person-based characteristics. implications for theories of media violence and models of aggression are discussed.

prosocial_behavior	fulfillment of the basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy is believed to facilitate people 's integrative tendencies to process psychological conflicts and develop a coherent sense of self. the present study therefore used event-related potentials (erps) to examine the relation between need fulfillment and the amplitude of conflict negativity (cn), a neurophysiological measure of conflict during personal decision making. participants completed a decision-making task in which they made a series of forced choices according to their personal preferences. three types of decision-making situations were created on the basis of participants' unique preference ratings, which were obtained prior to erp recording: low-conflict situations (choosing between an attractive and an unattractive option), high-conflict approach-approach situations (choosing between two similarly attractive options), and high-conflict avoidance-avoidance situations (choosing between two similarly unattractive options). as expected, cn amplitudes were larger in high- relative to low-conflict situations, and source localization analyses suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex was the generating structure of the cn. most importantly, people reporting higher need fulfillment exhibited larger cn amplitudes in avoidance-avoidance situations relative to low-conflict situations; to a lesser extent, they also exhibited larger cn amplitudes in approach-approach situations relative to low-conflict situations. by contrast, people reporting lower need fulfillment exhibited cn amplitudes that poorly discriminated the three decision situations. these results suggest that need fulfillment may promote self-coherent functioning by increasing people 's receptivity to and processing of events that challenge their abilities to make efficient, self-congruent choices.
depression	aims: to conduct a pilot trial to test the feasibility of a guided self-help intervention for chronic orofacial pain. methods: a pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the intervention with usual treatment. a total of 37 patients with chronic orofacial pain were randomized into either the intervention group (n = 19) or the usual treatment (control) group (n = 18). validated outcome measures were used to measure the potential effectiveness of the intervention over a number of domains: physical and mental functioning (short form 36 [sf-36]); anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale [hads]); pain intensity and interference with life (brief pain inventory [bpi]); disability (manchester orofacial pain disability scale [mopds]); and illness behavior (revised illness perceptions questionnaire [ipqr]). bootstrap confidence intervals were computed for the treatment effect (es) posttreatment and at 3 months follow-up and adjusted for baseline values of the outcome measure by using analysis of covariance. results: at posttreatment and the 3-month follow-up, 11 participants in the intervention group and 7 in the control group failed to complete outcome measures. the intervention was acceptable and could be feasibly delivered face to face or over the telephone. although the pilot trial was not powered to draw conclusions about the effectiveness, it showed significant (p <.05) effects of the intervention on physical and mental functioning and treatment control. conclusion: the self-help intervention was acceptable to patients and allowed them to better understand and self-manage chronic orofacial pain. it showed potential effectiveness on outcome domains related to functioning and illness perception. further research is needed to understand the cost effectiveness of the intervention for chronic orofacial pain.
borderline_personality_disorder	this study sought to explore the relationships between depression, anxiety, stress, and non-suicidal self-injury (nssi), and the mediating roles of rumination and emotion regulation in this relationship. the sample comprised 1,586 australian university students who completed a self-report questionnaire assessing the relevant variables. of the sample, 8.9% engaged in nssi in the 4 weeks prior to the survey. depression, anxiety, and stress each exerted a direct effect on nssi, and each relationship was mediated by cognitive reappraisal. the relationship between stress and nssi was also mediated by expressive suppression. the results imply intervention efforts aimed at teaching adaptive emotion regulation strategies for students experiencing high levels of psychological distress may reduce the frequency of nssi.
leadership	objective: to explore how an australian rural food policy coalition acts to influence a local food environment, focusing specifically on its composition, functions and processes as well as its food-related strategies and policy outputs. design: a qualitative case study approach was undertaken. three sources were used to triangulate data: eleven semi-structured in-depth interviews with coalition members, analysis of thirty-seven documents relating to the coalition and observation at one coalition meeting. data were analysed using a thematic and constant comparison approach. community coalition action theory provided a theoretical framework from which to interpret findings. setting: two rural local government areas on the south-eastern coast of victoria, australia. subjects: eleven members of the food policy coalition. results: five themes emerged from the data analysis. the themes described the coalition 's leadership processes, membership structure, function to pool resources for food system advocacy, focus on collaborative cross-jurisdictional strategies and ability to influence policy change. conclusions: this australian case study demonstrates that with strong leadership, a small-sized core membership and focus on collaborative strategies, food policy coalitions may be a mechanism to positively influence local food environments.
attention	meshless methods for convection-dominated flow problems have the potential to reduce the computational effort required for a given order of solution accuracy compared to mesh-based methods. the state of the art in this field is more advanced for elliptic partial differential equations than for time-dependent convection diffusion problems. in this paper, we introduce a new meshless method that it based on combining the modified method of characteristics with the radial basis functions during the solution reconstruction. the method belongs to a class of fractional time-stepping schemes in which a predictor stage is used for the discretization of convection terms and a corrector stage is used for the treatment of diffusion terms. special attention is given to the application of this method to solve convection-dominated flow problems in two-dimensional domains. numerical results are shown for several test examples including the incompressible navier stokes equations and the computed results support our expectations for a stable and highly accurate meshless method.

child_abuse	retinal hemosiderin deposition is a histologic indicator of sustained hemorrhage but cannot be used to precisely estimate the elapsed time since an episode of trauma. a 5-month-old male infant was admitted to hospital after acute deterioration. examination revealed encephalopathy, subdural hematomas, and retinal hemorrhages consistent with abusive head trauma (aht). at the age of 3, he was readmitted to hospital with spontaneous osteopenic fracture of the right femur. the patient deteriorated and died after unsuccessful resuscitation. ophthalmopathological investigation showed atrophy of the retina and optic nerve and hemosiderin deposition in both eyes. retinal hemosiderin deposition is currently generally assumed to disappear within 6-8 weeks after the occurrence of hemorrhage in aht. this case report describes an infant with bilateral retinal hemosiderin depositions due to hemorrhages sustained from aht occurring 32 months prior to death. implications of this finding for the interpretation of retinal hemosiderin depositions in aht are discussed.
social_cognition	the challenge of studying human cognitive evolution is identifying unique features of our intelligence while explaining the processes by which they arose. comparisons with nonhuman apes point to our early-emerging cooperative-communicative abilities as crucial to the evolution of all forms of human cultural cognition, including language. the human self-domestication hypothesis proposes that these early-emerging social skills evolved when natural selection favored increased in-group prosociality over aggression in late human evolution. as a by-product of this selection, humans are predicted to show traits of the domestication syndrome observed in other domestic animals. in reviewing comparative, developmental, neurobiological, and paleoanthropological research, compelling evidence emerges for the predicted relationship between unique human mentalizing abilities, tolerance, and the domestication syndrome in humans. this synthesis includes a review of the first a priori test of the self-domestication hypothesis as well as predictions for future tests.
depression	aims: this study explored the sex-specific associations between friendship trust and the psychological well-being of young swedes from late adolescence to early adulthood. methods: a random sample of native swedes born in 1990 was surveyed at age 19 years and again at age 23 years regarding their own well-being and their relationships with a maximum of five self-named peers. the response rate was 31.3%, resulting in 782 cases to be analysed. we used sex-stratified structural equation models to explore the associations between trust and well-being. psychological well-being was constructed as the latent variable in the measurement part. the structural part accounted for the autocorrelation of trust with respect to well-being over time and incorporated the cross-lagged effects between late adolescence and early adulthood. results: it was found that trust increased while well-being decreased for young men and remained stable for young women from 19 to 23 years of age. the young women reported lower well-being at both time points, whereas no sex difference was found for trust. based on model fit comparisons, a simple model without forward or reward causation was accepted for young men, whereas reversed causation from well-being to trust was suggested for young women. subsequent analysis based on these assumptions confirmed the reversed effect for young women. conclusions: the findings suggest that young people do not benefit from trustful social relations to the same extent as adult populations. young women who express impaired well-being run a greater risk of being members of networks characterized by low friendship trust over time.
person_perception	it was recently shown that austrians associate car front geometry with traits in a way that could be related to face shape geometry mapping to those same overall suites of traits. yet, possible confounding effects of familiarity with the car models, media coverage and entertainment could not be ruled out. in order to address this, the current study uses a cross-cultural comparison. adult subjects in two countries (austria and ethiopia, n=129) were asked to rate person characteristics of 46 standardized front views of automobiles on various trait scales. these two countries differ substantially with regard to their experience with car models and brands, as well as car marketing and media coverage. geometric morphometrics was then used to assess the shape information underlying trait attribution. car shapes for perceived maturity, maleness and dominance were highly similar in both countries, with patterns comparable to shape changes during facial growth in humans: relative sizes of the forehead and windshield decrease with age/growth, eyes and headlights both become more slit-like, noses and grilles bigger, lips and air-intakes are wider. austrian participants further attributed various degrees of some interpersonal attitudes and emotions, whereas neither austrians nor ethiopians congruently ascribed personalities. morphological correlates of personal characteristics are discussed, as are person perception and its overgeneralization to inanimate objects. cross-cultural similarities and differences are addressed, as well as implications for car styling, follow-up studies on driving and pedestrian behavior, and fundamental dimensions in inference from (human) faces.

antisocial_personality_disorder	purpose drug addiction and psychiatric disorders are frequently concomitant; however, few studies have investigated the impact of psychiatric disorders other than substance use disorder (sud) on health-related quality of life (hrqol) in drug users not in treatment. we studied the association of psychiatric disorders other than sud with hrqol in a street-recruited sample of cocaine and/or heroin users. methods it is a cross-sectional study involving 287 young users of cocaine and/ or heroin in barcelona, spain. hrqol was assessed with the nottingham health profile (nhp). patterns of drug use and mental disorders were assessed using the spanish version of the psychiatric research interview for substance and mental disorders iv, and degree of dependence through the severity of dependence scale (sds). the association of mental disorders with hrqol was assessed through a tobit regression analysis. results the overall nhp score was 23.9 (sd = 20.5, range 0-91.7). sixty-one percent of the sample had two or more suds; 22 % had at least one non-sud axis i disorder (anxiety, mood, psychotic, or eating disorder); and 27.2 % had a borderline personality disorder (bpd) and/or antisocial personality disorder. variables negatively associated with the global nhp score were psychosis [transformed beta coefficient: 15.23; 95 % confidence interval [ci] 4.48-25.97], bpd (9.55; 95 % ci 2.95-16.15), severity of dependence (8.12; 95 % ci 3.37-12.87), having two or more suds (for two or three suds: 6.83; 95 % ci 2.08-11.59) (>3 suds: 7.70; 95 % ci 1.72-13.68) and the intravenous use of some substance (10.20; 95 % ci 6.00-14.40). conclusion hrqol among street-recruited illegal substance users was impaired, particularly among those with psychiatric comorbidity, psychosis, and bpd being especially relevant.
prejudice	aim: mental-health-related stigma affects helpseeking behavior and service utilization among young people. whether mental-health-related stigma is different or correlated between parents and their children is unknown. it is also unknown whether the name change of schizophrenia in 2002 has had long-term effects on reducing stigma for adults in the general population. methods: we recruited 143 parent-child pairs (mean ages [sd]: 51.5 [3.6] and 21.2 [1.2] years, respectively) to complete self-report questionnaires regarding mental-health-related stigma and experience. we also assessed negative stereotypes for three psychiatric disease names (old and new names of schizophrenia, and depression), and for diabetes mellitus as a physical illness comparison. the questionnaires also asked respondents to identify the old and new names of schizophrenia and dementia, respectively, among 10 names for mental and physical illnesses and conditions. results: parents showed lower stigma levels toward mental illness and diabetes mellitus, but similar or greater stigma levels toward schizophrenia, compared with their children. stigma levels toward mental illness in parents and their children were significantly correlated. the rate of correct identification of the old and new names for schizophrenia was higher in parents than in their children (64.7% vs 41.4%, p < 0.001). parents who responded correctly endorsed more negative stereotypes toward the new name of schizophrenia compared with those who responded incorrectly (p = 0.049). conclusion: the present findings suggest that stigma toward mental illness is shared between family members, and the name change of schizophrenia has effectively reduced stigma levels toward this disorder in adults of various ages.
person_perception	in this paper i criticize theory-biased and overly individualist approaches to understanding others and introduce the pair account of joint attention as a pragmatic, affectively charged intentional relation. i argue that this relation obtains in virtue of intentional contents in the minds of the co-attenders, and - against the received understanding of intentional states as propositional attitudes - that we should recognize what i call 'subject mode' and 'position mode' intentional content. based on findings from developmental psychology, i propose that this subject mode content represents the co-attenders as co-subjects, who are like them and who are at least disposed to act jointly with them. i conclude by arguing that in joint attention we experience and understand affective, actional and perceptual relations at a non-conceptual level prior to the differentiation of mind and body.
prejudice	employment, demographic, cultural, and legal changes in europe over the past 40 years have brought unprecedented numbers of minority groups into organisations at all levels, and research suggests that most workplaces are likely to become even more diverse in the future. while much attention has been paid to negative experiences of minorities in the workplace, it also has the potential to be an important site of prejudice reduction. in response, drawing on original quantitative and qualitative data, this article explores the encounters of socially different groups in the workplace. it demonstrates that workplaces can promote meaningful encounters. however, cases of positive encounter with difference were often discussed at the level of the individual, with reference to specific people and friendships, rather than towards the minority group to which the individual belonged. as such, these positive encounters were often superficial with underlying tensions still existing between different groups in the workplace.
problem-solving	this study adds to the body of research examining the links between two components of cognitive self-regulation (inhibitory control and verbal working memory) and social functioning (social integration, social problem solving, and prosocial skills) and focuses on children 's sex as a moderator of the association between cognitive self-regulation and social functioning. the participants (n = 131) were french schoolchildren followed from kindergarten (mage = 68.36 months, sd = 3.33 months) through grade 1. using hierarchical regression analyses, three major findings were revealed: (1) inhibitory control was a better predictor than verbal working memory of prosocial skills assessed by peers using the sociometric technique as well as by teachers using questionnaires, after controlling for sex, mother 's education, and verbal and non-verbal iq; (2) the prosocial skills assessed by teachers in kindergarten contributed more to explaining the prosocial skills and peer acceptance assessed in grade 1 than cognitive self-regulation; and (3) sex did not moderate the relationship between cognitive self-regulation and social functioning. these results suggest that developing strong cognitive self-regulation, especially inhibitory control and prosocial skills, in young children schooled in france could be beneficial for their social development.
person_perception	declaring and thinking about heroes are common human preoccupations but surprisingly aspects of heroism that reinforce these behaviors are not well-understood. in four thematically consistent studies, we attempt to identify lay perspectives about the psychological functions served by heroes. in study 1, participants (n = 189) freely generated open-ended descriptions of hero functions, which were then sorted by independent coders into 14 categories (e.g., instill hope, guide others). in study 2, in an attempt to identify the most important functions associated with heroes, participants (n = 249) rated how each function corresponded with their personal views about heroes. results from a confirmatory factor analysis suggested that a three-factor model of hero functions fit the data well: participants thought that heroes enhanced the lives of others, promoted morals, and protected individuals from threats. in study 3 (n = 242), participants rated heroes as more likely to fulfill a protecting function than either leaders or role models. in studies 4a (n = 38) and 4b (n = 102), participants indicated that thinking about a hero (relative to a leader or an acquaintance) during psychological threat fulfilled personal enhancement, moral modeling, and protection needs. in all, these findings provide an empirical basis to spur additional research about the social and psychological functions that heroes offer.
eating_disorders	recently, death anxiety, or dread of death, has been proposed as a key transdiagnostic process underlying the anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, somatic disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders. in fact, it has been argued that death anxiety underlies all psychopathology, and is more fundamental than perfectionism, a process which was previously considered the root of mental illness. however, there has been a paucity of research examining the relationship between death anxiety and the eating disorders, although these conditions have been found to be strongly related to perfectionism. the present study therefore aimed to examine whether death anxiety is related to disordered eating, and whether death anxiety is a better predictor of disordered eating than perfectionism. a sample of 164 participants (132 female), average age 33.55 years (sd = 15.45 years), completed an online survey comprising background questions (age, sex, diagnosed psychiatric disorder), the eating attitudes test - 26 item version (eat-26), the almost perfect scale - revised (aps-r), the rosenberg self-esteem scale (rses), and the death anxiety scale (das). the findings of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis with eat-26 as the dependent variable, age entered at step 1, the rses and aps-r entered at step 2, and the das entered at step 3 showed that only death anxiety and self-esteem were independent predictors of disordered eating at step 3. a simultaneous multiple regression analysis was subsequently run with age and the aps-r alone as predictors of eat-26 scores. this analysis showed that perfectionism was only a predictor of disordered eating when death anxiety and self-esteem were not included in the regression model. death anxiety and self-esteem both appear to be important transdiagnostic processes.
prosocial_behavior	compared to our understanding of neurocognitive processes involved producing mimicry, the downstream consequences of being mimicked are less clear. a wide variety of positive consequences of mimicry, such as liking and helping, have been reported in behavioural research. however, an in-depth review suggests the link from mimicry to liking and other positive outcomes may be fragile. positive responses to mimicry can break down due to individual factors and social situations where mimicry may be unexpected. it remains unclear how the complex behavioural effects of mimicry relate to neural systems which respond to being mimicked. mimicry activates regions associated with mirror properties, self-other processing and reward. in this review, we outline three potential models linking these regions with cognitive consequences of being mimicked. the models suggest that positive downstream consequences of mimicry may depend upon self-other overlap, detection of contingency or low prediction error. finally, we highlight limitations with traditional research designs and suggest alternative methods for achieving highly ecological validity and experimental control. we also highlight unanswered questions which may guide future research.

nonverbal_communication	nonverbal communication using social cues, like gestures, governs a great part of our daily interactions. it has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder (asd) show a deviant processing of social cues throughout their social cognitive development. however, social cues do not always convey an intention to communicate. hence, the aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of adolescents and adults with asd and neurotypical controls to social cues of high communicative (pointing) and low communicative values (grasping). for this purpose, we employed a spatial cueing paradigm with both cue types and compared saccadic reaction times (srts) between conditions in which the target appeared at a location which was congruent versus incongruent with the direction of the cue. results showed that both adolescents and adults with asd had slower srts for the incongruent relative to the congruent condition for both cue types, reflecting sensitivity to these cues. additionally, mental effort during the processing of these social cues was assessed by means of pupil dilation. this analysis revealed that, while individuals with and without asd required more mental effort to process incongruent compared to the congruent cues, cues with higher communicative value posed more processing load for the asd group. these findings suggest that the perception of social gestures is intact in asd but requires additional mental effort for gestures with higher communicative value.
gender_roles	cities have been described as masculine, but simultaneously emancipatory for women giving them the possibility to experiment with new identities. women have gained access to the masculine sphere through working-life and financial independence. the new interest among families to live in inner cities has been interpreted as a way particularly for mothers to combine work with family life. drawing on an in-depth qualitative study, this paper investigates mothering and fathering practices on family leave in helsinki, finland. it explores how parenting is incorporated into the mothers' and fathers' urban self-identity, and argues that while parenting in the city traditional gender roles are blurred. the paper proposes the term domesticfication to describe how urban middle class mothering and fathering is being inscribed in nordic contemporary urban space.
person_perception	this was a study on the perceived enjoyment of different movie genres. in an online experiment, 176 students were randomly divided into two groups (n = 88) and asked to estimate how much they, their closest friends, and young people in general enjoyed either serious or light-hearted movies. these self-other differences in perceived enjoyment of serious or light-hearted movies were also assessed as a function of differing individual motivations underlying entertainment media consumption. the results showed a clear third-person effect for light-hearted movies and a first-person effect for serious movies. the third-person effect for light-hearted movies was moderated by level of hedonic motivation, as participants with high hedonic motivations did not perceive their own and others' enjoyment of light-hearted films differently. however, eudaimonic motivations did not moderate first-person perceptions in the case of serious films.
child_abuse	this study systematically reviews research on child maltreatment and risk of gambling problems in adulthood. it also reviews adult problem gamblers' risk of abusing or neglecting their own children. multiple database searches were conducted using pre-defined search terms related to gambling and child abuse and neglect. we identified 601 unique references and excluded studies if they did not report original research, or did not specifically measure child maltreatment or gambling. twelve studies that included multivariable analysis of childhood maltreatment exposure and problem gambling were identified. six of seven studies examining childhood sexual abuse and four of five examining physical abuse showed a significant positive association between abuse and later gambling problems (odds ratios for sexual abuse 2.01-3.65; physical abuse 2.3-2.8). both studies examining psychological maltreatment and two of three examining neglect identified positive associations with problem gambling. in most studies, risks were reduced or eliminated when controlling for other mental health disorders. the three studies measuring risk of child abuse and neglect among current problem gamblers suggest an increased risk for child physical abuse and medical conditions indicative of neglect although there is a considerable amount of variation among studies. child abuse is associated with increased risk of gambling problems - gambling treatment providers should ask about maltreatment history as part of their clinical assessment. problem gamblers may be more likely to physically abuse or neglect their children, but data here are more limited. child welfare professionals should consider asking questions about parental gambling when assessing family risk.

prenatal_development	the study was conducted on the adrenal glands of 43 buffalo foetuses of 39 mm to 890 mm crown rump length (crl) to investigate the distribution of mucopolysaccharides. the paraffin sections of adrenal glands were stained with pas and ab-pas methods to demonstrate the presence of neutral mucopolysaccharides (nmps) and acid mucopolysaccharides (nmps), respectively. the nmps content was high in the inner aspect of the capsule, moderate in the wall of large blood vessels of the capsule, low in the definite and foetal cortex, and low to moderate in both the zones of the medulla. the amps content was low in the adrenal primordia and moderate in the aggregating neuroectodermal cells. the amps content was low in the capsule, negative to low in the definite cortex, low to moderate in the foetal cortex and both the zones of the medulla. the distribution of nmps and amps varied in different regions of the adrenal gland of buffalo during prenatal development.
prenatal_development	common anaesthetic and analgesic agents used during pregnancy in mice have been observed to cause fetal growth restriction. we investigated the impact of therapeutic doses of three anaesthetics (ketamine/xylazine, isoflurane, and tribromoethanol) and two analgesics (buprenorphine and meloxicam) on fetal and placental growth. pregnant mice were treated with one of these agents at fertilization (e0), attachment (e4), beginning of organogenesis (e6), end of organogenesis (e12), or during the logarithmic growth phase (e15), or they were placed into an untreated control group. at term (e18), fetal and placental growth were evaluated, morphological analyses were performed, and skeletal measurements were conducted. fetal growth was reduced significantly (p<0.01) by ketamine/xylazine treatment at e0, e4, e12, or e15, by isoflurane administered at e0 or e6, and by tribromoethanol administered at e6 or e12. two-day treatment with buprenorphine beginning at e4 or e6, or with meloxicam at e0 also significantly reduced fetal growth (p<0.01). neither placental growth nor litter size was significantly affected by any of these agents. the occurrence of microphthalmia was nearly eight-fold higher (p<0.05) in response to buprenorphine administration at e6 compared with controls. the length of the humerus was reduced at most gestation times in response to each of these agents and was correlated (p<0.01) with fetal weight for ketamine/xylazine, tribromoethanol, and meloxicam. these data reveal patterns of acceptable and detrimental anaesthetic and analgesic use during fetal development and have refined our capability to provide recommendations for the use of these agents during pregnancy in the mouse.
prenatal_development	experiments on the model of foraging behavior formation under conditions of free choice (t-maze) revealed learning failure against the background of reduced motor activity in the offspring of rats exposed to tobacco smoke on gestation days 1-20. afobazole administered to pregnant rats orally in doses of 1 or 10 mg/kg daily during the whole gestation and/or entering rat pup body with breast milk from mothers receiving 200 mg/kg to day 20 of their life normalized their learning capacity. the formation of short-term and long-term memory in animals receiving afobazole did not differ from the control. hence, afobazole corrects cognitive disorders in rats exposed to tobacco smoke during prenatal development.
schizophrenia	the relationship between the autism spectrum quotient (aq) and schizotypal personality questionnaire (spq) data has consistently shown overlap in the social and interpersonal domains. factor analyses of the aq and spq subscales support this overlap with the emergence of a shared aq and spq subscale factor as the largest common element this study investigated, at the item level, the factor structure of the aq and spq exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on the aq and spq responses of 1670 participants (aged 18-40, 1243 females, 427 males). seven factors cumulatively explained 40.56% of the data. of these, four represented shared traits (named odd behaviour, relationship disinterest, cue interpretation, social and communication discomfort), one was a more specific autistic tendency (named fixation with details), and two factors were more specific to the psychotic dimension of schizotypy (named paranoia/suspiciousness and hallucination/delusional experiences). these findings demonstrate that a set of symptom traits is present in both the autism and schizophrenia spectra. the findings of this study have important clinical implications in terms of future research, diagnosis and treatment of autism and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

prejudice	theories linking the literatures on stereotyping and human resource management have proposed that individuals may enjoy greater success obtaining jobs congruent with stereotypes about their social categories or traits. here, we explored such effects for a detectable, but not obvious, social group distinction: male sexual orientation. bridging previous work on prejudice and occupational success with that on social perception, we found that perceivers rated gay and straight men as more suited to professions consistent with stereotypes about their groups (nurses, pediatricians, and english teachers vs. engineers, managers, surgeons, and math teachers) from mere photos of their faces. notably, distinct evaluations of the gay and straight men emerged based on perceptions of their faces with no explicit indication of sexual orientation. neither perceivers' expertise with hiring decisions nor diagnostic information about the targets eliminated these biases, but encouraging fair decisions did contribute to partly ameliorating the differences. mediation analysis further showed that perceptions of the targets' sexual orientations and facial affect accounted for these effects. individuals may therefore infer characteristics about individuals' group memberships from their faces and use this information in a way that meaningfully influences evaluations of their suitability for particular jobs.
schizophrenia	background: vti1a and etfa were identified recently as susceptibility genes for non-glioblastoma (gbm) of glioma risk in european populations, but the genetic etiology and pathogenesis of glioma have not been fully elucidated. here, we aimed to investigate whether common genetic variants in vti1a and etfa predispose han chinese individuals to glioma. methods: the association of thirteen common tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in vti1a and etfa genes with glioma were assessed in a hospital-based case-control study including 473 non-gbm of glioma patients and 1046 cancer-free controls. results: two snps (rs11196067 in vti1a and rs1801591 in etfa) were found to be significantly associated with non-gbm of glioma risk (rs11196067, adjusted p = 0.00018, adjusted odds ratio (or) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.16-1.61; rs1801591, adjusted p = 0.000022, adjusted or = 1.72, 95% ci = 134-2.20). in further stratified analysis, they were both more pronounced in the adult subgroup. in haplotype-based analysis, two haplotypes were identified to be significant association with glioma. the haplotype ""tga"" (p = 0.002) in vti1a and the haplotype ""aca"" (p < 0.001) in etfa had a 1.5-fold and 3-fold increased glioma risk respectively, compared with corresponding non-carriers. conclusions: in summary, our results indicate that genetic variants in vti1a and etfa may modify individual susceptibility to non-gbm of glioma in the han chinese population and support the role of the vti1a and etfa genes in the occurrence of glioma.

social_cognition	psychological perspective-taking is a powerful social cognition that helps us to understand other people. it creates feelings of closeness and sympathy, motivates us to help others, and is important for positive social relationships. in contrast to the impressive knowledge about its consequences, relatively little is known about how exactly people achieve them. the present paper addresses this question from a grounded cognition perspective, drawing on recent findings on the embodiment of visuospatial perspective-taking. visuospatial perspective-taking involves a mental transformation of one 's body schema into the physical location of another person. we argue that when people psychologically ""put themselves in another person 's shoes,""this simulation of physical proximity happens, too, and is one source of perceived closeness. in five experiments (total n = 1067), participants completed a visuospatial perspective-taking task. during half of the trials, angular disparity between the target person and the participant was high and participants had to adopt the target 's visual perspective (which involves an embodied simulation). during the remaining trials, angular disparity was low and participants could solve the task egocentrically. taking another 's perspective led participants to adopt the thoughts of the target person more strongly (experiments 1-3) and increased the perceived similarity of that person to the self (experiment 4) and participants' liking of that person (experiment 5). these effects were independent of task difficulty (experiment 2), and only present during trials where an embodied transformation happened (i.e., at high angular disparities; experiment 3). implications for psychological and visuospatial perspective-taking research and related phenomena are discussed.
prejudice	recent research and theorizing suggest that desires for group-based dominance underpin biases towards both human outgroups and (non-human) animals. a systematic study of the common ideological roots of human-human and human-animal biases is, however, lacking. three studies (in belgium, uk, and usa) tested the social dominance human-animal relations model (sd-harm) proposing that social dominance orientation (sdo) is a key factor responsible for the significant positive association between ethnic outgroup attitudes and speciesist attitudes towards animals, even after accounting for other ideological variables (that possibly confound previous findings). confirming our hypotheses, the results consistently demonstrated that sdo, more than right-wing authoritarianism (rwa), is a key factor connecting ethnic prejudice and speciesist attitudes. furthermore, studies 2 and 3 showed that both sdo and rwa are significantly related to perceived threat posed by vegetarianism (i.e. ideologies and diets minimizing harm to animals), but with sdo playing a focal role in explaining the positive association between threat perceptions and ethnic prejudice. study 3 replicated this pattern, additionally including political conservatism in the model, itself a significant correlate of speciesism. finally, a meta-analytic integration across studies provided robust support for sd-harm and offers important insights into the psychological parallels between human intergroup and human-animal relations. copyright (c) 2016 european association of personality psychology
borderline_personality_disorder	purpose - dialectical behaviour therapy (dbt) has been widely used in a number of different settings with published outcomes and literature supporting its validity and efficacy. what is less understood is dbt 's application to forensic populations. the purpose of this paper is to qualitatively explore the experiences of high risk and adult male forensic clients (diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (bpd) and antisocial personality disorder (aspd)) in a forensic adapted version of dbt. design/methodology/approach - six clients who had completed four modules of dbt and individual therapy engaged in semi-structured interviews which were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. findings - the findings identified emerging themes relating to group processes and treatment outcomes. specifically, the importance of motivation, shared learning, professionalism, reinforcement and reflection in creating a positive experience of dbt were identified. in addition clients identified feeling supported, a sense of belonging, personal achievement, increased knowledge and skills application as being part of their experience of dbt. research limitations/implications - whilst efforts were made to manage limitations, potential confounders include the impact of the researcher 's direct involvement in the facilitation of dbt and the small sample size. practical implications - this study provides support for the use of dbt with forensic males diagnosed with aspd and bpd and the importance of the group component to the treatment modality. it emphasises the importance of group cohesion and the development of interpersonal factors including feeling supported, sense of belonging and a sense of achievement. originality/value - this paper provides a unique contribution to the understanding of the application of dbt with forensic male clients with personality disorder. it is the first known study to use qualitative methods to explore forensic male clients' experiences of group and individual dbt. this paper provides insight into the key themes of clients' experiences of dbt. these identified themes lend support to the importance of motivation of clients and the experience of shared learning, reinforcement and reflection. furthermore, feeling supported, having a sense of belonging and a sense of personal achievement were identified as key to the positive experience of clients.
false_memories	two experiments examined the extent to which erroneous recall blocks veridical recall using, as a vehicle for study, the disruptive impact of distractors that are semantically similar to a list of words presented for free recall. instructing participants to avoid erroneous recall of to-be-ignored spoken distractors attenuated their recall but this did not influence the disruptive effect of those distractors on veridical recall (experiment 1). using an externalized output editing procedure whereby participants recalled all items that came to mind and identified those that were erroneous the usual between sequences semantic similarity effect on erroneous and veridical recall was replicated hut the relationship between the rate of erroneous and veridical recall was weak (experiment 2). the results suggest that forgetting is not due to veridical recall being blocked by similar events.
borderline_personality_disorder	symptoms of depersonalization during feared social situations are commonly experienced by individuals with social anxiety disorder (sad). despite its clinical relevance, it is not addressed in standard treatment manuals and it remains unclear if depersonalization is reduced by well-established treatments. this study investigated whether cognitive therapy (ct) for sad effectively reduces depersonalization and whether pre-treatment severity of depersonalization predicts or mediates treatment outcome. in a randomized controlled trial, patients underwent the standardized trier social stress test before and after ct (n = 20) or a waitlist period (n = 20) and were compared to healthy controls (n = 21). self-reported depersonalization was measured immediately after each stress test. depersonalization significantly decreased following ct, especially in treatment responders (eta(2)(p) = 0.32). pre-treatment depersonalization did neither predict nor mediate post-treatment severity of social anxiety. further prospective studies are needed for a better scientific understanding of this effect. it should be scrutinized whether sad-patients suffering from depersonalization would benefit from a more specific therapy.

seasonal_affective_disorder	body condition is an important determinant of fitness in many natural populations. however, as for many fitness traits, the underlying genes that regulate body condition remain elusive. the dopamine receptor d4 gene (drd4) is a promising candidate as dopamine is known to play an important role in the regulation of food intake and the metabolism of both glucose and lipids in vertebrates. in this study, we take advantage of a large data set of greater flamingos, phoenicopterus roseus, to test whether drd4 polymorphism predicts early body condition (ebc) while controlling for whole-genome effects of inbreeding and outbreeding using microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity (mlh). we typed 670 of these individuals for exon 3 of the homologue of the human drd4 gene and 10 microsatellite markers. when controlling for the effects of yearly environmental variations and differences between sexes, we found strong evidence of an association between exon 3 drd4 polymorphisms and ebc, with 2.22.3% of the variation being explained by drd4 polymorphism, whereas there was only weak evidence that mlh predicts ebc. because ebc is most likely a polygenic trait, this is a considerable amount of variation explained by a single gene. this is to our knowledge, the first study to show an association between exon 3 drd4 polymorphism and body condition in non-human animals. we anticipate that the drd4 gene as well as other genes coding for neurotransmitters and their receptors may play an important role in explaining variation in traits that affect fitness.
eating_disorders	eating, disorders are associated with a range of abnormalities in eating behavior. some individuals consume large amounts of non-caloric artificial sweeteners, suggesting abnormalities in appetitive responding. the current study aimed to quantify hedonic and motivating effects of artificial sweetener in individuals with and without an eating disorder. two laboratory studies were conducted. hedonic preference was estimated using the number of artificial sweetener packets (0-10) added to unsweetened cherry flavored kool-aid (study 1). motivation to obtain sweetener was assessed by a progressive ratio (pr) work task (study 2). ninety-three participants (25 anorexia nervosa restricting type (an-r), 23 an binge/purge type (an-b/p), 20 bulimia nervosa (bn), and 25 normal controls (nc)) completed the study. no significant difference in hedonic preference was found among participant groups. work completed at the pr task ranged from 0 to 9500 key-board presses. the an-b/p group had a significantly higher breakpoint and performed significantly more work for sweetener compared to the bn and nc groups. among an-b/p and an-r participants, the preferred number of equal packets was significantly correlated with the breakpoint and total work. the increased amount of work for sweetener among individuals with an-b/p supports an enhanced reward value of sweet taste in this population, and suggests that the characteristic food avoidance in an cannot be accounted for by decreased reward value of all taste-related stimuli. this study also supports the novel application of a pr ratio task to quantify the motivating effect of sweet taste among individuals with an eating disorder.

prenatal_development	hominin evolution is characterized by two main trends, transition to bipedality and increase in brain size. fossil evidence shows that both trends had a major impact on the structure and function of the hominin skull. this chapter asks how evolutionary modification of the cranial ontogenetic program led to morphological reorganization of the hominin skull and ultimately to hominin cranial diversity. three major mechanisms of evolutionary developmental reorganization are proposed: modified prenatal development of the cranial base and face reflects adaptation to bipedality; high rates of neurocranial growth during early postnatal ontogeny are essential to attain large brain sizes; taxon-specific modification of facial development reflects dietary adaptation and-in the genus homo-a general trend toward neoteny.
depression	a growing body of research suggests that bipolar spectrum disorders (bsds) are associated with high aggression. however, little research has prospectively examined how aggression may affect time to onset of hypomanic/manic versus major depressive episodes. in a longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that aggression would prospectively predict a shorter time to the onset of hypomanic/manic episodes and a longer time to the onset of major depressive episodes, based on the behavioral approach system theory of bsds. young adults (n=120) diagnosed with cyclothymia, bipolar ii disorder, or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified were followed every 4 months for an average of 3.55 years. participants completed measures of depressive and manic symptoms, family history of mood disorder, impulsivity, and aggression at baseline and were followed prospectively with semistructured diagnostic interview assessments of hypomanic/manic and major depressive episodes and treatment seeking for mood problems. cox proportional hazard regression analyses indicated that overall, physical, and verbal aggression predicted a longer time to major depressive episode onset, even after controlling for baseline depressive and manic symptoms, family history of mood disorder, treatment seeking for mood problems, and impulsivity. aggression, however, did not significantly predict time to onset of hypomanic/manic episodes, controlling for the same covariates. the findings suggest that approach-related behaviors may be utilized to delay the onset of major depressive episodes among people with bsds.
prosocial_behavior	some children show anger inappropriate for the situation based on the predominant incentives, which is called context-inappropriate anger. children need to attend to and interpret situational incentives for appropriate emotional responses. we examined associations of context-inappropriate anger with emotion recognition and attention problems in 43 preschoolers (42% male; m age=55.1 months, sd=4.1). parents rated context-inappropriate anger across situations. teachers rated attention problems using the child behavior checklist-teacher report form. emotion recognition was ability to recognize emotional faces using the emotion matching test. anger perception bias was indicated by anger to non-anger situations using an adapted affect knowledge test. 28% of children showed context-inappropriate anger, which correlated with lower emotion recognition (=-.28) and higher attention problems (=.36). higher attention problems correlated with more anger perception bias (=.32). this cross-sectional, correlational study provides preliminary findings that children with context-inappropriate anger showed more attention problems, which suggests that both problems tend to covary and associate with deficits or biases in emotion knowledge.
depression	psychiatric disorders and in particular depression have increased during the ""great recession"". the aim of this study was to investigate the consumption of psychotropic drugs in people who lost their permanent employment, using administrative data. the study considered all of the subjects domiciled in lombardy, northern italy, who lost a permanent employment between 2008 and 2010, not assuming psychotropic drugs and who did not find a new job within the following 12 months. the control group included people who did not lose permanent job in the study period, matched to the cases for gender, age, nationality, skill level, education and economic sector, using propensity score matching. the subjects who lost their permanent employment were 17 % more likely to receive one or more drug prescriptions than the controls, but the difference was significant only for males. females, subjects aged >50 years, low skill level workers and italians were more likely to have received a prescription for psychotropic drugs than respectively males, subjects aged 20-29 years or aged 30-39 years, low skill level workers and non-italians. the average number of drugs prescribed for those who lost their job and those who continued working was respectively 2.9 and 3.1. in conclusion, losing a permanent job increases significantly psychotropic drugs consumption in males but not in females.
attention	recently, ubiquitous manufacturing has attracted wide attention in both academia and industry. to create a successful ubiquitous manufacturing system, an efficient material handling system is essential. in accordance with this reason, mobile robots have been used for transporting materials. this paper aims at developing a methodology for scheduling the material supply for a single mobile robot in a ubiquitous manufacturing environment. in this type of environment, the processing rate of the materials along with supply quantity corresponds to the cycle of material supply. the carrying capacity of the robots are limited and thus the problem of determining the material supply quantity and material supply schedule without lack of materials for production or service processes becomes complicated. in this work, a nonlinear program is formulated to schedule the supply of material and determine the required material quantity. a heuristic algorithm based on genetic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. from the numerical experiments conducted in this study, it is observed that the proposed algorithm shows good performance and can also be implemented to solve large scale problems.

eating_disorders	background: negative body image is a risk factor for development and relapse in eating disorders (ed). many patients continue to be dissatisfied with their body shape or weight after treatment. this study presents a qualitative analysis of written reflections on body image from patients with an ed and a negative body image before and after an acceptance and commitment therapy group treatment at a specialized ed-unit. method: before and after the treatment participants (n = 47) answered a questionnaire with open ended questions on their thoughts on body image. data were analyzed through conventional content analysis. results: body image meant different things for different participants. for some it had to do with how you evaluate your body, whereas others focused on whether their body image was realistic or not. some emphasized their relationship with their body, while some described body image as strongly related to global self-esteem. these different views on the concept of body image affected the participants' descriptions of their own body image, and how they wanted it to change. body image was considered a state that fluctuated from day to day. after treatment the participants described changes in their body image, for instance perceiving oneself as less judgmental towards one 's body, and a shift in focus to the important things in life. conclusions: the participants had different views on body image and how they wished it to change. thus treatment interventions targeting negative body image needs to address various aspects of this complex construct.
depression	there is a large body of literature on attachment styles and personality traits. the purpose of this study was to compare two commonly used instruments of attachment that measure secure, fearful, dismissing, and preoccupied styles. furthermore, we sought to determine which personality factors and facets were common on both of the attachment measures. overall, 273 undergraduates completed a demographic measure, two attachment scales (rq and rsq), and the neo-pi-r to measure personality. we found high concordance between the neo-pi-r factors and facets that predicted rsq and rq attachment. on both measures of attachment, a secure style was associated with lower neuroticism and higher extraversion. fearful attachment was consistently predicted by being female, having higher neuroticism (specifically depression) as well as lower extraversion and agreeableness (specifically trust). individuals scoring higher on preoccupied attachment had higher neuroticism (specifically depression) and lower agreeableness. finally, individuals scoring higher on dismissing attachment had lower trust. these results confirm griffin and bartholemew 's(1994) conceptualization of attachment as falling on the dimensions of anxiety and avoidance. individuals with higher anxiety had higher neuroticism and lower agreeableness and those with higher avoidance had lower levels of trust. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
social_cognition	this study examines whether the perception of peripersonal action-space and interpersonal social-space is modified in patients with restrictive-type anorexia in two experimental conditions using videos. first, participants stopped the video of an approaching stimulus when they felt the distance to be comfortable for interacting with it (first-person perspective). second, participants stopped the video when an observed individual approaching a stimulus, or being approached by it, was at a comfortable distance (third-person perspective). in the first-person perspective, the results showed an estimation of peripersonal space that did not differ from controls when an object was approaching and an increase in interpersonal space compared with controls when a male or female individual was approaching. in the third-person perspective, both individual-object and individual-individual distances were larger in anorexic patients. these results indicate a specific deficit in adjusting interpersonal distances in both the first-person and third-person perspectives. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd and eating disorders association.
child_abuse	background: all types of abuse and neglect have been associated with suicide attempts. however, the association between the level of each type of childhood trauma and suicidal behavior severity (including the progression from ideation to attempts), adjusting for their co-occurrence, is not yet clear. methods: we used a cross-sectional web-based survey collected from the brazilian internet study on temperament and psychopathology (brainstep) to investigate the isolated effects of each type of childhood trauma on suicidal behavior severity. the sample consisted of 71,429 self-selected volunteers assessed with the childhood trauma questionnaire (ctq) and the following key question: ""have you ever thought about or attempted to kill yourself?'' (suicidal behavior questionnaire, sbq-17). results: after adjusting for demographic variables, and childhood trauma subtypes, severe emotional abuse (ea) was associated with suicidal ideation and attempts, mainly for serious suicide attempts (or, 22.71; 95% ci, 2.32-222.05). we found associations of smaller magnitude for severe emotional neglect (en) with serious suicide attempts, and for severe physical neglect (pn) and sexual abuse (sa) with attempts without really meaning to die. no meaningful trend for physical abuse (pa) was found. using as reference group ideators, ea was associated with serious suicide attempts, with a peak at the 95th percentile (or, 4.39; 95% ci, 2.04-9.41). we found associations of smaller magnitude for pn and sa, and no meaningful trend for en and pa. conclusions: suicidal behavior was strongly associated with emotional abuse in childhood, even when compared with ideators, suggesting that it is a relevant factor for the progression from ideation to attempts.

person_perception	past research has shown that the gender typicality of applicants' faces affects leadership selection irrespective of a candidate 's gender: a masculine facial appearance is congruent with masculine-typed leadership roles, thus masculine-looking applicants are hired more certainly than feminine-looking ones. in the present study, we extended this line of research by investigating hiring decisions for both masculine-and feminine-typed professional roles. furthermore, we used eye tracking to examine the visual exploration of applicants' portraits. our results indicate that masculine-looking applicants were favored for the masculine-typed role (leader) and feminine-looking applicants for the feminine-typed role (team member). eye movement patterns showed that information about gender category and facial appearance was integrated during first fixations of the portraits. hiring decisions, however, were not based on this initial analysis, but occurred at a second stage, when the portrait was viewed in the context of considering the applicant for a specific job.
prenatal_development	the potencies of resorcinol, 6-propylthiouracil (ptu) and methimazole (mmi) for inducing developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity were compared in pregnant rats, regarded as valid model for human thyroid toxicity. profound differences on maternal thyroid hormone levels (ths), maternal toxicity as well as developmental and neurotoxicity sequelae occurred. resorcinol affected none of those end points. ptu and mmi caused significant effects. therapy with either ptu or mmi during the first trimester of human pregnancy can cause reductions of maternal ths, accompanied by disruptions of prenatal development. clinical mmi studies show sporadic evidence of teratogenic effects, with equivocal relation to thyroid peroxidase (tpo) inhibition. in recent decades no mmi associated prenatal toxicity has been reported, an outcome possibly related to carefully managed therapy. orally administered resorcinol was rapidly absorbed, metabolized and excreted and was undetectable in the thyroid. in contrast, ptu or mmi accumulated. resorcinol 's potency to inhibit tpo was profoundly lower than that of ptu or mmi. quantum chemical calculations may explain low resorcinol reactivity with tpo. thus, distinctions in the target organ and the tpo inhibitory potency between these chemicals are likely contributing to different reductions of maternal ths levels and affecting the potency to cause developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity.

false_memories	previous research has shown that rating words for their relevance to a survival scenario leads to better retention of the words than rating them for self-reference. past studies have, however, relied exclusively on an autobiographical self-reference task in which participants rate how easily a common noun brings to mind a personal experience. we report five experiments comparing survival processing to a descriptive self-reference task in which participants rated how well trait words described them. rating trait adjectives for survival value led to higher levels of recall and recognition than rating them for their relevance to a moving home scenario. rating the adjectives for self-reference, however, led to higher levels of recall (experiments 1 and 3) and recollection (experiment 2) than survival rating. experiment 4 replaced trait adjectives with trait nouns and found that self-reference led to greater recognition accuracy than survival processing. experiment 5 used trait nouns followed by tests of free recall and found a memory advantage following self-reference that was not influenced by the imageability of the stimuli. the findings are discussed in terms of theories of the survival processing and self-reference effects and the relationship between them.

gender_roles	this study examined how college women 's instrumentality and expectations about combining work and family predicted early career development variables. specifically, 177 undergraduate women completed measures of instrumentality (i.e., traits such as ambition, assertiveness, and risk taking), willingness to compromise career for family, anticipated work-family conflict, traditionality of career choice, leadership aspirations, and occupational engagement. high levels of instrumentality were associated with strong leadership aspirations and occupational engagement. an inverse relationship emerged between the selection of a more traditional career and less anticipation that work would interfere with time spent with family, and a positive relationship emerged between high leadership aspirations and more anticipation that family would be a strain on work. additionally, anticipating that work would interfere with time spent with family had a positive relationship with occupational engagement. findings are discussed, and recommendations for career counseling for young women are provided.
social_cognition	it has been suggested that dogs' ability to comprehend human pointing gestures evolved as a by-product of the socio-emotional changes associated with domestication. given the large role played by the oxytocin system in socio-emotional processes, it is possible to hypothesize a role for oxytocin in modulating dogs' socio-communicative skills. indeed, it has been shown that intranasal oxytocin enhances dogs' ability to use human pointing cues in an object choice task, a classic paradigm used to assess the ability to follow a pointing gesture. we further tested this hypothesis in another sample of dogs and replicated the above findings. we also provided a novel explanation to the above findings, suggesting that oxytocin released during human-dog interactions increases the positive expectations about human behaviour via emotion and reward processes and thus facilitates the interpretation of pointing as leading to positive events. given the large and deep homology across mammals in the neural mechanisms involved in emotions, oxytocin could be involved in the acquisition of socio-communicative skills during human typical as well as pathological development.
attention	nowadays, the significant increase in noise has become a major problem in urban areas. using pervious concrete pavement is recommended to reduce the noise. unfortunately, standard materials used to produce pervious concrete are not completely environmental friendly. as a result, many researchers have devoted their attention towards identifying eco-friendlier substitutions to be used in the manufacturing of pervious concrete. in this respect, this current paper discussed the efficiency of two different sizes of oil palm kernel shell (ks) and cockle shell (cs) as partial replacement of natural coarse aggregate for sound absorption of pervious concrete. thirteen mixtures were made, which replaced 6.30 mm limestone with 0, 25, 50 and 75% of 6.30 mm and 4.75 mm of both shells. the specimens were cured in a fog room and void content and compressive strength were tested. the replacement of both ks and cs as the natural aggregate decreased the compressive strength, although the range was still acceptable for pervious concrete at 28 days. however, the angular shape of both shells caused high void content. the maximum increase in void content compared to that of the control pervious concrete (cpc) was achieved with the use of 75% of 6.30 mm ks at 28 days. moreover, by increasing sound absorption with the application of both shells, particularly ks, the concrete could be used as silent road pavement. it was therefore concluded that the use of both ks and cs to produce cleaner and quitter pervious concrete pavement is practical, both mechanically and environmentally.

prosocial_behavior	in an attempt to explain the inconsistent findings and overall weak relation between empathy and aggression, we focused on the role of emotional empathy (emotions of concern, compassion or sympathy toward a (potential) victim), agentic goals (the desire to be dominant during social interaction with peers) and their interplay (mediation or moderation) in the prediction of proactive aggression (learned instrumental behavior) in adolescence. data were collected from 550 young dutch adolescents, who filled out multiple questionnaires. findings showed that the link between a lack of empathic concern and proactive aggression is partly mediated and moderated by agentic goals. the moderation analyses showed that the predictive value of a lack of empathic concern with regard to proactive aggression was greater when adolescents reported a stronger desire to be dominant in social situations with peers. in addition, the findings supported the assumption that the relation between empathic concern and reactive aggression (a hostile and angry response to perceived provocation) is not mediated or moderated by agentic goals. findings were discussed in terms of their implications for future research.

borderline_personality_disorder	purpose: adults presenting with borderline personality disorder (bpd) score poorly on measures of health related quality of life (hrqol). little is known about hrqol in adolescents with bpd type presentations and how treatment impacts quality of life. our primary aim was to use routinely collected quality-of-life outcome measures pre and post-treatment in dialectical behaviour therapy (dbt) for adolescents to address this gap. secondary aims were to benchmark these data against euroqol 5 dimensions (eq-5d (tm)) outcomes for clients treated in clinical trials and to assess the potential of the eq-5d (tm) as a benchmarking tool. method: four adolescent dbt teams, routinely collecting outcome data using a pseudonymised secure web-based system, supplied data from consecutive discharges. results: young people in the dbt programmes (n = 43) had severely impaired hrqol scores that were lower at programme admission than those reported in published studies using the eq-5d (tm) in adults with a bpd diagnosis and in one study of adolescents treated for depression. 40 % of adolescents treated achieved reliable clinical change. hrqol improved between admission and discharge with a large effect size. these results were not statistically significant when clustering in programme outcomes was accounted for. conclusion: young people treated in nhs dbt programmes for bpd type presentations had poorer hrqol than adults with a bpd diagnosis and adolescents with depression treated in published clinical trials. the eq-5d (tm) detected reliable change in this group of adolescents. programme outcome clustering suggests that both the measure and the web-based monitoring system provide a mechanism for benchmarking clinical programmes.
prosocial_behavior	the authors examined the role of sympathy and moral respect in children 's overt aggression, and the subtypes of proactive and reactive aggression, in an ethnically diverse sample of 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds (n = 110). aggressive behaviors were measured through teacher reports and peer nominations. sympathy was assessed through teacher reports. children reported on their moral respect within an interview procedure where they were asked for their feelings of respect toward hypothetical peers who displayed morally relevant behaviors. results revealed that sympathy and moral respect were both negatively related to overt aggression and to the proactive aggression subtype, but unrelated to the reactive aggression subtype. the authors discuss the implications of the findings in relation to developmental research on the affective antecedents of children 's aggressive behavior.
prenatal_development	the blood-brain barrier (bbb) is a critical contributor to brain function. to understand its development and potential function in different brain regions, the postnatal (p) bbb was investigated in the mouse cortex (ctx), lateral hypothalamus, and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pvn). brains were examined on postnatal days (p)12, p22 and p52 for bbb competency and for pericytes as key cellular components of the bbb demarcated by immunoreactive desmin. glucocorticoid influences (excess dexamethasone; dex) during prenatal development were also assessed for their impact on the blood vessels within these regions postnatally. at p12, there was significantly more extravascular leakage of a low molecular weight dye (fluorescein isothiocyanate) in the ctx than within hypothalamic regions. for pericytes, there were low levels of desmin immunoreactivity at p12 that increased with age for all regions. there was more desmin immunoreactivity present in the pvn at each age examined. fetal dex exposure resulted in decreased blood vessel density within the pvn at p20. in the ctx, dex exposure increased bbb competency, in contrast to the pvn where there was a decrease in bbb competency and increased pericyte presence. overall, unique alterations in the functioning of the bbb within the pvn may provide a novel mechanism for fetal antecedent programming that may influence adult disorders.
attention	cognitive control enables successful goal-directed behavior by resolving a conflict between opposing action tendencies, while emotional control arises as a consequence of emotional conflict processing such as in irony. while negative emotion facilitates both cognitive and emotional conflict processing, it is unclear how emotional conflict processing is affected by positive emotion (e.g., humor). in 2 eeg experiments, we investigated the role of positive audiovisual target stimuli in cognitive and emotional conflict processing. participants categorized either spoken vowels (cognitive task) or their emotional valence (emotional task) and ignored the visual stimulus dimension. behaviorally, a positive target showed no influence on cognitive conflict processing, but impeded emotional conflict processing. in the emotional task, response time conflict costs were higher for positive than for neutral targets. in the eeg, we observed an interaction of emotion by congruence in the p200 and n200 erp components in emotional but not in cognitive conflict processing. in the emotional conflict task, the p200 and n200 conflict effect was larger for emotional than neutral targets. thus, our results show that emotion affects conflict processing differently as a function of conflict type and emotional valence. this suggests that there are conflict- and valence-specific mechanisms modulating executive control.
child_abuse	munchausen syndrome by proxy (msbp), also known as fabricated or induced illness in a child by a caretaker, is a form of abuse where a caregiver deliberately produces or feigns illness in a person under his or her care, so that the proxy will receive medical care that gratifies the caregiver. the affected children are often hospitalized for long periods and endure repetitive, painful and expensive diagnostic attempts. we present an analytically confirmed case of msbp by alimemazine. a 3-year-old boy was brought repetitively to a pediatric emergency department by his mother because he presented limb tremors, dysarthria, obnubilation, and ataxia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures coinciding with intermittent fever. neither the rest of the physical examination nor the complementary tests showed any significant alterations. msbp was suspected and a routine systematic toxicological analysis in urine and blood was requested. alimemazine was detected in all biological samples. the administration of this drug was never mentioned by the mother and the subsequent interview with her corroborated the suspicion of msbp. clinically, after separation from the mother, the child 's neurological symptoms gradually improved until the complete disappearance of the cerebellar symptoms. alimemazine was quantified in serum, urine, gastric content and cerebrospinal fluid samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (maximum serum level was 0.42 mu g/ml). hair quantification of alimemazine was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in different segments of hair. the results confirmed regular substance use during the at least eight last months (8.8, 14.7, 19.7 and 4.6 ng/mg hair starting from most proximal segment). this patient represents the first case published with analytical data of alimemazine in blood, urine, gastric content, cerebrospinal fluid and hair, which allowed us to prove an acute and repetitive poisoning with alimemazine as evidence of msbp.

social_cognition	social cognition is a topic of enormous interest and much research, but we are far from having an agreed taxonomy or factor structure of relevant processes. the aim of this review is to outline briefly what is known about the structure of social cognition and to suggest how further progress can be made to delineate the in(ter)dependence of core sociocognitive processes. we focus in particular on several processes that have been discussed and tested together in typical and atypical (notably autism spectrum disorder) groups: imitation, biological motion, empathy, and theory of mind. we consider the domain specificity/generality of core processes in social learning, reward, and attention, and we highlight the potential relevance of dual-process theories that distinguish systems for fast/automatic and slow/effortful processing. we conclude with methodological and conceptual suggestions for future progress in uncovering the structure of social cognition.
prenatal_development	progesterone produced by the corpus luteum (cl) regulates the synthesis of various endometrial proteins required for embryonic implantation and development. compromised cl progesterone production is a potential risk factor for prenatal development. reactive oxygen species (ros) play diverse roles in mammalian reproductive biology. ros-induced oxidative damage and subsequent adverse developmental outcomes constitute important issues in reproductive medicine. the cl is considered to be highly exposed to locally produced ros due to its high blood vasculature and steroidogenic activity. ros-induced apoptotic cell death is involved in the mechanisms of cl regression that occurs at the end of the non-fertile cycle. luteal ros production and propagation depend upon several regulating factors, including luteal antioxidants, steroid hormones and cytokines, and their crosstalk. however, it is unknown which of these factors have the greatest contribution to the maintenance of cl integrity and function during the oestrous/menstrual cycle. there is evidence to suggest that antioxidants play important roles in cl rescue from luteolysis when pregnancy ensues. as luteal phase defect impacts fertility by preventing implantation and early conceptus development in livestock and humans, this review attempts to address the importance of ros-scavenging antioxidant enzymes in the control of mammalian cl function and integrity.

seasonal_affective_disorder	objective at temperate latitudes, 1-5% of the population suffer from winter depression; during winter, mood difficulties tend to increase but may be alleviated by bright light therapy. unlike indoor workers, outdoor workers are exposed to therapeutic levels of sunlight during winter. we hypothesized that outdoor work may protect against mood difficulties and depression. method we studied this hypothesis among 2910 civil servants from arhus, denmark, who participated in a survey in january february 2009. mental symptoms (n=422) defined a common case category that we broke down into two parts: depression (n=66) and mood difficulties but no depression (n=356). a total of 222 controls were also sampled from the study population. all 644 participants reported the extent of outdoor work. results the confounder-adjusted odds ratio (or) of mood difficulties showed a decreasing trend by increasing hours of outdoor work of borderline statistical significance. the or was 0.63 [95% confidence interval (95% ci) 0.34-1.18)] for those working outdoors for >2 hours a day. no such effect was suggested for depression. conclusion our study is limited by its cross-sectional design and low statistical power but nevertheless suggests that outdoor work during winter may protect against mood difficulties. if this finding holds true, it may have significant impact on workers' health as well as public health in general. therefore, further studies are recommended.
prosocial_behavior	past research has established clear support for the prosocial function of gratitude in improving the well-being of others. the present research provides evidence for another hypothesized function of gratitude: the social alignment function, which enhances the tendency of grateful individuals to follow social norms. we tested the social alignment hypothesis of gratitude in 2 studies with large samples. using 2 different conformity paradigms, participants were subjected to a color judgment task (experiment 1) and a material consumption task (experiment 2). they were provided with information showing choices allegedly made by others, but were allowed to state their responses in private. supporting the social alignment hypothesis, the results showed that induced gratitude increased private conformity. specifically, participants induced to feel gratitude were more likely to conform to the purportedly popular choice, even if the option was factually incorrect (experiment 1). this effect appears to be specific to gratitude; induction of joy produced significantly less conformity than gratitude (experiment 2). we discuss whether the social alignment function provides a behavioral pathway in the role of gratitude in building social relationships.
eating_disorders	interoception and exteroception for body signals are two different ways of perceiving the self: the first from within, the second from outside. we investigated the relationship between interoceptive accuracy (iacc) and external perception of the body and we tested if seeing the body from an external perspective can affect iacc. fifty-two healthy female subjects performed a standard heartbeat perception task to assess the lacc, before and after the body image revealer (bir), which is a body perception task designed to assess the different aspects of body-image. the performance of the lower lacc group in the heartbeat perception task significantly improved after the exteroceptive task. these findings highlight the relations between interoceptive and exteroceptive body-representations, supporting the view that these two kinds of awareness are linked and interact with each other.

media_violence	the issue of whether video gamesviolent or nonviolentharm children and adolescents continues to be hotly contested in the scientific community, among politicians, and in the general public. to date, researchers have focused on college student samples in most studies on video games, often with poorly standardized outcome measures. to answer questions about harm to minors, these studies are arguably not very illuminating. in the current analysis, i sought to address this gap by focusing on studies of video game influences on child and adolescent samples. the effects of overall video game use and exposure to violent video games specifically were considered, although this was not an analysis of pathological game use. overall, results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences on increased aggression (r = .06), reduced prosocial behavior (r = .04), reduced academic performance (r = -.01), depressive symptoms (r = .04), and attention deficit symptoms (r = .03) are minimal. issues related to researchers' degrees of freedom and citation bias also continue to be common problems for the field. publication bias remains a problem for studies of aggression. recommendations are given on how research may be improved and how the psychological community should address video games from a public health perspective.
schizophrenia	electroconvulsive therapy is being used more frequently in the treatment of many chronic and acute psychiatric illnesses in children. the most common psychiatric indications for pediatric electroconvulsive therapy are refractory depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, catatonia, and autism. in addition, a relatively new indication is the treatment of pediatric refractory status epilepticus. the anesthesiologist may be called upon to assist in the care of this challenging and vulnerable patient population. unique factors for pediatric electroconvulsive therapy include the potential need for preoperative anxiolytic and inhalational induction of anesthesia, which must be weighed against the detrimental effects of anesthetic agents on the evoked seizure quality required for a successful treatment. dexmedetomidine is likely the most appropriate preoperative anxiolytic as oral benzodiazepines are relatively contraindicated. methohexital, though becoming less available at many institutions, remains the gold standard for induction of anesthesia for pediatric electroconvulsive therapy though ketamine, propofol, and sevoflurane are becoming increasingly viable options. proper planning and communication between the multidisciplinary teams involved in the care of children presenting for electroconvulsive therapy treatments is vital to mitigating risks and achieving the greatest therapeutic benefit.
prenatal_development	background: in pigs, the perinatal period is the most critical time for survival. piglet maturation, which occurs at the end of gestation, leads to a state of full development after birth. therefore, maturity is an important determinant of early survival. skeletal muscle plays a key role in adaptation to extra-uterine life, e.g. glycogen storage and thermoregulation. in this study, we performed microarray analysis to identify the genes and biological processes involved in piglet muscle maturity. progeny from two breeds with extreme muscle maturity phenotypes were analyzed at two time points during gestation (gestational days 90 and 110). the large white (lw) breed is a selected breed with an increased rate of mortality at birth, whereas the meishan (ms) breed produces piglets with extremely low mortality at birth. the impact of the parental genome was analyzed with reciprocal crossed fetuses. results: microarray analysis identified 12,326 differentially expressed probes for gestational age and genotype. such a high number reflects an important transcriptomic change that occurs between 90 and 110 days of gestation. 2,000 probes, corresponding to 1,120 unique annotated genes, involved more particularly in the maturation process were further studied. functional enrichment and graph inference studies underlined genes involved in muscular development around 90 days of gestation, and genes involved in metabolic functions, such as gluconeogenesis, around 110 days of gestation. moreover, a difference in the expression of key genes, e.g. pck2, ldha or pgk1, was detected between ms and lw just before birth. reciprocal crossing analysis resulted in the identification of 472 genes with an expression preferentially regulated by one parental genome. most of these genes (366) were regulated by the paternal genome. among these paternally regulated genes, some known imprinted genes, such as magel2 or igf2, were identified and could have a key role in the maturation process. conclusion: these results reveal the biological mechanisms that regulate muscle maturity in piglets. maturity is also under the conflicting regulation of the parental genomes. crucial genes, which could explain the biological differences in maturity observed between lw and ms breeds, were identified. these genes could be excellent candidates for a key role in the maturity.
borderline_personality_disorder	borderline personality disorder (bpd) is characterized by severe and persistent impairments in interpersonal functioning. given the complexity of social interactions, studying the interactive behavior of bpd patients is challenging. one way to implement both tight experimental control and realistic, externally valid settings is to use game-theoretical experiments. this review discusses findings from economic exchange studies in bpd against the background of game-theoretical literature. bpd patients do not seem to derive utility from mutual cooperation with others and appear not to ""forgive"" a partner 's unfairness. by pursuing a strategy of negative reciprocity, bpd patients seem to act mostly ""rationally"" and in their own self-interest. their ""grim trigger strategy"" resembles the theoretical ideal of the rational and self interested agent homo economicus. finally, we summarize how research findings from economics and clinical psychiatry may be mutually enriching and propose new research ideas in this fascinating field.

nonverbal_communication	we collected short video clips of speakers and created five types of stimuli: (1) the original videos, (2) the audio tracks only, (3) single pictures only, (4) speech content, and (5) stick-figure animations displaying body motion. participants rated these stimuli on a brief big five personality inventory. we then used ratings of the incomplete information conditions to predict ratings of the original video condition. impressions in the audio track condition were strong predictors throughout all trait ratings. however, other cues were also non-negligible contributors to an overall impression. people even make sense of parsimonious cues, e.g., an animated stick-figure. thus, presenters on a public stage are not only judged by what they say but also by how they move.

child_abuse	baby factories and baby harvesting are relatively new terms that involve breeding, trafficking, and abuse of infants and their biological mothers. since it was first described in a united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization report in nigeria in 2006, several more baby factories have been discovered over the years. infertile women are noted to be major patrons of these baby factories due to the stigmatization of childless couples in southern nigeria and issues around cultural acceptability of surrogacy and adoption. these practices have contributed to the growth in the industry which results in physical, psychological, and sexual violence to the victims. tackling baby factories will involve a multifaceted approach that includes advocacy and enacting of legislation barring baby factories and infant trafficking and harsh consequences for their patrons. also, programs to educate young girls on preventing unwanted pregnancies are needed. methods of improving awareness and acceptability of adoption and surrogacy and reducing the administrative and legal bottlenecks associated with these options for infertile couples should be explored to diminish the importance of baby factories.
child_abuse	mobile technologies are increasingly adopted by information intensive organizations such as public police corporations to support the tasks of its employees, for information management and innovation. however, because police organizations are government organizations, technology decisions are largely made by managers and politicians with budget being a key factor. therefore, whether the technologies adopted are suitable for police tasks, and if they enhance performance, is generally not assessed. the aim of this research is to establish if mobile technologies support police tasks, and if tablet pcs especially are suitable for specialist police tasks of the criminal investigators and sexual offence and child abuse units. guided by an interpretive paradigm and the theory of task technology fit, this research explores the use of tablet pcs by the two police units for improved performance. because information is critical for police tasks, data collected via focus groups establishes the impact of these technologies on case investigations, information management, and the performance of these units with the use of tablet pcs. the contribution this study makes to mobile information systems is that if technology dimensions are suitable for information based tasks, the outcome is virtualization of processes through which improved performance is achieved due to reduced costs, transparency, teamwork, and quick and informed decisions. the findings of this research can be used by police organizations, as well as by other organizations, for effective implementation of mobile technologies.
eating_disorders	by virtue of adopting the core symptomatic fear (i.e., a fear of weight gain) as a primary treatment target, the treatment of an centrally involves exposure-driven processes. however, exposure trials targeting the fear of weight gain in an have been sparse, yielding mixed results to date. in translating extinction theory to the treatment of an, it is likely that the absence of a clear distinction between what constitutes the core feared cue and the core feared outcome has stymied the application of exposure treatments in an. this review considers several configurations of the core fear association in an, noting distinct therapeutic strategies which may allow for more precise efforts in violating fear-based expectancies. specific guidance is offered in the clinical decision making process as to which strategies might best promote inhibitory learning, and a clinical case is discussed, in which treatment was adjusted to specifically violate the core underlying fear association.

gender_roles	published in 1911, margaret deland 's the iron woman depicts the transformation in the american cultural scene of the second half of the nineteenth century as affected by the powers of industrialization, modernity, and intellectuality. while reflecting on an extensive change in the social landscape, cultural ideology, gender roles, and family relations, the novel presents a unique exploration of the motherhood experience. i argue in this study that deland reconceptualizes the female maternal experience by defying an already established ambivalent discourse about mothers in the american culture. this ambivalence, as exposed and challenged in the iron woman, has confined motherhood within different power relations which seek to codify the lives of mothers religiously, culturally, socially, and psychologically. although she lived in a pre-feminist era, deland was able to anticipate a modern feminist argument of motherhood in her characterization of real mothers who struggle in their society and resist conforming to the traditional idealization and essentialist prototypes that accompany mother figures in the american cultural mind. the major concern of this study is to discuss how deland challenges a number of cultural codes of motherhood; such as, the religiously idealized virgin mary, the socially constructed ""true woman,"" and the newly introduced modernist ""new woman."" stepping beyond a dual, ambivalent discourse that glorifies mothers on one hand, and blames them on the other, margaret deland forges a new maternal path in her mother characters who resist inconsistency in culturally embedded notions of motherhood which codify and perpetuate a restrictive mother image while neglecting actual experiences of mothering.
schizophrenia	second generation antipsychotics (sga) are associated with adverse cardiometabolic side effects contributing to premature mortality in patients. while mechanisms mediating these cardiometabolic side effects remain poorly understood, three independent studies recently demonstrated that melatonin was protective against cardiometabolic risk in sga-treated patients. as one of the main target areas of circulating melatonin in the brain is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), we hypothesized that the scn is involved in sga-induced early cardiovascular effects in wistar rats. we evaluated the acute effects of olanzapine and melatonin in the biological clock, paraventricular nucleus and autonomic nervous system using immunohistochemistry, invasive cardiovascular measurements, and western blot. olanzapine induced c-fos immunoreactivity in the scn followed by the paraventricular nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus indicating a potent induction of parasympathetic tone. the involvement of a scn-parasympathetic neuronal pathway after olanzapine administration was further documented using cholera toxin-b retrograde tracing and vasoactive intestinal peptide immunohistochemistry. olanzapine-induced decrease in blood pressure and heart rate confirmed this. melatonin abolished olanzapine-induced scn c-fos immunoreactivity, including the parasympathetic pathway and cardiovascular effects while brain areas associated with olanzapine beneficial effects including the striatum, ventral tegmental area, and nucleus accumbens remained activated. in the scn, olanzapine phosphorylated the gsk-3 beta, a regulator of clock activity, which melatonin prevented. bilateral lesions of the scn prevented the effects of olanzapine on parasympathetic activity. collectively, results demonstrate the scn as a key region mediating the early effects of olanzapine on cardiovascular function and show melatonin has opposing and potentially protective effects warranting additional investigation.
seasonal_affective_disorder	this paper seeks to analyze the influence of the weather on a person 's self-reported life satisfaction. on a theoretical level, it is claimed that 'nice' weather can improve the affective well-being of a person. given this, it is argued that affects can, in turn, have an impact on that person 's general assessment of his or her life. in particular, it is expected that people would report a higher life satisfaction on days with unambiguously 'nice' weather. data from three german large-scale surveys are used to test empirically to what extent self-reported life satisfaction is determined by the weather. all in all, the results are mostly consistent with the initial hypothesis. in all three samples those respondents surveyed on days with exceptionally sunny weather reported a higher life satisfaction compared to respondents interviewed on days with 'ordinary' weather. in two out of three samples, this difference was statistically significant. hence, the supposed sunshine effect on peoples' life satisfaction does indeed exist. implications of these findings are discussed in a conclusion.
person_perception	communicators, motivated by strategic self-presentation, selectively underreport negative content in describing their impressions of individuals and stereotypes of groups, particularly for targets whom they view ambivalently with respect to warmth and competence. communicators avoid overtly inaccurate descriptions, preferring to omit negative information and emphasize positive information about mixed individual targets (study 1). with more public audiences, communicators increasingly prefer negativity omission to complete accuracy (study 2), a process driven by self-presentation concerns (study 3) and moderated by bidimensional ambivalence. similarly, in an extension of the princeton trilogy studies, reported stereotypes of ethnic and national outgroups systematically omitted negative dimensions over 75 years as anti-prejudice norms intensified-while neutral and positive stereotype dimensions remained constant (study 4). multiple assessment methods confirm this stereotyping-by-omission phenomenon (study 5). implications of negativity omission for innuendo and stereotype stagnation are discussed.
media_violence	no follow-up studies exist on how minors who commit sexual homicides adjust once released back into the community. this is an important question given the extreme nature of their crimes, lack of recidivism data, and the expectation that one-half of them will be freed from prison by mid-life. likewise, no studies exist on the role our culture 's pervasive media violence plays in these offenses. this report describes a 13-year-old boy who committed a witnessed media violence-inspired sexual homicide. follow-up information is provided on his community adjustment as an adult four years after release from prison. he had multiple indicators of brain dysfunction, and watched a ""slasher"" film just before committing the blitz style crime upon a female neighbor. media violence literature is reviewed-against a backdrop of developmental abnormalities, neuropsychiatric vulnerabilities, family dysfunction, and mental illness. this case illustrates how the confluence of such variables, combined with the tinder of erotic screen violence, may lead to sexual murder.
depression	sleep problems are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). this study aimed to examine the following: (1) predictors of sleep quality and (2) fluctuations in sleep quality in patients with sle. patients with sle were recruited from three rheumatology centers in japan. we collected demographic and clinical data and data on sleep quality as measured by the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi), the medical outcome study short form-12, and the lupus patient reported outcome tool (lupuspro). fluctuations in sleep quality were examined by administering the psqi a second time after a 2-week interval. we used multiple linear regression analysis to predict sleep quality. of 205 patients who completed the survey, 62.9% showed poor sleep quality. the largest fluctuation in sleep quality was for ""waking in the middle of the night or early morning."" ""lupuspro pain/vitality"" was a major predictor of poor sleep. the other significant predictors were mostly lupuspro subscales and clinical variables and sf-12 subscales were mostly non-predictive. the majority of the participants had poor sleep quality. a lupus-specific qol scale is important for understanding poor sleep quality in sle patients. symptom management appeared to play a key role in improving sleep quality.
gender_roles	this paper studies the notations of students on their family and gender roles. feminine stereotypes are prevailingly established, and the masculinity of young men is less expressed. ideas on the roles of the women and men in the viewpoint of girls and young men were respectively collected. for girls, priority of career and family were ascertained, as well as the main motive of creation of a family. important qualities based on the ideas on roles and responsibilities of a life-partner or future husband: for girls, the important criteria in the choice of life partners were; the thought system, diligence, maturity, ability to provide for, and protect the family, confidence, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and lack of addictions. some students also noted the need for emotional contact between their spouses and their future children, as well as the consciousness of the importance of the husband as head of the family. from our research, were able to obtain data indicating immaturity of ideas on family structures, and gender roles. some students entertained the possibility of combination of domestic duties, child rearing, and career growth. some others preferred career to family. in students, the tendency to dominate, dictate, dish out orders, and others were shown, coupled with instability of character. in difficult situations, some of them preferred to rely on opinion and the decision of their spouse. the study subjects (youths) displayed low indicators of readiness to marriage. they understood marriage as an emotional journey, they overestimated romanticism, and most of the subjects lacked the major psychological and household skills needed in marriage. majority of students were interested in marriage, they had plans to get married in the nearest future.

media_violence	school shootings tear the fabric of society. in the wake of a school shooting, parents, pediatricians, policymakers, politicians, and the public search for ""the"" cause of the shooting. but there is no single cause. the causes of school shootings are extremely complex. after the sandy hook elementary school rampage shooting in newtown, connecticut, we wrote a report for the national science foundation on what is known and not known about youth violence. this article summarizes and updates that report. after distinguishing violent behavior from aggressive behavior, we describe the prevalence of gun violence in the united states and age-related risks for violence. we delineate important differences between violence in the context of rare rampage school shootings, and much more common urban street violence. acts of violence are influenced by multiple factors, often acting together. we summarize evidence on some major risk factors and protective factors for youth violence, highlighting individual and contextual factors, which often interact. we consider new quantitative ""data mining"" procedures that can be used to predict youth violence perpetrated by groups and individuals, recognizing critical issues of privacy and ethical concerns that arise in the prediction of violence. we also discuss implications of the current evidence for reducing youth violence, and we offer suggestions for future research. we conclude by arguing that the prevention of youth violence should be a national priority.
borderline_personality_disorder	premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd) is a psychiatric disorder that causes serious impairments in the functioning and quality of life of affected women. until recently, research efforts were somewhat hampered by the lack of formal diagnostic criteria, which have now been codified as a category in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5). better characterization of deficits in socioemotional functioning caused by pmdd may aid in improving treatment efforts. in this investigation, prospective symptom ratings, based on dsm-5 criteria, were used to measure pmdd symptoms in 36 women (18 with pmdd and 18 healthy controls). two self-report inventories, the emotion regulation questionnaire and the difficulties in emotion regulation scale, were used to measure ability to regulate emotions, and socioemotional functioning was measured by inventories of social connectedness, perceived stress, and affect. potential relationships between ability to regulate emotion and pmdd symptom severity, as well as other measures of socioemotional functioning and affective state, were tested. women with pmdd reported significantly more behavioral impulsivity and greater difficulties in regulating emotion and in socioemotional functioning. cognitive or behavioral strategies to improve these problems may benefit women with pmdd and help to alleviate distress caused by this disorder.
antisocial_personality_disorder	as measured with the psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r), psychopathy is a dimensional construct underpinned by 4 correlated factors: interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and antisocial. theorists and clinicians (e.g., karpman and arieti) have posited 2 variants of ""primary"" or ""true"" psychopathy, both distinct from so-called ""secondary"" or ""pseudopsychopathy."" we used latent profile analysis to determine if homogeneous classes exist within a sample of 1,451 male offenders with high pcl-r scores (>= 27). the 4 pcl-r factors were the dependent variables for clustering. a solution with 3 latent classes showed a better fit to the data than did a unitary model without latent classes. tentative labels for the latent classes are manipulative (latent class 1 [lc1]), aggressive (latent class 2 [lc2]), and sociopathic (latent class 3 [lc3]). the latter class represented an antisocial group that lacked the emotional detachment observed in the other 2 groups. we propose that lc1 and lc2 reflect phenotypic variations on a theme of the traditional construct of psychopathy, and that lc3 is consistent with conceptions of antisocial personality disorder and sociopathy. replication and external classification with an independent data set of 497 adult male offenders again yielded clearly separable clusters, as well as meaningful differences or trends among latent classes on education, intelligence, symptoms of antisocial personality disorder, and self-reported psychopathic traits and negative affect. the conceptualization of psychopathy in terms of manipulative and aggressive variants is consistent with clinical theory and is empirically grounded.
prejudice	this article examines the british national party (bnp) 's opposition to gay men during the 1980s and 1990s. drawing on the sociological concept of homohysteria', it examines written material from bnp publications during those decades, looking specifically at the aids crisis, the party 's belief in a queer conspiracy', and the role which homosexuality played in the decline of the national front and the birth of the bnp. the first study dedicated to british fascism 's anti-gay prejudice, this article argues that the existing scholarship fails to understand the degree and nature of anti-gay sentiment in the bnp, concluding that the party was homohysteric from its inception.
false_memories	individuals who study a list of words that are all related to another word that is not presented (a lure word) sometimes produce a false memory of having studied the lure word. the false memories are observed in lists of words that are in the same category as (category list) or associated with (associative list) a word that was not presented in an attempt to elicit false recall. the present study investigated whether young children create these types of false recall. following the study of a categorical list, false recall was elicited in young children to the same degree as in adults, but studying an associative list elicited false recall only in adults. furthermore, categorically related lure words did not have a priming effect in young children. these results suggest that the categorical false recall is produced via a different mechanism from the associative false recall.
prejudice	liberals and conservatives both express prejudice toward ideologically dissimilar others (brandt et al., 2014). previous work on ideological prejudice did not take advantage of evidence showing that ideology is multidimensional, with social and economic ideologies representing related but separable belief systems. in 5 studies (total n = 4912), we test 3 competing hypotheses of a multidimensional account of ideological prejudice. the dimension-specific symmetry hypothesis predicts that social and economic ideologies differentially predict prejudice against targets who are perceived to vary on the social and economic political dimensions, respectively. the social primacy hypothesis predicts that such ideological worldview conflict is experienced more strongly along the social than economic dimension. the social-specific asymmetry hypothesis predicts that social conservatives will be more prejudiced than social liberals, with no specific hypotheses for the economic dimension. using multiple target groups, multiple prejudice measures (e. g., global evaluations, behavior), and multiple social and economic ideology measures (self-placement, issue positions), we found relatively consistent support for the dimension-specific symmetry and social primacy hypotheses, and no support for the social-specific asymmetry hypothesis. these results suggest that worldview conflict and negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors are dimension-specific, but that the social dimension appears to inspire more political conflict than the economic dimension.
media_violence	in this article we reply to c. j. ferguson and j. kilburn 's (2010) critique of our meta-analysis on violent video game effects (c. a. anderson et al., 2010). we rely on well-established methodological and statistical theory and on empirical data to show that claims of bias and misinterpretation on our part are simply wrong. one should not systematically exclude unpublished studies from meta-analytic reviews. there is no evidence of publication or selection bias in our data. we did not purposely exclude certain studies: we included all studies that met our inclusion criteria. although c. j. ferguson and j. kilburn believe that the effects we obtained are trivial in size, they are larger than many effects that are deemed sufficiently large to warrant action in medical and violence domains. the claim that we (and other media violence scholars) are attempting to create a false crisis is a red herring.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the triarchic model of psychopathy (patrick, fowles, & krueger, 2009) was formulated as an integrative framework for reconciling differing conceptions of psychopathy. the model characterizes psychopathy in terms of 3 distinguishable phenotypic components: boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. data from a large mixed-gender undergraduate sample (n = 618) were used to examine relations of several of the best known measures for assessing psychopathic traits with scores on the triarchic psychopathy measure (tripm), an inventory developed to operationalize the triarchic model through separate facet scales. analyses revealed that established inventories of psychopathy index components of the model as indexed by the tripm to varying degrees. although each inventory provided effective coverage of meanness and disinhibition components, instruments differed in their representation of boldness. present results demonstrate the heuristic value of the triarchic model for delineating commonalities and differences among alternative measures of psychopathy and provide support for the utility of the triarchic model as a framework for reconciling alternative conceptions of psychopathy.
antisocial_personality_disorder	an extensive body of research has demonstrated that patients with a co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and substance use disorder (sud) diagnosis are at high risk for a wide range of negative clinical outcomes, including treatment noncompletion. however, no studies to date have explored the effect of a ptsd-sud diagnosis on residential sud treatment completion, as well as potential moderators of this effect. consequently, the goal of this study was to examine the interactive effect of a ptsd diagnosis, distress tolerance (dt), and gender on residential sud treatment retention. participants were 214 substance-dependent patients consecutively admitted to a residential sud treatment facility. participants were administered diagnostic interviews, completed a laboratory-based measure of dt, and were followed throughout the course of treatment. although no significant main effects were found, results did reveal a significant ptsd x gender x dt interaction. post hoc analyses indicated that, among men, those with a current diagnosis of ptsd and low dt completed a significantly lower proportion of residential sud treatment compared to all other groups. the implications of the study 's findings for identifying ways to improve residential sud treatment retention among patients with a ptsd-sud diagnosis are discussed.
child_abuse	child sexual abuse (csa) is a global public health problem with major consequences for the individual child and society. an earlier swedish study showed that the school nurses did not initially talk about nor mention csa as one form of child abuse. for the child to receive adequate support, the disclosure is a precondition and is dependent on an available person prepared to listen. the aim of the study was to explore the ability of the school nurses to detect and support sexually abused children. it is a secondary analysis of focus group interviews with school nurses. thematic analysis was performed. results showed that the school nurses avoided addressing csa due to arousal of strong emotions, ambivalence, and a complicated disclosure process. in order to detect csa and support abused children, attentiveness of sexual abuse as a possible cause of physical and mental illhealth is crucial.
problem-solving	early childhood years are the period of the greatest and most significant developments in ones' life, and are generally regarded as the basis upon which the rest of their life is constructed. however, these early years are those that traditionally have received the least attention from environmental education. this paper was aimed to summarize several day-to-day activities that can be conducted to educate children in their early years about environment. environmental education is an educational process that deals with the human interrelationships with the environment, and that uses an interdisciplinary problem solving approach with value clarification. environmental education is aimed at producing a community that is knowledgeable about the biophysical environment and its associated problems, aware of how to solve these problems, and enthusiastic to work toward their solution. it highlights the progress of knowledge, understanding, attitudes, skills, and commitment for environmental problems and considerations. further, environmental education can help children expand their ecological worldview, promote active care to the environment, and explain the relationship between modern life style and current environmental problems. several types of environmental education have been identified from the literature, such as outdoor activities in natural outdoor setting, school gardening, play-based learning, and drawing activities. each of these activities has its own characteristics and effects on children 's environmental-related attitudes and behaviors. through these activities, the unique characteristics of tropical and coastal areas can potentially be used to facilitate children to learn about nature and environment. recommendations for childhood education practitioners and future researchers are discussed.
problem-solving	this study aims to investigate the use of metacognitive online reading strategies among iraqi students. the research seeks to answer the following research questions: (i) what are the metacognitive online reading strategies of iraqi fourth year undergraduate students when they read online academic text? (ii) what are the difficulties faced by iraqi fourth year undergraduates when they read online academic text?. using a quantitative approach, the study deployed questionnaires which were administered on 50 fourth year students of al-salam university college, baghdad iraq. the response of the metacognitive online reading strategies among the students was assessed differently. the students adopt online dictionaries, reading e-books and online journal articles are some of the ways to increase the students' reading ability and enhance online reading among english as foreign language (efl) students from iraq. the researcher analyzed students metacognitive reading strategies usage and their problems. based on the quantitative analysis of the students' responses to the sors questionnaire, the students showed that problem-solving reading strategies (mu= 3.59) is the most frequently used strategy followed by support reading strategies (mu= 3.49) and global reading strategies (mu= 3.42). all these identified themes provide and help the students to improve their reading skills. the researcher recommends that future research examine other reading strategies with online or even print text. moreover, reading strategies should be taught to english as foreign language (efl) students.
gender_roles	this article examines the transformation from rice farming to commercial aquaculture and its implications for gender roles and relations, women 's access to and control over resources, household food security, and livelihood. primary data collected from 400 sample households located across 10 villages in northern and southern bangladesh were used for this study. data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods, namely, wealth-ranking technique, self-assessment technique, gini coefficient, lorenz curve, and descriptive statistics. commercial aquaculture increased both farm income and income inequality, brought in new sources of employment, changed gender roles and relations, altered women 's access to and control of resources, altered household food consumption patterns, and increased market dependence for staple food. commercial aquaculture not only decreased the workload of women but also weakened their access to and control over agricultural products. women became more dependent on the husband 's income and had lesser control over its use. farm mechanization reduces women farmer 's drudgery and diversification of rice monoculture toward rice-based high-value crops and aquaculture improves the welfare of everyone in society. this implies that poor farmers, including women, should be provided better access to improved technologies and credit.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the purpose of this study was to extend the investigation of criminal thinking of persons with mental illness beyond prison and community settings to a jail setting. participants consisted of 122 individuals incarcerated in a county jail who were diagnosed with a severe mental illness, including schizophrenia spectrum and major mood disorders. results indicated that people with mental illness in this sample of jail inmates presented with thinking styles that support a criminal lifestyle, and have criminal thinking styles that follow a pattern that is very similar to a sample of prison inmates with serious mental illness. these findings support the need for therapeutic programs for justice-involved persons with serious mental illness to develop a multipronged treatment approach that integrates interventions for individuals' criminal thinking and antisocial attitudes with treatment for their mental illness and substance abuse issues.
nonverbal_communication	the aim of this study was to use structured assessments to assess dental students' clinical communication skills exhibited during patient appointments. fourth-year dental students (n=55) at the university of alabama at birmingham evaluated their own interpersonal skills in a clinical setting utilizing the four habits coding scheme. an instructor also assessed student patient clinical communication. these assessments were used to identify perceived strengths and weaknesses in students' clinical communication. both instructor assessments and student self-assessments pinpointed the following clinical communication skills as effective the most often: patient greeting, avoidance of jargon, and non-verbal behavior. there was also relative agreement between instructor assessments and student self-assessments regarding clinical communication skills that were rated as not effective most frequently: ensuring patient comprehension, identification of patient feelings, and exploration of barriers to treatment. these resulted pointed to strengths and weaknesses in the portion of the curriculum designed to prepare students for effective provider patient communication. these results may suggest a need for the school 's current behavioral science curriculum to better address discussion of potential treatment barriers and patient feelings as well as techniques to ensure patient comprehension.
attention	waxy starches consist almost exclusively of amylopectin and do n't contain amylose molecules. despite extensive knowledge - and certain applications - of waxy maize starch in former times, the production and use of other high amylopectin starches is now increasing. this review deals with the physical processing of these starches (via gelatinization, gelation, extrusion, annealing, and heat moisture treatment) and with chemical and biochemical modification (e.g. acetylation, debranching of amylopectin, hydrolysis). great attention is paid to the digestibility of the products and the formation of nanoparticles. both usual and new food and non-food uses of rice, maize, wheat, barley and potato waxy starches are referred to.

person_perception	this study explores the relationship between the bar-on eq-i and the occupational personality questionnaire opq32i to determine if there is a link between self- and other-reported emotional intelligence and personality traits. data was obtained from 329 managers working in the it and finance sectors and included multi-source (360) measures of emotional intelligence. results indicated construct overlap and correlations between some elements of emotional intelligence and the opq32i with a stronger relationship between 360 measures of emotional intelligence and personality. on both the self-report measure of eq-i and the 360 measure the mood scale showed a strongest link with personality factors. measures of emotional intelligence which include a 360 component may thus provide a more useful indicator of an individual 's ability to manage their own feelings and those of others.
leadership	this paper examines the electoral and ideological contest that has taken place between welsh labour and plaid cymru in the five national assembly elections that have been held between 1999 and 2016. both parties have found success when they have managed to combine effective leadership with a coherent programme and a strong sense of welsh identity. however, the welsh vote to leave the eu in the june 2016 referendum has dealt both parties a poor hand in speaking up for welsh interests. can they find a common cause in working together and also with scotland to take wales forward in a progressive constitutional direction?
attention	this article explores the ways in which london lives were written together during the romantic period, considering representations across different genres and media including: poetry by william wordsworth, richard horwood 's house-by-house plan of the city (1792-9), fores 's new guide for foreigners ([?1789]), the 1788 volume of harris 's list of covent garden ladies, richard phillips' modern london (1804) and pierce egan 's life in london (1820-1). it pays particular attention to recovering evidence of marginalised individuals, whose lives were never written at book or article length, but of whom traces survive in glimpses and in aggregated forms such as plate series and directories. it also discusses the life writing of communities through the representation of common knowledge and the use of statistics, contrasting the confident assertions of knowledge made in guides, mapping and topography with the more conflicted and fragmented modes common in poetry and novels. through examining these issues, it contends that there are considerable benefits in thinking of life writing as being intrinsic to a far wider range of discourses than the standard biographical and autobiographical modes, arguing that a broader conception is invaluable for recovering occluded existences, modelling collective experience and understanding the hierarchies implicit in the ways in which lives are culturally inscribed.
prosocial_behavior	gratitude promotes well-being and prompts prosocial behavior. here, we examine a novel way to cultivate this beneficial emotion. we demonstrate that 2 different types of consumption-material consumption (buying for the sake of having) and experiential consumption (buying for the sake of doing)-differentially foster gratitude and giving. in 6 studies we show that reflecting on experiential purchases (e.g., travel, meals out, tickets to events) inspires more gratitude than reflecting on material purchases (e.g., clothing, jewelry, furniture), and that thinking about experiences leads to more subsequent altruistic behavior than thinking about possessions. in studies 1-2b, we use within-subject and between-subjects designs to test our main hypothesis: that people are more grateful for what they 've done than what they have. study 3 finds evidence for this effect in the real-world setting of online customer reviews: consumers are more likely to spontaneously mention feeling grateful for experiences they have bought than for material goods they have bought. in our final 2 studies, we show that experiential consumption also makes people more likely to be generous to others. participants who contemplated a significant experiential purchase behaved more generously toward anonymous others in an economic game than those who contemplated a significant material purchase. it thus appears that shifting spending toward experiential consumption can improve people 's everyday lives as well as the lives of those around them.
depression	introduction: depressive symptoms are common in patients assessed by neuropsychologists, and these symptoms can have an effect on cognitive functioning. discrepancies between patient- and informant-reported depressive symptoms have been found in some diagnostic groups, raising concerns as to the value of assessing depressive symptoms via self-report alone. this study aimed to examine the relationship between these discrepancies and cognitive functioning in a heterogeneous outpatient neuropsychological sample. method: sixty-two patients with a variety of diagnoses (e.g., stroke, mild cognitive impairment) completed a measure of depressive symptoms and a battery of neuropsychological tests. informants also rated the patients' depressive symptoms and completed a measure of the patients' functional abilities. results: patient and informant reports of depressive symptoms were moderately correlated; larger differences between patient- and informant-reported symptoms were associated with poorer verbal learning and memory and greater functional impairments. conclusions: the moderate level of agreement found for depressive symptoms is consistent with past studies using specific neuropsychological patient groups and other studies in both clinical and non-clinical populations. these results highlight the utility of collecting informant reports of depressive symptoms in neuropsychological evaluations.
eating_disorders	in the present study, we examined the role of cumulative childhood maltreatment experiences for several health related outcomes in adulthood, including symptoms of psychological distress as well as perceived social support and hardiness. the sample comprised adult survivors of sexual abuse (n=278, 95.3% women, mean age at first abusive incident = 6.4 years). one-way anovas revealed a statistically significant dose-response relation between cumulative childhood maltreatment scores and self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress (ptss), anxiety, depression, eating disorders, dissociation, insomnia, nightmare related distress, physical pain, emotional pain, relational problems, self-harm behaviors as well as on a measure of symptom complexity. cumulative childhood maltreatment was also associated with lower levels of work functioning. an inverse dose-response relation was found for perceived social support and hardiness. using a bonferroni corrected alpha level, cumulative childhood maltreatment remained significantly associated with all outcome measures with the exception of eating disorder symptoms after controlling for abuse-related independent variables in hierarchical regression analyses. results add to previous literature by showing that dose-response relation between cumulative childhood adversities and adult symptom outcomes could also be identified in a sample characterized by high exposure to adversities, and lends support to the notion put forth by previous authors that cumulative childhood adversities seem to be related to the severity of adult health outcomes in a rule-governed way.

borderline_personality_disorder	objectivea parental diagnosis of borderline personality disorder has been associated with high levels of parenting distress and greater risk of psychopathology and psychosocial issues among their children. the aim of the present study was to investigate the experience of parents who have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and their perceptions regarding access to appropriate parenting supports and resources. methodseleven mothers and one father with a past and/or present diagnosis of borderline personality disorder participated in focus groups in which they were asked questions about their experiences of parenting and service provision. participants were aged between 29 and 59 years (m = 40.17; standard deviation = 9.53), and the majority identified themselves as caucasian (83%). the study design was qualitative, and thematic analysis was utilised to identify common themes. resultsthematic analysis identified four key themes of parenting challenges, parenting rewards, barriers to accessing support, and recommendations for improving parenting experience. seventeen subthemes were also identified and are represented graphically. conclusionsparents with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder find parenting both a challenging and rewarding experience. while a number of themes identified by parents with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder are similar to those reported by parents with other forms of severe mental illness (i.e., rewards, stigma, fear of custody loss, and negative service provision experiences), there was also evidence of specific themes relating to the symptoms of borderline personality disorder and parenting. recommendations are provided for improving services for these parents.
person_perception	this research examined how and why group membership diminishes the attribution of mind to individuals. we found that mind attribution was inversely related to the size of the group to which an individual belonged (experiment 1). mind attribution was affected by group membership rather than the total number of entities perceived at once (experiment 2). moreover, mind attribution to an individual varied with the perception that the individual was a group member. participants attributed more mind to an individual that appeared distinct or distant from other group members than to an individual that was perceived to be similar or proximal to a cohesive group (experiments 3 and 4). this effect occurred for both human and nonhuman targets, and was driven by the perception of the target as an entitative group member rather than by the knowledge that the target was an entitative group member (experiment 5).

social_cognition	social bonds are at the center of our daily living and are an essential determinant of our quality of life. in people with epilepsy, numerous factors can impede cognitive and affective functions necessary for smooth social interactions. psychological and psychiatric complications are common in epilepsy and may hinder the processing of social information. in addition, neuropsychological deficits such as slowed processing speed, memory loss or attentional difficulties may interfere with enjoyable reciprocity of social interactions. we consider societal, psychological, and neuropsychological aspects of social life with particular emphasis on socio-cognitive functions in temporal lobe epilepsy. deficits in emotion recognition and theory of mind, two main aspects of social cognition, are frequently observed in individuals with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. results from behavioural studies targeting these functions will be presented with a focus on their relevance for patients' daily life. furthermore, we will broach the issue of pitfalls in current diagnostic tools and potential directions for future research. by giving a broad overview of individual and interpersonal determinants of social functioning in epilepsy, we hope to provide a basis for future research to establish social cognition as a key component in the comprehensive assessment and care of those with epilepsy.

borderline_personality_disorder	although theories of narcissism describe the experience of emptiness as a possible mechanism for addictive behaviors such as compulsive buying, this link has n't been examined empirically. this study investigated the relationships between narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability, emptiness, materialism, and compulsive buying among adults. participants included 204 israeli adults (97 males; mage = 45.86) who completed a battery of self-reported questionnaires. our results show that narcissistic grandiosity, narcissistic vulnerability, materialism and emptiness were negatively related to compulsive buying. furthermore, while emptiness mediated the relationships between narcissistic vulnerability and compulsive buying, materialism mediated the relationships between narcissistic grandiosity and compulsive buying. these findings highlight the differential associations between the two facets of pathological narcissism and compulsive buying, and lend empirical support to the importance of the emptiness experience for compensatory behaviors such as compulsive buying by the vulnerable narcissist.
media_violence	in alleging that bushman et al. (2013) made sensational and unsubstantiated claims, markey et al. (2015) mistake hypotheses for hyperbole. moreover, in their effort to show that gun violence in pg-13 movies (for ages 13 and older) is unrelated to trends in population violence, they make unjustified demands on our data, with outcomes that are unconnected to hypothesized effects. using outcomes in line with our hypotheses, we draw the contrary conclusion that recent trends in gun violence in youth are actually consistent with gun violence trends in pg-13 movies. nevertheless, because we do not believe those patterns are sufficient to draw causal conclusions, we suggest more adequate tests of the hypothesis that exposure to movie gun violence affects the beliefs and attitudes of youth toward guns.
problem-solving	this study examined the direct and indirect pathways from maternal effortful control to 2 aspects of children 's self-regulation-executive functioning and behavioral regulation-via maternal emotional support. two hundred seventy-eight children and their primary caregivers (96% mothers) participated in laboratory visits when children were 4 and 5 years, and teachers reported on children 's behavior at kindergarten. at the 4-year assessment, maternal effortful control was measured using the adult temperament questionnaire (evans & rothbart, 2007) and maternal emotional support was observed during a semistructured mother-child problem-solving task. at the 5-year assessment, children 's executive functioning was measured using laboratory tasks designed to assess updating/working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, whereas behavioral regulation was assessed via teacher-report questionnaires on children 's attention control, discipline and persistence, and work habits. results from structural equation modeling indicated that, after controlling for child gender and minority status, and maternal education, maternal effortful control was indirectly associated with both child executive functioning and behavioral regulation through maternal emotional support. maternal effortful control had a direct association with children 's teacher-reported behavioral regulation but not observed executive functioning. these findings suggest that maternal effortful control may be a key contributing factor to the development of children 's self-regulatory competencies through its impact on maternal emotional support.
problem-solving	we investigated problem solving abilities of capuchin monkeys via the ""floating object problem,"" a task in which the subject must use creative problem solving to retrieve a favored food item from the bottom of a clear tube. some great apes have solved this problem by adding water to raise the object to a level at which it can be easily grabbed. we presented seven capuchins with the task over eight trials (four ""dry"" and four ""wet""). none of the subjects solved the task, indicating that no capuchin demonstrated insightful problem solving under these experimental conditions. we then investigated whether capuchins would emulate a solution to the task. seven subjects observed a human model solve the problem by pouring water from a cup into the tube, which brought the object to the top of the tube, allowing the subject to retrieve it. subjects were then allowed to interact freely with an unfilled tube containing the object in the presence of water and objects that could be used to solve the task. while most subjects were unable to solve the task after viewing a demonstrator solve it, one subject did so, but in a unique way. our results are consistent with some previous results in great ape species and indicate that capuchins do not spontaneously solve the floating object problem via insight.
social_cognition	a significant correlation exists between violence and schizophrenia (scz). recent studies matched sonic cognitive deficits like strong risk factors for violence with interesting applications in terms of treatment. our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of cognitive remediation (cr) and social cognitive training (sct) in the management of violent and aggressive behaviors in scz. methods: the electronic databases pubmed, web of science, cochrane library and sciencedirect were searched in, using combinations of terms relating to scz, cr and violence. studies were selected and data were extracted using a prisma statement. inclusion criteria were adults with scz and a documented collection of disruptive and violent behaviors, for whom researchers had used a cr or sct program. results: eleven studies were identified, two related to non-specific cr intervention and nine to codified cr or sct programs. results showed that these programs had a positive impact on the control and reduction of global aggressive attitudes and physical assaults. therapeutic targets were social cognition and executive functions through the improvement of interpersonal relationships and impulsivity feature respectively. effectiveness was proved at various stages of the illness, in different types of patients and units, with effects persisting for up to 12 months after interruption of cr. conclusions are limited by some methodological restrictions. conclusion: although current evidences need to be completed with further randomized studies, cr and sci. appear to be promising approaches in the management of violence in scz.
social_cognition	although frontal presentations of alzheimer 's disease (fv-ad) have already been described in the literature, we still know little about patients' social cognitive abilities, especially their theory of mind (tom). we report the case of ft, a 61-year-old woman who was diagnosed with fv-ad. two assessments of social cognition, using a false-belief task, the reading the mind in the eyes test, and a task probing knowledge of social norms, were performed one year apart. ft exhibited cognitive tom and social knowledge deficits from the onset. affective tom was initially preserved, but deteriorated as the disease progressed.
child_abuse	the study examined whether the diagnostic classification of mental health and developmental disorders of infancy and early childhood, revised edition (dc: 0-3r; zero to three, 2005) parent-infant relationship global assessment scale (pir-gas) is applicable to six european countries and contributes to the identification of caregiver-infant/toddler dyads with abusive relationship patterns. the sample consisted of 115 dyads with children 's ages ranging from 1 to 47 months. sixty-four dyads were recruited from community settings without known violence problems, and 51 dyads were recruited from clinical settings and already had been identified with violence problems or as being at risk for violence problems. to classify the dyads on the pir-gas categories, caregiver-child interactions were video-recorded and coded with observational scales appropriate for child age. to test whether the pir-gas allows for reliable identification of dyads with abusive relationship patterns, pir-gas ratings were compared with scores on the the international society for the prevention of child abuse and neglect 's (ispcan) child abuse screening tool-parental version (icast-p; d.k. runyan etal., ), a questionnaire measuring abusive parental disciplinary practices. it was found that pir-gas ratings differentiated between the general and the clinical sample, and the dyads with abusive patterns of relationship were identified by both the pir-gas and the icast-p. interrater reliability for the pir-gas ranged from moderate to excellent. the value of a broader use of tools such as the dc: 0-3r to promote early identification of families at risk for infant and toddler abuse and neglect is discussed.
borderline_personality_disorder	the suicidal behavior is regarded as the act by which a person seeks to take his life, being aware of the consequences of his action. in our review, besides describing the main introductory aspects for the concept of suicide, we focus our attention on the main neurophysiological and genetical mechanisms relevant for this extremely difficult to manage and controversial behavior. moreover, considering the latest interests in the current literature on the relevance of central oxytocin to various superior cognitive behaviors, we will also make a short description on how important effects of oxytocin could be in the context of suicidal behavior.
media_violence	objective. violent media exposure has been associated with aggressive behavior, and it has been suggested that child health professionals counsel families on limiting exposure. effective violence prevention counseling requires an understanding of norms regarding parental attitudes, practices, and influencing factors. both theories of reasoned action and planned behavior emphasize that subjective norms and attitudes affect people 's perceptions and intended behavior. few data exist on violent television viewing and monitoring from a cross-section of families. by understanding the spectrum of parental attitudes, community-sensitive interventions for violence prevention can be developed. the objective of this study was to assess attitudes about and monitoring of violent television viewing from the perspective of parents. methods. an anonymous self-report assisted survey was administered to a convenience sample of parents/guardians who visited child health providers at 3 sites: an urban children 's hospital clinic, an urban managed care clinic, and a suburban private practice. the parent questionnaire included questions on child-rearing attitudes and practices and sociodemographic information. results. a total of 1004 adults who accompanied children for health visits were recruited for the study; 922 surveys were completed (participation rate: 92%). a total of 830 (90%) respondents were parents and had complete child data. of the 830 respondents, 677 had questions on television viewing included in the survey and were the focus of this analysis. seventy-five percent of families reported that their youngest child watched television. of these, 53% reported always limiting violent television viewing, although 73% believed that their children viewed television violence at least 1 time a week. among television viewers, 81% reported usually or always limiting viewing of sexual content on television and 45% reported usually or always watching television with their youngest child. among children who watched television, parents reported that they spent an average of 2.6 hours per day watching television. limitation of television violence was associated with female parents and younger children. conclusions. there was variability in attitudes and practices regarding television violence viewing and monitoring among parents. attitudes and practices varied on the basis of the age of the child and the gender of the parent.
person_perception	the human body plays a central role in nonverbal communication, conveying attitudes, personality, and values during social interactions. three experiments in a large, open classroom setting investigated whether the visibility of torso-located cues affects nonverbal communication of similarity. in experiments 1 and 2, half the participants wore a black plastic bag over their torso. participants interacted with an unacquainted same-sex individual selected from a large class who was also wearing (or also not wearing) a bag. experiment 3 added a clear bag condition, in which visual torso cues were not obscured. across experiments, black bag-wearing participants selected partners who were less similar to them on attitudes, behaviors, and personality compared to the bag-less-and clear bag-participants. nonverbal cues in the torso communicate information about similarity of attitudes, behavior, and personality; the center of the body plays a surprisingly central role in early-stage person perception and attraction.
social_cognition	objective: bipolar disorder (bd) is highly heritable. neuroimaging studies comparing unaffected youth at high familial risk for bd (i.e., those with a first-degree relative with the disorder; termed ""high-risk"" [hr]) to ""low-risk"" (lr) youth (i.e., those without a first-degree relative with bd) and to patients with bd may help identify potential brain-based markers associated with risk (i.e., regions where br+bd not equal lr), resilience (hr not equal bd+lr), or illness (bd not equal hr+lr). method: during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), 99 youths (i.e., adolescents and young adults) aged 9.8 to 24.8 years (36 bd, 22 hr, 41 lr) performed a task probing face emotion labeling, previously shown to be impaired behaviorally in youth with bd and hr youth. results: we found three patterns of results. candidate risk endophenotypes (i.e., where bd and hr shared deficits) included dysfunction in higher-order face processing regions (e.g., middle temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). candidate resilience markers and disorder sequelae (where hr and bd, respectively, show unique alterations relative to the other two groups) included different patterns of neural responses across other regions mediating face processing (e.g., fusiform), executive function (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus), and social cognition (e.g., default network, superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction). conclusion: if replicated in longitudinal studies and with additional populations, neural patterns suggesting risk endophenotypes could be used to identify individuals at risk for bd who may benefit from prevention measures. moreover, information about risk and resilience markers could be used to develop novel treatments that recruit neural markers of resilience and attenuate neural patterns associated with risk.
person_perception	categorizations of multiracial individuals provide insight into the psychological mechanisms driving social stratification, but few studies have explored the interplay of cognitive and motivational underpinnings of these categorizations. in the present study, we integrated research on racial essentialism (i.e., the belief that race demarcates unobservable and immutable properties) and negativity bias (i.e., the tendency to weigh negative entities more heavily than positive entities) to explain why people might exhibit biases in the categorization of multiracial individuals. as theorized, racial essentialism, both dispositional (study 1) and experimentally induced (study 2), led to the categorization of black-white multiracial individuals as black, but only among individuals evaluating black people more negatively than white people. these findings demonstrate how fundamental cognitive and motivational biases interact to influence the categorization of multiracial individuals.
gender_roles	it is well established that certain categories of objects are processed more efficiently than others in specific tasks; a phenomenon known as category-specificity in perceptual and conceptual processing. in the last two decades there have also been several reports of gender differences in category-specificity. in the present experiments we test the proposition that such gender differences have an evolutionary origin. if they do, we would expect them to emerge even when the population tested comprises young individuals raised in a gender-equality oriented society. contrary to this expectation we find no evidence of gender differences in category-specificity in a relatively large sample (n = 366) drawn from such a population; and this despite the fact that both tasks applied (object decision and superordinate categorization) gave rise to reliable category-effects. we suggest that a plausible account of this discrepancy is that previous reports of gender differences may have reflected differences in familiarity originating from socially-based gender roles.

antisocial_personality_disorder	cocaine use can induce transient psychotic symptoms that include suspiciousness, paranoia, hallucinations, and other cocaine-related behaviors. in this commentary, the authors provide an international perspective while reviewing the recent advances in epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors related to cocaine-induced psychosis exhibited by patients with cocaine use disorders. in some settings, the occurrence of cocaine-induced psychosis has been shown to be as high as 86.5%. many risk factors have been linked with cocaine-induced psychosis, including the quantity of cocaine consumed, lifetime amount of cocaine use, onset of cocaine dependence, years of use, routes of administration, other substance use disorder comorbidity, weight, gender, comorbidity with other medical and mental health disorders, genetics, and pharmacological interactions. research has shown that the evaluation of cocaine-induced psychosis in patients with cocaine use is clinically relevant, especially in those patients who consume high amounts of cocaine, have a cannabis dependence history, have antisocial personality disorder, use administration routes other than intranasal, or exhibit attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) comorbidity. currently, the literature lacks information regarding the evolution of cocaine dependence or cocaine-dependent patients' risk for developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. furthermore, clinicians still do not have an evidence-based pharmacological approach to management of cocaine dependence available to them. additional research is also needed regarding risk factors such as neurobiological markers and personality traits. finally, we recommend the development of an integrative model including all of the risk factors and protective factors for cocaine-induced psychosis.
schizophrenia	diurnal temperature range (dtr) and temperature change between neighboring days (tcn) are important meteorological indicators closely associated with global climate change. however, up to date, there have been no studies addressing the impacts of both dtr and tcn on emergency hospital admissions for schizophrenia. we conducted a time-series analysis to assess the relationship between temperature variability and daily schizophrenia onset in hefei, an inland city in southeast china. daily meteorological data and emergency hospital admissions for schizophrenia from 2005 to 2014 in hefei were collected. after stratifying by season of birth, poisson generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag nonlinear model (dlnm) was used to examine the relationship between temperature variability and schizophrenia, adjusting for long-term trend and seasonality, mean temperature, and relative humidity. our analysis revealed that extreme temperature variability may increase the risk for schizophrenia onset among patients born in spring, while no such association was found in patients born in summer and autumn. in patients born in spring, the relative risks of extremely high dtr comparing the 95th and 99th percentiles with the reference (50th, 10 a degrees c) at 3-day lag were 1.078 (95 % confidence interval (ci) 1.025-1.135) and 1.159 (95 % ci 1.050-1.279), respectively. for tcn effects, only comparing 99th percentile with reference (50th, 0.7 a degrees c) was significantly associated with emergency hospital admissions for schizophrenia (relative risk (rr) 1.111, 95 % ci 1.002-1.231). this study suggested that exposure to extreme temperature variability in short-term may trigger later days of schizophrenia onset for patients born in spring, which may have important implications for developing intervention strategies to prevent large temperature variability exposure.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this study aimed to explore the extent of association between the classes and patterns (single vs. multiple) of drug use and the psychiatric disorders among recently incarcerated male drug users to help formulate drug policies for correctional facilities and provide adequate treatment for incarcerated drug users. data were recruited from 414 male first-time incarcerated illicit drug users in one detention center in taiwan. their lifetime historical profiles of illicit drug use were then assessed and their associations with current psychiatric disorders were compared with 257 community controls. heroin and meth/amphetamine were the most commonly used drugs among single and combined users. heroin users were more likely to exhibit major depression and social phobia; meth/amphetamine users showed more psychotic disorder and antisocial personality disorder than community controls. multiple drug users were associated with two-thirds of the psychiatric disorders. this study suggests that heroin and meth/amphetamine users require specific treatments, which may effectively address associated psychopathologic conditions. interventions for mental disorders for some detainees are also recommended.
attention	an experimental study was conducted to investigate the influence of frp confinement on the buckling behavior of longitudinal steel reinforcing bars (rebars) in rc columns subjected to monotonic and cyclic axial compression. test results of 12 frp-confined rc columns and 12 frp-confined plain concrete columns (control specimens) are presented with particular attention to the evolution of strains in the longitudinal steel rebars and the frp jacket as the load increases. for an frp-confined rc column subjected to monotonic axial compression, the contribution of longitudinal steel rebars to the overall axial load carried by the column was deduced by subtracting the contribution of the frp-confined plain concrete from the total axial load. the test results showed that the compressive stress-strain response of longitudinal steel rebars in frp-confined rc columns follows that from tensile testing before the axial stress reduces gradually due to the onset of buckling deformation. significant interactions were found to exist between frp confinement and the buckling of longitudinal steel rebars. this interaction should be carefully considered when formulating constitutive laws for both the longitudinal steel rebars and the frp-confined concrete for use in theoretical modeling.

person_perception	it may be important to know when our impressions of someone differ from how that person sees him/herself and how others see that same person. we investigated whether people are aware of how their friends see themselves (knowledge of identity) and are seen by others (knowledge of reputation). previous research indicates that, for physical attractiveness, romantic partners do have such knowledge of others' perceptions, but it is unknown whether people in platonic relationships also detect such discrepancies between their own perceptions and others'. we examined this phenomenon for a new set of characteristics: the big five personality traits. our primary research questions pertained to identity accuracy and reputation accuracy (i. e., knowledge of a target 's self-views and how others view the target, respectively) and identity insight and reputation insight (i. e., identity accuracy and reputation accuracy that cannot be accounted for by a potential artifact: perceivers assuming that others share their own views of targets). however, after a series of preliminary tests, we did not examine reputation insight, as several necessary conditions were not met, indicating that any effects would likely be spurious. we did find that perceivers can accurately infer a target 's identity and reputation on global personality traits (identity and reputation accuracy), and that perceivers can sometimes accurately distinguish between their own perceptions of targets and targets' self-views, but not others' views of targets (i. e., identity, but not reputation, insight). finally, we explored boundary conditions for knowledge of others' perceptions and whether knowledge of identity is correlated with knowledge of reputation.
attention	anatase (a) tio2 is widely used as a support of the supported vanadium-based and non-vanadium-based catalysts for nh3-scr reaction. however, there is lack of enough attention for brookite (b) and rutile (r) tio2. therefore, in the present work, we synthesize a series of tio2-a, tio2-b, and tio2-r, and then used as supports to prepare ceo2/tio2-a, ceo2/tio2-b, and ceo2/tio2-r catalysts with the purpose of clarifying the crystal form effect of tio2 supports on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of these supported ceria-based catalysts for nh3-scr reaction. characterization results exhibit that h-2 consumption (responding to reduction property), acid amounts, surface ce3+ content, surface adsorbed oxygen species, and catalytic performance of these supported ceria-based catalysts give the order of ceo2/tio2-r>ceo2/tio2-b >ceo2/tio2-a, which is related to the interaction (i.e., ce3+ ti4+ce4+ti3+) between ceo2 and tio2 (anatase, brookite, and rutile). especially, ceo2/1102-r catalyst exhibits the optimal catalytic performance for nh3-scr reaction among these supported ceria-based catalysts owing to the most excellent reduction property as well as the largest amounts of acid sites, surface ce3+ content, and surface adsorbed oxygen species.

person_perception	instructional strategies such as prompts, requests for clarification, and explicit feedback counter social desires of autonomy and appreciation, i.e., they threaten the face of their receiver. we report an online experiment on how readers perceive instructional face threats and what they accept as appropriate. one hundred and twenty-three participants read an online tutor-tutee discourse that systematically varied the tutor 's politeness while containing different types of face threats. face threats were either mitigated politely or expressed without redress. participants rated their perception of the tutor and the tutor 's contribution, and provided alternative formulations of the presented face threats. results showed that it is beneficial for tutors to mitigate instructional face threats. this finding deserves attention as the tutor 's role does, to some extent, legitimate face threats. the discussion examines how formulations influence person perception. practical conclusions are drawn for instructional online settings.
borderline_personality_disorder	objective: to determine the efficacy of psychotherapy interventions for reducing suicidal attempts (sa) and non-suicidal self-injury (nssi). methods: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing psychotherapy interventions and treatment as usual (tau; including also enhanced usual care, psychotropic treatment alone, cognitive remediation, short-term problem-oriented approach, supportive relationship treatment, community treatment by non-behavioral psychotherapy experts, emergency care enhanced by provider education, no treatment) for sa/nssi. rcts were extracted from medline, embase, psycinfo and cochrane library and analyzed using the cochrane collaboration review manager software and comprehensive meta-analysis. results: in the 32 included rcts, 4114 patients were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy (n = 2106) or tau (n = 2008). patients who received psychotherapy were less likely to attempt suicide during the follow-up. the pooled risk difference for sa was 0.08 (95% confidence intervals = 0.04 to -0.11). the absolute risk reduction was 6.59% (psychotherapy: 9.12%; tau: 15.71%), yielding an estimated number needed to treat of 15. sensitivity analyses showed that psychotherapy was effective for sa mainly in adults, outpatients, patients with borderline personality disorder, previously and non-previously suicidal patients (heterogeneous variable that included past history of sa, nssi, deliberate self-harm, imminent suicidal risk or suicidal ideation), long- and short-term therapies, tau only as a control condition, and mentalization-based treatment (mbt). no evidence of efficacy was found for nssi, with the exception of mbt. between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were detected. in the presence of publication bias, the duval and tweedie 's ""trim and fill"" method was applied. conclusion: psychotherapy seems to be effective for sa treatment. however, trials with lower risk of bias, more homogeneous outcome measures and longer follow-up are needed.

leadership	in this review article, the editor of the new routledge volume, leadership-as-practice: research and application, describes the foundation, thematic attributes, and critical uniqueness of leadership-as-practice, comparing it to related collective traditions in leadership and contrasting it to individualistic approaches that emphasize leader psychology. the review highlights the contributions of each chapter writer in weaving a tapestry of an emerging movement seeking to find leadership not in people but within the practices from which it springs.
person_perception	understanding the causes of human behavior is essential for advancing one 's interests and for coordinating social relations. the scientific study of how people arrive at such understandings or explanations has unfolded in four distinguishable epochs in psychology, each characterized by a different metaphor that researchers have used to represent how people think as they attribute causality and blame to other individuals. the first epoch was guided by an intuitive scientist metaphor, which emphasized whether observers perceived behavior to be caused by the unique tendencies of the actor or by common reactions to the requirements of the situation. this metaphor was displaced in the second epoch by an intuitive lawyer depiction that focused on the need to hold people responsible for their misdeeds. the third epoch was dominated by theories of counterfactual thinking, which conveyed a person as reconstructor approach that emphasized the antecedents and consequences of imagining alternatives to events, especially harmful ones. with the current upsurge in moral psychology, the fourth epoch emphasizes the moral-evaluative aspect of causal judgment, reflected in a person as moralist metaphor. by tracing the progression from the person-environment distinction in early attribution theories to present concerns with moral judgment, our goal is to clarify how causal constructs have been used, how they relate to one another, and what unique attributional problems each addresses.
eating_disorders	this paper systematically reviews the literature pertaining to the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfmri) in anorexia nervosa (an), classifying studies on the basis of different analysis approaches. we followed prisma guidelines. fifteen papers were included, investigating a total of 294 participants with current or past an and 285 controls. the studies used seed-based, whole-brain independent component analysis (ica), network-of-interest ica based and graph analysis approaches. the studies showed relatively consistent overlap in results, yet little overlap in their analytical approach and/or a-priori assumptions. functional connectivity alterations were mainly found in the corticolimbic circuitry, involved in cognitive control and visual and homeostatic integration. some overlapping findings were found in brain areas putatively important in an, such as the insula. these results suggest altered functional connectivity in networks/areas linked to the main symptom domains of an, such as impaired cognitive control and body image disturbances. these preliminary evidences suggest that more targeted treatments need to be developed that focus on these two symptom domains. further studies with multi-approach analyses and longitudinal designs are needed to better understand the complexity of an.

prosocial_behavior	social class predicts numerous important life outcomes and social orientations. to date, literature has mainly examined how an individual 's own class shapes interactions with others. but how prosocially do people treat others they perceive as coming from lower, middle, or higher social classes? here, in addition to testing effects of self social class on prosocial behavior, we also investigate how target social class affects prosocialbehavior, operationalized using a social mindfulness paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice to others. we offer three lines of reasoning, predicting that lower class targets either elicit greater prosociality than higher class targets (fairness), that higher class targets elicit greater prosociality (status), or that people are most prosocial to targets from their own social class (similarity). across four studies, we find that participants behave less prosocially (i.e., are less socially mindful) toward higher class targets relative to lower and/or middle class targets. perceptions of similarity, warmth, and competence did not mediate lower prosociality for higher relative to lower class targets. together, results are most consistent with a fairness perspective. across all studies, we also found that self social class had little to no relationship with prosociality. in total, results suggest that social class is relevant for prosocial behavior, but that target social class matters more than self social class.

depression	chronic breathlessness is a common source of psychological and physical stress in patients with advanced or progressive disease, suggesting that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis dysregulation may be prevalent. the aim of this study was to measure the salivary diurnal cortisol profile in patients receiving supportive and palliative care for a range of malignant and non-malignant conditions and to compare the profile of those experiencing moderate-to-severe disability due to breathlessness against that of patients with mild/no breathlessness and that of healthy controls. saliva samples were collected over two consecutive weekdays at 3, 6, and 12 h after awakening in 49 patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness [medical research council (mrc) dyspnoea grade >= 3], 11 patients with mild/no breathlessness (mrc dyspnoea grade <= 2), and 50 healthy controls. measures of breathlessness, stress, anxiety, depression, wellbeing and sleep were examined concomitantly. the diurnal cortisol slope (dcs) was calculated for each participant by regressing log-transformed cortisol values against collection time. mean dcs was compared across groups using ancova. individual slopes were categorised into one of four categories: consistent declining, consistent flat, consistent ascending and inconsistent. controlling for age, gender and socioeconomic status, the mean dcs was significantly flatter in patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness compared to patients with mild/no breathlessness and healthy controls [f (2,103) = 45.64, p<0.001]. furthermore, there was a higher prevalence of flat and ascending cortisol profiles in patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness (23.4%) compared to healthy controls (0%). the only variable which correlated significantly with dcs was mrc dyspnoea grade (rs=0.29, p<0.05). these findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe breathlessness have evidence of hpa axis dysregulation and that this dysregulation may be related to the functional disability imposed by breathlessness.

depression	objective: to ascertain efficacy and tolerability of carbamazepine (cbz), sodium valproate (vpa), lamotrigine (ltg) and levetiracetam (lev) using the ukaed register (www.ukaed.info). methods: patients on cbz (n=91), vpa (n=61), ltg (n=105), lev (n=72) and healthy control subjects (ctr) on no medication (n=51) were extracted. all patients had anonymously provided information on seizure type and frequency and completed the liverpool adverse event profile (laep). results: the number of seizure-free patients in the last 4 weeks was overall cbz/vpa /ltg/lev=60%/79%/67%/67%, for generalized epilepsy was cbz/vpa/ltg/lev=67%/89%/65%/94%, and for localization-related epilepsy was cbz/vpa/ltg/lev=59%/71%/67%/57%. mean laep scores were cbz/vpa/ltg/lev/ctr=42.21/39.66/39.86/43.01/29.69. the mean laep was significantly higher in patients reporting depression and in patients with active epilepsy than in patients without depression and remission. central nervous system (cns) adverse effects including memory problems, difficulty concentrating, depression, unsteadiness, restlessness, feelings of anger, shaky hands and dizziness were significantly more frequent in cbz, vpa, ltg and lev than in ctr. the feeling of anger was significantly more frequent in lev, and depression was significantly more frequent in cbz compared to the other drugs. conclusion: in this internet-based register of self-reported efficacy and tolerability, cbz, vpa, ltg and lev were similar. self-reported cns adverse effects were significantly more frequent than in controls. in addition, anger was associated with lev and depression with cbz. confounding factors were depression and uncontrolled epilepsy.
prenatal_development	the palatine rugae are specialized structures located on the fused hard palate; however, the number, arrangement and direction of the palatine rugae differ among species. since crocodilians were evolutionally the first animals to show fusion of the palate, the authors focused on the structure of the crocodilian palate. the surface structure of the palate in alligator mississippiensis at postnatal 60 days was examined by stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. in addition, histological observation was made by hematoxylin-eosin and azan staining. moreover, the urea silver nitrate method was used for nerve staining. on the palate of alligator mississippiensis, many papilla-like, small conic-shaped projections of about 450-800 mu m in width and about 500 mu m in height were observed, although there were no palatine rugae. these projections were distributed over the whole palate, and there was no difference in density by region (anterior, middle, and posterior portion of the hard palate). these projections consisted of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and connective tissue. in particular, many collagen fibers were observed in connective tissue. the bundles of nerve fibers ran from the connective tissue toward the oral epithelium. collagen fibers were sparse in the area with the fascicle of nerve fibers under the epithelium of these projections. it is generally known that many nerve fibers and nerve endings are located in the connective tissue of the palatine rugae. since there are many nerve fibers in the connective tissue of these projections, it is suggested that these projections may act as sensitive organs such as the palatine rugae.
person_perception	background and objectives: socially anxious individuals elicit less positive reactions from interlocutors than non-anxious individuals, but evidence for a distinctive social anxiety linked behaviour deficit to explain this finding has been sparse. we investigated whether socially anxious individuals engage less in joint action - a process which promotes rapport and usually arises spontaneously between conversation partners when they actively attend to the conversation. methods: in study 1, participants with high fear of negative evaluation, and low fear of negative evaluation conversed with a peer. study 2 simulated the cognitive impact of anxiety-linked threat focus in non-anxious participants via a partial distraction task and measured the social consequences. results: in study 1, listeners with high fear of negative evaluation made fewer collaborative contributions to a partner 's anecdote (an index of joint action). in study 2, non-anxious distracted listeners showed the same behavioural pattern (fewer collaborative responses) and were less well-liked by their conversation partners, compared to non-distracted listeners. limitations: we coded for only one marker of joint action. future research should identify further indices of connectedness between partners. in addition, both studies were conducted with small groups of university students, and future research should be conducted on larger samples selected on the basis of social anxiety, not fear of negative evaluation alone. conclusions: together, these findings indicate that socially anxious individuals engage less in the shared task of conversation, and this behaviour attracts less positive responses from conversation partners.

gender_roles	today, it is not uncommon to meet someone and begin a romantic relationship online. meeting on a dating website differs from meeting in person because a dating profile is created first that allows others to review potential romantic partners. few studies have examined romantic attraction within an online dating context, and even fewer have examined how gender roles may influence attraction. the current study(1) (n = 447, 49.4% female) examined the effects of gender role congruence and physical attractiveness on romantic interest in college students. participants viewed online dating profiles that varied in their physical attractiveness and adherence to gender role norms. results indicated that both men and women preferred attractive and gender role incongruent dating partners over average looking and gender role congruent. contrary to previous research, women differentiated more between profiles based on physical attractiveness than the men, especially for gender role congruent profiles. men were especially interested in attractive, gender role incongruent profiles. after physical attractiveness, gender role incongruence was the greatest factor that determined interest in a profile. future research may need to consider how the potential seriousness of a relationship, as defined by the expected length of the relationship, influences how online profile characteristics affect attraction and interest.

antisocial_personality_disorder	the genesis of the psychopath has long been debated, typically within the framework of the long-held nature versus nature argument. are psychopaths born psychopathic or are they molded by society? like all personality disorders, the development of the psychopathic brain is dynamic, and as the psychopath remains a consistent, albeit small, part of the population, one has to wonder why psychopathy continues to reappear in generation after generation. i explore the characteristics of psychopathic behavior, current theories on the adaptive qualities of this behavior, and psychopathy as it manifests in women. i argue that psychopathic behavior is not itself selecting for psychopathy. psychopathy is a mental disorder that increases the likelihood of a set of behaviors, but these behaviors are not unique to the psychopath, and so will not favor the continued presence of psychopaths in the population. i also discuss the biological characteristics of the male brain that may make it more susceptible to psychopathy than the female brain.

schizophrenia	dna methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. egr3 is considered as a potential candidate gerie for schizophrenia. we conducted in vitro dna methylation reaction, lucia luciferase activity assay, and pyrosequencing assay to assess the dna methylation of the egr3 expression underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. we found that dna methylation of the putative egr3 regulatory regions attenuated lucia luciferase activity. there was no difference in the dna methylation pattern of egr3 between in 50 schizophrenic patients and 47 controls. our data suggest that dna methylation regulated the expression of egr3 might not be associated with schizophrenia.
false_memories	we examined the neural activity associated with true and false recognition during both encoding and retrieval using the remember/know procedure to separate recollection (i.e., mental reinstatement of experienced events during which unique details of a memory are recalled) and familiarity (i.e., mental awareness that an event has been experienced previously without the unique details of the event) in recognition memory. neuroimaging data at retrieval revealed that the right parahippocampal gyrus was activated during recollection-based true recognition compared with familiarity-based true recognition, indicating the item-specific retrieval of visual details. this effect in the right parahippocampal gyrus was not observed for false recognition. contrary to our expectation, the reactivation effect in early visual cortex was not observed during true recognition, as opposed to false recognition. neuroimaging data at encoding revealed that the right visual cortex (the right occipitotemporal sulcus) was activated during the encoding of items that yielded recollection-based true recognition compared with familiarity-based true recognition, indicating item-specific visual processing. this effect in the right visual cortex was not observed for false recognition. these results suggest that the subjective feeling of remember/know with respect to both veridical and false memories varies with the neural activity during both encoding and retrieval.

prejudice	using a mixed methods approach, the researcher gathered a set of narrative responses from focus groups that supported the claim of underreporting campus discrimination on a survey. multiple studies have shown that underrepresented minority students are likely to bond with same-ethnic peers in a racially tense campus climate. this mixed method is a follow-up investigation into, why, in a post-9/11 environment, arab and muslim american community college students demonstrated less variation in the level of perceived discrimination in relationship to the percentage of same-ethnic and/or same-faith campus friendship groups. post hoc comparisons revealed that arab and muslim students exhibited significantly higher mean scores on a perceived discrimination scale than other ethnic groups.
person_perception	backgroundtwo important influences on students' evaluations of teaching are relationship and professor effects. relationship effects reflect unique matches between students and professors such that some professors are unusually effective for some students, but not for others. professor effects reflect inter-rater agreement that some professors are more effective than others, on average across students. aimswe attempted to forecast students' evaluations of live lectures from brief, video-recorded teaching trailers. sampleparticipants were 145 college students (74% female) enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a public university in the great lakes region of the united states. methodsstudents viewed trailers early in the semester and attended live lectures months later. because subgroups of students viewed the same professors, statistical analyses could isolate professor and relationship effects. resultsevaluations were influenced strongly by relationship and professor effects, and students' evaluations of live lectures could be forecasted from students' evaluations of teaching trailers. that is, we could forecast the individual students who would respond unusually well to a specific professor (relationship effects). we could also forecast which professors elicited better evaluations in live lectures, on average across students (professor effects). professors who elicited unusually good evaluations in some students also elicited better memory for lectures in those students. conclusionsit appears possible to forecast relationship and professor effects on teaching evaluations by presenting brief teaching trailers to students. thus, it might be possible to develop online recommender systems to help match students and professors so that unusually effective teaching emerges.
social_cognition	inferring the intentions and beliefs of another is an ability that is fundamental for social and affiliative interactions. a substantial amount of empirical evidence suggests that making sense of another 's intentional and belief states (i.e. theory of mind) relies on exteroceptive (e.g. visual and auditory) and proprioceptive (i.e. motor) signals. yet, despite its pivotal role in the guidance of behaviour, the role of the observer 's interoceptive (visceral) processing in understanding another 's internal states remains unexplored. predicting and keeping track of interoceptive bodily states - which inform intentions and beliefs that guide behaviour - is one of the fundamental purposes of the human brain. in this paper, we will focus on the role of interoceptive predictions, prescribed by the free energy principle, in making sense of internal states that cause another 's behaviour. we will discuss how multimodal expectations induced at deep (high) hierarchical levels - that necessarily entail interoceptive predictions - contribute to inference about others that is at the heart of theory of mind.

false_memories	distinctive encoding is greatly influenced by gist-based processes and has been shown to suffer when highly similar items are presented in close succession. thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying how presentation format affects gist processing is essential in determining the factors that influence these encoding processes. the current study utilised multivariate partial least squares (pls) analysis to identify encoding networks directly associated with retrieval performance in a blocked and intermixed presentation condition. subsequent memory analysis for successfully encoded items indicated no significant differences between reaction time and retrieval performance and presentation format. despite no significant behavioural differences, behaviour pls revealed differences in brain-behaviour correlations and mean condition activity in brain regions associated with gist-based vs. distinctive encoding. specifically, the intermixed format encouraged more distinctive encoding, showing increased activation of regions associated with strategy use and visual processing (e.g., frontal and visual cortices, respectively). alternatively, the blocked format exhibited increased gist-based processes, accompanied by increased activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. together, results suggest that the sequence that information is presented during encoding affects the degree to which distinctive encoding is engaged. these findings extend our understanding of the fuzzy trace theory and the role of presentation format on encoding processes.
problem-solving	recent economic events have sparked debates over the degree of structural mismatch in the u.s. economy. one of the most frequent claims is that workers lack the skills that employers demand. the existing literature, however, analyzes this potential mismatch at a high level of aggregation with abstract indices and noisy proxies that obscure the underlying mechanisms. the authors address these issues by presenting and analyzing results from a survey of u.s. manufacturing establishments. the survey is the first, to their knowledge, to directly measure concrete employer skill demands and hiring experiences in a nationally representative survey at the industry level. the findings indicate that demand for higher-level skills is generally modest, and that three-quarters of manufacturing establishments do not show signs of hiring difficulties. among the remainder, demands for higher-level math and reading skills are significant predictors of long-term vacancies, but demands for computer skills and other critical-thinking/problem-solving skills are not. of particular interest, high-tech plants do not experience greater levels of hiring challenges. when the authors examine the potential mechanisms that could contribute to hiring difficulties, they find that neither external regional supply conditions nor internal firm practices are predictive of hiring problems. rather, the data show that establishments that are members of clusters or that demand highly specialized skills have the greatest probability of incurring long-term vacancies. the authors interpret these results as a sign that it is important to think about factors that complicate the interaction of supply and demandsuch as disaggregation and communication/coordination failuresrather than simply focusing on inadequate labor supply.
prenatal_development	persistent deficits in social behavior are among the major negative consequences associated with exposure to ethanol during prenatal development. prior work from our laboratory has linked deficits in social behavior following moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (pae) in the rat to functional alterations in the ventrolateral frontal cortex [21]. in addition to social behaviors, the regions comprising the ventrolateral frontal cortex are critical for diverse processes ranging from orofacial motor movements to flexible alteration of behavior in the face of changing consequences. the broader behavioral implications of altered ventrolateral frontal cortex function following moderate pae have, however, not been examined. in the present study we evaluated the consequences of moderate pae on social behavior, tongue protrusion, and flexibility in a variant of the morris water task that required modification of a well-established spatial response. pae rats displayed deficits in tongue protrusion, reduced flexibility in the spatial domain, increased wrestling, and decreased investigation, indicating that several behaviors associated with ventrolateral frontal cortex function are impaired following moderate pae. a linear discriminant analysis revealed that measures of wrestling and tongue protrusion provided the best discrimination of pae rats from saccharin-exposed control rats. we also evaluated all behaviors in young adult (4-5 months) or older (10-11 months) rats to address the persistence of behavioral deficits in adulthood and possible interactions between early ethanol exposure and advancing age. behavioral deficits in each domain persisted well into adulthood (10-11 months), however, there was no evidence that aging enhances the effects of moderate pae within the age ranges that were studied.

prenatal_development	rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. to verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. to produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0 gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. from the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (e13s, e15s, e17s and e19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. e17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. on the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in e13s and e15s. periventricular nodular heterotopias (pnhs) were observed exclusively in e15s and e17s. generally, the size of pnhs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. e13s and e19s had brains devoid pnhs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in e15s. it can therefore be concluded that pnhs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of pnhs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself.

attention	our planet is gradually moving towards an urbanized world. modern urban agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. the currently popular notion of 'smart cities' aims to provide a new perspective for sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our 'urban century'. in this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. this paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ict) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called 'urban piazza' strategy framework). secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. and finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. the paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of 'big digital data' management in urban systems.

prejudice	the current study explored how individual differences in endorsement of aggressive behaviors and thoughts relate to individual levels of tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants and established prejudice correlates such as social dominance orientation (sdo) and ethnic out-groups ratings among adolescents. participants (n = 141; age m = 16.08, 68% girls) completed the readiness for interpersonal aggression inventory, the tolerance and prejudice questionnaire, and measures of sdo and ethnic out-groups ratings. results indicated that higher individual endorsement of aggression was related to higher prejudice and sdo and lower tolerance and ethnic out-groups ratings. patterns of endorsement of aggression related to habitual and socially determined aggressive acts or stable needs to hurt others as a source of satisfaction were significantly correlated with prejudice. conversely, the relationship between prejudice and endorsement of impulsive actions lacking of emotional control resulted was less marked. the results highlight how in the cognitive spectrum of prejudice, individual levels of endorsement of aggression may play a significant triggering role during adolescence. these findings may have implications for future studies and interventions aimed at reducing prejudice already in young ages.
prosocial_behavior	violent video game (vvg) use has repeatedly been found to be associated with hostile expectations about others, desensitization to violence, decreased empathy and prosocial behavior, and aggressive thoughts and behaviors. although these research findings have been widely publicized, vvgs remain the most extensively played games and represent a multi-billion dollar industry. although vvgs are typically rated mature, indicating they are not suitable for youths, they are often purchased for youths. this may be in part because there is currently no system available to consumers that thoroughly describes the content of video games, and much of the public is unaware of the types of violence that characterize game play. the purpose of this paper is to describe the violent content of some of the top vvgs, based on sales. for the purposes of this issue, acts of senseless, unprovoked violence will be described in detail.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: suicidal behavior has been reported to be associated with seasonality and chronotype. however, no study has reported the suicidality according to chronotype and seasonality in patients with major depressive disorder (mod). this study evaluated the relationship of suicidality and biological rhythm in patients with mod. methods: a total of 120 patients with nidd participated. we evaluated their seasonal patterns, chronotypes (morningness, wake up early and are at their best during the first part of the day; eveningness, feel best and most alert during late hours), suicidal ideations, and other clinical variables including symptom severity. results.: patients with seasonality showed significantly higher suicidal ideation than patients without seasonality. compared to morning-type participants, the evening-type participants showed higher suicidality. suicidal ideation was positively correlated with eveningness tendencies and hypomanic personality traits. limitations: first, we did not analyze the causal relationship between biological rhythm and suicidality. secondly, suicidal ideation does not in most cases reflect an actual attempt. lastly, we did not categorize seasonal pattern into summer or winter type. conclusions: our findings suggest that biological rhythm is significantly associated with suicidal ideation in patients with mdd.

child_abuse	child abuse is a global public health problem and a serious social issue in japan. social support is beneficial for parents faced with childrearing challenges. the aim of this study was to clarify the association between social support and child abuse potential. a cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire. the target population was mothers of children at nine public nursery schools. bivariate and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to examine the effects of socio-demographic, social support and psychological distress factors on child abuse potential. among 309 mothers, 29 (9.4%) had a high child abuse potential score. bivariate analysis indicated that mothers with a higher child abuse potential score were more likely to be divorced or unmarried (p < 0.001); living in single-female-parent households (p < 0.001); have low perceived economic status (p < 0.001); have a low level of child care support (p = 0.01); have a low multidimensional scale of perceived social support (mspss) score (p < 0.001); and/or a high general health questionnaire -12 score (ghq -12) (p < 0.001). important predictors of child abuse potential among the mothers surveyed included living in single-female-parent households, having low perceived economic status, low mspss score, and high ghq -12 score. improving approaches that help mothers build social support relationships and ease them into child rearing in a psychologically healthy condition is recommended to prevent child abuse.

depression	objective: to investigate the association between the perception of expressed emotion and psychopathology of school-going adolescents in a non-clinical sample. methods: the cross-sectional field study was conducted in kocaeli, turkey, and comprised high-school students during the 2014-15 school years. data was collected using the information collection form, strengths and difficulties questionnaire and shortened level of expressed emotion scale. spss 21 was used for data analysis. results: of the 487 subjects, 295(60.57%) were girls and 192(39.43%) were boys. the overall median age was 16 (inter-quartile range: 15-17 years). there were significant positive relationships between the scales in terms of emotional problems (p<0.001), behavioural problems (p<0.001), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p<0.001), and peer relationship problems (p<0.001). there was also a negative significant relationship between pro-social behaviours and expressed emotion (p<0.001). conclusion: the concept of perceived expressed emotion in non-clinical adolescents is useful in alarming clinicians and preventing mental disorders.
child_abuse	baby factories are new systematic abuse structures that are promoting infant trafficking, neo-slavery and the exploitation of young women with unwanted pregnancies in nigeria. since this practice was first described in 2006, it has been growing rather than abating. this paper reviews the scientific literature, along with media reports, and critiques this phenomenon from a children 's rights' perspective. children born into baby factories are denied various civil rights. they also suffer abuse in the baby factories and as a consequence of being born in such places. this abuse can be classified into immediate and long term. immediate abuse includes inadequate care and its repercussions, denial of birth registration, illegal adoption and murder. long-term or delayed abuse that they may be exposed to includes health-related consequences, neglect, death, child labour, prostitution and other sexual abuse, organ trafficking and recruitment as child soldiers. various factors are thought to drive the baby factory phenomenon which include poverty, high infertility rates and the profitability of local and inter-country adoptions. programmes directed at addressing the root cause of the problem are needed in order to eliminate infant trafficking. also, clear laws that delineate inter-country adoption and infant trafficking need to be enacted. most importantly, baby factories need to be recognised as child trafficking routes. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
nonverbal_communication	hand gestures are a form of nonverbal communication, which allow a person to communicate a range of thoughts and feelings with or without speech. here mems 3 axis accelerometer to detect the input gestures as x, y, z direction. the axis is to detect the four types of gesture, which includes up, down, left, right. the hand motion of data collected will directly send to the microcontroller to run on a pc with the help of wireless module. thedata will compressed by different users, gesture to extract from sign sequence and template matching. a single gesture has contain an 8 numbers code. this code reduces the hundreds of data values in single gesture and also to compare with the stored templates. in this paper three models has introduced and discussed about its accuracy. the sequence of gesture contain 85 experiments, finally the results achieves an overall accuracy of 96% based on the sign sequence generation and template matching, this each recognitioncontains the ranging from 94% to 100%.
social_cognition	background: bipolar disorder (bd) and schizophrenia (sz) show substantial overlap. it has been suggested that a subgroup of patients might contribute to these overlapping features. this study employed a cross diagnostic cluster analysis to identify subgroups of individuals with shared cognitive phenotypes. method: 143 participants (68 bd patients, 39 sz patients and 36 healthy controls) completed a battery of eeg and performance assessments on perception, nonsocial cognition and social cognition. a k-means cluster analysis was conducted with all participants across diagnostic groups. clinical symptoms, functional capacity, and functional outcome were assessed in patients. results: a two-cluster solution across 3 groups was the most stable. one cluster including 44 bd patients, 31 controls and 5 sz patients showed better cognition (high cluster) than the other cluster with 24 bd patients, 35 sz patients and 5 controls (low cluster). bd patients in the high cluster performed better than bd patients in the low cluster across cognitive domains. within each cluster, participants with different clinical diagnoses showed different profiles across cognitive domains. limitations: all patients are in the chronic phase and out of mood episode at the time of assessment and most of the assessment were behavioral measures. conclusions: this study identified two clusters with shared cognitive phenotype profiles that were not proxies for clinical diagnoses. the finding of better social cognitive performance of bd patients than sz patients in the lowe cluster suggest that relatively preserved social cognition may be important to identify disease process distinct to each disorder.
social_cognition	this paper explores the proposal that there is a close link between counterfactual thinking and lying. both require the imagination of alternatives to reality and we describe four studies which explore this link. in study 1 we measured individual differences in both abilities and found that individuals with a tendency to generate counterfactual thoughts were also more likely to generate potential lies. studies 2 and 3 showed that counterfactual availability influences people 's ability to come up with lies and the extent to which they expect others to lie. study 4 used a behaviotiral measure of deception to show that people tend to lie more in situations also known to elicit counterfactual thoughts. overall, the results show that the imagination of alternatives to the past plays an important role in the generation of lies. we discuss the implications for the fields of counterfactual thinking and deception.

person_perception	reverse correlation (rc) techniques provide a data-driven approach to model internal representations in an unconstrained way. here, we used this approach to model social perception of faces. in the rc task, participants repeatedly selected from two face images-created by superimposing randomly generated noise masks on the same face-the face that looked most trustworthy (or, in other conditions: untrustworthy, dominant, or submissive). we calculated classification images (cis) by averaging all selected images. trait judgments of independent participants, as well as objective metrics, showed that the cis visualized the intended traits well. furthermore, tests of pixel clusters showed that diagnostic information resided mostly in mouth, eye, eyebrow, and hair regions. the current work shows that rc provides an excellent tool to extract psychologically meaningful images that map onto social perception.
schizophrenia	objective: to use expert consensus to inform the development of policy and guidelines for the treatment, management and monitoring of the physical health of people with an enduring psychotic illness. method: the delphi method was used. a systematic search of websites, books and journal articles was conducted to develop a 416-item survey containing strategies that health professionals should use to treat, manage and monitor the physical health of people with an enduring psychotic illness. three panels of australian experts (55 clinicians, 21 carers and 20 consumers) were recruited and independently rated the items over three rounds, with strategies reaching consensus on a priori-defined levels of importance written into the expert consensus statement. results: the participation rate for the clinicians across all three rounds was 65%, with consumers and carers only completing one round due to high endorsement rates. finally, 386 strategies were endorsed as essential or important by one or all panels. the endorsed strategies provided information on engagement and collaborative partnerships; clinical governance; risk factors, morbidity and mortality in people with enduring psychotic illness; assessment, including initial and follow-up assessments; barriers to care; strategies to improve care of people with enduring psychotic illness; education and training; treatment recommendations; medication side effects; and the role of health professionals. conclusion: the consensus statement is intended to be used by health professionals, people with an enduring psychotic illness and their families and carers. the next step needed is an implementation strategy by the royal australian and new zealand college of psychiatrists and other stakeholders.
leadership	this work explores how mindful leadership practice can inform school and district leadership specifically as it occurs in professional learning communities (plc). when school and district leaders create plc cultures that encourage rich thinking and intentional practice, individual and organizational mindfulness is present. as leaders work to craft informed responses to the demands before them, it is argued that such mindfulness places them in a position to maximize learning from the experiences of the moment. as an organizational structure, the plc provides school members with a location for the practice of mindful leadership. yet, the plc can become an end in itself, a structure that organizes participants but lacks the necessary goal orientation for actors to engage in motivating and purposeful work and create meaningful outcomes. we assert that the mindful institutionalization of plcs orients the school toward cultural change embodied in a collective attention that orients the work of its members. we argue that to do so requires attention to deeply developed explanations of activities within the school setting, opportunities for formative, substantive data use, and on-the-ground real-time orientation to communal learning. we argue that attention to these themes would further enhance the knowledge and skill set available to plc members.
eating_disorders	background: anorexia nervosa (an) destroys developmentally important early years of many young people and knowledge is insufficient regarding course, treatment outcome and prognosis. only a few naturalistic studies have been conducted within the field of eating disorder (ed) research. in this naturalistic study we included adolescents with an or subthreshold an treated in outpatient care, and the overall aim was to examine sample characteristics and treatment outcome. additional aims were to examine potential factors associated with remission as an outcome variable, and possible differences between three time periods for treatment onset. methods: participants were identified through the swedish national quality register for eating disorder treatment (sweat), in which patients are registered at treatment onset and followed up once a year until end of treatment (eot). inclusion criteria were: medical or self-referral to one of the participating treatment units between 1999 and 2014, 13-19 years of age at initial entry into sweat and diagnosed with an or subthreshold an. the total sample consisted of 3997 patient from 83 different treatment units. results: the results show that 55% of the participants were in remission and approximately 85% were within a healthy weight range at eot. of those who ended treatment according to plan, 70% were in remission and 90% within a healthy weight range. the average treatment duration was approximately 15 months. about one third of the patients terminated treatment prematurely, which was associated with a decreased chance of achieving remission. remission rates and weight recovery increased over time, while treatment duration decreased. considering treatment outcome, the results did not show any differences between patients with an or subthreshold an. conclusions: the present study shows a relatively good prognosis for adolescent patients with an or subthreshold an in routine care and the results indicate that treatment for adolescents with ed in sweden has become more effective over the past 15 years. the results of the present study contribute to the scope of treatment research and the large-scale naturalistic setting secures the generalizability to a clinical environment. however, more research is needed into different forms of evidence, new research strategies and diversity of treatment approaches.
borderline_personality_disorder	the aim of this study was to develop and validate a german adaptation of the dialectical behavior therapy ways of coping checklist (dbt-wccl), a self-report questionnaire that measures the frequency of adaptive and maladaptive skills used to manage difficult situations over the past month. the adaptive skills are derived from dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) but do not include dbt-specific language and can be assessed independent of this treatment. in all, 150 patients with borderline personality disorder completed the german dbt-wccl adaptation and questionnaires assessing symptom severity. a different sample of 40 patients completed the questionnaire at five different time points while undergoing inpatient dbt. the three-factor structure of the english version was replicated and confirmed. psychometric analyses indicated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability for all three subscales. supporting the construct validity of the measure, skills use, as measured with the dbt-wccl, increased significantly during inpatient dbt. in addition, using skills was significantly positively correlated with prior experience with dbt and perceived use of dbt skills. in conclusion, these results offer preliminary support for the validity and reliability of the german adaptation of the dbt-wccl.
antisocial_personality_disorder	trauma in childhood is a psychosocial, medical, and public policy problem with serious consequences for its victims and for society. chronic interpersonal violence in children is common worldwide. developmental traumatology, the systemic investigation of the psychiatric and psychobiological effects of chronic overwhelming stress on the developing child, provides a framework and principles when empirically examining the neurobiological effects of pediatric trauma. this article focuses on peer-reviewed literature on the neurobiological sequelae of childhood trauma in children and in adults with histories of childhood trauma.
person_perception	three experiments are reported which examined the capacity to match a voice with a static image of a face. when using a simultaneous same/different matching task, performance was significantly better than chance (experiments 1 and 2). however, it did not appear to depend either on sex of speaker, sex of listener, stimulus distinctiveness, or self-reported strategies (experiment 2). concerns over floor effects as well as a significant response bias prompted a change of task, and when performance was examined through matching a voice to a face lineup, a more interesting pattern emerged. again, performance was significantly better than chance, but in addition, it was demonstrably affected by the distinctiveness of the speaker 's voice. these results are considered in the context of theoretical discussions regarding face-voice integration, and in the context of more applied considerations regarding multimodal benefits in witness scenarios.
problem-solving	autism spectrum disorder (asd) is characterized by impairments in social communication as well as restricted, repetitive behaviors. evidence suggests that some individuals with asd have cognitive impairments related to weak central coherence and hyperrestricted processing. reducing noradrenergic activity may improve aspects of network processing and thus improve cognitive abilities, such as verbal problem solving, in individuals with asd. the present pilot study explores the effects of acute administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol on verbal problem solving in adults and adolescents with asd. in a within-subject crossover-design, 20 participants with asd received a single dose of propranolol or placebo on one of two sessions in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. verbal problem solving was assessed via an anagram task. baseline measurements of autonomic nervous system functioning were obtained, and anxiety was assessed at baseline and following drug administration. participants solved the anagrams more quickly in the propranolol condition, as compared to the placebo condition, suggesting a potential cognitive benefit of this agent. additionally, we observed a negative linear relationship between response to propranolol on the anagram task and two measures of baseline autonomic activity, as well as a positive linear relationship between drug response and baseline anxiety. these relationships propose potential markers for treatment response, as propranolol influences both autonomic functioning and anxiety. further investigation is needed to expand on the present single-dose psychopharmacological challenge and explore the observed effects of propranolol in a serial-dose setting.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: seasonal affective disorder (sad) is a subtype of recurrent depressive or bipolar disorder that is characterized by regular onset and remission of affective episodes at the same time of the year. the aim of the present study was to provide epidemiological data and data on the socioeconomic impact of sad in the general population of austria. methods: we conducted a computer-assisted telephone interview in 910 randomly selected subjects (577 females and 333 males) using the seasonal health questionnaire (shq), the seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire (spaq), and the sheehan disability scale (sds). telephone numbers were randomly drawn from all austrian telephone books and transformed using the random last digits method. the last birthday method was employed to choose the target person for the interviews. results: out of our subjects, 2.5% fulfilled criteria for the seasonal pattern specifier according to dsm-5 and 2.4% (95% ci = 1.4-3.5%) were diagnosed with sad. when applying the icd-10 criteria 1.9% (95% ci = 0.9-2.8%) fulfilled sad diagnostic criteria. the prevalence of fall-winter depression according to the kasper-rosenthal criteria was determined to be 3.5%. the criteria was fulfilled by 15.1% for subsyndromal sad (s-sad). we did not find any statistically significant gender differences in prevalence rates. when using the dsm-5 as a gold standard for the diagnosis of sad, diagnosis derived from the spaq yielded a sensitivity of 31.8% and a specificity of 97.2%. subjects with sad had significantly higher scores on the sds and higher rates of sick leave and days with reduced productivity than healthy subjects. conclusions: prevalence estimates for sad with the shq are lower than with the spaq. our data are indicative of the substantial burden of disease and the socioeconomic impact of sad. this epidemiological data shows a lack of gender differences in sad prevalence. the higher rates of females in clinical sad samples might, at least in part, be explained by lower help seeking behaviour in males.

eating_disorders	weanling pigs, with an underdeveloped intestine and immature immune system, are usually subjected to depressed feed intake, growth retardation, and postweaning diarrhea. the aim of this study was to determine 1) the growth response of weaned pigs to supplemental tributyrin (tb) and 2) the potential effects and mechanisms of tb in modulating immune responses of lipopolysaccharide (lps)-challenged piglets. a total of 240 piglets (duroc x large white x landrace) were weaned at 21 d of age to a control (basal diet), supplemented with antibiotics (ab; + ab), supplemented with tb (+ tb), or with supplemental ab and tb (+ ab+ tb) diets, with 10 replicate pens (6 piglets/pen) per diet. at 49 d of age, male pigs from the control and + tb groups were intraperitoneally injected with lps (25 mu g/kg bw) or saline (n = 6) and sacrificed at 4 h after injection to collect blood, intestine, and digesta samples for biochemical analysis. there were higher (p < 0.05) feed intake and lower (p < 0.05) percentage of negative growth pig-lets in the + tb groups than in the control group during the first week after weaning. for piglets without lps challenge, there were higher (p < 0.05) ileal fibroblast growth factor 19 (fgf19) mrna abundance and total bile acid concentrations in the + tb groups than in the control group, whereas downregulated (p < 0.05) fgf19 expression was observed in the + tb groups after lps challenge. lipopolysaccharide challenge in the control group increased (p < 0.05) plasma tumor necrosis factor a and il-6 concentrations and colonic escherichia coli amount and decreased (p0.05) observed between + tb groups following lps challenge. taken together, dietary supplementation with tb prevented growth retardation through stimulating the appetite of weaned pigs and protected piglets against lethal infection via modulation of inflammatory cytokines production, ileal fgf19 expression, and intestinal acetate fermentation.
nonverbal_communication	background: down syndrome is a common human genetic disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. individuals with down syndrome can present with a range of health issues during their lives that may require imaging for diagnosis. radiographers, therefore, play a significant role in the management and communication of down syndrome patients' health. purpose: this review identified patient-centered strategies that radiographers should use to provide quality imaging services for down syndrome patients, who may have limited verbal ability and behavioral issues. method: a systematic review using the established prisma guidelines was undertaken of current literature obtained through the ovid and scopus databases. a total of 189 articles were found, of which 41 were categorized and analyzed in detail. findings: a high level of care for down syndrome patients will require longer than usual procedures, and the patients will not respond well to being rushed or ignored. down syndrome patients have difficulty verbalizing, yet they understand more than is often thought. individuals may require increased imaging time to give them time to respond, especially to pain. patients are at risk of injury with aai or other pathologies, and caution should be taken with flexion and extension spine x-rays. radiographs may reveal undisclosed physical abuse. conclusion: specific strategies with verbal and nonverbal communication help to facilitate communication, reduce anxiety and fear, and improve compliance with down syndrome patients. patients may require an increased level of care; increased imaging time; and allowing support people to be present during the examination process.
gender_roles	purpose: research indicates that family therapy courses in gender studies affect both female and male students to the same degree. how female students experience a gender-focused family therapy class has yet to be explored. this qualitative study focused on self-identified cis-female students' experiences in a ten-week course on gender in family therapy. the purpose of this study was to present female students' critical reflections of taking a clinical training course dedicated to gender studies. method: using transcendental phenomenology, we analysed reflections from 86 student-participants regarding how they perceived themselves as gendered and how new information had transformed their thoughts and actions. thematic analysis from the data was inductive, we read and reread the reflections and then generated several main themes. results: participants were challenged to revisit gendered assumptions about significant and insignificant concerns in their development. we organized women 's self-reports into four domains: affect, identity, empowerment, and action. conclusions: in summary, addressing gender-related topics in the classroom had impacted students intra-personally and interpersonally. as they processed internally, they began to reshape their relationships. additionally, they planned to become agents of change in therapy room. practitioner points therapists recognize how gender-related power differences, gender roles in societal and familial systems, and the ways unequal gender relations affect relationships therapists address not only the position of women in their cultures but also how their social environment reproduces this positioning within its own ranks educators ensure that their pedagogies and therapeutic practices constantly reflect gender-aware practices in order to be culturally competent
depression	the problem of direction of arrival (doa) estimation of non-circular (nc) signal for non-uniform linear array is investigated. a generalised-esprit (gesprit) algorithm can be treated as an improvement of esprit algorithm and the inter-elements spacing of the array geometry can be uniform or non-uniform within a half wavelength. the authors combine the gesprit algorithm and the nc property, and propose an nc-gesprit algorithm to obtain the doas of nc signals, which requires spectrum peak searching. moreover, a computationally efficient search-free root nc-gesprit algorithm, which is based on polynomial rooting, is also proposed to depress the computational cost. the proposed nc-gesprit algorithms have much better estimation performance than the conventional gesprit algorithm and it can detect 2m-1 sources with only m sensors due to the nc property. furthermore, the proposed algorithms can work well without estimating nc phase. the effectiveness and improvement of the proposed algorithms will be proved in the following simulation results.
leadership	issues of gender imbalance in leadership have long been a significant issue in universities, as is the case across most industries. this paper explores the experiences of seven females who have successfully achieved senior leadership positions at a regional university in australia. while the experiences of these women differ in many ways, there are certainly similarities in the challenges and adversities that they have faced, and their perceptions of what has allowed them to experience success in their leadership roles. this paper provides a number of recommendations for women aspiring to be leaders in higher education, such as committing to ongoing development, taking opportunities when presented, developing resilience, developing a track record, and seeking support, and also recommendations for institutions.
attention	nitrate pollution of groundwater, which is mainly caused by the application of nitrogen-based fertilizers in intensive agriculture, is a widespread problem all over the world and a potential risk for public health. reverse osmosis, ion exchange and electrodialysis are currently used for water denitrification, yielding a highly concentrated reject water that requires economic and environmental costs for disposal. nitrate reduction technologies that are able to convert nitrate into inert nitrogen gas have appeared that are promising, cost effective and environmentally friendly. among these technologies, attention has been focused on i) the chemical reduction over mono-and bimetallic catalysts with hydrogen as the reducing agent and ii) electrocatalytic reduction processes over metallic anodes. although selectivity values towards n-2 of greater than 90% are achieved with both technologies, the undesired formation of ammonium as a reaction by-product is still the main drawback preventing their implementation at larger scales. for this reason, the development of new catalytic and electrodic materials as well as novel reactor configurations to avoid ammonium formation have been extensively investigated in the last few years to increase the effectiveness and competitiveness of both technologies. in this paper, an overview of the current state-of-the-art of both catalytic reduction and electroreduction of nitrates is presented, highlighting their potential and their main drawbacks along with guidelines for future research.

nonverbal_communication	this paper deals with an issue from the field of proxernics, that refers to the perception and the usage of space, as a way of transmitting messages, attitudes and behaviors in the military in certain situations. by defining the concepts of proxemics and establishing the four types of distances between humans: intimate, personal, social and public, we aim to identify elements of this area that are characteristic for drill in the romanian armed forces. consequently, the work proposes, particularly in the army, to reveal the significations of norms established in the military general regulations and their impact on the military personnel. we aim to answer to the following research question: does the romanian armed forces' drill regulations take into account the aspects of ""human topology"" or the role of personal distances in everyday transactions? in addition, we intend to analyze in a comparative manner the romanian and foreign (american and european) military drill regulations and to identify if certain specific elements of proxernics possess cultural connotations. the research methodology is based on a mixed method, consisting in document study: the study of distances in the military drill regulations.
nonverbal_communication	touch between people is associated with several outcomes, including reduced stress, more positive mood, enhanced feelings of closeness, and positive behavioral change. however, the potential utility of touch rarely has been examined in a college sample, with teachers touching their students. in the present study, we used instrumental touch operationalized as teaching students to take their pulse on the wrist; a control group was not touched. we assessed motivation, attitudes toward the instructor and the lecture, and quiz grades based on the lecture. results indicated that touch increased motivation and attitudes toward the teacher and lecture. we suggest that instructors can use touch as a way to develop rapport, increase student motivation, and improve attitudes toward the instructor and course. future research should evaluate appropriate forms of touch, possible moderation by student or instructor gender, and potential long-term benefits of using touch in the classroom.
prenatal_development	neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) is an autosomal-dominant neuro-cutaneous-skeletal syndrome. neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the rasopathies, and at the cellular level nf1 results in a hyperactive ras pathway. in the current investigation, our aim was to study lateral skull x-rays (cephalograms) to assess nf1-related craniofacial morphology. a total of 85 finnish patients with nf1, including four patients with plexiform neurofibroma of the 5th cranial nerve, and their age- and gender-matched controls, were enrolled in the study. the results showed that patients with nf1 typically had a short mandible, maxilla, and cranial base compared with healthy controls, irrespective of age, but the results were statistically significant only in adults. the length of the mandible, the maxilla and the cranial base correlated with the height of patients under 19 yr of age, but this correlation was absent in adult patients. thus, a tall adult patient with nf1 may have short jaws and a short cranial base. in conclusion, the nf1 gene apparently influences the growth of craniofacial bones, thus contributing to the craniofacial morphology in nf1.
attention	the development of efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for water splitting has drawn much attention. herein, we demonstrated a novel h-2-producing photocatalytic system that employed nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (ngqds)-znnb2o6/g-c3n4 heterostructures as the hydrogen evolving catalysts. the as-prepared ngqds-znnb2o6/g-c3n4 heterostructures were favorable for light harvesting and charge separation, and showed highly efficient photocatalytic performance for water splitting into hydrogen. results showed that both the znnb2o6/g-c3n4 (zn/cn) mole ratio and the amount of ngqds displayed important influence for h-2 production. moreover, the optimum synthesis conditions of the zn/cn mole ratio (1/7) and the amount of ngqds (5%) were both obtained, and the corresponding 5%ngqds-zn/7cn sample performed a much higher hydrogen-evolution rate of 340.9 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). by the further studies, the enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the crucial roles of ngqds and heterojunction photocatalytic system, which resulted in an efficient charge separation and the largely enhanced photocatalytic activity. meanwhile, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of ngqds-znnb2o6/g-c3n4 was also proposed. we envision that this work creates new opportunities for constructing and designing efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction.

eating_disorders	the current study replicated and extended previous research on disordered eating and dietary intent (i.e., self-reported restriction of caloric intake with the purpose of losing weight) in boys and men by examining the direct and indirect influence of sociocultural pressure, social body comparisons, internalization of societal appearance ideals, body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) on dietary restraint. participants were 681 boys ((x) over bar (age) = 12.49 years, sd = 0.99) from six middle schools located in the south central united states. using structural equation modeling (sem), 32% to 35% of the dietary restraint variance was explained across two independent samples. pressures to lose weight and diet predicted all the psychosocial outcomes, whereas higher levels of (crf) predicted higher levels of body satisfaction and self-esteem and lower body mass indices (bmis), which predicted lower dietary restraint. the results from this study support a multifactorial approach to understanding boys' dietary behaviors.
attention	high-temperature superconducting (hts) generators for large-scale wind power generation systems attract much research attention. excitation systems in hts generators, particularly brushless hts exciters, are a new challenge. to verify the possibility of a brushless hts exciter in a large-scale wind power generator, we designed and fabricated hts coils for a laboratory-scale wind power generator employing a brushless exciter. in order to supply dc current into the hts coils, a brushless exciter was considered in the generator. all of the field coils were wound with an hts coated conductor made of 2g gdbco wire. the conduction cooling test was executed in a cryogenic test chamber to check the performances at 30 k. the detailed results of the operating performance of the hts coils were discussed in detail.
prenatal_development	adhd symptoms ""run in families"". however, relatively little is known about the ways in which parents' symptoms might additively and interactively work with the parenting environment, to influence (and be influenced by) the developmental trajectory of symptoms in children and adolescents. in this commentary on the special section addressing this gap in knowledge, emphasis is placed on the importance of replicating and extending family-wide studies of adhd symptoms and etiology. the current papers exemplify the leading-edge of such efforts, demonstrating the feasibility and rigor with which studies are being conducted, utilizing longitudinal and experimental designs. families and parenting environments operate as a system in which individuals influence each other 's symptoms and functioning. in so doing, parents produce tremendous variability within (as well as between) each family in individuals' adhd symptoms from childhood through adulthood, via gene-environment transactions that may even begin during prenatal development.
nonverbal_communication	background: the use of the internet for seekers of health-related information provides convenience and accessibility to diverse sources (of variable quality) for many medical conditions. there is a suggestion that patients may find empowerment by engaging with internet health care strategies and communities. the profile of consumers of online health information on knee pain has not been explored. objective: our objective was to identify the characteristics and motivations of online health information-seekers accessing the online health community, kneeguru (kg). the study was designed to obtain the respondents' sociodemographic profile, together with their main reasons and motivations for joining such a community, their health information-seeking behavior, the extent of their knee problems, and their general internet usage. methods: we undertook an online questionnaire survey, offered to users of the kg website from june to july 2012. a mix of open and closed questions was used to facilitate inductive enquiry. quantitative responses were analyzed using univariate analysis; qualitative thematic analysis of the open responses was completed and a conceptual model was developed. results: one-hundred and fifty-two respondents took part (11.56% response rate, 152/1315), with a mean age of 40.1 years. of this cohort, 61.2% were female, 68.4% were in domestic partnerships, 57.2% were employed, 75.0% had higher education qualifications, and 80.3% were of white/caucasian ethnicity. females were associated with joining kg in order to get emotional support from other users (or 2.11, 95% ci 1.04 - 4.27, p=.04). respondents' self-perception of health was associated with reported quality of life (or 10.86, 95% ci 3.85 - 30.43, p<.001). facebook users were associated with joining kg to share experiences (or 2.34, 95% ci 1.04 - 5.56, p=.03). post-surgery respondents were associated with joining kg to compare symptoms with other users (or 7.31, 95% ci 2.06 - 39.82, p<.001). three key themes were induced: condition, emotion and support. respondents expressed distress and frustration at uncertainty of prognosis around various knee conditions, with some users preferring to initially observe rather than engage. conversely, a strong desire to inform and support other community members was stated with reciprocation of ideas and experiences. kg was conceptualized as a filter that takes an individual 's condition and emotional response to that condition as basis for support; this filter facilitated validation as the outcome of engagement. conclusions: this study, in line with wider literature, suggests that users of an online knee-specific community are typically female, middle-aged, white/caucasian, married, employed, and have attained a level of higher education. these users demonstrate a pragmatic approach to health care information with altruistic motivations and a desire to share experiences as a means of validation. this finding emphasizes a means of promoting efficient and appropriate online health care, and demonstrates the benefits of the internet as a viable complement to clinical engagement.
false_memories	people often discuss events they have seen and these discussions can influence later recollections. we investigated the effects of factual, emotional, and free retelling discussion on memory recollections of individuals who have witnessed an event. participants were shown a video, made an initial individual recall, participated in one of the three retelling conditions (emotional versus factual versus free) or a control condition, and then recalled the event individually again. participants in the factual and free retelling conditions reported more items not previously recalled than participants in the control condition did, while the emotional condition did not show the same advantage. participants in all three retelling conditions failed to report more previously recalled items as compared with the control condition. finally, a memory conformity effect was observed for all three retelling conditions. these findings suggest that eyewitnesses' discussions may influence the accuracy of subsequent memory reports, especially when these discussions are focused on emotional details and thoughts.
problem-solving	in circles of support and accountability (cosa), a group of trained and supervised volunteers support a sex offender (core member in a circle), with the aim of supporting the core member 's transitions toward full desistance. a prospective, multi-method design was used to explore psychological and social transitions in core members. data were collected at the start of their circle, after 6 months, and after 12 months. qualitative data were collected in semi-structured interviews with 17 core members and a total of 29 professionals, and analyzed with kwalitan, a computer-assisted program for qualitative data analysis. quantitative data were assessed with self-report questionnaires for sex offenders. mean differences between t0, t1, and t2 were tested with repeated-measures anovas. qualitative results indicated improvements in reflective skills, openness, and problem-solving skills, as well as social skills, agency, and self-regulation. quantitative results documented improvements in emotion regulation and internal locus of control, and positive trends in self-esteem and coping skills. due to the small sample size, our results must be interpreted with caution. core members as well as professionals reported a unique contribution of circles to their process, but this claim needs further confirmation.
schizophrenia	circulating micrornas presented in venous plasma have been demonstrated as powerful biomarkers for the complex diseases like cancer. nevertheless, those presented in arterial plasma remained largely unexplored. here, using microarray technique, we compared microrna expression profiles of the matched arterial and venous plasma samples from the same male rats. though the microrna profiles were largely similar, we identified 24 differentially expressed micrornas, including 10 arterial highly expressed micrornas and 14 venous highly expressed micrornas. the differentially expressed micrornas were validated by qrt-pcr. computational analysis of these micrornas and their targets indicated that arterial highly expressed micrornas were overrepresented for functional terms like hematopoiesis and diseases like crohn 's disease and leukemia; while venous highly expressed micrornas were enriched for cell differentiation function, and diseases like distal myopathies and heart failure. our analysis also suggested significant correlations between plasma microrna expression and tissue microrna expression. four arterial highly expressed micrornas also showed enriched expression in specific tissues and would be novel biomarker candidates.
schizophrenia	alzheimer 's disease (ad) is a terminal, age-related neurological syndrome exhibiting progressive cognitive and memory decline, however ad patients in addition exhibit ancillary neuropsychiatric symptoms (npss) and these include aggression. in this communication we provide recent evidence for the mis-regulation of a small family of genes expressed in the human hippocampus that appear to be significantly involved in expression patterns common to both ad and aggression. dna array-and mrna transcriptome-based gene expression analysis and candidate gene association and/or genome-wide association studies (cgas, gwas) of aggressive attributes in humans have revealed a surprisingly small subset of six brain genes that are also strongly associated with altered gene expression patterns in ad. these genes encoded on five different chromosomes (chr) include the androgen receptor (ar; chrxq12), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf; chr11p14.1), catechol-o-methyl transferase (comt; chr22q11.21), neuronal specific nitric oxide synthase (nos1; chr12q24.22), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh chr9q34.2) and tryptophan hydroxylase (tph1, chr11p15.1 and tph2, chr12q21.1). interestingly, (i) the expression of three of these six genes (comt, dbh, nos1) are highly variable; (ii) three of these six genes (comt, dbh, tph1) are involved in da or serotonin metabolism, biosynthesis and/or neurotransmission; and (iii) five of these six genes (ar, bdnf, comt, dbh, nos1) have been implicated in the development, onset and/or propagation of schizophrenia. the magnitude of the expression of genes implicated in aggressive behavior appears to be more pronounced in the later stages of ad when compared to mci. these recent genetic data further indicate that the extent of cognitive impairment may have some bearing on the degree of aggression which accompanies the ad phenotype.
prejudice	disparities in health and mental health between sexual-minority and heterosexual individuals emerge in early adolescence, in large part because sexual-minority individuals are stigmatized. in this article, i review and synthesize the role of gender nonconformity in shaping how adolescents experience the stigma associated with sexual-minority status. then, i review research with adolescents and emerging adults that shows that gender nonconformity is associated with variation in harassment and mental health outcomes both within sexual-minority groups and between sexual-minority and heterosexual groups. next, i discuss gender nonconformity as a construct that influences the association between sexual-minority status and peer relations, and between peer relations and individual psychosocial outcomes. finally, i discuss the importance of addressing stigma related to gender nonconformity.
schizophrenia	rationale: the polyglutamine disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (sca17) is a neurodegenerative disease leading to severe neurological symptoms during development. additionally, patients affected by sca17 display psychosis earlier than their motor disorders. objective: here the putative psychotic phenotype and endophenotype of transgenic sca17 rats was examined. methods: the expression of schizophrenia-like symptoms was evaluated over a longitudinal period before and after the onset of neurological symptoms in sca17. to this end, transgenic sca17 rats' monoamine neurotransmission was investigated along with their locomotion at baseline and in response to amphetamine using in-vivo microdialysis in free moving conditions, their sensorimotor gating using pre-pulse inhibition of startle reaction, and their object memory using the novel object recognition test as an index of cognitive impairments. results: presymptomatic sca17 rats displayed dysregulated monoamine levels at baseline and in response to amphetamine compared with control wild-type (wt) rats. at that stage, neither amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion nor sensorimotor gating differed from that in wt rats. symptomatic sca17 rats developed sensorimotor gating deficits and also showed an impaired object memory, while their monoaminergic responses remained supersensitive to amphetamine. conclusions: the data of the present study demonstrate a neurochemical endophenotype in sca17 rats resembling that of prodromal schizophrenia. these findings suggest that a sensitization of the monoamine systems arises early in adulthood in sca17 rats and may predispose them to express schizophrenia-like symptoms later in life.
nonverbal_communication	introduction: this article is part of the focus theme of methods of information in medicine on ""pervasive intelligent technologies for health"". background: effective nonverbal communication between patients and clinicians fosters both the delivery of empathic patient-centered care and positive patient outcomes. although nonverbal skill training is a recognized need, few efforts to enhance patient-clinician communication provide visual feedback on nonverbal aspects of the clinical encounter. objectives: we describe a novel approach that uses social signal processing technology (ssp) to capture nonverbal cues in real time and to display ambient visual feedback on control and affiliation two primary, yet distinct dimensions of interpersonal nonverbal communication. to examine the design and clinician acceptance of ambient visual feedback on nonverbal communication, we 1) formulated a model of relational communication to ground ssp and 2) conducted a formative user study using mixed methods to explore the design of visual feedback. methods: based on a model of relational communication, we reviewed interpersonal communication research to map nonverbal cues to signals of affiliation and control evidenced in patient-clinician interaction. corresponding with our formulation of this theoretical framework, we designed ambient real-time visualizations that reflect variations of affiliation and control. to explore clinicians' acceptance of this visual feedback, we conducted a lab study using the wizard-of-oz technique to simulate system use with 16 healthcare professionals. we followed up with seven of those participants through interviews to iterate on the design with a revised visualization that addressed emergent design considerations. results: ambient visual feedback on nonverbal communication provides a theoretically grounded and acceptable way to provide clinicians with awareness of their nonverbal communication style. we provide implications for the design of such visual feedback that encourages empathic patient-centered communication and include considerations of metaphor, color, size, position, and timing of feedback. conclusions: ambient visual feedback from ssp holds promise as an acceptable means for facilitating empathic patient-centered nonverbal communication.
eating_disorders	the severity criterion used in dsm-5 for bulimia nervosa (bn) was investigated in 214 individuals referred for treatment at a regional eating disorders service in the uk. in addition to comparing eating disorder symptoms, impairment secondary to these symptoms was also assessed. according to guidance in dsm-5, 94 individuals were classified as mild (43.9%), 70 as moderate (32.7%), 32 as severe (15.0%), and 8 as extreme (3.7%) levels of bn severity. due to small numbers in the latter two groups, it was necessary to combine these to form one `severe/extreme' group. analyses on these three groups suggested no group effect on demographic variables but differences were seen on measures of eating pathology, psychological distress, and psychosocial impairment between the mild group and other groups. individuals in the moderate and severe/extreme groups scored comparably on most measures of pathology and impairment. the results are broadly consistent with past studies on community samples although together question the demarcation between moderate and more severe groups of individuals with bn.
borderline_personality_disorder	positive urgency, the tendency to respond impulsively to positive affective states, has been linked to many psychopathologies, but little is known about mechanisms underpinning this form of impulsivity. we examined whether the positive urgency measure (pum) related to higher scores on performance-based measures of impulsivity and cognitive control that were administered after a positive mood induction. undergraduates (n = 112) completed the self-report pum, several positive mood inductions, and behavioral measures of impulsivity and cognitive control. pum scores were significantly related to poor performance on the antisaccade task, a measure of prepotent response inhibition, but not to other performance measures. together with existing literature, findings implicate deficits in response inhibition as one mechanism involved in emotion-related impulsivity.
depression	anxiety and depression, which are highly prevalent in adolescence, are both characterized by a negative attentional bias. as attentional bias modification (abm) can reduce such a bias, and might also affect emotional reactivity, it could be a promising early intervention. however, a growing number of studies also report comparable improvements in both active and placebo groups. the current study investigated the effects of eight online sessions of visual search (vs) abm compared to both a vs placebo-training and a no-training control group in adolescents with heightened symptoms of anxiety and/or depression (n = 108). attention bias, interpretation bias, and stress-reactivity were assessed pre- and post-training. primary outcomes of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and secondary measures of emotional resilience were assessed pre- and post-training and at three and six months follow-up. results revealed that vs training reduced attentional bias compared to both control groups, with stronger effects for participants who completed more training sessions. irrespective of training condition, an overall reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression and an increase in emotional resilience were observed up to six months later. the training was evaluated relatively negatively. results suggest that online abm as employed in the current study has no added value as an early intervention in adolescents with heightened symptoms.

prosocial_behavior	associations between social class and prosocial behaviordefined broadly as action intended to help othersmay vary as a function of contextual factors. three studies examined how making prosocial actions public, versus private, moderates this association. in study 1, participation in a public prosocial campaign was higher among upper than lower class individuals. in studies 2 and 3, lower class individuals were more prosocial in a dictator game scenario in private than in public, whereas upper class individuals showed the reverse pattern. follow-up analyses revealed the importance of reputational concerns for shaping class differences in prosociality: specifically, higher class individuals reported that pride motivated their prosocial behavior more than lower class individuals, and this association partially accounted for class-based differences in prosociality in public versus private contexts. together, these results suggest that unique strategies for connecting and relating to others develop based on one 's position in the class hierarchy.
false_memories	the effect of mindfulness meditation on false-memory susceptibility was examined in three experiments. because mindfulness meditation encourages judgment-free thoughts and feelings, we predicted that participants in the mindfulness condition would be especially likely to form false memories. in two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to either a mindfulness induction, in which they were instructed to focus attention on their breathing, or a mind-wandering induction, in which they were instructed to think about whatever came to mind. the overall number of words from the deese-roediger-mcdermott paradigm that were correctly recalled did not differ between conditions. however, participants in the mindfulness condition were significantly more likely to report critical nonstudied items than participants in the control condition. in a third experiment, which tested recognition and used a reality-monitoring paradigm, participants had reduced reality-monitoring accuracy after completing the mindfulness induction. these results demonstrate a potential unintended consequence of mindfulness meditation in which memories become less reliable.
person_perception	when it comes to person perception, does one ""judge a book by its cover?"" perceivers made judgments of liking, and of personality, based on a photograph of an unknown other, and at least 1 month later, made judgments following a face-to-face interaction with the same person. photograph-based liking judgments predicted interaction-based liking judgments, and, to a lesser extent, photograph-based personality judgments predicted interaction-based personality judgments (except for extraversion). consistency in liking judgments (1) partly reflected behavioral confirmation (i.e., perceivers with favorable photograph-based judgments behaved more warmly toward the target during the live interaction, which elicited greater target warmth); (2) explained, at least in part, consistency in personality judgments (reflecting a halo effect); and (3) remained robust even after controlling for perceiver effects, target effects, and perceived attractiveness. these findings support the view that even after having ""read a book,"" one still, to some extent, judges it by its ""cover.
schizophrenia	pragmatic competence may be disrupted due to psychological and neurological causes. for appropriate remedy and rehabilitation, a precise assessment of pragmatic skills is important. however, there is no test battery in the bengali language, and consequently, there is no published data on pragmatic ability of bengali speakers. due to the vast diversity of the population, it becomes increasingly difficult to assess pragmatic ability of an individual without a proper knowledge of the normal variations. to address this problem we have developed a test battery in bengali, and to begin with, we have administered it to one hundred and five (105) normal healthy persons having different levels of education. the four groups having 17 years and above, 15 to < 17 years, 12 to < 15 years and 10 to < 12 years of education yielded a normative score of 193, 189, 171 and 150, respectively. these normative scores will allow clinicians to make a proper assessment of patients suffering from pragmatic deficits and help avoid interpreting social differences as neurological deficits.
depression	spontaneous epileptiform activity has previously been observed in lateral amygdala (la) slices derived from patients with intractable-temporal lobe epilepsy. the present study aimed to characterize intranuclear la synaptic connectivity and to test the hypothesis that differences in the spread of flow of neuronal activity may relate to spontaneous epileptiform activity occurrence. electrical activity was evoked through electrical microstimulation in acute human brain slices containing the la, signals were recorded as local field potentials combined with fast optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dye fluorescence. sites of stimulation and recording were systematically varied. following recordings, slices were anatomically reconstructed using two-dimensional unitary slices as a reference for coronal and parasagittal planes. local spatial patterns and spread of activity were assessed by incorporating the coordinates of electrical and optical recording sites into the respective unitary slice. a preferential directional spread of evoked electrical signals was observed from ventral to dorsal, rostra) to caudal and medial to lateral regions in the la. no differences in spread of evoked activity were observed between spontaneously and non-spontaneously active la slices, i.e. basic properties of evoked synaptic responses were similar in the two functional types of la slices, including input output relationship, and paired-pulse depression. these results indicate a directed propagation of synaptic signals within the human la in spontaneously active epileptic slices. we suggest that the lack of differences in local and in systemic information processing has to be found in confined epileptiform circuits within the amygdala likely involving well-known ""epileptic neurons"".

media_violence	a recent [f-18]fdopa-pet study reports negative correlations between dopamine synthesis rates and aggressive behavior. since dopamine is among the substrates for monoamine oxidase a (maoa), this investigation examines whether functional allelic variants of the maoa tandem repeat (vntr) promotor polymorphism, which is known to modulate aggressive behavior, influences dopamine release and aggression in response to violent visual stimuli. we selected from a genetic prescreening sample, strictly case-matched groups of 2 x 12 healthy male subjects with vntrs predictive of high (maoa-high) and low (maoa-low) maoa expression. subjects underwent pairs of pet sessions (dopamine d-2/3 ligand [f-18]dmfp) while viewing a movie of neutral content, versus violent content. directly afterwards, aggressive behavior was assessed by the point subtraction aggression paradigm (psap). finally, pet data of 23 participants and behavioral data of 22 participants were analyzed due to post hoc exclusion criteria. in the genetic prescreening sample maoa-low carriers had significantly increased scores on the buss-perry aggression questionnaire. in the pet-study-group, aggressive behavior under the emotional neutral condition was significantly higher in the maoa-low group. interestingly, the two maoa-groups showed inverse dopaminergic and behavioral reactions to the violent movie: the maoa-high group showed higher dopamine release and increased aggression after the violent movie; maoa-low subjects showed decreases in aggressive behavior and no consistent dopamine release. these results indicate a possible impact of the maoa-promotor polymorphism on the neurobiological modulation of aggressive behavior. however, the data do not support approaches stating that maoa-low fosters aggression by a simple pro-dopaminergic mechanism.

prenatal_development	maternal immune activation during prenatal development, including treatment with the viral rna mimic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly ic), serves as a widely used animal model to induce behavioral deficits reminiscent of schizophrenia and related disease. here, we report that massive cytokine activation after a single dose of poly ic in the prenatal period is associated with lasting working memory deficits in adult offspring. to explore whether dysregulated gene expression in cerebral cortex, contributes to cognitive dysfunction, we profiled the cortical transcriptome, and in addition, mapped the genome-wide distribution of trimethylated histone h3-lysine 4 (h3k4me3), an epigenetic mark sharply regulated at the 5' end of transcriptional units. however, deep sequencing-based h3k4me3 mapping and mrna profiling by microarray did not reveal significant alterations in mature cerebral cortex after poly ic exposure at embryonic days e17.5 or e12.5. at a small set of genes (including suppressor of cytokine signaling socs3), h3k4me3 was sensitive to activation of cytokine signaling in primary cultures from fetal forebrain but adult cortex of saline- and poly ic-exposed mice did not show significant differences. a limited set of transcription start sites (tss), including disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (disc1), a schizophrenia risk gene often implicated in gene-environment interaction models, showed altered h3k4me3 after prenatal poly ic but none of these differences survived after correcting for multiple comparisons. we conclude that prenatal poly ic is associated with cognitive deficits later in life, but without robust alterations in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the cerebral cortex.

social_cognition	the subtle relationship between feeling and thinking, affect and cognition has fascinated philosophers and writers since time immemorial, yet, empirical research on this topic was relatively neglected by psychologists until recently. there have been many claims emphasising the beneficial cognitive and behavioural consequences of positive affect. many recent works suggest that negative affect may also facilitate optimal performance in many situations, consistent with evolutionary theories suggesting the adaptive signalling function of various affective states. this paper reviews traditional and current psychological theories linking affect to social thinking and behaviour. a variety of empirical studies from our laboratory will also be presented, demonstrating that in many situations, negative affect promotes optimal performance in cognitive and social tasks, including tasks such as memory, social judgements, motivation, and strategic interpersonal behaviours. these results will be interpreted in terms of a dual-process theory that predicts that negative affect promotes a more accommodative, vigilant, and externally focused thinking strategy. the relevance of these findings for recent affect-cognition theories will be discussed, and the practical implications of negative affect promoting improved social thinking and performance in a number of applied fields will be considered.
child_abuse	a cost of illness (coi) study was undertaken to estimate the magnitude and range of lifetime effects associated with child maltreatment in australia, using an incidence-based approach. costs were primarily estimated through calculation of population attributable fractions (pafs) to determine the marginal effects of child maltreatment on a range of outcomes. pafs were then applied to estimates of expenditure, inflated to 2014-15 australian dollars, projected over the life course, according to a baseline age of incident cases for child maltreatment in 2012-13, and discounted at 7% per annum. sensitivity analysis was conducted using a best and lower bound estimate of incidence of child abuse. the best estimate of the total estimated lifetime financial costs for incident cases of child maltreatment in 2012-13 was $9.3 billion (a cost per child maltreated of $176,437), with a lower bound of $5.8 billion. the best estimate of lifetime costs associated with reduced quality of life and premature mortality (non-financial costs) for all incident cases of child maltreatment in 2012-13 was $17.4 billion, or $328,757 per child maltreated. the considerable lifetime costs associated with child maltreatment warrants an expansion of existing investment in primary and secondary prevention and targeted support services for children and families at risk.

media_violence	this article develops answers to the question, ""are there psychiatric processes or some general psychological predisposition that makes nondiagnosed people susceptible to media violence consumption in a way that would lead to lifelong aggressive behavior?"" the authors discuss the assumptions they make about what this question is trying to answer, review factors known to precipitate destructive aggressiveness, and clarify environmental exposures' being a small part of a long list of precipitants. they discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to trauma and others less so. they mention their work examining exposure to violence within schools and the impact it has on school climates and vulnerable children, illustrating the importance of social factors relating to aggression. the authors conclude by reformulating the question, allowing human psychopathological reactions to be seen in their glorious, nonparsimonious complexity.
eating_disorders	background: experts recommend that clinicians assess motivational factors before initiating care for pediatric obesity. currently, there are no well-established clinical tools available for assessing motivation in youth with obesity or their families. this represents an important gap in knowledge since motivation-related information may shed light on which patients might fail to complete treatment programs. our study was designed to evaluate the measurement properties and utility of the readiness and motivational interview for families (rmi-family), a structured interview that utilizes a motivational interviewing approach to (i) assess motivational factors in youth and their parents, and (ii) examine the degree to which motivation and motivation-related concordance between youth and parents are related to making changes to lifestyle habits for managing obesity in youth. methods: from 2016 to 2020, this prospective study will include youth with obesity (body mass index [bmi] >= 97th percentile; 13-17 years old; n = 250) and their parents (n = 250). the study will be conducted at two primary-level, multidisciplinary obesity management clinics based at children 's hospitals in alberta, canada. participants will be recruited and enrolled after referral to these clinics, but prior to initiating clinical care. each youth and their parent will complete the rmi-family (similar to 1.5 h) at baseline, and 6-and 12-months post-baseline. individual (i.e., youth or parent) and family-level (i.e., across youth and parent) responses to interview questions will be scored, as will aspects of interview administration (e.g., fidelity to motivational interviewing tenets). the rmi-family will also be examined for test-retest reliability. youth data collected at each time point will include demography, anthropometry, lifestyle habits, psychosocial functioning, and health services utilization. cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between individual and family-level interview scores on the rmi-family and these clinical measures will be examined. discussion: as a measurement tool drawing on family-centered care and motivational interviewing, the rmi-family was designed to increase understanding of the role of motivational factors in pediatric obesity management, allowing healthcare providers and policymakers to manage pediatric obesity more effectively and efficiently. findings will help to create an innovative, tailored model of health care delivery that uses resources judiciously and is designed to best meet families' needs.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the article is devoted to the development of a method of diagnosing psychopathy, or antisocial (dissocial) personality disorder. modern researchers mostly use the methods of experiment, expert assessment, clinical interview or different combinations for personality disorders, including psychopathy. however, nowadays there is a growing need in development of a psychopathy diagnosis method which would be less labour-intensive, less expensive and more objective. one of the recently developed models of psychopathy is trierarchic conceptualization by c. patrick, it offers a new way to operationalize and diagnose psychopathy. the authors had tested this method in the russian population, including both common sample as well as criminal offender sample consisting of individuals that have been suspected, accused or convicted of violent crimes. the subject of the current research is psychopathic traits measured by the tested method. we had carried out statistical and content analyzes of the data. our study allowed to conclude that tested russian version of the triarchic psychopathy measure is effective enough to be used for research purposes. however, further research is required in order to render this measure valid to practical use.
depression	background: while short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies have been shown effective for major depression, it is unclear if this could be a treatment of choice for depressed patients, many of whom have chronic and complex health issues, who have not sufficiently responded to treatment. method: this superiority trial used a single blind randomised parallel group design to test the efficacy of time-limited intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (istdp) for treatment resistant depression (trd). patients referred to secondary care community mental health teams (cmht) who met dsm-iv criteria for major depressive episode, had received antidepressant treatment weeks, and had hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d) scores of were recruited. the effects of 20 sessions of istdp were judged through comparison against secondary care cmht treatment as usual (tau). the primary outcome was ham-d scores at 6 months. secondary outcomes included the patient health questionnaire (phq-9) self-report measures for depression and dichotomous measures of both remission (defined as ham-d score <= 7) and partial remission (defined as ham-d score <= 12). results: sixty patients were randomised to 2 groups (istdp = 30 and tau = 30), with data collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. multi-level linear regression modelling showed that change over time on both depression scales was significantly greater in the istdp group in comparison to tau. statistically significant between-group treatment differences, in the moderate to large range, favouring istdp, were observed on both the observer rated (cohen 's d=0.75) and self-report measures (cohen 's d=0.85) of depression. relative to tau, patients in the istdp group were significantly more likely after 6 months to achieve complete remission (36.0% vs. 3.7%) and partial remission (48.0% vs. 18.5%). limitations: it is unclear if the results are generalizable to other providers, geographical locations and cultures. conclusions: time-limited istdp appears an effective treatment option for trd, showing large advantages over routine treatment delivered by secondary care services.
attention	recently, graph-based dimensionality reduction methods have attracted much attention due to their widely applications in many practical tasks such as image classification and data clustering. however, an inappropriate graph which cannot accurately reflect the underlying structure and distribution of input data will dramatically deteriorate the performances of these methods. in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm termed locality constrained graph optimization dimensionality reduction (lc-godr) to address the limitations of existing graph-based dimensionality reduction methods. firstly, unlike most graph-based dimensionality reduction methods in which the graphs are constructed in advance and kept unchanged during dimensionality reduction, our lc-godr combines the graph optimization and projection matrix learning into a joint framework. therefore, the graph in the proposed algorithm can be adaptively updated during the procedure of dimensionality reduction. secondly, through introducing the locality constraints into our lc-godr, the local information of high-dimensional input data can be discovered and well preserved, which makes the proposed algorithm distinct from other graph optimization based dimensionality reduction methods. moreover, an effective updating scheme is also provided to solve the proposed lc-godr. extensive experiments on two uci and five image databases are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. the experimental results indicate that the proposed lc-godr outperforms other related methods.

gender_roles	data for 40 developing countries in the period 2005 to 2010 are used to study the gendered impact of country-level conditioning (financial environment, government quality and support, education quality and entrepreneurship know-how, innovation environment and support, business infrastructure, entrepreneurial culture and society and gender roles) on the choice made by early-stage entrepreneurs regarding the routine level of the sector of activity in which they are starting their business, with lower routine levels linked to higher economic growth. the business infrastructure of a country is a core factor for facilitating entry into medium-low routine sectors, followed by education quality and entrepreneurship know-how. women entrepreneurs benefit to a larger extent from innovation environment and support, but gender roles may deter their entry into medium-low routine sectors.
prejudice	improvements in biomedical technologies, combined with changing social attitudes to sexual minorities, provide new opportunities for hiv prevention among gay and other men who have sex with men (gmsm). the potential of these new biomedical technologies (biotechnologies) to reduce hiv transmission and the impact of hiv among gmsm will depend, in part, on the degree to which they challenge prejudicial attitudes, practices and stigma directed against gay men and people living with hiv (plhiv). at the structural level, stigma regarding gay men and hiv can influence the scale-up of new biotechnologies and negatively affect gmsm 's access to and use of these technologies. at the personal level, stigma can affect individual gay men 's sense of value and confidence as they negotiate serodiscordant relationships or access services. this paper argues that maximising the benefits of new biomedical technologies depends on reducing stigma directed at sexual minorities and people living with hiv and promoting positive social changes towards and within gmsm communities. hiv research, policy and programs will need to invest in: (1) responding to structural and institutional stigma; (2) health promotion and health services that recognise and work to address the impact of stigma on gmsm 's incorporation of new hiv prevention biotechnologies; (3) enhanced mobilisation and participation of gmsm and plhiv in new approaches to hiv prevention; and (4) expanded approaches to research and evaluation in stigma reduction and its relationship with hiv prevention. the hiv response must become bolder in resourcing, designing and evaluating programs that interact with and influence stigma at multiple levels, including structural-level stigma.
prenatal_development	sex-linkage is predicted to evolve in response to sex-specific or sexually antagonistic selection. in line with this prediction, most sex-linked genes are associated with reproduction in the respective sex. in addition to traits directly involved in fertility and fecundity, mediators of maternal effects may be predisposed to evolve sex-linkage, because they indirectly affect female fitness through their effect on offspring phenotype. here, we test for sex-linked inheritance of a key mediator of prenatal maternal effects in oviparous species, the transfer of maternally derived testosterone to the eggs. consistent with maternal inheritance, we found that in japanese quail (coturnix japonica) granddaughters resemble their maternal (but not their paternal) grandmother in yolk testosterone deposition. this pattern of resemblance was not due to non-genetic priming effects of testosterone exposure during prenatal development, as an experimental manipulation of yolk testosterone levels did not affect the females' testosterone transfer to their own eggs later in life. instead, w chromosome and/or mitochondrial variation may underlie the observed matrilineal inheritance pattern. ultimately, the inheritance of mediators of maternal effects along the maternal line will allow for a fast and direct response to female-specific selection, thereby affecting the dynamics of evolutionary processes mediated by maternal effects.
prosocial_behavior	as a fundamental concern of human beings, mortality salience impacts various human social behaviors including intergroup interactions; however, the underlying neural signature remains obscure. here, we examined the neural signatures underlying the impact of mortality reminders on in-group bias in costly punishment combining a second-party punishment task with multivariate pattern analysis of fmri data. after mortality salience (ms) priming or general negative affect priming, participants received offers from racial in-group and out-group proposers and decided how to punish proposers by reducing their payoffs. we revealed that ms priming attenuated in-group bias and dampened the discriminated activation patterns pertaining to group identities in regions previously implicated in costly punishment, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. the group identity represented in multivariate patterns of activity of these regions predicted in-group bias for the control condition, i.e., the stronger discriminative representations of group identities in these regions; the larger was the in-group bias. furthermore, the in-group bias was reliably decoded by distributed activation patterns in the punishment-related networks but only in the control condition and not in the ms condition. these findings elucidate the neural underpinnings of the effects of mortality reminders on intergroup interaction. hum brain mapp 38: 1281-1298, 2017.

problem-solving	executive dysfunction is a deficiency in skills of planning and problem solving that characterizes many neuropsychiatric disorders. the towers task is a commonly used measure of planning and problem solving for assessing executive function. towers task data are usually zero-inflated and right-censored, and ignoring these features can result in biased inference for the disease characterization of executive dysfunction. in this manuscript, a mixed-effects model for longitudinal censored semicontinuous data is developed for analyzing longitudinal towers task data from the predict-hd study. the model is contrasted with current practice, and implications for general use are discussed.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: the best available treatment for seasonal affective disorder (sad) is light therapy. yet, this treatment does not prevent recurrence of depression in subsequent seasons. the aim of the study is to gain preliminary insight in the efficacy of mindfulness based cognitive therapy (mbct) in the prevention of sad recurrence. methods: this is a randomized controlled pilot study, in which sad patients in remission were randomly allocated to an individual format of mbct or a control condition (i.e. treatment as usual). mkt was given between may and june 2011, when there was no presence of depressive symptoms. the inventory for depressive symplomatology self-report (ids-sr), which patients received on a weekly basis from september 2011 to april 2012, was used to assess moment of recurrence (>= 20) and severity at moment of recurrence. results: 23 sad patients were randomized to mkt and 23 to the control condition. kaplan-meier survival curve showed that the groups did not differ in moment of recurrence 1)41, p=.52). t-tests showed no group difference in mean ids-sr scores at moment of recurrence (1(31)=.52, p=.61). limitations: the results are limited by small sample size (n=46) and missing data of weekly ids-sr assessments. conclusion: the findings of this pilot rct suggest that individual mbct is not effective in preventing a sad recurrence when offered in a symptom free period (i.e. spring).

prosocial_behavior	this study examined the developmental trajectory of a potential source of resilience, prosocial behaviors, and children 's peer victimization from third to sixth grade. trajectories were examined for 1091 children (540 females, 81.4% caucasian) from phase 3 of the nichd study of early child care. latent growth mixture modeling indicated that three latent classes emerged (labeled resilient, at-risk, and normative). follow-up analyses with covariates further supported the presence of these classes. the resilient class, of particular interest in this study, indicated high initial, but dramatically decreasing victimization coupled with high-stable prosocial behaviors over the 4-year period. these findings suggest the potential protective function of engaging in prosocial behaviors for victims and highlight the need to examine potential heterogeneity among victims.

seasonal_affective_disorder	the management of mood disorders during pregnancy is complex due to risks associated with medication use and risks associated with untreated depression. antidepressant use during pregnancy is an exposure for the unborn child, and it currently remains unclear what long-term repercussions there might be from this exposure, though available data are reassuring. on the other hand, there are risks for both the mother and child of untreated depression during pregnancy. there is a real need for research into nonpharmacological strategies for the prevention of relapse of mood disorders in pregnant women who are off medications. we have reviewed a number of potential candidate interventions including psychotherapies, exercise, light box therapy (lbt), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms), electroconvulsive therapy (ect), holistic strategies, and nutritional and herbal supplements. currently there is a lack of evidence supporting the use of such strategies in the prevention of depressive relapse during pregnancy, though most of these strategies have at least some support for their use in the treatment of a major depressive episode. carefully conducted research using one or more of these strategies in women who want to discontinue antidepressants for pregnancy is sorely needed.
schizophrenia	schizophrenia and bipolar illness are two of the most serious forms of mental illness. until relatively recently, almost nothing was known about the molecular pathogenesis of either illness. the single largest risk factor that predisposes people to schizophrenia or bipolar illness is genetic risk. heritability is high, and the incidence is significantly higher in identical twins than in nonidentical twins. despite decades of work aimed at identifying the genes involved in these two illnesses, virtually no progress had beenmade until the past decade. with the knowledge and technologies that have been gained from thehumangenome project, ithas been possible to begin to understand the underlying genetics and to use the new information to begin the effort to discover new and better medicines to treat these illnesses. this articlewilldescribe the past decade of work toward this goal and articulate both the promise thatnowexists andwhat is still neededto bringdramatic andtangible change topatients-scolnick, e. m. thepath to new therapies for schizophrenia and bipolar illness.
person_perception	when travelling through a new environment people can and do make very quick judgements about the local conditions. this paper explores the idea that such judgements are affected by the travel mode they use. we hypothesise that drivers generate a more superficial impression of the things they observe than those who walk because they are exposed to less information. this prediction is based on social psychological research that demonstrates that information that becomes available in ""thin slices"" affects superficial judgements. a survey study (n = 644) demonstrated that perceptions of a less affluent area are indeed negatively related to more driving and positively related to more walking, but only for those who do not live there. perceptions of a neighbouring affluent area are positively related to more driving. two experimental studies (n = 245 and n = 91) demonstrated that explicit (but not implicit) attitudes towards a group of young people in an ambiguous social situation are more negative when they are viewed from the perspective of a car user in particular in relation to a pedestrian perspective. these findings suggest that mode use may affect communities by influencing social judgements.

borderline_personality_disorder	objective: to identify psychiatric diagnoses and psychosocial factors associated with intentional male genital self-mutilation (gsm) of specific injury subtypes. methods: a search of medline, embase, psycinfo, pubmed, web of science and cinahl for cases of gsm was conducted until december 2015, based on gsm and related terms. cases were examined for injury subtype, psychiatric diagnosis and psychosocial factors. chi-square analyses were employed to determine differences in frequency of such factors across injury subtypes. results: data were obtained from 173 cases: genital mutilation (n=21), penile amputation (n=62), castration (n=56) and combined amputation/castration (n=34). common psychiatric disorders included schizophrenia spectrum (49%), substance use (18.5%), personality (15.9%) and gender dysphoric disorders (15.3%). chi-square analyses revealed that schizophrenia spectrum disorders occurred significantly more often among auto-amputates as compared with self-castrators or mutilators. gender dysphoria occurred significantly more often among self-castrators than auto-amputates. no significant differences emerged regarding psychosocial factors across gsm subtypes. however, associations were observed between psychosocial factors and psychiatric diagnoses. although altogether not commonly reported, experiential factors were reported in 82% of psychotic individuals. treatment inaccessibility was noted among 71% of gender dysphorics engaging in auto-castration. conclusion: clinicians must consider the diverse range of psychiatric disorders and psychosocial factors underlying gsm.

seasonal_affective_disorder	objective: efficient treatments to phase-advance human circadian rhythms are needed to attenuate circadian misalignment and the associated negative health outcomes that accompany early-morning shift work, early school start times, jet lag, and delayed sleep phase disorder. this study compared three morning bright-light exposure patterns from a single light box (to mimic home treatment) in combination with afternoon melatonin. methods: fifty adults (27 males) aged 25.9 +/- 5.1 years participated. sleep/dark was advanced 1 h/day for three treatment days. participants took 0.5 mg of melatonin 5 h before the baseline bedtime on treatment day 1, and an hour earlier each treatment day. they were exposed to one of three bright-light (similar to 5000 lux) patterns upon waking each morning: four 30-min exposures separated by 30 min of room light (2-h group), four 15-min exposures separated by 45 min of room light (1-h group), and one 30-min exposure (0.5-h group). dim-light melatonin onsets (dlmos) before and after treatment determined the phase advance. results: compared to the 2-h group (phase shift = 2.4 +/- 0.8 h), smaller phase-advance shifts were seen in the 1-h (1.7 +/- 0.7 h) and 0.5-h (1.8 +/- 0.8 h) groups. the 2-h pattern produced the largest phase advance; however, the single 30-min bright-light exposure was as effective as 1 h of bright light spread over 3.25 h, and it produced 75% of the phase shift observed with 2 h of bright light. conclusions: a 30-min morning bright-light exposure with afternoon melatonin is an efficient treatment to phase-advance human circadian rhythms.

prenatal_development	objective. to review the prenatal development of the maxillary sinus under the perspective of the sinus surgery. study design. cross-sectional study. setting. basic embryology laboratory. subjects and methods. morphometry and morphology of the maxillary sinus and its ostium were studied under stereomicroscopy in 100 human fetuses from the 9th to the 37th week. fetuses were obtained from the fetal collection of the school of medicine of the universidad autonoma de nuevo leon. approval was granted by the ethics committee. statistics were applied. results. the maxillary sinus begins its development at the 10th week. on the 37th week, the anterior-posterior diameter has a mean of 4.36 mm; ossification of the medial wall was absent, and the floor was located below the attachment of the inferior turbinate. septa and recesses were temporarily observed. some variations in shape were observed; however, only the oval shape persisted. maxillary sinus hypoplasia was not found, although asymmetry was present in 30% of cases. the ostium was located at the anterior third of the ethmoid infundibulum; its final dimensions were 1.96 mm in length and 0.44 mm in width. the mean length between the ostium to the lamina papyracea and nasolacrimal duct was 1 mm. one case of double maxillary sinus was observed. significant difference between the variables, in accordance with the age, was found (p = .02). conclusion. knowledge of prenatal development of the maxillary sinus improves the perspective of the sinus surgeon and helps the understanding of postnatal anatomy, especially in children.
borderline_personality_disorder	selective attention toward emotional cues and emotion recognition of facial expressions are important aspects of social cognition. stress modulates social cognition through cortisol, which acts on glucocorticoid (gr) and mineralocorticoid receptors (mr) in the brain. we examined the role of mr activation on attentional bias toward emotional cues and on emotion recognition. we included 40 healthy young women and 40 healthy young men (mean age 23.9 +/- 3.3), who either received 0.4 mg of the mr agonist fludrocortisone or placebo. a dot-probe paradigm was used to test for attentional biases toward emotional cues (happy and sad faces). moreover, we used a facial emotion recognition task to investigate the ability to recognize emotional valence (anger and sadness) from facial expression in four graded categories of emotional intensity (20, 30, 40, and 80 %). in the emotional dot-probe task, we found a main effect of treatment and a treatment x valence interaction. post hoc analyses revealed an attentional bias away from sad faces after placebo intake and a shift in selective attention toward sad faces compared to placebo. we found no attentional bias toward happy faces after fludrocortisone or placebo intake. in the facial emotion recognition task, there was no main effect of treatment. mr stimulation seems to be important in modulating quick, automatic emotional processing, i.e., a shift in selective attention toward negative emotional cues. our results confirm and extend previous findings of mr function. however, we did not find an effect of mr stimulation on emotion recognition.
schizophrenia	the objectives of the present study are to compare polymorphisms of the il-1 beta and muc7 genes between patients with burning mouth syndrome (bms) and controls and to investigate relationships between these polymorphisms and clinical characteristics in bms patients. forty female bms patients and 40 gender- and age-matched controls were included. genomic dna was extracted from saliva samples. single-nucleotide polymorphisms of il-1 beta -511 and +3954 and variation in number of tandem repeat (vntr) polymorphism of muc7 were analyzed. relationships between genotypic polymorphism data and clinical characteristics in bms patients were also analyzed. there were no significant differences in the genotypes of il-1 beta -511 and +3954 and of muc7 between the groups. there were no significant differences in symptom duration and intensity of bms patients according to their il-1 beta and muc7 genotypes. the t allele of il-1 beta -511 showed associations with psychometry results in bms patients: paranoid ideation (p = 0.014), global severity index (p = 0.025), and positive symptom total (p = 0.008). the genotypic polymorphisms of il-1 beta -511 and +3954, and of muc7 vntr, had no direct associations with the development of bms. however, the t allele of il-1 beta -511 may increase the risk of bms by increasing psychological asthenia. the genotypic polymorphisms of il-1 beta -511 may increase the risk for the development of bms by increasing psychological asthenia.
eating_disorders	objectiveindividuals with anorexia nervosa (an) restrict fat intake. the geiselman food preference questionnaire-i (c) (fpq) is a validated self-report instrument that yields a fat preference score (>100=high fat preference, <100= low fat preference). the goal of the study was to assess the utility of the fpq in patients with an. specific aims: (1) to examine change in fat preference scores before and after weight restoration in hospitalized patients; and (2) to compare patients' scores before and after weight restoration to scores from healthy participants (hps). methodthe fpq was completed by 88 patients and 115 hps. resultscompared with hps, patients had significantly lower fat preference scores before (74.0332.03 vs. 102.93 +/- 16.89, p<0.001) and after (81.51 +/- 26.89 vs. 102.92 +/- 16.89, p<0.001) weight restoration. fat preference scores increased with weight gain (74.03+32.03 vs. 81.51+26.89, p< 0.01) but did not normalize in an. discussionacutely weight restored patients continue to endorse decreased preference for high fat foods. the fpq may be a useful metric by which to assess improvements in diet during treatment. further study is warranted to validate the fpq against observed food intake in an.

person_perception	two experiments examined how individuals respond to a restriction presented within an approach versus an avoidance frame. in study 1, working on a problem-solving task, participants were initially free to choose their strategy, but for a second task were told to change their strategy. the message to change was embedded in either an approach or avoidance frame. when confronted with an avoidance compared to an approach frame, the participants' reactance toward the request was greater and, in turn, led to impaired performance. the role of reactance as a response to threat to freedom was explicitly examined in study 2, in which participants evaluated a potential change in policy affecting their program of study herein explicitly varying whether a restriction was present or absent and whether the message was embedded in an approach versus avoidance frame. when communicated with an avoidance frame and as a restriction, participants showed the highest resistance in terms of reactance, message agreement and evaluation of the communicator. the difference in agreement with the change was mediated by reactance only when a restriction was present. overall, avoidance goal frames were associated with more resistance to change on different levels of experience (reactance, performance, and person perception). reactance mediated the effect of goal frame on other outcomes only when a restriction was present.
prosocial_behavior	as an entertainment technology, video games are a popular social activity that can allow for multiple players to cooperatively engage on-screen challenges. emerging research has found that when people play together, the resulting teamwork can have beneficial impacts on their prosocial orientations after gameplay - especially when the players are cooperative with one another. the present study wanted to expand the scope of these beneficial interpersonal effects by considering both inter- and intrapersonal factors. in an experimental study (n = 115) we manipulated the difficulty of a game (easy or hard) and the behavior of a confederate teammate (supportive or unsupportive playing style). we found that neither coplayer supportiveness nor game difficulty had an effect on the expectations of a teammate 's prosocial behavior or one 's own prosocial behavior toward the teammate after the game (operationalized as willingness to share small amounts of money with one 's teammate after playing). increased expectations of prosocial behavior from one 's teammate were related to one 's own prosocial behaviors, independent of our manipulations. considering these results, we propose alternative theoretical approaches to understanding complex social interactions in video games. furthermore, we suggest to explore other types of manipulations of game difficulty and cooperation between video game players as well as alternative measures of prosocial behavior.
child_abuse	intimate partner violence (ipv) in sub-saharan africa affects 36% of the population. several african countries rank among the highest globally. in this article, we present evidence on the prevalence, determinants, and impact of ipv across several sub-saharan african countries interpreted against the backdrop of social ecological theory. we also describe prevention or intervention programs tested in different regions of africa, selecting only those programs which were published in a journal outlet and which met a high criteria of implementation and methodology (n = 7). based on our review of the empirical literature, some risk factors for violence documented in western societies are the same in africa, including poverty, drinking, a past history of child abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder, and highly traditional gender role beliefs. low education is also associated with ipv for both women and men. in africa, partner abuse intersects with the hiv pandemic, making violence prevention especially urgent. african programs to prevent ipv are often incorporated with hiv prevention; community building and community engagement are emphasized more in africa than in north america or europe, which invoke more individually focused approaches. some programs we review lowered hiv exposure in women; others contributed to reduced violence perpetration among men. the programs show sufficient promise to recommend replication and dissemination in sub-saharan africa.
social_cognition	few studies have addressed likely gene x gene (ie, epistatic) interactions in mediating risk for schizophrenia. using a preclinical genetic approach, we investigated whether simultaneous disruption of the risk factors neuregulin-1 (nrg1) and disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (disc1) would produce a disease-relevant phenotypic profile different from that observed following disruption to either gene alone. nrg1 heterozygotes exhibited hyperactivity and disruption to prepulse inhibition, both reversed by antipsychotic treatment, and accompanied by reduced striatal dopamine d2 receptor protein expression, impaired social cognition, and altered glutamatergic synaptic protein expression in selected brain areas. single gene disc1 mutants demonstrated a disruption in social cognition and nest-building, altered brain 5-hydroxytryptamine levels and hippocampal erbb4 expression, and decreased cortical expression of the schizophrenia-associated microrna mir-29b. co-disruption of disc1 and nrg1, indicative of epistasis, evoked an impairment in sociability and enhanced self-grooming, accompanied by changes in hypothalamic oxytocin/ vasopressin gene expression. the findings indicate specific behavioral correlates and underlying cellular pathways downstream of main effects of dna variation in the schizophrenia-associated genes nrg1 and disc1.
attention	the transport sector is one of the main sources of greenhouse gases, adding in spain near a quarter of the total national emissions, the majority in road transport. therefore, road contribution to climate change should be mitigated to achieve the proposed goals in the fight against climate change. policies and strategies suggest several preventive mitigation options, but have paid little attention to compensatory mitigation. we have conducted a theoretical case study in a spanish province, segovia, estimating the carbon dioxide emissions in the road network between 2015 and 2050, and analysing different compensation possibilities through conservation agriculture, agroforestry, afforestation and hedgerow plantation. we have calculated carbon sequestration in the reference period and costs per tonne for each option, estimating the budget range of offsetting road carbon emission, and funding possibilities, especially through fuel taxes. the paper demonstrates that offsetting carbon emissions produced by roads in this area is technically possible and highly desirable, unifying carbon sequestration, biodiversity improvement and rural development. the main challenge is funding, which depends largely on the political will and the awareness of the citizens.

depression	we aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine versus ssris and to assess whether ""non-response at week 4"" may be a clinical indicator for combining mirtazapine and ssris for subsequent treatment. one-hundred fifty-four outpatients with mdd were randomized to receive mirtazapine or ssris in step i (4 weeks). non-responders in step i were randomly assigned to either mirtazapine or ssris monotherapy or their combination in step ila while responders in step i continued the same monotherapy in step ilb for 4 weeks. in step i, mirtazapine showed significantly faster improvement as shown by higher remission rate at week 2 with nnt = 8 compared to ssris. somnolence rate was higher in mirtazapine and nausea rate was higher in ssris. in step ila, combination therapy showed a more favorable time course than ssris monotherapy. for subjects taking ssris in step i, combination therapy showed significant better improvement in the hamilton depression rating (ham-d) score both at week 6 (p = 0.006) and 8 (p = 0.013) than ssris monotherapy. about 80% of responders at week 4 could reach remission at week 8 and 64% of non-responders could not reach remission at week 8 for patients who continued monotherapy. when mirtazapine was added on for ssris non-responders at week 4, the remission rate increased by 5% and ham-d score improved by 4 points. while for mirtazapine non responders, ssris add-on was not equally effective. mirtazapine may provide a faster improvement and ""non-response at week 4"" may be indicator to mirtazapine add-on for patients receiving ssris.

attention	gas sensors play a vital role on many aspects in our society, and have gained much progress, propelled by the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. in this regard, metal oxides with heterojunctions have attracted tremendous attention owing to their enhanced gas sensing properties. herein, belt-tooth shape zno/in2o3 nano-heterostructures has been achieved through a chemical vapor deposition process. the gas sensor fabricated from the as-prepared nano-heterostructures exhibits superior sensing performances for c2h2 gas at low operating temperature (90 degrees c). moreover, the au decorated zno/in2o3 nano-heterostructures (au-zno/in2o3) exhibit enhanced c2h2 sensing properties such as higher response, less response time, better selectivity and smaller deviation from the ideal value of power exponent. more significantly, the response to c2h2 gas is maintained well in 30 days, indicating good long-term stability. in addition, both the potential-barrier-controlled carrier transport model combining with the surface depletion model and the unique properties of au are presented to describe the c2h2 gas sensing mechanism of au-zno/in2o3. this study offers an innovative methodology to design novel gas sensing materials and enhance gas sensing performances.

prejudice	this study investigates the relation between age stereotypes and perceived age discrimination. existing evidence for such a relation is notoriously ambiguous with regard to its direction-age stereotypes can predict (perceived) discrimination, but experiencing discrimination may also change views on ageing-which is why we used a dataset with two waves to disentangle the direction of the associations. considering research on the multi-dimensionality of views on ageing and perceived age discrimination, we addressed this question from a domain- and age group-specific perspective. drawing on data from two measurement points of the german ageing survey (deas;t(1):2008, t(2): 2011; age range at t(1): 40-93 years, n = 6092 participants at t (1)), we examined reciprocal relations between views on ageing and perceived age discrimination. cross-lagged models revealed that domain-specific views on ageing predict subsequent changes in perceived discrimination in corresponding domains: negative views on ageing regarding personal competence, physical decline, and social interactions were associated with increases in perceived discrimination in the domains of work, medical care, and social life, respectively. however, we did not find evidence for a reciprocal effect of perceived age discrimination on views on ageing. in sum, results indicate that negative views on ageing act as self-fulfilling prophecies by predisposing people to categorize other people 's behaviour as age discrimination or to act themselves in a way that might elicit ageist behaviour in others.
gender_roles	informal seed saving and farmer-to-farmer seed exchange are dictated by local rules and practices, which in turn can influence the distribution and management of crop biodiversity. such systems are essential components of the livelihoods of small-holder farmers in kenya and for in situ conservation of intraspecific and interspecific diversity. using a mixed methods approach combining interviews, focus groups, and a household survey, we identify that the distribution of crop varieties in tharaka, kenya, has been shaped by both human migrations that have transported seeds and gender roles that have restricted travel and utilization of local indigenous varieties during early migrations. our results suggest that the migrations of the first tharaka people from mbwa 300 years ago have influenced the concentration of local indigenous varieties in the areas of first settlement today. subsequent smaller migrations dictated by men within tharaka through the 1960s, particularly to the northern areas, originally limited the distribution of crops, such as pearl millet (pennisetum glaucum), that are dependent on women for seed selection and processing. this study offers a specific case where the consideration of human migration and gender roles, currently and historically, have influenced the distribution of crop biodiversity, and thus farmer access, to specific types of varieties within a single region and ethnic group.
attention	when two targets are presented within approximately 500 ms of each other in the context of rapid serial visual presentation (rsvp), participants' ability to report the second target is reduced compared to when the targets are presented further apart in time. this phenomenon is known as the attentional blink (ab). the ab is increased in magnitude when the first target is emotionally arousing. emotionally arousing stimuli can also capture attention and create an ab-like effect even when these stimuli are presented as to-be-ignored distractor items in a single-target rsvp task. this phenomenon is known as emotion-induced blindness (eib). the phenomenological similarity in the behavioral results associated with the ab with an emotional t1 and eib suggest that these effects may result from similar underlying mechanisms - a hypothesis that we tested using event-related electrical brain potentials (erps). behavioral results replicated those reported previously, demonstrating an enhanced ab following an emotionally arousing target and a clear eib effect. in both paradigms highly arousing taboo/sexual words resulted in an increased early posterior negativity (epn) component that has been suggested to represent early semantic activation and selection for further processing in working memory. in both paradigms taboo/sexual words also produced an increased late positive potential (lpp) component that has been suggested to represent consolidation of a stimulus in working memory. therefore, erp results provide evidence that the eib and emotion-enhanced ab effects share a common underlying mechanism.
child_abuse	aim: to assess plasma levels of cortisol and cytokines between cocaine-dependent women with and without childhood maltreatment (cm) history during cocaine detoxification treatment. method: we assessed immunoendocrine and clinical parameters of 108 crack cocaine female users during 3 weeks of inpatient detoxification treatment, and 24 healthy women to obtain reference values. women with (cm+, n = 53) or without (cm-, n = 55) cm history were identified answering the childhood trauma questionnaire (ctq). blood samples and clinical assessment were collected before lunch during the first, second and third week post-treatment admission. flow cytometry was used to assess tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4, il-6, il-10, il-17a plasma levels and elisa assay was used to measure plasma cortisol levels. results: at baseline, lower th1 and thl 7-related cytokines levels and higher th2 cytokines levels were observed in crack cocaine users compared with reference values. cytokines levels of cocaine dependents gradually became closer to reference values along detoxification treatment. however, when cm+ and cm groups were compared, increased levels of il-6, il-4 and tnf-alpha across time were observed in cm+ group only. additionally, a th1/th2 immune imbalance was observed within cm+ group, which was negatively correlated with the severity of the crack withdrawal. finally, loading trauma exposure severity, immunoendocrine and clinical parameters in factor analysis, we identified three clusters of observed variables during detoxification: (1) systemic immunity and trauma exposure, (2) pro-inflammatory immunity and (3) behavior conclusion: our results suggest the existence of an immunological phenotype variant associated with cm exposure during crack cocaine detoxification of women.

gender_roles	marriage continues to be a fundamental institution through which sexual and social relations are forged. however, little is known of the ways in which young men think about negotiating their personal and relational identities within the formalised institution of marriage. this article focuses on african male university students. theories of 'power' and 'performativity' are used to understand their projections of masculinity within (future) marriage. the young men 's gender role expectations, and the ways in which they plan to conform to and/or attempt to disrupt traditional patriarchal messages in their marriage goals, are explored. gender power inequities in a patriarchal south africa in which politically and culturally perpetuated social inequality are embedded, have been implicated in the high degree of interpersonal violence. from the projected roles as husbands and fathers that these men hold, many reject violence as a show of power. this is a positive indication of men questioning and reworking gender norms that condone and accept violence against women as normal. their intentions to subvert the masculinities privileged by patriarchal gender discourses, and thereby redefine gender configurations within intimate relations in contemporary society, are viewed against perceived tensions with upholding traditional conceptions of gender roles. men 's resistances are buttressed by the dominant heterosexual norms (which they feel they benefit from), leading to ambiguity in relationships.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the purpose of this study was to determine whether comorbid adolescent criminal and substance involvement (acsi) was more predictive of adult criminal/substance involvement than adolescent criminal or substance involvement alone, and identify potential precursors and mediators of this relationship. using data from 6502 members of the four-wave national longitudinal study of adolescent health (add health), it was found that acsi at wave 2 (ages 13-20) predicted adult criminal and substance involvement at waves 3 (ages 18-26) and 4 (ages 24-32). in addition, antisocial cognition at wave 3 partially mediated the relationship between acsi at wave 2 and criminal/substance involvement at wave 4 and wave 1 school problems correlated with the independent, dependent, and mediating variables. theoretical and practical implications of this study include the role of early school problems in the development of acsi and the significance of antisocial thinking in maintaining this involvement.
seasonal_affective_disorder	background: existing diverse bottom-up estimations of direct costs associated with depression in germany motivated a detailed patient-level analysis of depression-related treatment (drt),-costs (drc) and comorbidity. methods: a large sickness fund 's claims data was used to retrospectively identify patients aged 18-65 years with new-onset depression treatment between january 1st and february 15th 2010, and follow them until december 31st 2010, describe drt, estimate associated drc, and predict drc with a generalised linear model. results: a total of 18,139 patients were analysed. mean direct drc were 783. predictors of drc regarding psychiatric comorbidities were: ""delusion, psychotic disorders and personality disorders"" (drcratio 1.72), ""alcohol/drug addiction"" (1.82), ""abuse of alcohol/drugs"" (1.57). predictors of drc regarding medical comorbidities were: ""rheumatoid arthritis"" (0.77), ""atherosclerosis"" (0.65), ""pregnancy"" (0.66), and ""osteoarthritis"" (1.87). of all patients, 60.8% received their most intense/specialised drt from a general practitioner, a medical specialist (23.7%), a psychotherapist (8.0%), a medical specialist and psychotherapist (2.9%), or in hospital (4.6%). serious psychiatric comorbidity nearly tripled depression related hospitalisation rates. limitations: seasonal affective disorder and missing psychiatric outpatient clinic data must be considered. conclusions: estimated drc are significantly below the assessment of the german national guideline. differing definitions of observation period and cost attribution might explain differing german drc results. signs of hospital psychiatric comorbidity bias indicate overestimation of hospital drc. identified associations of drc with certain medical diseases in older adults warrant further research. up to one quarter of patients with severe depression diagnosis might lack specialist treatment.

person_perception	although aesthetic preferences are known to be important in person perception and can play a significant role in everyday social decisions, the effect of the age of the observer on aesthetic preferences for faces of different ages has not yet been fully investigated. in the present study we investigated whether aesthetic preferences change with aging, with an age-related bias in favoring faces from one 's own age group. in addition, we examined the role of age on both the perceptual qualities and the social attributes of faces that may influence these aesthetic judgements. both younger and older adult observers provided ratings to images of younger, middle-aged and older unfamiliar faces. as well as attractiveness, the rating dimensions included other perceptual (distinctiveness, familiarity) and social (competence, trustworthiness and dominance) factors. the results suggested a consistent aesthetic preference for youthful faces across all ages of the observers but, surprisingly, no evidence for an age-related bias in attractiveness ratings. older adults tended to provide higher ratings of attractiveness, competence and trustworthiness to the unfamiliar faces, consistent with the positivity effect previously reported. we also tested whether perceptual factors such as face familiarity or distinctiveness affected aesthetic ratings. only ratings of familiarity, but not distinctiveness, were positively associated with the attractiveness of the faces. moreover, ratings of familiarity decreased with increasing age of the face. with regard to the social characteristics of the faces, we found that the age of the face negatively correlated with ratings of trustworthiness provided by all observers, but with the competence ratings of older observers only. interestingly, older adults provided higher ratings of perceived competence and trustworthiness to younger than older faces. however, our results also suggest that higher attractiveness ratings, together with older aged faces, led to more positive evaluations of competence. the results are discussed within the context of an age-related decline in the differentiation of faces in memory. our findings have important implications for a better understanding of age-related perceptual factors and cognitive determinants of social interactions with unfamiliar others across the adult lifespan.
attention	green planning is critically important during the design phases of construction projects but continually gets less attention during construction. project owners and planners need to understand how communication influences green implementation. to address a gap in the extant research, this paper presents the evaluation results on how sustainability awareness of field supervision personnel impacts the successful completion of school projects by proving that communicating sustainability goals with them is vital for decision-making during the construction stage of the project. this paper uses data collected from 162 new school construction projects to compare sustainability design goals with their successful incorporation into completed projects. seventy-one project managers and inspectors were surveyed to assess their awareness of key high-performance sustainability requirements that were built into the designs. the responses from these two groups were compared to examine the positive or negative impacts. the analysis results show that early and continuous communication of sustainability design goals with field supervision personnel has a significant impact on whether those goals are realized when the project is turned over to the owner for occupancy. successful implementation of sustainability goals not only provides economic benefits from fully exploiting life-cycle costs, but also holds the promise of providing a healthier working environment.
eating_disorders	pediatric surveillance units (psus) provide a unique model for the study of pediatric eating disorders (eds). australia, britain, and canada have surveillance programs that have generated valuable epidemiological and clinical data on early-onset eating disorders (eoed). the psus represent an important collaborative tool that has helped shape our understanding of eoeds and offers potential to contribute to decisions regarding health resource allocation and public health policy. this paper reviews the role of psus as a unique model to study pediatric eds and its success in translating the knowledge generated by these programs into improving the health of children and adolescents with eds worldwide.
social_cognition	patients with severe mental illnesses manifest substantial deficits in self-assessment of the abilities that impact everyday functioning. this study compares patients with schizophrenia to healthy individuals on their social cognitive performance, their assessment of that performance, and the convergence between performance and indicators of effort in solving tasks. patients with schizophrenia (n = 57) and healthy controls (hc; n = 47) completed the bell-lysaker emotion recognition test (blert), a psychometrically sound assessment of emotion recognition. participants rated their confidence in the accuracy of their responses after each item. participants were instructed to respond as rapidly as possible without sacrificing accuracy; the time to complete each item was recorded. patients with schizophrenia performed less accurately on the blert than hc. both patients and hc were more confident on items that they correctly answered than for items with errors, with patients being less confident overall; there was no significant interaction for confidence between group and accuracy. hc demonstrated a more substantial adjustment of response time to task difficulty by taking considerably longer to solve items that they got wrong, whereas patients showed only a minimal adjustment. these results expand knowledge about both self-assessment of social cognitive performance and the ability to appraise difficulty and adjust effort to social cognitive task demands in patients with schizophrenia.

prenatal_development	neonatal pain is often undertreated. this is based on the assumption that because of the immature nervous system and the lack of the myelinisation preterm and newborn does not feel pain. it is confirmed by a number of articles that the fetus and neonate can experience and respond to painful events. this publication gives a brief overview of the ontogeny of the pain, short-and long-term postnatal consequences, as well as the perception of the possibility of a particularly frail child population: premature infants and neonates, based on animal and human studies.
nonverbal_communication	this study examined parent-offspring communication of disgust-related information and its effects on children 's feelings of disgust and fear towards an animal. mothers were instructed to provide information about a novel animal to their children (n=60) by studying in secrecy either disgusting or neutral attributes that were allegedly characteristic of this animal. first, mothers were instructed to do this in a nonverbal way; then they were also allowed to use verbal utterances. results indicated that nonverbal communication of disgust by the mothers failed to produce any effects on offspring 's subjective evaluations of the animal. however, verbal information transmission did have a differential impact on children 's feelings of disgust and fear. that is, children to whom mothers had verbally communicated about a set of disgusting specimens not only displayed higher levels of disgust (cohen 's d=1.02) but also exhibited higher levels of fear (cohen 's d=.62) towards the novel animal as compared to children to whom mothers had verbally communicated about neutral specimens. the effect on fear was mainly due to the fact that children after the verbal neutral information exhibited a clear decline in fear, whereas children to whom mothers had provided verbal disgust information maintained a similar level of fear towards the animal. the implications of these results for the familial transmission of disgust and fear will be discussed.
eating_disorders	part of circulating ghrelin is bound to immunoglobulins (ig) protecting it from degradation and preserving its functional activity. this review summarizes the data on ghrelin- and desacyl-ghrelin-reactive igg in conditions of altered appetite and energy balance. plasma levels and affinity kinetics of such igg were compared in patients with obesity and anorexia nervosa (an) and in animal models of obesity including ob/ob mice, high-fat diet-induced obese mice, and obese zucker rats as well as in mice after chronic food restriction and activity-based anorexia and in rats with methotrexate-induced anorexia. we show that plasmatic igg in both obese humans and animals are characterized by increased affinity for ghrelin. in contrast, patients with an and anorectic rodents all show lower affinity of ghrelin- and desacyl-ghrelin-reactive igg, respectively, the changes which were not observed in non-anorectic, chronically starved mice. we also show that affinity of ghrelin- reactive igg correlate with plasma levels of ghrelin. these data point to common mechanisms underlying modifications of affinity kinetics properties of ghrelin- reactive igg during chronic alterations of energy balance in humans and rodents and support a functional role of such autoantibodies in ghrelin- mediated regulation of appetite.
antisocial_personality_disorder	this study examined the associations among posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) symptom severity, antisocial personality disorder (aspd) diagnosis, and intimate partner violence (ipv) in a sample of 145 substance abuse treatment-seeking men and women with positive trauma histories; sex was examined as a moderator. aspd diagnosis significantly predicted both verbal and physical aggression; sex moderated the association between aspd diagnosis and physical violence. ptsd symptom severity significantly predicted engaging in verbal, but not physical, aggression. overall, these results suggest that an aspd diagnosis may be an important risk factor for engaging in ipv among women seeking treatment for a substance use disorder.
prejudice	during the last years several studies of construction materials with incorporation of encapsulated phase change material (pcm) have been published. however, the utilization of non-encapsulated pcm is one of the main gaps. the main objective of this work was the study of physical and mechanical properties of cement mortars with incorporation of non-encapsulated pcm. it was possible to conclude that the utilization of non-encapsulated phase change materials can be seen as a good and more economical solution for the energy efficiency of the buildings, without prejudice of the properties.

child_abuse	study objective: to describe the clinical characteristics of patients referred for domestic minor sex trafficking (dmst) to improve identification and intervention. design: retrospective cohort study. setting: the lawrence a. aubin, sr child protection center at hasbro children 's hospital where patients are evaluated by child abuse pediatricians in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. participants: a total of 41 patients younger than the age of 18 years referred for the evaluation of dmst involvement between august 1, 2013 and march 30, 2015. interventions and main outcome measures: we collected demographic, social-environmental, medical, and psychiatric variables from the medical records of patients referred for evaluation who have self-disclosed, been reported with evidence, and/or have histories that place them at high risk for dmst involvement. results: children had frequent contact with medical providers, with 81% seen in the year before referral for dmst. childhood maltreatment and family dysfunction were identified (sexual abuse, 21/37 or 57%; parental substance abuse, 22/37 or 60%) in the 41 patients. children had medical problems (eg, sexually transmitted infection, 13/41 or 32%), psychiatric needs (eg, acute suicidality, 8/41 or 20%; at least 1 previous psychiatric admission, 19/41 or 46%), and substance use (36/41 or 88%). although 26/41 (63%) had runaway and 17/41 (42%) lived in a group home placement, 28/41 (68%) currently lived at home and 29/41 (71%) presented with a parent/guardian or relative. conclusion: children referred for dmst present frequently to physicians and have complex medical and psychiatric needs. medical providers' increased awareness of this health issue would inform victim identification and intervention.
leadership	purpose the aim of this study was to compare differences in current orthopaedic and trauma training programs across europe. methods a questionnaire was sent to the forte (federation of orthopaedic trainees in europe) representatives of 25 different european countries, of which 18 responded. the questionnaire included demographic information and information concerning the structure of the training programs, including duration, selection, and mandatory training requirements. results the number of trainees per specialist varied between countries from a ratio of 1:2 to 1:7. residency was generally five to six years in all the countries. in more than half of the countries selection was interview-based. nearly all countries utilized a logbook. about 80% of the participating countries had a final examination. when assessing the components of training it was found that only one country (the united kingdom) had mandatory minimum requirements for (1) courses, (2) surgical procedures, (3) research and (4) leadership. nearly 40% of the participating countries had only one or none of these four components as a mandatory training requirement. conclusions there are many similarities in training programs, but some important differences remain in overall requirements and final qualification. the main limitation of this study was that we were unable to get data from all the european countries. forte will continue to serve as a forum for sharing best practices with the ultimate goal of improving and harmonizing the level of orthopaedic training across europe. future studies should aim to include further details about training programs as well as to include data from more countries.
gender_roles	this article argues that the status of women continues to be a major issue in the ongoing culture wars over morality politics. while more scholarly and media attention has focused on abortion and gay marriage, since the 1970s the democratic and republican parties have also taken divergent positions on the status of women. data from the american national election studies show that while the general public has become more supportive of equal roles for women, the presidential candidates are perceived to differ considerably on gender roles and positions on abortion. since the 1970s perceptions of candidate differences on gender equity have been strong predictors of the presidential vote, even after controlling for party identification, abortion attitudes, religiosity, retrospective assessments of the economy, and perceived candidate differences on other issues, including abortion.
nonverbal_communication	introduction: family plays an important role in the patient 's environment, the complexity in the intensive care unit services generates situational and emotional crisis in the immediate family which causes anxiety and stress. objective: to evaluate the perception of the relatives of critical patients about the verbal and nonverbal communication, and the emotional support provided by nursing staff during hospitalization in the intensive care unit which belong to a iv social level clinic in cucuta city. materials and methods: a quantitative and descriptive cross sectional study was conducted. the sample consisted of 200 relatives; for data collection was used as instrument. (perception of the relatives of critical patients), according to the nursing work during the situational crisis. results: the perception of the family is favorable by 80% expressing a positive connotation. discussion: relatives of patients consider the work of nursing as humanized behavior care focused on the valuation of the human being as a holistic being, where the care given was characterized by behaviors such as empathy, effective communication, affection and touch. conclusions: to humanize the intensive care unit allows recognizing the family as a central axis for all assistance actions; a collaborative family is a healthy family, which has more tools to fight against despair that generates the income of patients to the critical hospitalization service.
social_cognition	the default mode network (dmn) has been identified reliably during rest, as well as during the performance of tasks such as episodic retrieval and future imagining. it remains unclear why this network is engaged across these seemingly distinct conditions, though many hypotheses have been proposed to account for these effects. prior to generating hypotheses explaining common dmn involvement, the degree of commonality in the dmn across these conditions, within individuals, must be statistically determined to test whether or not the dmn is truly a unitary network, equally engaged across rest, retrieval and future imagining. to provide such a test, we used comparable paradigms (self-directed, uninterrupted thought of equal duration) across the three conditions (rest, retrieval, and future imagining) in a within-participant design. we found lower than expected pattern similarity in dmn functional connectivity across the three conditions. similarity in connectivity accounted for only 40-50% of the total variance. partial least squares (pls) analyses revealed the medial temporal regions of the dmn were preferentially coupled with one another during episodic retrieval and future imagining, whereas the non-medial temporal regions of the dmn (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and temporal pole) were preferentially coupled during rest. these results suggest that dmn connectivity may be more flexible than previously considered. our findings are in line with emerging evidence that the dmn is not a static network engaged commonly across distinct cognitive processes, but is instead a dynamic system, topographically changing in relation to ongoing cognitive demands. hum brain mapp 38:1155-1171, 2017.

eating_disorders	a 17-year-old adolescent boy presented with atypical major depressive episode (mde) without specific focal neurological signs for 6 months. he had a diagnosis of intracranial germinoma, and the atypical mde symptoms subsided after the operation. however, he had a relapse of atypical mde 7 months after the first surgery. his mood and binge eating symptoms subsided, but intractable body weight gain only partially improved after treatment. when encountering manifestations of depression with atypical features, especially with binge eating symptoms in male children and adolescents, with early onset age, no family history, and prolonged depressive episodes, clinicians should consider not only mood disorders including bipolar spectrum disorders but also organic brain lesions such as intracranial germinoma.
borderline_personality_disorder	the political decision to widen the possibilities of combing individual and group psychotherapy could be a step to promote group psychotherapy within the health system. in view of a limited practical significance instead of very good evidence for the efficacy of group treatments, such a promotion would be desirable. the paper summarized studies of the efficacy of group psychotherapy in general as well as compared to individual psychotherapy and the limited evidence available related to the question of combined treatments. in contrast, one can find a wide variety of clinical-theoretical discussions in the literature which - under certain circumstances recommend combined treatments and related structural conditions. if the political decision - instead of some administrative barriers - really will lead to an increased use of combined treatments, accompanying research should be indispensable.
eating_disorders	purpose - referrals to specialist eating disorder (ed) services from the south asian (sa) community are under- represented, despite research suggesting that disordered eating attitudes and behaviours of sa people are similar to the population in general. the purpose of this paper is to identify the reasons for this and sought to inform ways to encourage help-seeking. design/methodology/approach - a qualitative methodology was used to investigate barriers to help-seeking for eds among the sa community. a key informant focus group was conducted with clinicians working within the local specialist ed service (participants n = 16, 12 female, 4 male). six focus groups were conducted with members of the sa community in leicester, uk (participants n = 28, 23 female, 5 male), recruited from a local university, two charities and children, young people and family centres. findings - a number of themes emerged as possible factors for delaying early access to help: lack of knowledge about eds and their potential seriousness, ideals regarding body shape, family living circumstances and the role of food in the community. participants acknowledged stigma among their community associated with mental health issues, including eds and concerns about confidentiality when approaching services, particularly primary care. originality/value - general practitioners and specialist services need to be aware of the potential barriers to help- seeking for eds as early specialist help is recommended for effective treatment. an educational campaign around eds specifically designed with the sa community in mind may improve awareness, reduce stigma and promote early help- seeking.
social_cognition	the objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between social cognition (sc) and cognitive impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwms). a prospective study was conducted in 60 pwms, 30 with relapsing-remitting ms (rrms), 15 with secondary progressive ms (spms) and 15 with primary progressive ms (ppms), and in healthy subjects (hs). all subjects were assessed by the bordeaux social cognition evaluation protocol (pecs-b) (facial emotion recognition, theory of mind, emotional awareness and cognitive and affective alexithymia), by a large neuropsychological battery and by questionnaires (depression and anxiety). 43.3% of pwms were impaired for at least one sc test. the proportion of pwms with at least two impaired sc tests was similar in all three phenotypes (20%). mean scores differed significantly between pwms and hs only for the reading the mind in the eyes test, a test of theory of mind (tom). anova analyses showed an effect of phenotype on emotional awareness scores with lower scores in ppms as compared to rrms. tom performance was significantly correlated (r (2) = 0.56) with executive functions, working memory and episodic memory scores. sc impairment was found in all phenotypes and was more prominent in cognitively impaired ms patients. executive functions, and working and episodic memory performance accounts for approximately 50% of tom performance. emotional awareness is more impaired in progressive ms.
problem-solving	introduction: the intensive care unit (icu) is a dynamic and complex learning environment. the wide range in trainee 's experience, specialty training, fluctuations in patient acuity and volume, limitations in trainee duty hours, and additional responsibilities of the faculty contribute to the challenge in providing a consistent experience with traditional educational strategies. the ""flipped classroom"" is an educational model with the potential to improve the learning environment. in this paradigm, students gain exposure to new material outside class and then use class time to assimilate the knowledge through problem-solving exercises or discussion. the rationale and pedagogical foundations for the flipped classroom are reviewed, practical considerations are discussed, and an example of successful implementation is provided. methods: an education curriculum was devised and evaluated prospectively for teaching point-of-care echocardiography to residents rotating in the surgical icu. results: preintervention and postintervention scores of knowledge, confidence, perceived usefulness, and likelihood of use the skills improved for each module. the quality of the experience was rated highly for each of the sessions. conclusion: the flipped classroom education curriculum has many advantages. this pilot study was well received, and learners showed improvement in all areas evaluated, across several demographic subgroups and self-identified learning styles.
problem-solving	to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing an evidence-based, peer-delivered mental health intervention for somali women in minnesota, and to assess the impact of the intervention on the mental health of those who received the training. in a feasibility study, 11 somali female community health workers were trained to deliver an 8-session cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. each of the trainers recruited 5 participants through community outreach, resulting in 55 participants in the intervention. self-assessed measures of mood were collected from study participants throughout the intervention, and focus groups were conducted. the 55 somali women who participated recorded significant improvements in mood, with self-reported decreases in anxiety and increases in happiness. focus group data showed the intervention was well received, particularly because it was delivered by a fellow community member. participants reported gaining skills in problem solving, stress reduction, and anger management. participants also felt that the intervention helped to address some of the stigma around mental health in their community. delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy by a community health workers offered an acceptable way to build positive mental health in the somali community.
borderline_personality_disorder	this qualitative case study explored one client 's recovery from borderline personality disorder, trauma, and problem gambling. the client attended 18 months of integrative treatment and was followed for 5 years. the study included 106 data points of both client and therapist data. we identified three phases to treatment. first, alliance formation and normalization appeared as mechanisms, and the client experienced dependence. second, working alliance and countertransference appeared as mechanisms, and the client experienced reduced gambling and suicidal ideation. third, external controls and increased opportunity appeared as mechanisms, and ""moving into the world"" was the client experience. the findings give preliminary support to a phase-based constructivist treatment including trauma assessment to normalize self-feelings, countertransference work to support motivation for restraint, and case management principles to support continuity of change efforts.
attention	affective coldness is one of the main features of machiavellianism. recent studies have revealed that machiavellians are emotionally detached and that this ""affective blunting"" is associated with intense feelings, emotional instability, negative emotions, and difficulty in enduring distress. we used brain-imaging techniques to investigate emotion regulation in machiavellianism at a neuropsychological level. we used situations in which participants were required to demonstrate emotional flexibility to explore the controversy surrounding the fact that machiavellianism is associated with both cold-mindedness and emotional instability. participants performed a reappraisal task in which emotionally evocative pictures (from the international affective picture system) were presented in different contexts (negative, positive, and neutral). they were asked to interpret a scenario according to its title and to reinterpret it according to another context created by a new title (e.g., negatively labeled pictures shifted to positively labeled ones). during task performance, machiavellians showed increased activation of brain regions associated with emotion generation-for example, the amygdala and insula. this indicates that machiavellian individuals are able to be involved emotionally in social situations. increased activation in the temporal and parahippocampal regions during reappraisal suggests that machiavellians use semantic-perceptual processes to construct alternative interpretations of the same situation and have enhanced memory for emotional stimuli. furthermore, they seem to possess an intense awareness that leads them to shift attention from external to internal information to detect environmental changes. these cognitive processes may enable them to adjust their behavior quickly. this study supports the flexibility hypothesis of machiavellianism and suggests that machiavellians' approach to emotion regulation is linked to their rational mode of thinking.
eating_disorders	objectified body consciousness (obc) appears to play a crucial role in eating and body-related disturbances, which typically emerge during adolescence. the 24-item obc scale (obcs) has been employed in eating disorder (ed) research and school-based adolescent samples, but evidence for its psychometric proprieties exists only in adult (nonclinical) populations. we evaluated (a) the construct validity and reliability of the 24-item obcs with data collected from 1,259 adolescent girls and boys from the community (study 1) and 643 adolescents of both genders with an ed (study 2) and (b) whether the instrument functions similarly and equivalently measures the underlying construct(s) across gender and samples (i.e., test of measurement equivalence/invariance; study 3). results upheld the three-factor structure and measurement equivalence/invariance of the 24-item obcs across gender and samples. obcs subscale scores were internally consistent and stable over a 4-week period. obcs subscales discriminated community participants with high and low ed symptom levels with fair accuracy, as well as community participants from those with an ed. they were also associated with five constructs closely related to both obc and ed psychopathology. latent mean comparisons across samples and gender were performed and discussed. implications and directions for future research are also outlined.
media_violence	the objective of the current study was to examine possible risk (school-bullying and victimization, exposure to media violence, callous-unemotional traits, impulsivity and narcissism) and protective (family, peer and school social support) factors that might be associated with cyberbullying and cyber-victimization by employing a longitudinal, two-wave design. the sample consisted of 1,416 (50.1% girls) adolescents living in cyprus. the findings suggested cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between school-bullying and cyberbullying and between school-victimization and cyber-victimization. furthermore, callous-unemotional traits were longitudinally related to cyberbullying. media violence exposure was a risk factor leading to both cyberbullying and cyber-victimization, while family social support was a protective factor for both types of adjustment problems. finally, family social support protected adolescents living in single-parent households from being cyber-victimized when their friendships were not supportive.
antisocial_personality_disorder	moral engagement produces strong emotions that help individuals refrain from serious criminal behavior, but what if a youth is unable to experience these emotions. based on a sample of adjudicated delinquents and using a series of structural equation models, we test whether moral disengagement varies by level of psychopathy in relation to criminal onset and assess this stability across gender. psychopathic personality features, moral disengagement, and family stress intermixed in diverse ways depending on the severity of psychopathic personality and gender. at higher levels of psychopathy, the effect of psychopathy on criminal onset was unmediated. however, moral disengagement was found to have mediating effects on criminal onset at lower levels of psychopathy. study findings lend support to the hypothesis that due to core emotional deficits, youth high on psychopathy are unaffected by the mechanisms of moral disengagement. results are discussed in light of theories of morality and psychopathy and the treatment of moral deficits among youthful offenders.
prejudice	utilising a qualitative case study approach, this research study set out to understand discrimination experienced by immigrant students in their interactions with south african students and the prejudice immigrant students expressed against black south african students. findings reveal that the discrimination experienced by immigrant students could be clustered into four broad themes, namely categorisations and prototypes; practised stereotypes; academic and social exclusion; and work ethic. furthermore, statements immigrant students make about south african students seem to fall into two broad categories, namely lack of value for moral integrity and lack of value for education. educating students to value human dignity and to view each other as cosmopolitan citizens of the world could be a way to ensure social cohesion and harmony of future generations to come.
prejudice	a correlational study investigated extended contact as a strategy to improve outgroup attitudes and stereotyping and to prepare children for future contact. additional aims were to investigate when and why the effects of extended contact occur. in particular, intergroup empathy was tested as a mediator and direct contact (i.e. cross-group friendship) as a moderator of extended contact. participants were italian and immigrant elementary school children. results showed that extended contact was associated with improved intergroup empathy, which, in turn, was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, stereotypes and behavioural intentions. these effects were significant only among participants with a low or moderate level of direct contact. the theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
seasonal_affective_disorder	seasonal affective disorder (sad) is a condition of seasonal mood changes characterized by recurrent depression in autumn or winter that spontaneously remits in spring or summer. evidence has suggested that circadian gene variants contribute to the pathogenesis of sad. in this study, we investigated polymorphisms in the clock, arntl, and npas2 genes in relation to seasonal variation in 507 healthy young adults. seasonal variations were assessed with the seasonality pattern assessment questionnaire. the prevalence of sad was 12.0% (winter-type 9.3%, summer-type 2.8%). no significant difference was found between the groups in the genotype distribution of arntl rs2278749 and npas2 rs2305160. the t allele of clock rs1801260 was significantly more frequent in seasonals (sad + subsyndromal sad) compared with non-seasonals (p = 0.020, odds ratio = 1.89, 95% confidence interval = 1.09-3.27). global seasonality score was significantly different among genotypes of clock rs1801260, but not among genotypes of arntl rs2278749 and npas2 rs2305160. however, statistical difference was observed in the body weight and appetite subscales among genotypes of arntl rs2278749 and in the body weight subscale among genotypes of npas2 rs2305160. there was synergistic interaction between clock rs1801260 and arntl rs2278749 on seasonality. to our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal an association between the clock gene and seasonal variations in mood and behavior in the korean population. although we cannot confirm previous findings of an association between sad and the arntl and npas2 genes, these genes may influence seasonal variations through metabolic factors such as body weight and appetite. the interaction of the clock and arntl genes contributes to susceptibility for sad.
eating_disorders	recent research has uncovered many examples of socioeconomic gradients in behavior and psychological states. as yet there is no theoretical consensus on the nature of the causal processes that produce these gradients. here, i present the hunger hypothesis, namely the claim that part of the reason that people of lower socioeconomic position behave and feel as they do is that they are relatively often hungry. the hunger hypothesis applies in particular to impulsivity-hyperactivity, irritability-aggression, anxiety, and persistent narcotic use, all of which have been found to show socioeconomic gradients. i review multiple lines of evidence showing that hunger produces strong increases in these outcomes. i also review the literatures on food insufficiency and food insecurity to show that, within affluent societies, the poor experience a substantial burden of hunger, despite obtaining sufficient or excess calories on average. this leads to the distinctive prediction that hunger is an important mediator of the relationships between socioeconomic variables and the behavioral/psychological outcomes. this approach has a number of far-reaching implications, not least that some behavioral and psychological differences between social groups, though persistent under current economic arrangements, are potentially highly reversible with changes to the distribution of financial resources and food.
nonverbal_communication	previous studies show that close friends improve at lie detection over time. however, is this improvement due to an increase in the ability to decode the feelings of close friends or a change in how close friends communicate their true and deceptive emotions? in a study of 45 pairs of friends, one friend from each pair (the sender) was videotaped showing truthful and faked affect in response to pleasant and unpleasant movie clips. the other friend from each pair (the judge) guessed the true emotions of both the friend and a stranger 1 month and 6 months into the friendship. judges were better at guessing the true emotions of friends than strangers, and this advantage in judging friends increased among close friends over time. surprisingly, improvement over time was due mostly to a change in the sender 's communication, rather than an increase in judges' ability to decode their friends' feelings.
nonverbal_communication	facial expression is an important channel for human nonverbal communication. this paper presents a novel and effective approach to automatic 3d/4d facial expression recognition based on the muscular movement model (mmm). in contrast to most of existing methods, the mmm deals with such an issue in the viewpoint of anatomy. it first automatically segments the input 3d face (frame) by localizing the corresponding points within each muscular region of the reference using iterative closest normal point. a set of features with multiple differential quantities, including coordinate, normal, and shape index values, are then extracted to describe the geometry deformation of each segmented region. meanwhile, we analyze the importance of these muscular areas, and a score level fusion strategy is exploited to optimize their weights by the genetic algorithm in the learning step. the support vector machine and the hidden markov model are finally used to predict the expression label in 3d and 4d, respectively. the experiments are conducted on the bu-3dfe and bu-4dfe databases, and the results achieved clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
gender_roles	empirical analysis of data drawn from the european social survey reveals that-after individual characteristics are controlled for-women engaging in market work and housework have similar life satisfaction levels. complementing the micro-level data from the survey with country-level variables, namely gdp per capita and gender inequality (measured by the world economic forum 's global gender gap index, gggi), we estimate a multilevel regression model to shed light on the contextual factors of the life satisfaction of women in europe. we find that working women 's well-being relative to housewives is greater in countries where the gggi indicates a smaller gender gap, i.e. where women are in a better position in terms of equality with men in the public domains. we interpret this finding to mean that the so-called 'paradox of declining female happiness' is in part due to persistent gender roles which appear to have a larger impact on the well-being of working women.
false_memories	like true memories, false memories are capable of priming answers to insight-based problems. recent research has attempted to extend this paradigm to more advanced problem-solving tasks, including those involving verbal analogical reasoning. however, these experiments are constrained inasmuch as problem solutions could be generated via spreading activation mechanisms (much like false memories themselves) rather than using complex reasoning processes. in three experiments we examined false memory priming of complex analogical reasoning tasks in the absence of simple semantic associations. in experiment 1, we demonstrated the robustness of false memory priming in analogical reasoning when backward associative strength among the problem terms was eliminated. in experiments 2a and 2b, we extended these findings by demonstrating priming on newly created homonym analogies that can only be solved by inhibiting semantic associations within the analogy. overall, the findings of the present experiments provide evidence that the efficacy of false memory priming extends to complex analogical reasoning problems.
media_violence	public discussions about the harmfulness of violent media are often held in the aftermath of violent felony. at the same time, we know little about whether and how experiencing real-life violence impacts the way laypersons perceive and evaluate debates about virtual violence. in study 1, we provided data indicating that both real-life violence and violent video games are perceived as morally threatening by people who regard nonviolence to be an important moral value (i.e., pacifists). in study 2, we hypothesized and found that when pacifists perceive threat from the presence of real-life violence, they are especially susceptible to scientific and political claims indicating that violent video games are harmful. our findings are in line with the value protection model and research on the psychological consequences of threat. implications of the present findings are discussed with regard to a better understanding of the violent video games debate in the general public.
leadership	purpose: to explore what, when, and how lean methods and tools can add value during the programming phase of design through providing additional resources and support to project leadership and the architectural design team. background: this case study-based research took place at one large academic hospital during design efforts of a surgical tower to house 19 operating rooms (ors) and support spaces including pre- and postop, central processing and distribution, and materials management. surgical services project leadership asked for support from lean practitioners during the design process. methods: lean exploration loops (lels) were conducted to generate evidence to support stakeholders, as they made important decisions about the new building design. the analyses conducted during lels were primarily focused on the relative advantages of a large footprint with few floors or a smaller footprint with more floors and support spaces not collocated adjacent to ors on the same floor. results: lels resulted in quantifications of key operational and design features (e.g., design preferences of employees and patients, horizontal distance travel, and elevator utilization studies), which in turn complemented the architectural design process and created an opportunities to gain buy-in and consensus from stakeholders through their active participation in many of the analyses. conclusions: we found lean tools and methods to be of most value during programming phase when focused on the high-level operational and design issues to help establish buy-in and consensus among stakeholders, while acknowledging that there is often not enough design detail to perform accurate analysis.
borderline_personality_disorder	the mineralocorticoid receptor (mr) is highly expressed in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and is involved in social cognition. we recently found that pharmacological stimulation of the mr enhances emotional empathy but does not affect cognitive empathy. in the current study, we examined whether blockade of the mr impairs empathy in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd) and healthy individuals. in a placebo-controlled study, we randomized 28 patients with mdd without psychotropic medication and 43 healthy individuals to either placebo or 300 mg spironolactone, a mr antagonist. subsequently, all participants underwent two tests of social cognition, the multifaceted empathy test (met) and the movie for the assessment of social cognition (masc), measuring cognitive and emotional facets of empathy. in the met, we found no significant main effect of treatment or main effect of group for cognitive empathy but a highly significant treatment by group interaction (p < 0.01). patients had higher cognitive empathy scores compared to controls in the placebo condition but not after spironolactone. furthermore, in the spironolactone condition reduced cognitive empathy was seen in mdd patients but not in controls. emotional empathy was not affected by mr blockade. in the masc, no effect of spironolactone could be revealed. depressed patients appear to exhibit greater cognitive empathy compared to healthy individuals. blockade of mr reduced cognitive empathy in mdd patients to the level of healthy individuals. future studies should further clarify the impact of mr functioning on different domains of social cognition in psychiatric patients.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the current study provides additional information about the nomological networks of the personality dimensions associated with the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy - boldness, meanness, and disinhibition (patrick et al. 2009). all analyses were based on a sample of college students (n = 633 to 637; 50 % women). we evaluated correlations between measures of the triarchic constructs and measures of the facets and domains of the five-factor model (ffm). we also evaluated associations between triarchic constructs and measures of self-esteem, narcissism, aggression and antisocial behavior and tested whether the triarchic measures increment measures of the ffm for predicting these variables. we replicated and extended previous studies concerning the correlates of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. we also found evidence that measures of the triarchic dimensions incremented measures of the ffm, especially when considering self-reported antisocial behavior.
gender_roles	the article analyses party documents and rhetoric from kotleba 's people 's party of our slovakia (lsns) and demonstrates that it has a culturally conservative, instrumental and paternalist- populist attitude to gender issues. the thematic analysis indicates that the lsns not only seeks to promote traditional gender roles and the exclusion of women from public space but also uses quasi-feminist arguments. these, for instance, call on women to engage more in public life but only in support of its patriarchal agenda. our findings show that gender related issues feature only peripherally in lsns rhetoric, however they are used strategically as a theme that cuts across the party ideology, forming not its core but being purposely used in relation to the party 's main priorities. lsns uses gender related themes as part of its political arsenal for (1) increasing the party 's support amongst women and (2) seeking to involve more women in the party 's activities to increase its acceptability among voters.
child_abuse	in korea, an amendment to the child welfare act was made in 2008 that required a national study estimating the occurrence rate of child abuse and neglect every 5 years. the present study reports the major findings of the first national study conducted after the 2008 amendment. the aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of child physical and psychological maltreatment (cppm) in korea and to explore the basic characteristics associated with such incidents. household surveys were administered to caregivers and focal children who were school age and older. we estimated the prevalence of cppm using the parent-child conflict tactic scale, which was developed by straus et al. (1998). the occurrence rate of cppm was 25.3 % in korea, with instances differing by household income, poverty status, and size of the region. children who experienced physical and psychological maltreatment were more likely to witness the abuse of their siblings and domestic violence. the implications of the findings are discussed and recommendations made for further research.
attention	inadequate regulation of spatial development is at the origin of the current global crisis and increases, in years of crisis, the unequal distribution of wealth. the importance of the related risks for democracy draw attention to the systems of spatial governance and planning, through which states regulate spatial development. in europe, the countries most affected by the unequal effects of the crisis have spatial planning systems that are traditionally based on the preventive assignation of rights for land use and development through a plan. the systems of other countries had established beforehand that new rights for land use and for spatial development are rather assigned only after the public control of development projects and their distributional effects. despite the evidence that some models can operate better than others in ensuring public government of spatial development, the improvement of spatial planning systems is, however, limited by their complex nature of institutional technologies'. especially in a context of crisis, planners are responsible for the increase in public awareness concerning the role of spatial governance in economic and social life.
leadership	based on social cognitive theory and leadership theory, the current study tests a theoretical model linking supervisory styles (i.e. supportive and directive) with graduate student creativity via psychological cognitive factors (specifically, creative self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation). results from a sample of 216 graduate students of 1 university in china indicate that both creative self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation completely mediate the influences of supportive supervisory style and directive supervisory style on graduate student creativity. interestingly, the results indicate a positive influence of directive supervisory style on graduate student creativity, which is inconsistent with the literature and our own original hypothesis. our findings verify that creative self-efficacy has an indirect effect on graduate student creativity by influencing intrinsic motivation. we discuss the implications of these findings for both theory and practice.
borderline_personality_disorder	we describe 2 studies designed to evaluate scores on the multidimensional shame-related response inventory-21 (msri-21), a recently developed instrument that measures affective and behavioral responses to shame. the inventory assesses shame-related responses in 3 categories: negative self-evaluation, fear of social consequences, and maladaptive behavior tendency. for study 1, (n = 743) undergraduates completed the msri-21. confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the msri-21 3-factor structure. latent variable modeling of coefficient-alpha provided strong evidence for the internal consistency of scores on each scale. in study 2, (n = 540) undergraduates completed the instrument along with 5 concurrent measures chosen for clinical significance. achievement of factorial invariance supported the use of msri-21 scale scores to make valid mean comparisons across gender. in addition, msri-21 scale scores were associated as expected with scores on measures of self-harm, suicide, and other risk factors. taken together, results of 2 studies support the internal consistency reliability, factorial validity, factorial invariance, and convergent validity of scores on the msri-21. further work is needed to assess the temporal stability of the msri-21 scale scores, invariance across clinical status and other groupings, item-level measurement properties, and viability in highly symptomatic samples.
false_memories	previous studies have reported that young participants typically date events that they remember, but no longer believe they experienced, to the period of childhood. the present study investigated whether participants aged between 40 and 79 years dated events related to relinquished memories to the period of childhood, as do younger people, or whether they dated such events to a period later in life. the study also compared believed and nonbelieved memories with respect to memory perspective (1st vs 3rd person perspective). results indicated that the majority of middle-aged and older people dated nonbelieved memories to the period of childhood (median age = 8 years). no correlation was found between the participants' current age and their age at the time the nonbelieved event occurred. in addition, results showed that believed memories were more likely to be retrieved from a 1st person perspective than were nonbelieved memories.

depression	undocumented immigrant young adults growing up in the united states face significant challenges. for those qualified, the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program 's protections may alleviate stressors, with implications for their mental health and wellbeing (mhwb). we conducted nine focus groups with 61 daca-eligible latinos (ages 18-31) in california to investigate their health needs. participants reported mhwb as their greatest health concern and viewed daca as beneficial through increasing access to opportunities and promoting belonging and peer support. participants found that daca also introduced unanticipated challenges, including greater adult responsibilities and a new precarious identity. thus, immigration policies such as daca may influence undocumented young adults' mhwb in expected and unexpected ways. research into the impacts of policy changes on young immigrants' mhwb can guide stakeholders to better address this population 's health needs. mhwb implications include the need to reduce fear of deportation and increase access to services.
nonverbal_communication	this research details the development of the ""comfort with interpersonal touch"" (cit) scale designed to measure individual differences in interpersonal touch tendencies and preferences. the cit construct is defined as the degree to which an individual is comfortable with intentional interpersonal touch from or to another person. the scale incorporates the distinction between initiating touch, which is the act of touching someone else, and receiving touch, which is the act of being touched by someone else. investigation of this construct includes scale development, measure purification, and validation. we situate cit-initiating and cit-receiving within an approach avoidance framework and demonstrate that comfort with initiating touch is more related to approach tendencies such as assertiveness while comfort with receiving touch is more related to avoidant tendencies such as avoiding crowded spaces. while previous research generally finds positive effects of interpersonal touch, we find that these effects, at least in part, depend on an individual 's comfort with interpersonal touch. we discuss theoretical and managerial implications as well as future research opportunities using the cit scale.

schizophrenia	background: mental illness is a disease that affects millions of people every year. it not only causes stress to the mentally ill patients, but also for the family members who provide them the care. the family caregivers, therefore need some form of coping strategies in dealing with their mentally ill family members.aims: this qualitative study aims at identifying and analysing the coping strategies adopted by the family caregivers in dealing with their mentally ill family members.method: a total of 15 family caregivers from the state of kedah, malaysia participated in the face-to-face semi structured interview.results: the study findings identified an array of coping strategies used by the family caregivers, including religious coping, emotional coping, acceptance, becoming engaged in leisure activities, and the use of traditional healing to help them cope with their mentally ill members.suggestions and conclusions: study suggests that the family caregivers should engage themselves in social support groups to learn about and obtain the positive coping strategies used by other caregivers who have similar experiences in caring for the mentally ill. study also suggests that they should get appropriate training from the mental health professionals in order to enhance the caregivers' coping skills.
false_memories	the source-monitoring paradigm suggests that dreams could be an important source of naturally occurring false memories. however, the malleability of memories for dreams remains to be investigated. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of suggestions on subsequent dream recall. immediate dream recall collected in a sleep laboratory was compared with long-term recall 1 to 2 weeks later. standard recall was also compared with hypnotic recall. suggested elements were reported by 15% of the 26 participants. the hypnotic condition showed no differential effect. it was also found that between 3% and 7% of the dreams reported in long-term recall were probably naturally occurring false memories of dreams. these findings suggest that situations of misinformation can easily elicit false memories of specific dreams.
prejudice	there is evidence of health disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual populations. although the focus of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health research has been human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infection among men who have sex with men, there are health disparities among sexual minority women. using the minority stress framework, these disparities may in part be caused by individual prejudice, social stigma, and discrimination. to ensure equitable health for all, there is urgent need for targeted culturally sensitive health promotion, cultural sensitivity training for health care providers, and intervention-focused research.
prejudice	this article explores the relationship between racial prejudice towards blacks and the black-white self-employment rate gap and provides the first direct empirical evidence that racial prejudice negatively impacts black self-employment, particularly in high start-up cost industries. to perform this analysis, i construct a measure of prejudicial attitudes using responses from the general social survey and estimate the relationship between self-employment and this index using the american community survey. i find that an amount of prejudice equal to the difference in least and most prejudiced census divisions increases the black-white self-employment rate gap in high start-up cost industries by 10.4-16.8%, depending upon whether parental self-employment is controlled for, and represents the entire impact of racial prejudice on the black-white selfemployment rate gap. additionally, racial prejudice widens the black-white self-employment income gap by between 6.4% and 8.2% in my full specification, dependent upon how income is measured. evidence indicates that racial prejudice is causing blacks difficulty in financing their businesses. the results presented are robust to various modelling and data assumptions.
child_abuse	recognition of physical child abuse is imperative for ensuring children 's safety. screening tools (st) may increase identification of physical abuse; however, the extent of their use is unknown. this study assessed use of sts for physical abuse in children 's hospitals and determined attitudes regarding sts. a web-based survey was sent to child abuse program contacts at 103 children 's hospitals. the survey assessed institutional use of a st for physical abuse and characteristics of the st used. respondents were asked to identify benefits and liabilities of sts used or barriers to st use. seventy-two respondents (70 %) completed the survey; most (64 %) were child abuse pediatricians. nine (13 %) respondents reported using a st for physical abuse; sts varied in length, population, administration, and outcomes of a positive screen. most respondents (86 %) using a st felt that it increased detection of abuse. barriers noted included lack of time for development and provider completion of a st. while few respondents endorsed use of a st for physical abuse, most believed that it increased detection of abuse. future research should focus on development of a brief, uniform st for physical abuse which may increase detection in at-risk children.
problem-solving	much has been written about the promise and peril of technology in education. this paper presents an empirical study that explores how technology can play a pivotal role in student learning and how teaching staff can adopt innovative technology-based approaches in the creation of interactive online problem-based learning (pbl) resources, allowing students to interact with authentic, complex and realistic problems designed within a framework of pbl methodology. the application of pbl approaches within authentic situated learning contexts has been shown in the literature to deepen student learning outcomes. this paper demonstrates how innovative authoring tools that promote problem-solving skills and the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge were introduced as part of a university-wide elearning strategic blueprint. overall, student feedback is very positive, with many students commenting on the realism, and even the enjoyment of the online problem simulations. however, major challenges were met in the implementation requiring several support activities across the organisation.
prejudice	there is a rich literature on the nature of mental health-related stigma and the processes by which it severely affects the life chances of people with mental health problems. however, applying this knowledge to deliver and evaluate interventions to reduce discrimination and stigma in a lasting way is a complex and long-term challenge. we conducted a narrative synthesis of systematic reviews published since 2012, and supplemented this with papers published subsequently as examples of more recent work. there is evidence for small to moderate positive impacts of both mass media campaigns and interventions for target groups in terms of stigma-related knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviour in terms of desire for contact. however, the limited evidence from longer follow-up times suggests that it is not clear whether short-term contact interventions have a lasting impact. the risk that short-term interventions may only have a short-term impact suggests a need to study longer term interventions and to use interim process and outcome data to improve interventions along the way. there is scope for more thorough application of intergroup contact theory whenever contact is used and of evidence-based teaching and assessment methods when skills training is used for target groups.
attention	neuroleptic drug molindone hydrochloride is a dopamine d2/d5 receptor antagonist and it is in late stage development for the treatment of impulsive aggression in children and adolescents who have attention deficient/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). this new indication for this drug would expand the target population to include younger patients, and therefore, toxicity assessments in juvenile animals were undertaken in order to determine susceptibility differences, if any, between this age group and the adult rats. adult rats were administered molindone by oral gavage for 13 weeks at dose levels of 0, 5, 20, or 60mg/kg-bw/day. juvenile rats were dosed for 8 weeks by oral gavage at dose levels of 0, 5, 25, 50, or 75mg/kg-bw/day. standard toxicological assessments were made using relevant study designs in consultation with fda. treatment-related elevation in serum cholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in glucose levels were observed in both the age groups. organ weight changes included increases in liver, adrenal gland and seminal vesicles/prostate weights. decreases in uterine weights were also observed in adult females exposed to the top two doses with sufficient exposure. in juveniles, sexual maturity parameters secondary to decreased body weights were observed, but, were reversed. in conclusion, the adverse effects noted in reproductive tissues of adults were attributed to hyperprolactinemia and these changes were not considered to be relevant to humans due to species differences in hormonal regulation of reproduction. on the whole, there were no remarkable differences in the toxicity profile of the drug between the two age groups.
person_perception	bipolar disorder is fundamentally a disorder of emotion regulation, and associated with explicit processing biases for socially relevant emotional information in human faces. less is known, however, about whether implicit processing of this type of emotional information directly influences social perception. we thus investigated group-related differences in the influence of unconscious emotional processing on conscious person perception judgments using a continuous flash suppression task among 22 individuals with remitted bipolar i disorder (bd; age(m)=30.82, age(sd)= 7.04; 68.2% female) compared with 22 healthy adults (ctl; age(m)=20.86, age(sd)=9.91; 72.2% female). across both groups, participants rated neutral faces as more trustworthy, warm, and competent when paired with unseen happy faces as compared to unseen angry and neutral faces; participants rated neutral faces as less trustworthy, warm, and competent when paired with unseen angry as compared to neutral faces. these findings suggest that emotion-related disturbances are not explained by early automatic processing stages, and that activity in the dorsal visual stream underlying implicit emotion processing is intact in bipolar disorder. implications for understanding the etiology of emotion disturbance in bd are discussed.

false_memories	belief in paranormal psychic phenomena is widespread in the united states, with over a third of the population believing in extrasensory perception (esp). why do some people believe, while others are skeptical? according to the cognitive differences hypothesis, individual differences in the way people process information about the world can contribute to the creation of psychic beliefs, such as differences in memory accuracy (e.g., selectively remembering a fortune teller 's correct predictions) or analytical thinking (e.g., relying on intuition rather than scrutinizing evidence). while this hypothesis is prevalent in the literature, few have attempted to empirically test it. here, we provided the most comprehensive test of the cognitive differences hypothesis to date. in 3 studies, we used online screening to recruit groups of strong believers and strong skeptics, matched on key demographics (age, sex, and years of education). these groups were then tested in laboratory and online settings using multiple cognitive tasks and other measures. our cognitive testing showed that there were no consistent group differences on tasks of episodic memory distortion, autobiographical memory distortion, or working memory capacity, but skeptics consistently outperformed believers on several tasks tapping analytical or logical thinking as well as vocabulary. these findings demonstrate cognitive similarities and differences between these groups and suggest that differences in analytical thinking and conceptual knowledge might contribute to the development of psychic beliefs. we also found that psychic belief was associated with greater life satisfaction, demonstrating benefits associated with psychic beliefs and highlighting the role of both cognitive and noncognitive factors in understanding these individual differences.
prenatal_development	respiratory chemoreceptors are neurons that detect pco2, po2, and/or ph in body fluids and provide sensory feedback for the control of breathing. they play a critical role in coupling pulmonary ventilation to metabolic demand in endothermic vertebrates. during birth in mammals and hatching in birds, the state change from placental or chorioallantoic gas exchange to pulmonary respiration makes acute demands on the neonatal lungs and ventilatory control system, including the respiratory chemoreceptors. here we review the literature on prenatal development of carotid body chemoreceptors, central chemoreceptors, and airway chemoreceptors, with emphasis on the histology, histochemistry, and neurophysiology of chemosensory cells or their afferents, and their physiological genomics if known. in general, respiratory chemoreceptors develop prenatally and are functional but immature at birth or hatching. each type of respiratory chemoreceptor has a unique prenatal developmental time course, and all studied to date require a period of postnatal maturation to express the full adult response.

prejudice	background: freedom from discrimination is one of the key principles in a human rights-based approach to maternal and newborn health. objective: to review the published evidence on discrimination against romani women in maternity care in europe, and on interventions to address this. search strategy: a systematic search of eight electronic databases was undertaken in 2015 using the terms ""roma"" and ""maternity care"". a broad search for grey literature included the websites of relevant agencies. data extraction and synthesis: standardised data extraction tables were utilised, quality was formally assessed and a line of argument synthesis was developed and tested against the data from the grey literature. results: nine hundred papers were identified; three qualitative studies and seven sources of grey literature met the review criteria. these revealed that many romani women encounter barriers to accessing maternity care. even when they are able to access care, they can experience discriminatory mistreatment on the basis of their ethnicity, economic status, place of residence or language. the grey literature revealed some health professionals held underlying negative beliefs about romani women. there were no published research studies examining the effectiveness of interventions to address discrimination against romani women and their infants in europe. the roma health mediation programme is a promising intervention identified in the grey literature. conclusions: there is evidence of discrimination against romani women in maternity care in europe. interventions to address discrimination against childbearing romani women and underlying health provider prejudice are urgently needed, alongside analysis of factors predicting the success or failure of such initiatives.
antisocial_personality_disorder	although antisocial personality disorder (aspd) has represented the current operationalization of psychopathy since dsm-iii, it has long been recognized as failing to capture the full range of the construct. the current study examined the degree to which boldness, a trait domain within the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy that captures fearlessness, dominance and low stress reactivity, represents a distinct difference between psychopathy and aspd. utilizing a sample of 152 male prison inmates, the current study examined the extent to which boldness, relative to meanness and disinhibition (indexed by the triarchic psychopathy measure [tripm]), accounted for incremental variance beyond aspd symptom counts (indexed by the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv axis ii disorders aspd module) in predicting psychopathy (as indexed by psychopathy checklist-revised [pcl-r] total, factor and facets scores). tripm boldness added to the incremental prediction of pcl-r factor 1(interpersonal/affective) and facet 1 (interpersonal) scores above and beyond aspd scores.
prosocial_behavior	does ""liking"" a brand on facebook cause a person to view it more favorably? or is ""liking"" simply a symptom of being fond of a brand? the authors disentangle these possibilities and find evidence for the latter: brand attitudes and purchasing are predicted by consumers' preexisting fondness for brands, and these are the same regardless of when and whether consumers ""like"" brands on social media. in addition, we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether ""liking"" brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably. when consumers see that a friend has ""liked"" a brand, they are less likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more meaningful social endorsement. taken together, five experiments and two meta-analyses (n >14,000) suggest that turning ""liking"" into improved brand attitudes and increased purchasing by consumers and their friends may require more than just the click of a button.
prejudice	the study sought to identify the influential factors of stereotypes, social distance, and prejudice toward racial/ethnic minorities in the united states. we used data from the american general social survey (gss) of 2012, and analysed the data of 4 820 individuals (3 700 caucasians, 722 african americans, and 398 others; males = 44.2%, females = 55.8%). data were analysed using the spss 18.0 statistics program. in order to test for differences in racial prejudice by demographic characteristics by stereotyping and social distancing, we utilised variance and regression analyses procedures. results suggest that stereotypes and social distance effects on prejudice toward african americans vary according to ethnicity, gender, age, education, and income. specifically, older and less-educated white males were more prejudiced toward african americans than were individuals from other sociodemographic groupings. there was a direct relationship between the holding of stereotypical views and social distance, in that those who showed higher levels of stereotyping maintained a greater social distance from african americans and showed greater implicit prejudice toward them. racism toward african americans remains a major social concern in the usa, and is largely influenced by sociodemographic factors.
prejudice	research has shown that jurors are heavily influenced by secondary confessions, and that they may attribute the informant 's motives to good character rather than to an incentive. this study investigated the role of race in this context by manipulating both defendant and informant race (black/white), informant type (jailhouse/civic duty), and whether the informant received an incentive to testify. participants read a trial transcript and provided a verdict, then answered questions about the informant 's reason for testifying (i.e. attributions). we observed that in the absence of informant testimony, participants convicted the white defendant more often. we also discovered an effect of incentive on verdicts when the defendant was white, such that participants voted guilty less often when the informant received an incentive; there was no effect of incentive on verdict when the defendant was black. informant race, defendant race, and incentive showed a combined effect on verdict, such that participants were particularly suspicious (i.e. less likely to vote guilty) when a black informant received an incentive for testifying against a black defendant. there were no effects of race on attributions. this research sheds light on extralegal factors that can prevent jurors from considering the role of incentives in secondary confessions.
eating_disorders	we examine differential effects of mental pain and suicidal tendencies in female victims who have been sexually and physically abused, hypothesizing that sexual abuse victims report more mental pain and suicidal tendencies than physical abuse victims. a group of 98 women completed questionnaires that measured mental pain, suicidal tendencies and thoughts, and demographic details. sexual abuse victims suffered more mental pain than physical abuse victims while the physical abuse victims demonstrated more repulsion by life than sexual abuse victims. only sexual abuse victims demonstrated less attraction to life and only physical abuse victims showed more attraction to death.
nonverbal_communication	what cognitive processes specify understanding of humans' behavior in communicative situations? 51 healthy controls and 50 schizophrenia patients were presented with social ""silent"" video clips and then they performed flicker task and predicted characters' behavior. during the experiment eye movements were recorded. observers, who have made successful predictions, evaluated the characters' actions, specified how they categorized the objects and events, and then profiled the objects' features, on which just these categorizations were based. information about these features remained in working memory and directed a communicative situation 's perception. observers noticed the events, relevant to the viewpoints of the characters, and understood their gazes, gestures and actions. those, who have made unsuccessful predictions, advanced hypotheses about how the characters categorized the objects and events, but they did not profile the objects' features, on which categorizations were based. they demonstrated ""blindness"" to the events, relevant to the viewpoints of the characters, and did not understand a coherence of their actions.
borderline_personality_disorder	recognition of the limitations of the current categorical diagnostic system and increased understanding of commonalities across clinical problems associated with negative emotion, including anxiety and depression, has led to the development of transdiagnostic psychological interventions. this new approach holds promise in shifting our emphasis from diagnostic categories to treating core construct that cut across disorders. this paper identifies some of the similarities and differences across various cognitive-behavioral transdiagnostic protocols and key challenges in assessment and case conceptualization for clinicians wishing to use this approach. some key needs in the research literature that would be particularly helpful to clinicians are also identified.

depression	recent theoretical models suggest that repetitive negative thinking might be a key mechanism explaining the negative effects of maternal psychopathology on mother-infant relations. while an emerging body of research largely supports this idea, the relative importance of differences in the trajectory of repetitive negative thinking during and after pregnancy for mother-infant bonding as well as maternal depressive symptoms is currently unknown. therefore, we investigated associations between the course of maternal repetitive negative thinking during pregnancy and after birth and mother-infant-bonding and maternal depressive symptoms in a longitudinal study. the overall level of repetitive negative thinking was a significant predictor of mother-infant bonding, maternal anxiety and rejection in dealing with her infant four months after birth. furthermore, differences in the trajectory of repetitive negative thinking predicted bonding, but not anxiety or rejection. the overall levels of repetitive negative thinking as well as the differences in the trajectory of repetitive negative thinking were significant predictors of maternal depressive symptoms. these findings indicate that changes of repetitive negative thinking during and after pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.
media_violence	different criminological theories assume that religiosity protects against violent behavior. up to now, this assumption is tested empirically almost exclusively for the christian religiosity. the study presented here questions whether such a relationship between religiosity and violent behavior could be found for muslims, likewise. using a german-wide representative school survey of 16,545 male students in the ninth grade, who belong either to a christian or an islamic denomination, it can be revealed that only for christians a higher religiosity correlates with a lower rate of violent behavior. this influence of christian religiosity can be explained by mainly control theory variables. for muslims, there is no significant correlation between religiosity and violent behavior in a bivariate analysis. a multivariate analysis, however, reveals a suppression effect: controlling for alcohol consumption, muslim religiosity increases violent behavior. in addition, high religious muslims agree more often to norms of masculinity and consume more often media violence, which are risk factors of violent behavior. accordingly, it can be concluded that religiosity is not a violence-protecting factor in general; instead, a more differentiated view for separate religious groups is necessary.
prejudice	despite international efforts, stigma is still a significant issue for people living with hiv/aids (plwha). this paper explores the stigma encountered in health interactions, focusing on strategies plwha use to manage and reduce it. it is hoped that our findings will improve future interactions by contributing towards a more understanding practitioner-patient relationship. the data have been drawn from a small qualitative study conducted in christchurch, new zealand. fourteen participants took part in semi-structured face-to-face interviews in 2013 and 11 of these participants were then interviewed again in 2014. codes and themes were developed through inductive thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. our findings identified that whilst the majority of participants had positive experiences, nearly all had faced stigma during their health interactions. most of these encounters were due to healthcare workers holding exaggerated fears of transmission or not maintaining confidentiality and privacy. the main way that participants managed this stigma was through seeking control in their interactions. this overarching strategy could be further divided into three key themes: selective disclosure of their hiv status, self-advocacy and developing their hiv knowledge. we discuss these findings in the context of the current literature, comparing our results to strategies that have been previously identified in social settings.
problem-solving	the long-term goal of artificial intelligence (ai) is to make machines learn and think like human beings. due to the high levels of uncertainty and vulnerability in human life and the open-ended nature of problems that humans are facing, no matter how intelligent machines are, they are unable to completely replace humans. therefore, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive capabilities or human-like cognitive models into ai systems to develop a new form of ai, that is, hybrid-augmented intelligence. this form of ai or machine intelligence is a feasible and important developing model. hybrid-augmented intelligence can be divided into two basic models: one is human-in-the-loop augmented intelligence with human-computer collaboration, and the other is cognitive computing based augmented intelligence, in which a cognitive model is embedded in the machine learning system. this survey describes a basic framework for human-computer collaborative hybrid-augmented intelligence, and the basic elements of hybrid-augmented intelligence based on cognitive computing. these elements include intuitive reasoning, causal models, evolution of memory and knowledge, especially the role and basic principles of intuitive reasoning for complex problem solving, and the cognitive learning framework for visual scene understanding based on memory and reasoning. several typical applications of hybrid-augmented intelligence in related fields are given.
false_memories	the current study sought to examine the relative contributions of encoding and retrieval processes in accessing contextual information in the absence of item memory using an extralist cuing procedure in which the retrieval cues used to query memory for contextual information were related to the target item but never actually studied. in experiments 1 and 2, participants studied 1 category member (e. g., onion) from a variety of different categories and at test were presented with an unstudied category label (e. g., vegetable) to probe memory for item and source information. in experiments 3 and 4, 1 member of unidirectional (e. g., credit or card) or bidirectional (e. g., salt or pepper) associates was studied, whereas the other unstudied member served as a test probe. when recall failed, source information was accessible only when items were processed deeply during encoding (experiments 1 and 2) and when there was strong forward associative strength between the retrieval cue and target (experiments 3 and 4). these findings suggest that a retrieval probe diagnostic of semantically related item information reinstantiates information bound in memory during encoding that results in reactivation of associated contextual information, contingent upon sufficient learning of the item itself and the association between the item and its context information.
leadership	drawing on a multilevel model of motivation in work groups and a functionalist perspective of citizenship and socially responsible behaviors, we developed and tested a multilevel model of voluntary workplace green behavior that explicates some of the reasons why employees voluntarily engage in green behavior at work. for a sample of 325 office workers organized into 80 work groups in three firms, we found that conscientiousness and moral reflectiveness were associated with the voluntary workplace green behavior of group leaders and individual group members. furthermore, we found a direct relationship between leader green behavior and the green behavior of individual subordinates as well as an indirect relationship mediated by green advocacy within work groups. our theory and findings shed new light on the psychological and social conditions and processes that shape voluntary workplace green behavior in organizational settings and suggest implications for organizations striving to improve their social responsibility and environmental sustainability.
depression	in this study, drug target was identified using kegg database and network analysis through cytoscape software. designed series of novel benzimidazoles were taken along with reference standard flibanserin for insilico modeling. the novel 4-(1h-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-n-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxobutanamide (3a-j) analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their antidepressant activity. reaction of 4-(1h-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (1) with 4-(1h-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)-4-oxobutanoyl chloride (2) furnished novel 4-(1h-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)-n-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxobutanamide (3a-j). all the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by ir, h-1-nmr, and mass spectral analysis. the antidepressant activities of synthesized derivatives were compared with standard drug clomipramine at a dose level of 20mg/kg. among the derivatives tested, most of the compounds were found to have potent activity against depression. the high level of activity was shown by the compounds 3d, 3e, 3i, and it significantly reduced the duration of immobility time at the dose level of 50mg/kg.
media_violence	most of the studies on violence in digital games have investigated its effects on arousal or aggression. little attention has been paid to how in-game violence is actually perceived and evaluated. to investigate this issue we conducted two experimental studies (n = 30 and n = 74) in which participants either played or watched a violent shooter game and reported how they perceived and evaluated the violent content. results showed that playing the games led to an increased awareness for in-game violence, but also to less-negative subjective evaluations of the violent content. gaming frequency had a negative effect on both the perception and evaluation of in-game violence, suggesting a desensitization effect. the results of our studies illustrate that individual perceptions and evaluations of violence in digital games have to be taken into account when studying their effects. implications for further research and the system of age ratings are discussed based on our findings.
depression	relationships between the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (crhr1) [rs878886] and serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-httlpr), with resilience and satisfaction with life were examined in 172 adolescents; 70 refugee adolescents living in the netherlands and 102 non-refugee (dutch) adolescents. genetic variation in the crhr1 was related with self-reported resilience and satisfaction with life, while the 5-httlpr polymorphism was not. these findings did not depend on being a refugee or a non-refugee (dutch) adolescent and did hold after accounting for age, number of exposures to potentially traumatic events and gender. this implies that adolescents who are g-allele carriers of crhr1 (rs878886) might be more susceptible to mental health problems following trauma, further suggesting innate differences in crhr1 as a factor in resilience.

eating_disorders	objectiveto investigate the cost-utility of the internet-based intervention featback provided with different levels of therapist support, in comparison to a waiting list. methodthis economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective and was part of a randomized controlled trial in which participants (n=354) with self-reported ed symptoms were randomized to: (1) 8 weeks of featback, consisting of psychoeducation and a fully automated monitoring- and feedback system, (2) featback with low-intensity (weekly) therapist support, (3) featback with high-intensity (three times a week) therapist support, and (4) a waiting list. participants were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. cost-utility acceptability curves were constructed. resultsno significant differences between the study conditions were found regarding quality-adjusted life-years (p=0.55) and societal costs (p=0.45), although the mean costs per participant were lowest in the featback condition with low-intensity therapist support (euro1951), followed by featback with high-intensity therapist support (euro2032), featback without therapist support (euro2102), and the waiting list (euro2582). featback seemed to be cost-effective as compared to the waiting list. no clear preference was found for featback with or without therapist support. discussiona fully automated internet-based intervention for ed symptoms with no, low-, or high-intensity therapist support represented good value for money when compared to a waiting list. this finding may have important implications for clinical practice, as both the unguided- and guided intervention could allow for more efficient care and widespread dissemination, potentially increasing the accessibility and availability of mental health care services for individuals with ed symptoms.

eating_disorders	objective. depressive comorbidity is often associated with anorexia nervosa (an), and antidepressant medication is widely used although it does not rely on any convincing data in the scientific literature. our objectives were: to summarize the epidemiological, physiological, psychopathological literature about the relation between an and manifestations of depression, and to focus on the clinical trial data assessing the use of antidepressant medication in an in order to clarify the strategy for the use of antidepressant in an during adolescence. method. a manual computerised search (medline) was performed for relevant published studies assessing the association between depressive signs or major depressive disorder (mdd) and an. another manual computerised search (medline) listed clinical trials assessing antidepressant in an. results. on the one hand, depressive symptoms are common during the course of an and could have different meaning. indeed, firstly, we can distinguish symptoms that are inherent to an and which can be mistaken for depressive signs (for instance: low self-esteem, reduced social contacts). secondly, long-term undernourishment can be held responsible for numerous psychological distortions, including anxiety and depression symptoms such as insomnia, impaired concentration, or social isolation. thirdly, the natural course of an can also lead to ""depressive moments"", in particular when switching to a ""purging type"" an, or when recovery mobilizes control and narcissistic issues. on the other hand, mdd is also highly prevalent among an patients and is a negative prognosis factor. thus, it is complex to differentiate mdd from isolated depressive symptoms that could be inherent of the an symptomatology which raises the question of the role of antidepressant medication in treatment of depression in an. no significant benefit of antidepressant medication in an has been shown in clinical trials, and according to international guidelines it should be prescribed only as a second-line treatment, after appropriate refeeding, and in case of an authentic depressive disorder. those data appear to be in contradiction with the frequent use of those drugs in clinical practice. discussion. - nevertheless, clinical trials assessing antidepressant treatment in an suffer from methodological weakness concerning the size of the sample, the choice of the population or the evaluation criterion. this lack of proof must raise our vigilance concerning antidepressant medication in an but should not categorically prevent the clinician from using it when necessary. we do believe that there are some indications for prescribing antidepressant in patients with an. the clinical challenge lies in the differentiation of the depressive symptoms that are transitory and likely to improve without medication from those that signal the presence of an mdd. three criterion could be indicative of mdd: familial history of mood disorder, as it is a major risk factor for mdd among relatives; the chronology of appearance of both disorders, when mdd pre-exists an; a few specific symptoms cannot be attributed to undernourishment or reactive depressive signs, such as morning insomnia, daily variation of depressive symptoms, suicidal attempts or ideation and guilt ideation. thus, in integrating the data from the literature review, we propose a pragmatic therapeutic strategy for the use of an antidepressant in an during adolescence that lies in 3 main categories for depressive manifestations in an: therapeutic emergencies: when an obvious and severe mdd is comorbid to an, immediate antidepressant would be required; isolated and non-specific depressive sign: no medication would be relevant as they are supposed to improve with refeeding and psychotherapeutic support; intermediary patterns which is probably the most frequent situation. in the last case, it would be relevant to abstain from prescribing medication in first line, but an antidepressant medication should be quickly considered in the presence of one (or several) criterion listed above and its persistence despite refeeding. the general medical state of this fragile population of patients should be evaluated (standard blood test, ecg) before and during treatment.

borderline_personality_disorder	background: the current analyses examined whether the dysregulation profile (dp) 1) could be used to identify children and adolescents at high risk for complex and serious psychopathology and 2) was correlated to other emotional and behavioral problems (such as delinquent behavior or suicide ideation). dp was assessed using both the child behavior checklist (cbcl) and the youth self report (ysr) in a residential care sample. methods: children and adolescents (n=374) aged 10-18 years living in residential care in switzerland completed the ysr, and their professional caregivers completed the cbcl. participants meeting criteria for dp (t-score >= 67 on the anxious/depressed, attention problems, and aggressive behavior scales of the ysr/cbcl) were compared against those who did not for the presence of complex psychopathology (defined as the presence of both emotional and behavioral disorders), and also for the prevalence of several psychiatric diagnoses, suicidal ideation, traumatic experiences, delinquent behaviors, and problems related to quality of life. results: the diagnostic criteria for cbcl-dp and ysr-dp were met by just 44 (11.8%) and 25 (6.7%) of participants. only eight participants (2.1%) met the criteria on both instruments. further analyses were conducted separately for the cbcl-dp and ysr-dp groups. dp was associated with complex psychopathology in only 34.4% of cases according to cbcl and in 60% of cases according to ysr. ysr-dp was somewhat more likely to be associated with psychiatric disorders and associated problems than was the cbcl-dp. limitations: because of the relatively small overlap between the cbcl-dp and ysr-dp, analyses were conducted largely with different samples, likely contributing to the different results. conclusions: despite a high rate of psychopathology in the population studied, both the ysr-dp and the cbcl-dp were able to detect only a small proportion of those with complex psychiatric disorders. this result questions the validity of ysr-dp and the cbcl-dp in detecting subjects with complex and serious psychopathology. it is possible that different screening instruments may be more effective.

person_perception	the purpose of this study is to explore the link between political affinity and source credibility perception through the cases of fox news and npr. based on the third-person perception framework, this study combines the q methodology and focus group interviews to investigate the interaction of audience and source in shaping the credibility of a media source. results confirmed the third-person perception in that audiences tend to perceive a politically aligned news channel as being trustworthy, but fails to attain the social impact it deserves. in contrast, audiences perceive a hostile news channel as having social impact although not being trustworthy.
borderline_personality_disorder	the current study investigated the relationship between maladaptive five-factor model (ffm) personality traits, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, and suicide ideation in a sample of 131 undergraduate students who were selected based on their scores on a screening questionnaire regarding borderline personality disorder (bpd) symptoms. those who endorsed elevated bpd symptoms in a pre-screen analyses completed at the beginning of each semester were oversampled in comparison to those with low or moderate symptoms. indirect effect (mediation) results indicated that the maladaptive personality traits of anxious/uncertainty, dysregulated anger, self-disturbance, behavioral dysregulation, dissociative tendencies, distrust, manipulativeness, oppositional, and rashness had indirect effects on suicide ideation through anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. all of these personality traits correlated to suicide ideation as well. the maladaptive personality traits of despondence, affective dysregulation, and fragility were positive correlates of suicide ideation and predicted suicide ideation when all traits were entered in one linear regression model, but were not indirectly related through anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. the implication for targeting anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns in evidence based practices for reducing suicide risk in those with bpd is discussed.
prejudice	nonheterosexual individuals are half as likely as their heterosexual counterparts to report a religious identity. gay, lesbian, bisexual, and queer (glbq) emerging adults who maintain a religious identity and affiliation throughout their adolescent and young adult years challenge dominant narratives of sexuality and religion (pew, 2012, 2013). this study contextualizes these demographic findings and considers their impact on family life and sexual identity. the authors present data from 11 qualitative interviews with glbq individuals between the ages of 20 and 25. results are presented in a model describing how participants constructed a glbq christian identity, and how they perceive the acceptance of their identities in both their families and church communities.
problem-solving	background: executive functions have an important role in human behavioural regulation and can be a determinant of eating behaviour. our aim was to study the different components of executive functions in obese individuals waiting for clinical treatment, comparing them with normoweight subjects with similar socio-demographic characteristics. method: a total of 114 adults (76 obese and 38 normoweight) completed a neuropsychological battery that included tasks of conceptualization and abstraction, motor programming, response maintenance, inhibition and resistance, problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency. results: there was a statistically significant difference between groups for all the dimensions of the executive functions evaluated, with the obese group showing poorer performance compared to normoweight. conclusions: obese individuals demonstrated poorer executive functions than normoweight individuals.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objective: to examine the dynamic relationship between treatment expectations and treatment outcome over the course of a clinical trial for winter seasonal affective disorder (sad). method: currently depressed adults with major depression, recurrent with seasonal pattern (n = 177) were randomized to 6 weeks of group-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for sad (cbt-sad) or light therapy (lt). the majority were female (83.6%) and white (92.1%), with a mean age of 45.6 years. treatment expectations for cbt-sad and lt were assessed using a modification of the treatment expectancy and credibility survey (borkovec & nau, 1972). depression severity was assessed using the beck depression inventory-second edition (beck, steer, & brown, 1996). all measures were administered at pretreatment, midtreatment, and posttreatment. results: as treatment progressed, expectations for the treatment received increased across time steeply in cbt-sad patients and moderately in lt patients. collapsing across time, patients with higher treatment expectations had lower depression severity than those with lower treatment expectations. in a cross-lagged panel path analysis, there was a significant effect of treatment expectations at midtreatment on depression severity at posttreatment among cbt-sad patients. conclusions: treatment expectations changed across treatment, affected outcome, and should be assessed and monitored repeatedly throughout treatment. findings suggest that treatment expectations at midtreatment are a mechanism by which cbt-sad reduces depression, which should be replicated in sad samples and examined for generalizability to nonseasonal depression. these findings underscore the importance of further research examining treatment expectations in mediating cbt 's effects in depression and other types of psychopathology.
borderline_personality_disorder	objective: in psychotherapy clients' i do n't know-responses (idk-responses) to therapists' questions are typically considered to be non-cooperating behaviors. how therapists actually handle these behaviors remains unclear. this study therefore aims to assess client-therapist interactions following idk-responses. methods: data were collected in a dutch child and adolescent mental healthcare service by observing dialectical behavior therapy aimed at adolescents with severe emotional distress. eighteen individual psychotherapy sessions involving two therapists with six clients were video-recorded and transcribed. stand-alone idk-responses were selected (n = 77) and analyzed using conversation analysis. results: adolescents' idk-responses led to varying actions of therapists. we identified five categories of continuations after idk-responses: no idk-related continuation; redoing of the question; proposing a candidate answer; employing therapy-specific techniques; and meta-talk on the problematic nature of the idk-response. conclusions: therapists treat idk-responses not just as non-cooperative behavior on the part of the client; idk-responses are also used as a starting point to collaboratively enhance clients' insights in their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. practice implications: after idk-responses therapists can use a variety of continuation strategies with varying therapeutic functions. these strategies can be embedded in training of therapists to deal with potentially non-cooperative behavior.

eating_disorders	bulimia nervosa (bn) is characterized by symptoms of binge eating and compensatory behavior, and overevaluation of weight and shape, which often co-occur with symptoms of anxiety and depression. however, there is little research identifying which specific bn symptoms maintain bn psychopathology and how they are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. network analyses represent an emerging method in psychopathology research to examine how symptoms interact and may become self-reinforcing. in the current study of adults with a diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders-fourth edition (dsm-iv) diagnosis of bn (n = 196), we used network analysis to identify the central symptoms of bn, as well as symptoms that may bridge the association between bn symptoms and anxiety and depression symptoms. results showed that fear of weight gain was central to bn psychopathology, whereas binge eating, purging, and restriction were less central in the symptom network. symptoms related to sensitivity to physical sensations (e.g., changes in appetite, feeling dizzy, and wobbly) were identified as bridge symptoms between bn, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. we discuss our findings with respect to cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches for bn. these findings suggest that treatments for bn should focus on fear of weight gain, perhaps through exposure therapies. further, interventions focusing on exposure to physical sensations may also address bn psychopathology, as well as co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms.
prejudice	the united kingdom 's marriage (same sex couples) act (2013) was framed by the government as an equality measure and, as such, those who opposed the legislation were likely to be sensitive to possible accusations of prejudice. this article examines opposition to marriage equality within the british press and explores how denials of homophobia were made. opponents to same-sex marriage attended to commonsense notions of homophobes', either by aligning their views with categories of persons not typically considered homophobic or by distancing their views from a homophobic other. opponents also offered a counter-accusation that it was liberal supporters of same-sex marriage who were intolerant. parallels are drawn with discursive literature on racist discourse and it appears that despite social scientists' attempts to expand the concept of antigay prejudice, homophobia is commonly referred to in terms of irrational bigoted individuals.
prejudice	inspired by sociolinguistic scholarship, this study examines the influence of linguistic vitality, the social health of a language, on perceived in-group threat and out-group attitudes. using an experimental design that manipulated perceptions of the linguistic vitality of french in quebec, this study sought to ascertain the causal role of linguistic vitality on intergroup attitudes. the results demonstrate that the type of information, positive or negative, about linguistic vitality influences perceptions of threat towards a language. however, results about linguistic vitality information 's impact on out-group attitudes, support for independence and subjective identity revealed inter-individual heterogeneity.
eating_disorders	research suggests that humans have an attentional bias for the rapid detection of emotionally valenced stimuli, and that such a bias might be shaped by clinical psychological states. the current research extends this work to examine the relation between body dissatisfaction and an attentional bias for thin/idealized body shapes. across two experiments, undergraduates completed a gender-consistent body dissatisfaction measure, and a dot-probe paradigm to measure attentional biases for thin versus heavy bodies. results indicated that men (n = 21) and women (n = 18) show an attentional bias for bodies that correspond to their own gender (experiment 1), and that high body dissatisfaction among men (n = 69) and women (n = 89) predicts an attentional bias for thin same-gender bodies after controlling for body mass index (bmi) (experiment 2). this research provides a new direction for studying the attentional and cognitive underpinnings of the relation between body dissatisfaction and eating disorders.

antisocial_personality_disorder	objective: to assess personality traits using the temperament and character inventory (tci) in a group of 63 previously diagnosed adhd patients and 68 population controls and investigate the impact of common comorbid psychiatric disorders on these personality measures. method: psychiatric comorbidity was assessed with the mini international neuropsychiatric interview plus and personality traits by the tci. results: the patient group had significantly higher scores on the tci dimensions harm avoidance and novelty seeking compared with the control group. however, when adjusting for comorbid anxiety and depressive disorder, the adhd group no longer showed higher harm avoidance than the control group. the difference in novelty seeking between the patient and control groups was correlated with lifetime diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (aspd). conclusion: it is important to take comorbid psychiatric disorders into account while investigating personality traits in adhd.
antisocial_personality_disorder	mentalization-based treatment (mbt) is a new development in the field of psychodynamic therapy that particularly aims at patients with severe difficulties in affect regulation. initially, mbt was developed for the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder. at the moment, the scope of mbt is broadened to other mental disorders, such as psychosis, eating disorders and antisocial personality disorder as well as to low personality functioning in adolescence. the core model of mbt regarding therapeutic stance and technique aims to restore mentalization especially in the context of attachment relationships. in contrast to other psychodynamic therapies, mbt remains in the ""here and now"" with a focus on current affects and relationships (including the therapeutic relationship). there is initial evidence that mbt shows effectiveness with the particular patient groups addressed.
person_perception	using event-related potentials (erps), this study examines how trait information inferred from behaviors is associated with person names. in linguistic discourses, person names were associated with descriptions of either positive or negative behaviors. in a subsequent explicit evaluation task, the previously described person names were presented in isolation, and the participants were asked to judge the emotional valence of these names. we found that the names associated with positive descriptions elicited a larger positivity in the erp than the names associated with negative descriptions. the results indicate that the emotional valence of person names attached to person perception can be dynamically influenced by short descriptions of the target person, probably due to trait inference based on the provided behavioral descriptions.
media_violence	media violence poses a threat to public health inasmuch as it leads to an increase in real-world violence and aggression. research shows that fictional television and film violence contribute to both a short-term and a long-term increase in aggression and violence in young viewers. television news violence also contributes to increased violence, principally in the form of imitative suicides and acts of aggression. video games are clearly capable of producing an increase in aggression and violence in the short term, although no long-term longitudinal studies capable of demonstrating long-term effects have been conducted. the relationship between media violence and real-world violence and aggression is moderated by the nature of the media content and characteristics of and social influences on the individual exposed to that content. still, the average overall size of the effect is large enough to place it in the category of known threats to public health.
media_violence	over the past few decades, researchers have documented positive associations between direct child maltreatment and exposure to interpersonal violence (including intimate partner violence, community violence, school violence, and media violence) and children 's externalizing behavior problems. however, current family violence literature largely ignores the effects of child abuse on other children in the family. a handful of studies have focused on exposure to child abuse and documented the behavioral effects on siblings, and these studies lend support for broadening scholarship focused on this type of family violence. this article presents empirical research and theories that focus on the relationships between child physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence and children 's externalizing behavior problems. using this literature as a foundation, an argument is made for the need to focus on children 's exposure to child physical abuse. this article presents information from the few studies that have focused on children who were exposed to the physical abuse of a sibling and offers theoretical frameworks, including social learning theory and psychological proximity, as a foundation for future research. the article concludes with a discussion of services that may be necessary for children who have been exposed to the physical abuse of a sibling, including services focused on safety and mental health.

prejudice	the present study investigated the role of authoritarianism in the association between the actual proportion of ethnic minorities (objective diversity) within a neighborhood and majority members' subjective perception thereof (perceived diversity). additionally, we tested how authoritarianism affects the direct and indirect relationships between objective diversity and outgroup threat, anxiety, and mistrust. analyses in a nationally stratified sample of dutch citizens (n=848) without migration background from 706 different neighborhoods showed that higher levels of authoritarianism have a dual effect on the relationship between objective diversity and negativity towards outgroups. in particular, authoritarianism (i) boosts the indirect relationship between objective diversity and greater outgroup negativity through perceived diversity, and (ii) curbs the direct association of objective diversity with reduced outgroup negativity. these findings shed light on how majority members with different levels of authoritarianism differentially perceive diversity in their neighborhood, and how this relates to their responses to ethnic minorities.
prosocial_behavior	sleep disturbances in children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) exist worldwide, but little is known about this issue in non-western cultures. this study aimed to characterize sleep disturbances in chinese children with asd and to examine associated sociodemographic factors and emotional/behavioral problems. parents of 60 chinese children with asd (aged 6-17 years) from shenzhen, china completed the children 's sleep habits questionnaire (cshq), and the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq). sleep disturbances were severe and common, with rates of 70.0 % for overall disturbances and 15.0 % (daytime sleepiness) to 40.0 % (sleep duration) for specific domains. the severity and rate of sleep disturbances were higher compared to previous studies in typically developing children from the same region of china and american children with asd, respectively. further, there were significant correlations between most cshq and sdq domains. female gender, older parental age, higher hyperactivity, and poorer prosocial behavior were associated with increased overall sleep disturbances.
prejudice	aims and objectives. with a focus on sexual health and rights, this study describes how transgender people experience meetings with health care professionals. background. transgender people face prejudice and discrimination worldwide. little is known of their experiences in sexual health-promoting settings. method. within a descriptive design, 20 persons aged 18-74 and identifying as transgender and nonbinary were interviewed. the results were analysed with constructivist grounded theory. results. disrespect among health care professionals is the core category connected to the experiences in the result; transgender people experience estrangement, expectations and eviction in different sexual health-promoting settings. conclusion. transgender knowledge needs to be increased in general, in both specialised transgender health care and many other health care settings, to prevent transgender peoples' experiences of estrangement. moreover, an increased knowledge of, and respect for, sexual health and rights is needed to prevent transgender peoples' exposure to gender binary, cis- and heteronormative expectations. in addition, access to sexual health care is essential following gender-confirmatory care as well to avoid transgender peoples' experiences of eviction from the health care system. relevance to clinical practice. nurses have an important role to play in striving for equity and justice within health care. this study describes how health care professionals appear to be disrespectful and suggestions of how this can be avoided are made.
leadership	given the lack of active nurses in industrialized countries throughout the world, in combination with demographic changes, it is of utmost importance to protect nurses' well-being and to prevent psychological distress, because of their strong association with premature occupational leave. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of quality of leadership and social support at work on well-being and psychological distress of nurses and to determine whether nurses' overcommitment mediates the relationship between the abovementioned determinants and the outcomes. a cross-sectional survey design was used to gather our data. this study utilized part of the database of the nurses' early exit study. a total of 34,771 nurses (covering all nurse qualifications) working in hospitals, nursing homes, and home-care institutions in 8 european countries filled out a questionnaire (response rate=51.4%). for all model variables (job satisfaction, satisfaction with salary, positive affectivity, personal burnout, negative affectivity, quality of leadership, social support from immediate supervisor, social support from near colleagues, and overcommitment), psychometrically sound, that is, valid and reliable measures were used. outcomes from testing a structural equation mediation model indicated that, respectively, positive and negative influences of leadership quality and social support from supervisor and colleagues on nurses' wellbeing and psychological distress are partially mediated, that is, reduced, by nurses' overcommitment. social work environment is highly important in relation to nurses' well-being and psychological distress.
depression	the aim is to determine whether serum drug concentrations obtained from the neonate 's umbilical cord can be used as a prognostic factor for admission to the neonatology ward and the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. a retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was carried out among pregnant women using psychotropic drugs and their baby. binary logistic regression was used for the multivariate analysis. of the 186 neonates included, 22.6% (n=42) were admitted to the neonatology ward, 6.5% (n=12) because of withdrawal. among women with therapeutic concentrations of psychotropic medication, 22.0% (n=5) of the neonates had withdrawal symptoms. when comparing neonates with therapeutic versus undetectable drug concentrations, an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-8.6) was found for admission to the neonatology ward and an odds ratio of 20.5 (95% confidence interval: 2.2-186.1) for the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. therapeutic concentrations of psychotropic drugs in neonates' umbilical cord blood correspond with higher odds for admission to the neonatology ward and the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms compared with neonates with undetectable drug concentrations. the measurement of drug concentrations in the neonate may contribute toward the general clinical assessment of the physician to predict the necessity of admission to the neonatology ward and the risk of withdrawal symptoms.
prenatal_development	foetal breathing in mice results from prenatal activity of the two coupled hindbrain oscillators considered to be responsible for respiratory rhythm generation after birth: the pre-botzinger complex (prebotc) is active shortly before the onset of foetal breathing; the parafacial respiratory group (e-pf in embryo) starts activity one day earlier. transcription factors have been identified that are essential to specify neural progenitors and lineages forming each of these oscillators during early development of the neural tube: hoxa1, egr2 (krox20), phox2b, lbx1 and atoh1 for the e-pf; dbx1 and evx1 for the prebotc which eventually grow contralateral axons requiring expression of robo3. inactivation of the genes encoding these factors leads to mis-specification of these neurons and distinct breathing abnormalities: apneic patterns and loss of central chemosensitivity for the e-pf (central congenital hypoventilation syndrome. cchs, in humans), complete loss of breathing for the prebotc, right-left desynchronized breathing in robo3 mutants. mutations affecting development in more rostral (pontine) respiratory territories change the shape of the inspiratory drive without affecting the rhythm. other (primordial) embryonic oscillators start in the mouse three days before the e-pf, to generate low frequency (lf) rhythms that are probably required for activity-dependent development of neurones at embryonic stages; in the foetus, however, they are actively silenced to avoid detrimental interaction with the on-going respiratory rhythm. altogether, these observations provide a strong support to the previously proposed hypothesis that the functional organization of the respiratory generator is specified at early stages of development and is dual in nature, comprising two serially non-homologous oscillators.

depression	to assess the impact of their child 's symptoms of autism spectrum disorder upon parents' anxiety and depression, 68 mothers of boys aged 10 to 15 years (m = 12.6 years, sd = 1.6 years) completed the asd behaviour checklist, the gad7 and the phq9 at a single setting. results indicated that the boys' restricted and repetitive behaviours had the strongest relationship with their mothers' anxiety and depression, followed by communication difficulties, but the latter set of behaviours did not significantly add to the variance predicted by restricted and repetitive behaviours. their sons' intense reactions to stressors was the most powerful asd-related contributor to the anxiety and depression experienced by these mothers. several suggestions for enhancing parental coping with this aspect of their child 's asd behavioural symptomatology are discussed.
antisocial_personality_disorder	research into the biosocial correlates of antisocial behavior has revealed the importance of integrating sociological findings with evidence flowing from genetics and neuroscience. the present study represents a step toward such integration by offering an in-depth overview of neurocriminology, which is the study of the brain and how it affects antisocial behavior. we consider the role of the brain in both antisocial/criminal behavior as well as in drug use/abuse. we highlight various regions/systems in the brain that have been identified as targets for intervention and as areas in need of more study. this knowledge equips us with the foundation to think translationally about how to promote mental health, adaptive behavior, and well-being among drug using criminal offenders.
attention	a simple and cost effective synthesis of nanomaterials with advanced physical and chemical properties have received much attention to the researchers, and is of interest to the researchers from different disciplines. in the present work, we report a simple and one pot electrochemical synthesis of poly(melamine) entrapped gold nanoparticles (pm-aunps) composite. the pm-aunps composite was prepared by a single step electrochemical method, wherein the aunps and pm were simultaneously fabricated on the electrode surface. the as-prepared materials were characterized by various physicochemical methods. the pm-aunps composite modified electrode was used as an electrocatalyst for oxidation of catechol (cc) due to its well-defined redox behavior and enhanced electro-oxidation ability towards cc than other modified electrodes. under optimized conditions, the differential pulse voltammetry (dpv) was used for the determination of cc. the dpv response of cc was linear over the concentration ranging from 0.5 to 175.5 mu m with a detection limit of 0.011 mu m. the pm-aunps composite modified electrode exhibits the high selectivity in the presence of range of potentially interfering compounds including dihydroxybenzene isomers. the sensor shows excellent practicality in cc containing water
attention	the design of tailor-made gelators has attracted tremendous level of attention for the fabrication of novel nanogels with responsive characteristics. exploiting the gel properties of nanocellulose (nc) because of its abundance, sustainability and renewability, we reported the fabrication of a fluorescent hydrogel based on s,n-codoped graphene quantum dots (s,n-gqds) acting as luminophore and sensitizer. the incorporation of the gqds into the hydrogel resulted in a significant fluorescence intensity enhancement if compared to gq.d solutions. in conjunction with recent efforts in the applicability of optical responsive gels, a simple method based on the selectively sensing ability of the gqd/nc hydrogel towards 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (tcp) through the fluorescence enhancement is disclosed. the validity of this strategy is demonstrated with the analysis of tcp in red wine and environmental water samples.

prejudice	watching contact between members of one 's ingroup and members of an outgroup in the media (mediated vicarious contact) improves intergroup attitudes. we compare mediated vicarious contact with observing only members of the outgroup (parasocial contact), and examine whether the activity of the portrayed contact matters. building on theory, we predict that watching outgroup members playing music should reduce prejudice more than watching them engaged in nonmusical activities, particularly with vicarious (vs. parasocial) contact. results show that vicarious musical contact enhances perceptions of synchronization, liking, and honesty between ingroup and outgroup actors in a video, which in turn results in more positive attitudes toward the outgroup. counter to predictions, parasocial musical contact results in less positive outcomes than parasocial nonmusical contact.
schizophrenia	despite many reports on visual processing deficits in psychotic disorders, studies are needed on the integration of visual and non-visual components of eye movement control to improve the understanding of sensorimotor information processing in these disorders. non-visual inputs to eye movement control include prediction of future target velocity from extrapolation of past visual target movement and anticipation of future target movements. it is unclear whether non-visual input is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. we recorded smooth pursuit eye movements in 21 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 22 patients with bipolar disorder, and 24 controls. in a foveo-fugal ramp task, the target was either continuously visible or was blanked during movement. we determined peak gain (measuring overall performance), initial eye acceleration (measuring visually driven pursuit), deceleration after target extinction (measuring prediction), eye velocity drifts before onset of target visibility (measuring anticipation), and residual gain during blanking intervals (measuring anticipation and prediction). in both patient groups, initial eye acceleration was decreased and the ability to adjust eye acceleration to increasing target acceleration was impaired. in contrast, neither deceleration nor eye drift velocity was reduced in patients, implying unimpaired non-visual contributions to pursuit drive. disturbances of eye movement control in psychotic disorders appear to be a consequence of deficits in sensorimotor transformation rather than a pure failure in adding cognitive contributions to pursuit drive in higher-order cortical circuits. more generally, this deficit might reflect a fundamental imbalance between processing external input and acting according to internal preferences.
leadership	this study aims to analyze the perception of managers of the councils of municipal health secretariats (cosems) and their contributions to the health regionalization process. we conducted thorough interviews with presidents of cosems of the states of mato grosso do sul, parana, ceara, tocantins and minas gerais. data were analyzed with iramuteq software, which generated a dendrogram with three themes: the first thematic axis: the prominent role of cosems in the regional governance process, which includes class 1 - cosems' leadership in the process of regionalization, and class 3 - the strategic experience of the regional agreement process. the second thematic axis includes the challenges to the provision of health care in the regions, consisting of class 2, which shows how to meet community needs, and class 4, which shows the local support carried out by cosems' teams. the third thematic axis consists of class 5, which describes the operational aspects of the provision of health care in the region. cosems play an important role in the regionalization process, especially because they have an organic performance and leadership. its organic performance in these areas has ensured its legitimacy and leadership. it is a daily construction that ensures the advancement of collaborative governance in health regions.
leadership	background: delirium and dementia (cognitive impairment; ci), are common in older hospital patients, and both are associated with serious adverse outcomes. despite delirium often being preventable, it is frequently not recognized in hospital settings, which may be because hospital nurses have not received adequate education or training in recognizing or caring for those with ci. however, the most effective way of increasing nurses' awareness about delirium and dementia, and initiating regular patient screening and monitoring to guide best practices for these patients in hospital settings is not known. hence this current project, conducted in 2015-2017, aims to redress this situation by implementing a multi-component non-pharmacological evidence-based intervention for patients with ci, through educating and mentoring hospital nurses to change their practice. methods: the development of the practice change component is informed by recent findings from implementation science that focuses on facilitation as the active ingredient in knowledge uptake and utilization. this component focuses on educating and empowering experienced nurses to become cognition champions (cogchamps) across six wards in a large australian tertiary referral hospital. the cogchamps will, in turn, educate other nursing team members to more effectively care for patients with ci. the hospital leadership team are supportive of the project and are directly involved in selecting the cogchamps. cogchamps will be provided with comprehensive education in evidence-based delirium assessment, prevention and management, and practice change management skills. they will receive continuing support from research and education staff about raising awareness, upskilling other staff in delirium assessment and in the adoption of best practices for preventing and managing delirium. both qualitative and quantitative data are being collected at multiple time-points to evaluate process, impact and outcome, and to provide clarity regarding the most effective aspects of the intervention. discussion: this paper describes the study protocol for the implementation of multi-component evidence-based non-pharmacological practices designed to improve the care of older hospital patients with ci. findings will inform subsequent initiatives directed towards enhancing the capacity of the nursing workforce to implement best practices for providing high quality care for this growing patient population throughout their acute care hospital stay.
person_perception	many people view religion as a crucial source of morality. however, 6 experiments (total n = 1,078) revealed that good deeds are perceived as less moral if they are performed for religious reasons. religiously motivated acts were seen as less moral than the exact same acts performed for other reasons (experiments 1-2 and 6). religious motivations also reduced attributions of intention and responsibility (experiments 3-6), an effect that fully mediated the effect of religious motivations on perceived morality (experiment 6). the effects were not explained by different perceptions of motivation orientation (i. e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic) across conditions (experiment 4) and also were evident when religious upbringing led to an intuitive moral response (experiment 5). effects generalized across religious and nonreligious participants. when viewing a religiously motivated good deed, people infer that actually helping others is, in part, a side effect of other motivations rather than an end in itself. thus, religiously motivated actors are seen as less responsible than secular actors for their good deeds, and their helping behavior is viewed as less moral than identical good deeds performed for either unclear or secular motivations.
person_perception	organic claims can influence how a product is perceived in dimensions that are unrelated with the food production method (e.g., organic food is perceived as more healthful and less caloric than conventional food). such claims can also bias how the consumers of organic food are perceived and how other people judge their behavior. schuldt and schwarz (2010) have shown that individuals evaluating a target with a weight-loss goal are more lenient in judging the target forgoing exercise when the target had an organic (vs. conventional) dessert. this impact of organic claims on leniency judgments has been interpreted either as a halo or a licensing effect. in the current research we aim to replicate and extend schuldt and schwarz 's (2010) results by examining the mechanisms that are more likely to explain the observed leniency judgments. in experiment 1, we observed that leniency towards a target that has consumed an organic meal is only observed when the target intentionally chooses such organic meal (vs. choice determined by the situation). these findings suggest that the impact of organic claims on leniency judgments is not merely based on a halo effect. instead, a licensing account emerges as the most probable mechanism. in experiment 2, we further found that stronger (vs. weaker) motives for forgoing exercise influenced leniency judgments to the same extent as having had an organic meal. understanding the mechanisms that shape consumers' decisions may have important implications to prevent bias in their judgments about food and exercise.

prosocial_behavior	behavior analysis has produced a robust theoretical analysis of the contingencies involved in cultural evolution. yet, thus far, the empirical yield of this work remains quite limited. with this paper, i attempt to provide specific examples of the ways to advance an experimental analysis of the contingencies involved in cultural evolution. i begin with a review of the theoretical analyses developed by behavior analysts and other contextually oriented scientists. next, i submit that, if the goal of our science is both predicting and influencing cultural phenomena, we must produce experimental analyses of the impact of meta-contingencies on organizations' practices. there is no more pressing reason for doing this than the threat of climate change posed by the continuing growth in human use of fossil fuels. therefore, the paper provides an analysis of the contingencies influencing organizational practices now affecting continued use of fossil fuels and the contingencies for organizations seeking to prevent their use. one concrete step to advance a science of cultural change relevant to climate change would be to create a database of organizations that are promoting vs. working to prevent fossil fuel consumption and the consequences that seem to maintain their practices. i call for experimental analysis of the impact of altering consequences for these practices and for experimental analyses of interventions intended to change the norms, values, and behavior of organizational leaders who can influence fossil fuel consumption. i then discuss the role of prosocial behavior and values in affecting behavior relevant to reducing fossil fuel consumption because the empirical evidence shows that prosociality favors more ""green"" behavior. recent advances in prevention research have identified interventions to promote prosociality, but we need experimental analyses of how advocacy organizations can be more effective in getting these interventions widely adopted.
prenatal_development	little is known about the development of the olfactory organs of camel. in this study, prenatal development and neuronal differentiation of the vomeronasal organ (vno) and the olfactory epithelium (oe) of the one-humped camel were studied by immunohistochemistry and lectin histochemistry. a neuronal marker, protein gene product (pgp) 9.5, but not a marker of fully differentiated olfactory receptor cells, olfactory marker protein, intensely labeled the olfactory receptor cells of the vno and oe at 395 mm, 510 mm, and 530 mm fetal ages, indicating that the olfactory receptor cells are differentiated, but not fully matured both in the vno and the oe. in 187 mm and 190 mm fetuses, pgp 9.5 yielded faint immunoreactive signals in the vno, but not in the oe, although the presence of olfactory receptor cells were demonstrated in both tissues by intense wga and lel stainings. we conclude that the camel vno and oe bear differentiated, but still immature receptor cells; in addition, the onset of neuronal differentiation seems to be somewhat earlier in the vno than in the oe till half of the prenatal life. microsc. res. tech. 78:613-619, 2015.

child_abuse	substance use and depression are prevalent among mothers enrolled in home visiting programs and are significant risk factors for child maltreatment, yet most home visiting programs are staffed by workers who lack the training and clinical skills to address these risks. emanating from one state network 's interest in advancing its practice in this area, the current study surveyed 159 home visitors on their current practices, training, knowledge, and perceived self-efficacy, and perceived system- and client-level barriers regarding client substance use and depression. home visitors reported managing maternal depression more extensively than substance use, though overall management of both risk areas was low. more training was associated with more extensive management of both risk domains, as was greater home visitor knowledge and self-efficacy. implications for the development of strategies to improve home visitor management of client behavioral health risks, including enhanced skills-based training and supervision, are discussed.
media_violence	although catharsis theory as applied to violent media has been repeatedly refuted in the literature, scholars have recently proposed methods by which a cognitive form of catharsis might occur for people who utilize games to manage negative affect. drawing on these ideas, the current study tests how video games are used to manage feelings of frustration and boost one 's sense of competency. it also explores how these emotional processes influence game enjoyment and hostile attribution bias (hab). we frustrated half of 82 participants prior to randomizing them to play a violent or nonviolent game. our results showed that frustrated participants were motivated to progress farther in a video game. this in-game performance decreased their feelings of frustration, boosted their sense of competency, and increased their enjoyment of the game. however, for those who played a violent game, this enjoyment predicted hostile attributions: high enjoyment of violence increased hab, while low enjoyment of violence decreased hab. these findings have implications for how video games are used to manage negative feelings.

false_memories	we investigated priming of analogical problem solutions with true and false memories. children and adults were asked to solve nine verbal proportional analogies, three of which had been primed by deese-roediger-mcdermott (drm) lists where the critical lure (and problem solution) was presented as the initial word in the list (true memory priming), three of which were primed by drm lists whose critical lures were the solution to the verbal proportional analogies (false memory priming), and three of which were unprimed. we controlled for age differences in solution rates (knowledge base) in order to examine developmental differences in speed of processing. as anticipated, the results showed that adults completed the problems significantly faster than children. furthermore, both children and adults solved problems primed with false memories significantly faster than either those primed with true memories or unprimed problems. for both age groups, there was no significant difference between solution times for unprimed and true primed problems. these findings demonstrate that (a) priming of problem solutions extends to verbal proportional analogies, (b) false memories are more effective at priming problem solutions than true memories, and (c) there are clear positive consequences to the production of false memories.

antisocial_personality_disorder	backgroundan extensive clinical literature has noted gender differences in the etiology and clinical characteristics of individuals with alcohol dependence (ad). despite this knowledge, many important questions remain. methodsusing the 2001 to 2002 national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions (n=43,093), we examined differences in sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, clinical correlates, risk factors, and treatment-utilization patterns of men (n=2,974) and women (n=1,807) with lifetime ad. resultsmen with lifetime ad were more likely than women to be diagnosed with any substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder, whereas women were more likely to have mood and anxiety disorders. after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and gender differences in psychiatric comorbidity in the general population, ad was associated with externalizing disorders and any mood disorder among women only. men with ad met more criteria, had longer episodes, and were younger at the age of first drink. there were no gender differences in remission rates. women with ad were more likely to have a family and a spouse with history of alcohol use disorders. treatment rates were low for both genders, and women were more likely to report social stigmatization as a treatment barrier. conclusionsthere are important gender differences in the psychiatric comorbidities, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment-utilization patterns among individuals with lifetime ad.
media_violence	the article presents a meta-analysis of studies-yielding 26 independent samples of subjects-on the relationship between exposure to media violence and violent aggression. mean effect sizes from aggregate and experimental studies do not suggest that media violence and criminal aggression are positively associated, but findings from prospective longitudinal studies are more ambiguous. summary statistics based on models strictly conforming to each study 's original design were compared to post hoc models (in which measures or model specification were not consistent with the original description). overall, ""original"" models, controlling for ""trait,"" did not suggest that exposure to media violence is associated with criminal aggression. the summary statistic for boys reached statistical significance, but the effect size was small, and conclusions based on this finding are attenuated because of known biases in the coefficients estimated.
depression	background: major depressive disorder (mdd) and anxiety disorders are highly co-morbid. research has shown conflicting evidence for white matter alteration and amygdala volume reduction in mood and anxiety disorders. to date, no studies have examined differences in structural connectivity between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. this study compared fractional anisotropy (fa) and density of selected white matter tracts and amygdala volume between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. methods: 64- direction dti and t1 scans were collected from 110 unmedicated subjects with mdd, 39 of whom had a co-morbid anxiety disorder diagnosis. region of interest (roi) and tractography methods were performed to calculate amygdala volume and fa in the uncinate fasciculus, respectively. diffusion connectometry was performed to identify whole brain group differences in white matter health. correlations were computed between biological and clinical measures. results: tractography and roi analyses showed no significant differences between bilateral fa values or bilateral amygdala volumes when comparing the anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed groups. the diffusion connectometry analysis showed no significant differences in anisotropy between the groups. furthermore, there were no significant relationships between mri-based and clinical measures. conclusion: the lack of group differences could indicate that structural connectivity and amygdalae volumes of those with anxious-depression are not significantly altered by a co-morbid anxiety disorder. improving understanding of anxiety co-morbid with mdd would facilitate development of treatments that more accurately target the underlying networks.

depression	research over the last two decades on the role of positive emotions and cognitions in psychological functioning is leading to conceptual changes regarding the nature of mental disorders and the mechanisms underlying their onset and maintenance. this introduction to the latest breakthrough research on positive emotions and cognition offers a brief description of the emerging presence of positivity in current diagnostic systems like the dsm5 and research domain criteria (rdoc). it also analyzes some select findings from the literature on experimental psychopathology supporting the relevance of examining positive aspects of functioning in clinical psychology. in addition, the study of positive aspects of psychological functioning adds a more conceptually complex understanding of psychopathology. the multiple perspectives encompassed in this special issue shed light on our understanding of the different roles that positive emotions and cognitions play in mediating normal and abnormal human functioning and their importance to improving research methods and interventions in psychopathology.
person_perception	people readily make personality attributions to images of strangers' faces. here we investigated the basis of these personality attributions as made to everyday, naturalistic face images. in a first study, we used 1000 highly varying ""ambient image"" face photographs to test the correspondence between personality judgments of the big five and dimensions known to underlie a range of facial first impressions: approachability, dominance, and youthful-attractiveness. interestingly, the facial big five judgments were found to separate to some extent: judgments of openness, extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness were mainly linked to facial first impressions of approachability, whereas conscientiousness judgments involved a combination of approachability and dominance. in a second study we used average face images to investigate which main cues are used by perceivers to make impressions of the big five, by extracting consistent cues to impressions from the large variation in the original images. when forming impressions of strangers from highly varying, naturalistic face photographs, perceivers mainly seem to rely on broad facial cues to approachability, such as smiling.
schizophrenia	introduction: hyperprolactinemia is a common serious side effect of antipsychotic medications that are currently used in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. pharmacogenetic approaches offer the possibility of identifying patient-specific biomarkers for predicting the risk of this side effect. we investigated a possible relationship between variants (snps) in genes for cytochrome 2d6 (cyp2d6), dopamine-2 receptor (drd2) and serotonin-2c receptor (htr2c) and antipsychotic drug-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients with schizophrenia. methods: overall, 128 russian patients with paranoid schizophrenia (61f/67m, aged 18-65 y) were included. serum prolactin concentration was measured with elisa. dna analysis and genotyping of cyp2d6 (rs3892097), drd2 (rs6275) and htr2c (rs6318) genes was done with steponeplus real-time pcr system using taqman (r) snp genotyping assays (applied biosystems, usa). results: our study showed an association of the cyp2d6 (rs3892097) and htr2c (rs6318) gene polymorphism with hyperprolactinemia in patients with schizophrenia on the background of therapy. no associations were identified between the drd2 (rs6275) gene polymorphism and the risk of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients with schizophrenia. conclusion: our study confirms a contribution of genetic factors to the antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in patients with schizophrenia. further studies are required to unravel the genetic predictors of antipsychotic-induced side effects and to develop the personalized treatment strategies for patients with schizophrenia.
person_perception	people give widely varying estimates for the amount of genetic overlap that exists between humans. while some laypeople believe that humans are highly genetically similar to one another, others believe that humans share very little genetic overlap. these studies examine how beliefs about genetic overlap affect neural and evaluative reactions to racially-ambiguous and biracial targets. in study 1, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted a stronger neural avoidance response to biracial compared to monoracial targets. in study 2, we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted longer response times to classify biracial (vs. monoracial) faces into racial categories. in study 3, we manipulated genetic overlap beliefs and found that participants in the low overlap condition explicitly rated biracial targets more negatively than those in the high overlap condition. taken together, these data suggest that genetic overlap beliefs influence perceivers' processing fluency and evaluation of biracial and racially-ambiguous individuals.
seasonal_affective_disorder	depressed patients often show altered circadian rhythms, sleep disturbances, and diurnal mood variation. decreased latency of rapid eye movement (rem) sleep, reduction in slow wave sleep, and abnormalities in the timing of rem/nonrem sleep cycles have all been reported in patients with major depressive disorder (mdd). it is thus evident that an understanding of the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation is essential, for a better analysis of the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. the aim of this article is to review progress in understanding the mechanisms that underlie circadian and sleep rhythms, and their role in the treatment of depression. chronotherapies including, bright light exposure, sleep deprivation, melatonin treatment, and social rhythm therapies, may provide novel insights into the development of new pharmacological and behavioral treatment strategies for mood disorders. the novel antidepressant, agomelatine, which combines the properties of a serotonin 5-ht2c antagonist and a melatonergic mt1/mt2 receptor agonist, has been found to be very effective for resetting the disturbed sleep/wake cycle and improving the clinical status of depressed patients. agomelatine may fill the gap in the current therapeutic armoury, by combining tolerability profile with efficacy, in treating mdd.
attention	traffic flow in cities is affected by numerous factors, including land use (especially commercial land use because of its trip-making nature). this phenomenon can be more effective when combined with accessibility factors and street connectivity. the case of bojnourd has been selected for this study. the most important reason to choose this case is that the municipality gives commercial construction permits to developers in this city without paying attention to traffic consequences. bojnourd is a medium-sized city and the capital of the north khorasan province. the ultimate goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of both commercial land use and route configuration on number of trips. for this purpose, analysis of secondary data has been used as the method of study. findings showed that there is a significant relationship between commercial land use and trip volume in bojnourd city. findings also indicated a strong correlation between the syntax of routes and traffic flow in the case of bojnourd. the combined effect of both commercial land use and route configuration on the number of trips was examined and both factors that influence the number of trips were significant.

problem-solving	many species in the family paridae, such as marsh tits poecile palustris, are large-scale scatter hoarders of food that make cryptic caches and disperse these in large year-round territories. the perhaps most well-known species in the family, the great tit parus major, does not store food itself but is skilled in stealing caches from the other species. we have previously demonstrated that great tits are able to memorise positions of caches they have observed marsh tits make and later return and steal the food. as great tits are explorative in nature and unusually good learners, it is possible that such ""memorisation of caches from a distance"" is a unique ability of theirs. the other possibility is that this ability is general in the parid family. here, we tested marsh tits in the same experimental set-up as where we previously have tested great tits. we allowed caged marsh tits to observe a caching conspecific in a specially designed indoor arena. after a retention interval of 1 or 24 h, we allowed the observer to enter the arena and search for the caches. the marsh tits showed no evidence of such observational memorization ability, and we believe that such ability is more useful for a non-hoarding species. why should a marsh tit that memorises hundreds of their own caches in the field bother with the difficult task of memorising other individuals' caches? we argue that the close-up memorisation procedure that marsh tits use at their own caches may be a different type of observational learning than memorisation of caches made by others. for example, the latter must be done from a distance and hence may require the ability to adopt an allocentric perspective, i.e. the ability to visualise the cache from the hoarder 's perspective. significance statement members of the paridae family are known to possess foraging techniques that are cognitively advanced. previously, we have demonstrated that a non-hoarding parid species, the great tit p. major, is able to memorise positions of caches that they have observed marsh tits p. palustris make. however, it is unknown whether this cognitively advanced foraging strategy is unique to great tits or if it occurs also in other parids. here, we demonstrated that ""pilfering by observational memorization strategy"" is not a general strategy in parids. we believe that such ability is important for a non-hoarding species such as the great tit and, most likely, birds owning many caches do not need this foraging strategy.
attention	the entrepreneurial ecosystem (ee) literature has attracted much attention, especially in policy circles. however, the concept suffers from a number of shortcomings: (1) it lacks a clear analytical framework that makes explicit what is cause and what is effect in an ee; (2) while being a systemic concept, the ee has not yet fully exploited insights from network theory, and it is not always clear in what way the proposed elements are connected in an ee; (3) it remains a challenge what institutions (and at what spatial scale) impact on the structure and performance of ee; (4) studies have often focused on the ee in single regions or clusters, but lack a comparative and multi-scalar perspective and (5) the ee literature tends to provide a static framework taking a snapshot of ee without considering systematically their evolution over time. for each of these shortcomings, we make a number of suggestions to take up in future research on ee.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objectives. seasonal affective disorder (sad) is a subtype of recurrent unipolar or bipolar depressive disorder with a higher prevalence in winter than in summer. the biological underpinnings of sad are so far poorly understood. studies examining sad have found disturbances between the molecular and connectivity scales. the aim of the study was to explore changes in functional connectivity typical for sad. methods. we investigated unmedicated, untreated sad patients and healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fmri) utilizing graph theory, a data driven and hypothesis free approach, to model functional networks of the brain. results. comparing whole brain network properties using graph theory we observed globally affected network topologies with increasing pathlength in sad. nodal changes, however, were highly restricted to bilateral inferior occipital cortex. interestingly, we found a lateralization where hyper-connectedness was restricted to right inferior occipital cortex and hyper-efficiency was found in the left inferior occipital cortex. furthermore, we found these nodes became more ""hub like"" in patients, suggesting a greater functional role. conclusions. our work stresses the importance of abnormal intrinsic processing during rest, primarily affecting visual areas and subsequently changing whole brain networks, and thus providing an important hint towards potential future therapeutic approaches.
gender_roles	objective: the main study objective was to identify perceived barriers to achieving glycemic control among the arab population in israel, by both members of the arab community with type 2 diabetes and by primary care teams working with the arab community. methods: a series of six focus groups using qualitative research methodology were conducted in two phases among people with diabetes and primary care professionals treating them. results: the perception of the disease among people with diabetes was one of low severity. barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle and to self-management included awareness of the need, financial considerations regarding medication, and traditional gender roles. food preparation in family life was identified as a strong cultural determinant. the health literacy needs for more in-depth and accessible educational programs were identified. primary care staff viewed the needs similarly, with the exception of the need for in-depth instructional materials. conclusion and practice implications: the understanding of the significance of healthy lifestyles and self-management was essential for developing culturally appropriate implementation programs and policy. consultation with, and involvement of patient groups in needs assessment and planning is essential and should be established in policy that promotes best practice and health promotion in chronic illness.
gender_roles	using insights from a case study on the allocation of labor in subsistence households in mozambique, this study develops a conceptual framework for examining linkages between time poverty and farm production. an unexpected event such as a health crisis increases the demand for labor provided by women, thus making them more time poor. the model and numerical simulations show that a deterioration in a woman 's time constraint will have an adverse effect on agricultural output of the household. this occurs because most women respond to an increase in household work by reducing their work hours on the farm and by reducing their leisure time. the latter outcome is expected to have a negative effect on women 's physical and mental health, which will then cause a decline in their productivity on the farm.
antisocial_personality_disorder	individuals with a history of child abuse are at high risk for depression, anxiety disorders, aggressive behavior, and substance use problems. the goal of this paper is to review studies of the genetics of these stress-related psychiatric disorders. an informative subset of studies that examined candidate gene by environment (gxe) predictors of these psychiatric problems in individuals maltreated as children is reviewed, together with extant genome wide association studies (gwas). emerging findings on epigenetic changes associated with adverse early experiences are also reviewed. meta-analytic support and replicated findings are evident for several genetic risk factors; however, extant research suggests the effects are pleiotropic. genetic factors are not associated with distinct psychiatric disorders, but rather diverse clinical phenotypes. research also suggests adverse early life experiences are associated with changes in gene expression of multiple known candidate genes, genes involved in dna transcription and translation, and genes necessary for brain circuitry development, with changes in gene expression reported in key brain structures implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders. the finding of pleiotropy highlights the value of using the research domain criteria (rdoc) framework in future studies of the genetics of stress-related psychiatric disorders, and not trying simply to link genes to multifaceted clinical syndromes, but to more limited phenotypes that map onto distinct neural circuits. emerging work in the field of epigenetics also suggests that translational studies that integrate numerous unbiased genome-wide approaches will help to further unravel the genetics of stress-related psychiatric disorders.

problem-solving	this article has three objectives. it first examines whether the latest version of simcity can achieve learning objectives related to systems thinking, problem solving, creativity, and regional understanding in the classroom. second, it examines whether the game influences student interest in planning. third, it considers whether the game impacts students' perception of the discipline. using instructor observation, students' game creations, and surveys, we find that the game can achieve the aforementioned learning objectives, increase student interest, and increase the perception of planning as being creative and fun. the results have implications for instruction, student recruitment, and perceptions of the field.
prejudice	fifty years after the end of the algerian war of independence, french colonization in algeria (1830-1962) is still a very controversial topic when sporadically brought to the forefront of the public sphere. one way to better understand current intergroup relationships between french of french origin and french with algerian origins is to investigate how the past influences the present. this study explores french students' emotional reactions to this historical period, their ideological underpinnings and their relationship with the willingness to compensate for past misdeeds, and with prejudice. results show that french students with french ascendants endorse a no-remorse norm when thinking about past colonization of algeria and express very low levels of collective guilt and moral-outrage related emotions, especially those students with a right-wing political orientation and a national identification in the form of glorification of the country. these group-based emotions are significantly related to pro-social behavioral intentions (i.e. the willingness to compensate) and to prejudice toward the outgroup.
leadership	this study was designed to examine and intervene into student behaviours to promote a democratic, inclusive and participatory focus within sport education. to achieve an increased understanding of and changes within student behaviours, a collaborative participatory action research methodology was applied to provide voice to students as agents of change. the research progressed throughout an entire school year and was cast in two stages. the first was a season of basketball that provided some baseline with respect to issues of equity and inclusion. this was followed by an intervention stage (seasons of handball, soccer and volleyball) in which the identified issues were acted upon. based upon issues unearthed during the action research cycles the intervention focused on legitimating different levels of participation through (1) a reconfiguration of the learning content, peer teaching activities and competition formats, (2) the discussion of inequity, exclusion, gender stereotyping and discrimination emerging from group dynamics within focus groups interviews and (3) the promotion of positive leadership behaviours of the student coaches through leadership seminars conducted outside the gym. by the end of the year, there was significant evidence of inclusive membership accompanied by the development of mutual trust among students and shared contributions towards a common and inclusive goal. a close interrelatedness was found between game competence development, trajectories of participation and sense of membership, the restructuring of power relations and the sharing of knowledge and investment of dominant and higher-skilled students towards more inclusive team goals. the sport education curriculum alone was insufficient to dismantle the deeply rooted negative cultural influences of community-based sports that influenced equity and inclusion. however, by planning and implementing a specific intervention that used the educational resources of sport education proactively it was possible to promote a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.
borderline_personality_disorder	one of the most common personality disorders among adolescents and young adults is the borderline personality disorder (bpd). the objective of current study was to assess three questionnaires that can reliably screen for bpd in adolescents and young adults (n = 53): the mclean screening instrument for bpd (msi-bpd; zanarini et al., 2003), the personality diagnostic questionnaire 4th edition - bpd scale (pdq-4 bpd; hyler, 1994), and the scid-ii patient questionnaire - bpd scale (scid-ii-pq bpd). the nine criteria of bpd according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-iv (dsm-iv; apa, 1994) were measured with the structural clinical interview for dsm-ivaxis ii disorders - bpd scale (scid-ii; first, spitzer, gibbon, williams, & benjamin, 1995). correlations between the questionnaires and the scid-ii were calculated. in addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaires were tested. all instruments predicted the bpd diagnosis equally well.
false_memories	the testing effect refers to the finding that retrieval practice in comparison to restudy of previously encoded contents can improve memory performance and reduce time-dependent forgetting. naturally, long retention intervals include both wake and sleep delay, which can influence memory contents differently. in fact, sleep immediately after encoding can induce a mnemonic benefit, stabilizing and strengthening the encoded contents. we investigated in a series of 5 experiments whether sleep influences the testing effect. after initial study of categorized item material (experiments 1, 2, and 4a), paired associates (experiment 3), or educational text material (experiment 4b), subjects were asked to restudy encoded contents or engage in active retrieval practice. a final recall test was conducted after a 12-hr delay that included diurnal wakefulness or nocturnal sleep. the results consistently showed typical testing effects after the wake delay. however, these testing effects were reduced or even eliminated after sleep, because sleep benefited recall of restudied items but left recall of retrieved items unaffected. the findings are consistent with the bifurcation model of the testing effect (kornell, bjork, & garcia, 2011), according to which the distribution of memory strengths across items is shifted differentially by retrieving and restudying, with retrieval strengthening items to a much higher degree than restudy does. on the basis of this model, most of the retrieved items already fall above recall threshold in the absence of sleep, so additional sleep-induced strengthening may not improve recall of retrieved items any further.
eating_disorders	objectives: eating disorders are important health issues of body image disturbances. these disorders are not limited to western countries or females. the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence of eating disorders among iranian male adolescents and the associated factors. materials and methods: this cross-sectional survey was conducted on 433 male high school students. the study assessed the effects of demographic characteristics, social pressures from family and friends, self-esteem, body satisfaction and media on eating disorders. results are presented in terms of odds ratio (or) and confidence interval (ci). p-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. results: about 15% of male adolescents had eating disorders. there were significant differences between the two groups (with and without eating disorders) in terms of social pressure, body dissatisfaction and body mass index (bmi). body dissatisfaction (or = 1.23, 95% ci: 1.01-1.50) and bmi (or = 1.14, 95% ci: 1.06-1.21) were identified as predictive factors in eating disorders. conclusions: the results indicated the need for more attention to eating disorders and predictive factors in iranian adolescents as an example of asian cultures.
attention	wiener processes have received considerable attention in degradation modeling over the last two decades. in this paper, we propose a generalized wiener process degradation model that takes unit-to-unit variation, time-correlated structure and measurement error into considerations simultaneously. the constructed methodology subsumes a series of models studied in the literature as limiting cases. a simple method is given to determine the transformed time scale forms of the wiener process degradation model. then model parameters can be estimated based on a maximum likelihood estimation (mle) method. the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and the probability distribution function (pdf) of the wiener process with measurement errors are given based on the concept of the first hitting time (fht). the percentiles of performance degradation (pd) and failure time distribution (ftd) are also obtained. finally, a comprehensive simulation study is accomplished to demonstrate the necessity of incorporating measurement errors in the degradation model and the efficiency of the proposed model. two illustrative real applications involving the degradation of carbon-film resistors and the wear of sliding metal are given. the comparative results show that the constructed approach can derive a reasonable result and an enhanced inference precision.

prosocial_behavior	prosocial behavior is considered an important dimension of positive development. although previous research suggests the quality of children 's early relationships may influence prosocial behaviors, the specific contributions of mother, father and teacher to children 's prosocial behavior have been less examined. this is a cross-sectional study that investigates (a) the combined associations between mother-, father- and teacher-child relationships, and prosocial behavior in 168 children aged 36-72 months, and (b) the mediating role of the teacher-child relationship in the association between the parent-child relationship and prosocial behavior. results suggested a positive link between the quality of relationships with early caregivers and children 's prosocial behavior. the quality of both father- and teacher-child relationships were found to have a direct association with children 's prosocial behavior. the quality of the mother-child relationship was indirectly linked to children 's prosocial behavior, via the teacher-child relationship. results suggesting connections between multiple relational contexts were discussed based on the notion of internal working models proposed by attachment theory. mothers' and fathers' contributions to children 's prosocial behavior were also discussed considering differences on relational styles and changing roles of mothers and fathers from dual-earner families.
problem-solving	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how assessment design was used to enhance students' critical thinking in a subject concerned with business enterprise systems. the study shows positive results and favorable perceptions of the merit of the approach. design/methodology/approach - a case study approach was used to examine how the problem-based assessment task was redesigned to enhance students' critical thinking. the study documents post-graduate accounting students' achievements, including some comparison with results from an earlier version of the task. data were collected using surveys and anonymous student comments. findings - the case study reveals that the merit of the assessment design lay in presenting students with new material that generated some cognitive dissonance, which had to be resolved, rather than just applying subject knowledge to a new scenario. by requiring students to assimilate and harmonize the materials, they were encouraged to think more critically about how their prior learning applied to the problem. originality/value - congruent with widespread calls by employers and professional bodies, there is renewed focus on the importance of developing critical thinking skills as an integral part of higher education courses. whilst achievement is usually realized interdependently through communication, problem solving and analysis, critical thinking must be fostered in the context of the specific professional knowledge. this study contributes knowledge about how students' critical thinking may be fostered, with the added difficulty that the context involves a focus on the role and value of technology.
social_cognition	we herein report the case of a 75-year-old male who had shown many psychiatric symptoms, but whose autopsy disclosed the presence of dementia with lewy bodies (dlb). when he was 70 years old, the patient had presented with stereotyped behavior, dietary changes, and a decline in social interpersonal conduct in clinical settings, and it was thought that these symptoms were consistent with a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvftd), and he lacked the core features of dlb. nevertheless, this case was pathologically defined as the limbic type of dlb after he died at the age of 75 years. looking retrospectively at the clinical course, it was considered that the following features were suggestive or supportive of dlb: neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms. it can be presumed that the bvftd-like behavioral disturbances were caused by the severe lewy pathology of the locus ceruleus (lc) and left anterior temporal region. the clinical symptoms of dlb might be more multifarious than has conventionally been thought, because the symptoms can be modified by the pathological spread of dlb within the brain. it is important to be aware of these possible symptoms of dlb so as not to overlook the diagnosis in the clinical setting.
schizophrenia	background clozapine remains the only evidence-based treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and prediction of clozapine response is important in developing stratified treatment. we studied potential predictors of clozapine response, applying functional assessments as well as service use. procedures we performed a nationwide cohort study among all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in denmark after 1995 (age, 18 years) who initiated clozapine treatment between 2004 and 2011 with a global assessment of functioning (gaf-f) score registered at clozapine initiation. during up to 2-year follow-up, clinical response was defined as (a) no further hospitalization with schizophrenia or (b) improvement in gaf-f score (moderate improvement: increase, 10; substantial improvement: increase, 20; and gaf-f, 50). we performed cox regression analysis and report adjusted hazard rate ratios (hrrs; 95% confidence intervals [95% cis]). results among 502 clozapine users with a registered gaf-f score, 232 (46.2%) remained out of hospital, 96 (19.1%) achieved moderate functional improvement, and 29 (5.8%) substantial functional improvement. of all potential predictors, voluntary status at clozapine initiation showed borderline statistical significance with nonhospitalization (hrr, 1.61; 95% ci, 0.97-2.67). regarding functional improvement, living with a partner was the strongest predictor with an almost threefold increased hrr (2.78; 95% ci, 1.07-7.23). female sex was only nonsignificantly associated with functional improvement, whereas the chance of substantial improvement decreased by 15% (hrr, 0.85; 95% ci, 0.72-1.00) for each year delay in clozapine initiation among females. conclusions living with a partner was the strongest predictor of functioning after clozapine initiation in this study. although potentially indicating better premorbid functioning, this finding stresses the need and importance of social support during the course of the treatment independent of clinical factors.
child_abuse	intentional childhood poisoning is an uncommon formof child abuse but has a very high risk of morbidity and mortality. patients present with four main categories of illness: metabolic derangements (salt and water ingestion), gastrointestinal symptoms (laxative and ipecac poisoning), hemorrhagic disease (warfarin and superwarfarin exposures), and neurologic symptoms (central nervous systemdepression or excitation). while widely available, routine urine drug screens are of limited value so clinicians must have a high index of suspicion to make these diagnoses.
nonverbal_communication	communicative skills of chimpanzees are of significant interest across many domains, such as developmental psychology (how does communication emerge in prelinguistic beings?), evolution (e.g., did human language evolve from primate gestures?), and in comparative psychology (how does the nonverbal communication of chimpanzees and humans compare?). here we ask about how gestures develop in chimpanzee infants (n=16) that were raised in an interactive program designed to study skill development. data on socio-communicative development were collected following 4hr of daily interaction with each infant, longitudinally from birth through the first year of life. a consistent and significant developmental pattern was found across the contexts of tickle play, grooming, and chase play: infant chimpanzees first engaged in interactions initiated by others, then they initiated interactions, and finally, they requested others to join them in the interaction. gestures were documented for initiating and requesting tickle play, for initiating and requesting grooming, and for initiating and requesting chase play. gestural requests emerged significantly later than gestural initiations, but the age at which gestures emerged was significantly different across contexts. those gestures related to hierarchical rank relations, that is, gestures used by subordinates in interaction with more dominant individuals, such as wrist presenting and rump presenting, did not emerge in the same manner as the other gestures. this study offers a new view on the development of gestures, specifically that many develop through interaction and communicate socio-emotional desires, but that not all gestures emerge in the same manner. am. j. primatol. 76:14-29, 2014.

false_memories	studies on emotional memory for complex events suggest that arousal enhances long-term memory for central and peripheral information. few studies, however, have addressed arousal effect on memory distortion. aiming to investigate the relationship between arousal and true/false memories for central and peripheral information, a recognition test was developed. the test was supported by the brazilian adaptation of the cahill and mcgaugh 's (1995) slideshow procedure. the test was answered by 168 university students one week after they had watched either the low or the high emotional arousal version of the procedure. the arousal version of the story was responsible for better memory retrieval of true peripheral information and false central information.
leadership	posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is common and undertreated among veterans affairs (va) primary care patients. a brief primary care intervention combining clinician support with a self-management mobile app (clinician-supported ptsd coach, csptsd coach) may improve patient outcomes. this study developed and refined an intervention to provide clinician support to facilitate use of the ptsd coach app and gathered va provider and patient qualitative and quantitative feedback on cs-ptsd coach to investigate preliminary acceptability and implementation barriers/ facilitators. va primary care providers and mental health leadership (n = 9) completed a survey and interview regarding implementation barriers and facilitators structured according to the consolidated framework for implementation research (cfir). clinicians who delivered cs-ptsd coach (n = 3) and patients (n = 9) who received it provided feedback on the intervention and implementation process. cs-ptsd coach has high provider and patient acceptability. important implementation factors included that cs-ptsd coach be compatible with the clinics' current practices, have low complexity to implement, be perceived to address patient needs, and have strong support from leadership. diverse factors related to cs-ptsd coach delivery facilitate implementation, provide an opportunity to problem-solve barriers, and improve integration of the intervention into primary care.
leadership	we consider the strategic interactions between fiscal and monetary policies in a monetary union when a fiscal authority enjoys a strategic advantage. in particular we depart from the standard literature on strategic interactions in monetary unions in that we solve a three-stage game, where the two national fiscal authorities do not play simultaneously. we find that there is always an incentive for the leader fiscal authority to play a three-stage game, which leaves the other fiscal authority worse off under demand shocks. this choice leads to more (less) volatile union-wide fiscal stance for demand (supply) shocks compared to the standard narrow-coordination case. this volatility is positively related to demand shocks' asymmetries.

social_cognition	objective: emotion processing abilities might be reduced in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). previous studies of emotion processing in als have inconsistent results, and are limited by variations in task difficulty, modalities examined, and participants' cognitive status. the current study used a battery of emotion processing tasks at differing levels of difficulty and across different modalities (facial affect and voice prosody) to assess the extent of emotion processing deficits in nondemented als. method: 33 als participants with intact basic cognition and 22 healthy controls completed the abbreviated comprehensive affect testing system (cats), which assesses simple and complex facial affect recognition, affective prosody recognition, cross-modal face-prosody integration, and semantic comprehension of affect. participants also completed measures of executive function, mood, and functional impairment. results: als participants showed impairments on complex facial affect recognition, affective prosody recognition, and cross-modal integration. in contrast, simple facial affect recognition and semantic comprehension of affect were intact. als participants did not have significant mood symptoms, and neither mood nor functional impairment was related to emotion processing. performance on the cross-modal composite was related to executive function, however, this relationship was not apparent for facial or prosody recognition within a single modality. conclusions: these results indicate that people living with als without dementia often have subtle difficulties with recognizing emotions in both faces and voices, even in the context of intact basic cognition. clinicians should be aware of the potential for these emotion processing difficulties to be present in als and to affect interpersonal behavior and quality of life.
gender_roles	the purpose of this study was to determine whether emerging adults use relationship television to form their expectations for sexual interaction in romantic relationships. considering emerging adulthood is a unique period of development providing opportunities to experiment with adult identities, and relationship television contains multiple consistent messages about gender roles in sexual relationships, we questioned whether emerging adults' relationship television viewing may be related to their sexual expectations in relationships. our findings indicated women 's relationship television viewing was associated with expecting more sexual interaction in their relationship. men 's sexual expectations were moderated by perceived realism. men who watched more relationship television, and perceived that television to be less realistic, reported expecting less frequent sexual interaction.
prenatal_development	the study on ""prenatal development of the sphenoid in the buffalo (bubalus bubalis) was conducted at the department of veterinary anatomy, college of veterinary science, tirupati. a total 75 buffalo embryos and foctii starting from the 26th day to the 310th day were collected from different slaughter houses. the specimens were fixed, processed for serial paraffin sectioning and the sections were subjected to different staining methods. the prechordal part formed the basisphenoid caudally and the presphenoid cranially. the anterior end of the prechordal part joined with the nasal capsule. the prechordal part was in precartilaginous form at 40 days and cartilaginous form at 45 days. the sphenoid was developed from six ossification centers. ossification was recognized first in the orbitosphenoid, the body of basisphenoid and the alisphenoid at 62 days.
seasonal_affective_disorder	objectivethe present trial evaluated incorporation of bright light therapy in the treatment of chronic nonspecific back pain (cnbp). designa prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open design with three parallel trial arms was used. settingsubjects received a novel therapeutic, an expected therapeutic ineffective low dose, or no light exposure at three different medical centers. patientsa total of 125 cnbp patients reporting pain intensity of 3 points on item 5 of the brief pain inventory (bpi) were included. interventionover 3 weeks, 36 active treatment, 36 placebo controls, and 33 controls received 3 or no supplementary light exposures of 5.000lx or 230lx, respectively. outcome measureschanges in self-reported scores of pain intensity (bpi sub-score 1) and depression (hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire) were the primary outcome measures. secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported overall pain sensation (bpi total score), grade of everyday life impairment (bpi sub-score 2), mood (visual analog scale), and well-being (world health organization-five well-being index). resultschanges in pain intensity were higher (1.0 [0.8-1.6]) in the bright light group compared with controls (0.3 [-0.1-0.8]; effect size d=0.46). changes in the depression score were also higher in the intervention group (1.5 [0.0-2.5]) compared with controls (0.0 [0.0-2.0]; effect size d=0.86). no differences were seen in change scores between intervention vs sham group. conclusionthe present randomized controlled trial shows that light therapy even in low dose could improve depressive symptoms and reduce pain intensity in cnbp patients. further research is needed for optimizing parameters of frequency, dose, and duration of therapeutic light exposure.
depression	a new sandwich structure which core is made of thin-walled semi-ellipsoidal shell is designed, column cell sandwich composite was prepared by pre-panel preparation process. a series of quasi-static axial compression experiments were carried out on 2 x 2 thin-walled semi-ellipsoidal shell, the compression deformation and yield behavior of thin wall semi-ellipsoidal shells with different materials, diameters and wall thicknesses were studied by means of ansys/ls-dyna finite element simulation and experiment. then, the effect of filling mode of epoxy resin on the mechanical properties of column-cell sandwich composites was studied. the results show that the deformation process of the thin spherical shell can be divided into local flattening, axisymmetric depression, non-axisymmetric depression and compaction stage. as the wall thickness increases, the deformation""mode changes from the polygon to the ring and the deformation process become three stages; small diameter requires larger force under the conditions of the same compression displacement, as the diameter increases, the critical displacement of flipping and asymmetric buckling increases; epoxy filled in the spherical shell of the sample specific compression performance is better than filled in the outer shell and better than unfilled with epoxy resin.

prejudice	accumulated research has shown that western christian religiosity often predicts prejudice toward various kinds of outgroups. on the contrary, initial recent evidence indicates that east asian religiosity predicts tolerance of various outgroups-except atheists. to understand these differences, we investigated cognitive (intolerance of contradiction) and emotional (disgust) mechanisms possibly mediating the link between religiosity and prejudice versus tolerance. in study 1 (295 westerners of christian tradition), high disgust contamination and, to some extent, intolerance of contradiction mediated the relationship between religiosity and prejudice against ethnic (africans), religious (muslims), moral (homosexuals), and convictional (atheists) outgroups. however, in study 2 (196 taiwanese of buddhist or taoist tradition), religiosity was unrelated to disgust, and predicted low intolerance of contradiction, and thus tolerance of the same religious, ethnic, and moral outgroups-but still not of atheists. cultural differences in cognition and emotion seem to explain east-west differences in religious prejudice.
child_abuse	this paper examines the association between the great recession and four measures of the risk for maternal child abuse and neglect: (1) maternal physical aggression; (2) maternal psychological aggression; (3) physical neglect by mothers; and (4) supervisory/exposure neglect by mothers. it draws on rich longitudinal data from the fragile families and child wellbeing study, a longitudinal birth cohort study of families in 20 u.s. cities (n = 3177; 50% african american, 25% hispanic; 22% non-hispanic white; 3% other). the study collected information for the 9 year follow-up survey before, during, and after the great recession (2007-2010). interview dates were linked to two macroeconomic measures of the great recession: the national consumer sentiment index and the local unemployment rate. also included are a wide range of socio-demographic controls, as well as city fixed effects and controls for prior parenting. results indicate that the great recession was associated with increased risk of child abuse but decreased risk of child neglect. households with social fathers present may have been particularly adversely affected. results also indicate that economic uncertainty during the great recession, as measured by the consumer sentiment index and the unemployment rate, had direct effects on the risk of abuse or neglect, which were not mediated by individual-level measures of economic hardship or poor mental health.

nonverbal_communication	this research addresses three important issues regarding interpersonal expectancy effects and communication across various modalities. the phenomena of behavioral confirmation and disconfirmation were tested in an original experiment involving 148 participants using computer-mediated communication (cmc). first, this study tested a boundary condition asserted by previous theorists about whether or not confirmation and disconfirmation could occur in communication channels without nonverbal communication. secondly, it shed light on an important causal variable of perceived malleability of interpersonal expectancies in a novel, simultaneous test of confirmation and disconfirmation. lastly, it verified the hyperpersonal model of cmc by demonstrating behavioral confirmation, and extended the model by specifying when disconfirmation occurs online.
borderline_personality_disorder	this study investigated whether self-compassion and emotional invalidation (perceiving others as indifferent to one 's emotions) may explain the relationship of childhood exposure to adverse parenting and adult psychopathology in psychiatric outpatients (n=326). path analysis was used to investigate associations between exposure to adverse parenting (abuse and indifference), self-compassion, emotional invalidation, and mental health when controlling for gender and age. self-compassion was strongly inversely associated with emotional invalidation, suggesting that a schema that others will be unsympathetic or indifferent toward one 's emotions may affect self-compassion and vice versa. both self compassion and emotional invalidation mediated the relationship between parental indifference and mental health outcomes. these preliminary findings suggest the potential utility of self-compassion and emotional schemas as transdiagnostic treatment targets.

problem-solving	background: in order to provide skills that enable people to realize their potential, education should not only develop knowledge and aptitudes, but also contribute to the formation of attitudes and positive values. education systems should be judged in terms of this multidimensional character of education, and the available information indicates that countries differ in the degree to which their students are able to acquire cognitive and non-cognitive competences. therefore, it should be of interest to improve our comprehension of the development of both types of outcomes, a complex process that depends on personal, family, school and contextual factors. while most empirical studies that try to explain educational quality have only considered cognitive results, this study focuses on the non-cognitive ones. methods: we estimate a multivariate multilevel regression model that simultaneously analyzes the determinants of two outcomes attained by argentine students in the program for international student assessment (pisa) 2012 study: a cognitive result the achievement level in mathematics and a non-cognitive one the openness to problem-solving-. results: both types of outcomes seem to differ in their explanatory factors: schools appear to play a greater role in the determination of cognitive achievements than non-cognitive competencies. however, attributes such as gender or home socioeconomic status have a significant influence in both cases. furthermore, although school characteristics seem to be less relevant than individual ones in the determination of both types of results, there is also room to improve their development at school. conclusions: the heterogeneity regarding the variables which explain both types of school outcomes suggests that the policies designed to improve each one of them should be different. nonetheless, the development of these competencies mainly requires an improvement in socioeconomic and educational conditions at home.
child_abuse	the current study tested the hypothesis that mothers who have experienced child maltreatment and aggression within their adult relationships may be at particular risk for misinterpreting infant emotions, leading to less sensitive parenting behaviors. participants were 120 pregnant women recruited for a larger, longitudinal study investigating the role of psychosocial and environmental risk on women and their young children. data were collected during the third trimester of pregnancy, and when children were 1 and 2 years of age. participants completed a projective test designed to elicit individual differences in perceptions of infant emotions and an observer-rated assessment of parenting behaviors was conducted in the family home. using structural equation modeling, we tested associations between maternal interpersonal aggression exposure and perceptions of infant emotion and parenting behaviors. results demonstrated that a history of child abuse and intimate partner conflict were associated with a maternal tendency to view ambiguous infant facial expressions as negative (i.e., negative attribution bias), and in turn, with less parenting sensitivity over time. findings suggest that negative attributions of infant emotion may be 1 mechanism by which a history of trauma and violence exposure contributes to less sensitive parenting for some mothers. implications for intervention include the need for trauma-informed clinical services and psychoeducational methods that help mothers more accurately read and respond to infant emotional expression and bids for connection.
borderline_personality_disorder	the relations of parental warmth, self-conscious emotions, and forgiveness were investigated. university students completed self-report questionnaires online through the university-sponsored website. the questionnaires contained measures of five constructs: parental warmth, empathy, shame, self-forgiveness, and interpersonal forgiveness. from the results, the authors concluded that interpersonal forgiveness and self-forgiveness were predicted by parental warmth, empathy, and shame. empathy mediated the relation of parental warmth with interpersonal forgiveness and self-forgiveness. parental warmth and self-conscious emotions were important in the prediction of both interpersonal forgiveness and self-forgiveness.
nonverbal_communication	background: doctors' verbal and non-verbal communication skills have an impact on patients' health outcomes, so it is important for medical students to develop these skills. traditional, non-verbal communication skills training can involve a tutor manually annotating a student 's non-verbal behaviour during patient-doctor consultations, but this is very time-consuming. tele-conference systems have been used in verbal communication skills training. methods: we describe eqclinic, a system that enables verbal and non-verbal communication skills training during tele-consultations with simulated patients (sps), with evaluation exercises promoting reflection. students and sps can have tele-consultations through the tele-consultation component. in this component, sps can provide feedback to students through a thumbs-up/thumbs-down tool and a comments box. eqclinic automatically analyses communication features in the recorded consultations, such as facial expressions, and provides graphical representations. our 2015 pilot study investigated whether eqclinic helped students be aware of their non-verbal behaviour and improve their communication skills, and evaluated the usability of the platform. students received automated feedback, and sp and tutor evaluations, and then completed self-assessment and reflection questionnaires. results: eight medical students and three sps conducted 13 tele-consultations using eqclinic. more students paid attention to their non-verbal communication and students who were engaged in two consultations felt more confident in their second consultation. students rated the system positively, felt comfortable using it (5.9/7), and reported that the structure (5.4/7) and information (5.8/7) were clear. this pilot provides evidence that eqclinic helps, and positively influences, medical students practise their communication skills with sps using a tele-conference platform. discussion: it is not easy to improve non-verbal communication skills in a short time period. further evaluation of eqclinic with larger numbers will ascertain learning gains and application in health professional training. developing a standard model for the assessment of non-verbal behaviour in tele-consultations and providing students with more valuable evaluation and suggestions are part of our future work.
borderline_personality_disorder	introduction: impulsivity is a psychological phenomenon that has not been extensively studied in headache patients. we aim to assess the presence of impulsivity in patients with chronic migraine (cm) and medication overuse (mo). patients: all patients examined in an outpatient headache clinic between january 2013 and march 2014 were included. episodic migraine, cm, and mo were diagnosed according to ichd-iii beta criteria. we prospectively gathered demographic and clinical characteristics. mood disorders were evaluated using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads) and impulsiveness was assessed with the plutchik impulsivity scale. results: a total of 155 patients were included (22 men, 133 women). the mean age (sd) was 38.2 (11.7) years (range, 18-70); 104 patients (67.1%) presented cm and, among them, 74 (71.1%) had mo. of the patient total, 28.4% met criteria for anxiety, 7.1% for depression and 16.1% for impulsivity. the cm group showed higher scores for hads-anxiety (8.5 [sd 4.5] vs. 6.4 [sd 3.6], p=0.003) and hads-depression (4.4 [4.3] vs. 1.9 [2.3], p < 0.001). among cm cases only, scores for hads-anxiety (9.3 [4.4] vs. 6.8 [4.3], p = 0.01) and hads-depression (5.1 [4.6] vs. 2.7 [2.9], p = 0.002) were higher in patients who also had mo. we found no associations between plutchik scale scores or presence of impulsivity with either cm or mo. conclusion: impulsivity is a common trait in our population of migraine patients, but unlike mood disorders, it is not correlated with either cm or mo.

nonverbal_communication	in an era of condensed treatment and managed care, three trends are gaining prevalence in some graduate training programs and in some circles of the practicing community, limiting clinicians from utilizing the therapeutic techniques needed to help a client achieve long-standing intrapsychic change, a precondition for maintaining therapeutic gains post treatment. the first trend, the equation of empathy with sympathy, hinders the therapeutic dyad from truly understanding a client 's internal experience and implicitly conveys the message that anxiety-provoking material is less welcome in the consulting room. the second trend, prizing cognition over affect, results in a primary focus on secondary thought process, discounting the affective experience that unconsciously steers behavior and thought. this trend is, in large part, due to the widespread dissemination of cognitive-behavioral therapy efficacy research and the belief by some individuals that psychodynamic forms of treatment lack empirical support. the last and most problematic trend, the rigid utilization of treatment manuals, tends to result in a reductionistic approach to treatment, limiting psychotherapy to a set of techniques while also overlooking salient aspects of treatment that can predict positive outcomes. treatment manuals oversimplify the process of therapy; as a result, the therapeutic dyad is less likely to uncover and discover the multiple origins of one 's suffering, contributory factors that are not always readily available to conscious awareness. this paper discusses each trend and the therapeutic implications that result.
depression	this study investigated whether personality traits, psychopathological characteristics, and sociodemographic factors in depressed patients differentiate patients with only suicidal thoughts from those who have attempted suicide. we investigated two groups of patients with an affective disorder: 198 patients with a suicide attempt within the last 3 months (sex ratio male to female, 1: 1.3; mean age male to female, 44.8/44.7 years) and 30 patients without a suicide attempt but with suicidal thoughts (sex ratio male to female, 1: 2; mean age male to female, 39.4/42.6 years) using a comprehensive measurement (mini-international neuropsychiatric interview, structured clinical interview for dsm-4 axis ii disorders, hamilton depression scale, beck depression inventory, state-trait anxiety inventory, hamilton anxiety scale, brief psychiatric rating scale, clinical global impression scale, beck-hopelessness scale, scale for suicide ideation, impulsivity rating scale, barratt impulsivity scale, inventory for the assessment of aggression factors, state-trait anger expression inventory, ways of coping checklist). several differences distinguished the two groups, namely, in personality traits such as anxiety or coping strategies and sociodemographics (e.g., education level). personality traits, psychopathological characteristics, and sociodemographic factors are useful tools for assessing suicidal risk. our findings encourage us to suggest that clinicians pay particular attention to sociodemographic variables such as separation/divorce and a lower education level when conducting risk assessments on suicidal patients.
antisocial_personality_disorder	the inverse relation between serotonin and human aggression is often portrayed as ""reliable,"" ""strong,"" and ""well established"" despite decades of conflicting reports and widely recognized methodological limitations. in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluate the evidence for and against the serotonin deficiency hypothesis of human aggression across 4 methods of assessing serotonin: (a) cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (csf 5-hiaa), (b) acute tryptophan depletion, (c) pharmacological challenge, and (d) endocrine challenge. results across 175 independent samples and over 6,500 total participants were heterogeneous, but, in aggregate, revealed a small, inverse correlation between serotonin functioning and aggression, anger, and hostility (r = -.12). pharmacological challenge studies had the largest mean weighted effect size (r = -.21), and csf 5-hiaa studies had the smallest (r = -.06). potential methodological and demographic moderators largely failed to account for variability in study outcomes. notable exceptions included year of publication (effect sizes tended to diminish with time) and self- versus other-reported aggression (other-reported aggression was positively correlated to serotonin functioning). we discuss 4 possible explanations for the pattern of findings: unreliable measures, ambient correlational noise, an unidentified higher order interaction, and a selective serotonergic effect. finally, we provide 4 recommendations for bringing much needed clarity to this important area of research: acknowledge contradictory findings and avoid selective reporting practices; focus on improving the reliability and validity of serotonin and aggression measures; test for interactions involving personality and/or environmental moderators; and revise the serotonin deficiency hypothesis to account for serotonin 's functional complexity.
problem-solving	co-rumination involves excessive dwelling on negative aspects of problems within a dyadic relationship (rose, 2002). while research has focused on the tendency to co-ruminate within particular relationships, we were interested in examining the behavior of co-rumination outside the context of a preexisting relationship. using an experimental manipulation of co-rumination, the primary goal of this study was to experimentally test the effects of co-rumination and examine its associations with negative and positive affectivity. participants were randomly assigned to one of three interviewing style conditions: a co-ruminative style, a problem-solving style, or a distracting style. results revealed that the co-rumination condition significantly differed from both the distraction and problem-solving conditions on overall negative affect, sadness, and anxiety, but not on hostility. there were no significant differences among groups on positive affect. in conclusion, this investigation revealed detrimental effects of co-ruminative behavior even between strangers.
social_cognition	social network analysis has become a prominent tool to study animal social life, and there is an increasing need to develop new systems to collect social information automatically, systematically, and reliably. here we explore the use of a freely accessible automated learning device for monkeys (aldm) to collect such social information on a group of 22 captive baboons (papio papio). we compared the social network obtained from the co-presence of the baboons in ten aldm testing booths to the social network obtained through standard behavioral observation techniques. the results show that the co-presence network accurately reflects the social organization of the group, and also indicate under which conditions the co-presence network is most informative. in particular, the best correlation between the two networks was obtained with a minimum of 40 days of computer records and for individuals with at least 500 records per day. we also show through random permutation tests that the observed correlations go beyond what would be observed by simple synchronous activity, to reflect a preferential choice of closely located testing booths. the use of automatized cognitive testing therefore presents a new way of obtaining a large and regular amount of social information that is necessary to develop social network analysis. it also opens the possibility of studying dynamic changes in network structure with time and in relation to the cognitive performance of individuals.
child_abuse	objective: to understand effective ways for ems providers to interact with distressed family members during a field intervention involving a recent or impending out-of-hospital ( ooh) pediatric death. methods: eight focus groups with 98 ems providers were conducted in urban and rural settings between november 2013 and march 2014. sixty-eight providers also completed a short questionnaire about a specific event including demographics. seventy-eight percent of providers were males, 13% were either african american or hispanic, and the average number of years in ems was 16 years. they were asked how team members managed the family during the response to a dying child, what was most helpful for families whose child suddenly and unexpectedly was dead in the ooh setting, and what follow up efforts with the family were effective. results: the professional response by the ems team was critical to family coping and getting necessary support. there were several critical competencies identified to help the family cope including: ( 1) that ems provide excellent and expeditious care with seamless coordination, ( 2) allowing family to witness the resuscitation including the attempts to save the child 's life, and ( 3) providing ongoing communication. whether the child is removed from the scene or not, keeping the family appraised of what is happening and why is critical. exclusion of families from the process in cases of suspected child abuse is not warranted. giving tangible forms of support by calling friends, family, and clergy, along with allowing the family time with the child after death, giving emotional support, and follow-up gestures all help families cope. conclusion: the study revealed effective ways for ems providers to interact with distressed family members during an ooh pediatric death
social_cognition	attachment has recently been proposed as a key developmental construct in psychosis, in particular with respect to interpersonal functioning and social cognition. the current study examined the latent structure of the self-report psychosis attachment measure (pam) and its relationship to lower-level perceptual and higher-order inferential social cognitive processes. the pam was administered to 138 psychiatrically stable outpatients with schizophrenia alongside a battery of symptom, social cognitive, and functional measures. pam responses were analyzed using latent variable measurement models, which did not yield evidence of the coherent two-dimensional structure predicted by previous literature. a unidimensional subscale comprising 6 of the 16 original pam items possessed the strongest psychometric properties. this subscale was generally uncorrelated with social cognitive measures and showed weak correlations with some symptoms measures and with community functioning. these results suggest that either the pam may not measure attachment in psychosis or it may measure only attachment anxiety but demonstrate little construct validity in this population. these results tell a cautionary tale regarding making theoretical inferences on the basis of measures without coherent latent structure. attachment measures with stronger psychometric properties will help clarify putative relationships between attachment and social cognitive processes in psychosis.

attention	as promising photocatalyst driven by visible-light, bioi has attracted more and more attention in the past years. however, the surface structure and properties of biol that is the most important place for the photocatalytic have not been investigated in details. to this end, density functional theory was performed to calculate the structural and electronic properties of four low-index stoichiometric surfaces of bioi. it is found that the relaxation of the low-index bioi surfaces are relatively small, especially the (001) surface. thus, the surface energies of biol are very relatively small. moreover, there are a few surface states below the bottom of conduction band in the first layer except the (001) surface, which maybe capture the photo-excited carriers. in all of the most stable terminated planes, all the dangling bonds are cleaved from the broken bi-o bonds. in the case of (001) surface, the dangling bond density of bi atoms for the (001) surface is zero per square nano. therefore, the (001) surface is thermodynamically lowest energy surface of biol, and it is the predominant surface (51.4%). as a final remark, the dangling bonds density of bismuth atoms determines not only the surface energy, but also the surface relaxation. finally, the equilibrium morphology of bioi was also proposed and provided, which is determined through the wulff construction. these results will help us to better understand the underlying photocatalytic mechanism that is related to bioi surfaces, and provide theoretical support for some experimental studies about bioi-based photocatalyst in future.

false_memories	trauma memories can feel more disorganised than more mundane memories. that may be problematic in legal contexts. here we examined: (a) whether that disorganised feeling makes people more susceptible to suggestive questioning during direct examination; and (b) whether cross-examination is the safeguard it is purported to be: that is, we examined whether cross-examination can uncover and correct distorted trauma memories. we showed participants a film depicting a graphic car accident. for some participants, the film unfolded in a temporally disorganised way. we then interviewed participants immediately after the film regarding what they had seen: this 'direct examination' included free recall, cued recall and yes/no questions, some of which were misleading. then, 48 hours later, a second interviewer cross-examined participants. contrary to our predictions, neither manipulation of the film 's temporal organisation, nor participants' self-reported feelings of event disorganisation significantly affected their accuracy of the film during direct or cross-examination nor their recognition memory of the film. instead, we found that regardless of whether participants' memories were distorted by the direct examination, the suggestive nature of the cross-examination introduced sufficient doubt that participants were willing to change their answers. we conclude that traumatic memories are vulnerable to suggestive questioning and, unfortunately, cross-examination is not the legal system 's fail-safe corrective influence.
attention	humans have drastically altered the abundance of animals in marine ecosystems via exploitation. reduced abundance can destabilize food webs, leading to cascading indirect effects that dramatically reorganize community structure and shift ecosystem function. however, the additional implications of these top-down changes for biogeochemical cycles via consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (cnd) are often overlooked in marine systems, particularly in coastal areas. here, we review research that underscores the importance of this bottom-up control at local, regional, and global scales in coastal marine ecosystems, and the potential implications of anthropogenic change to fundamentally alter these processes. we focus attention on the two primary ways consumers affect nutrient dynamics, with emphasis on implications for the nutrient capacity of ecosystems: (1) the storage and retention of nutrients in biomass, and (2) the supply of nutrients via excretion and egestion. nutrient storage in consumer biomass may be especially important in many marine ecosystems because consumers, as opposed to producers, often dominate organismal biomass. as for nutrient supply, we emphasize how consumers enhance primary production through both press and pulse dynamics. looking forward, we explore the importance of cdn for improving theory (e.g., ecological stoichiometry, metabolic theory, and biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships), all in the context of global environmental change. increasing research focus on cnd will likely transform our perspectives on how consumers affect the functioning of marine ecosystems.
eating_disorders	sororities have been identified as placing young women at risk for body image concerns due to a focus on traditional gender role norms and objectification of women. objective: this study assessed the relationship between conformity to feminine gender role norms, self-objectification, and body image surveillance among undergraduate women. participants: in a random sample of undergraduates, the authors examined data from sorority and nonsorority women. methods: in a random sample of undergraduate women, the authors assessed the impact of traditional feminine gender role norms on self-objectification, body image, and feedback regarding physical appearance for sorority and nonsorority undergraduate women. results: three linear regressions were conducted, and only conformity to feminine gender role norms contributed significantly in each regression model. conclusions: regardless of sorority membership, conformity to feminine gender role norms was found to significantly contribute to increased body consciousness, negative body image, and feedback on physical appearance.
prosocial_behavior	children show stronger cooperative behavior in experimental settings as they get older, but little is known about how the environment of a child shapes this development. in adults, prosocial behavior toward strangers is markedly decreased in low socioeconomic status (ses) neighborhoods, suggesting that environmental harshness has a negative impact on some prosocial behaviors. similar results have been obtained with 9-year-olds recruited from low vs. high ses schools. in the current study, we investigate whether these findings generalize to a younger age group and a developing country. specifically, we worked with a sample of thirty-nine 6- to 7-year-olds in two neighborhoods in a single city in romania. using a ""quality dictator game"" that offers greater resolution than previous measures, we find that children living in the harsher neighborhood behave less prosocially toward a stranger than children living in the less harsh neighborhood.
eating_disorders	objectivethis study aims to determine whether the prevalence of lifetime and past 12-month dsm-iv eating disorders (ed) diagnoses differed by body mass index category among men and women in a general population sample. methodsdata from the collaborative psychiatric epidemiology surveys (n=12337 adults) were analysed using logistic regression. analyses were conducted separately by gender. resultslifetime ed prevalence was 2.22% in men and 4.93% in women. in both genders, the prevalence of any lifetime and past 12-month ed, binge eating disorder and recurrent binge eating was highest among obese individuals. among obese men and women, lifetime and past 12-month ed prevalence was highest among those with class iii obesity. conclusioneating disorders were most prevalent among high-weight individuals. this information is important for planning targeted public health ed and obesity prevention and intervention activities, as well as for informing the clinical care of obese individuals. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd and eating disorders association.
false_memories	successful memory retrieval is predicated not only on recognizing old information, but also on correctly rejecting new information (lures) in order to avoid false memories. correctly rejecting lures is more difficult when they are perceptually or semantically related to information presented at study as compared to when lures are distinct from previously studied information. this behavioral difference suggests that the cognitive and neural basis of correct rejections differs with respect to the relatedness between lures and studied items. the present study sought to identify neural activity that aids in suppressing false memories by examining the network of brain regions underlying correct rejection of related and unrelated lures. results showed neural overlap in the right hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal gyrus associated with both related and unrelated correct rejections, indicating that some neural regions support correctly rejecting lures regardless of their semantic/perceptual characteristics. direct comparisons between related and unrelated correct rejections showed that unrelated correct rejections were associated with greater activity in bilateral middle and inferior temporal cortices, regions that have been associated with categorical processing and semantic labels. related correct rejections showed greater activation in visual and lateral prefrontal cortices, which have been associated with perceptual processing and retrieval monitoring. thus, while related and unrelated correct rejections show some common neural correlates, related correct rejections are driven by greater perceptual processing whereas unrelated correct rejections show greater reliance on salient categorical cues to support quick and accurate memory decisions.
problem-solving	tobacco and alcohol use are linked behaviors that individually and synergistically increase the risk for negative health consequences. this study was a two-group, randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of a behavioral intervention, ""motivation and problem solving plus"" (maps +), designed to concurrently address smoking cessation and the reduction of at-risk drinking. targeted interventions may promote coaction, the likelihood that changing one behavior (smoking) increases the probability of changing another behavior (alcohol use). puerto ricans (n = 202) who were smokers and at-risk drinkers were randomized to standard mapstreatment focused exclusively on smoking cessation (saviaps), or maps +, focused on cessation and at-risk drinking reduction. drinking outcomes included: number of at-risk drinking behaviors, heavy drinking, binge drinking, and drinking and driving. maps + did not have a significant main effect on reducing at-risk drinking relative to s-maps. among individuals who quit smoking, maps + reduced the number of drinking behaviors, the likelihood of meeting criteria for heavy drinking relative to s-maps, and appeared promising for reducing binge drinking. maps + did not improve drinking outcomes among individuals who were unsuccessful at quitting smoking. maps + showed promise in reducing at-risk drinking among puerto rican smokers who successfully quit smoking, consistent with treatment enhanced coaction. integrating an alcohol intervention into cessation treatment did not reduce engagement in treatment, or hinder cessation outcomes, and positively impacted at-risk drinking among individuals who quit smoking. findings of coaction between smoking and drinking speak to the promise of multiple health behavior change interventions for substance use treatment and chronic disease prevention.

prejudice	space and spatiality had been a thorn in philosophy 's side from time immemorial. spatiality, immediately associated with corporeality, finitude, even death, properly speaking constituted problems for philosophy; enigmas posed to philosophy to disrupt its cool complacency. the root of the difficulty, it seems, rests on nothing more than a prejudice: the rightful domain of philosophy is time, understood as pure continuous duration, the image of eternity; the compartmentalised units of space are (always in the plural) the province of cartographers and geographers, but certainly not the philosopher, lost in his transcendent contemplation. what follows then is a preliminary study, or better an etude deploying variations on a single theme: how can we liberate space from the cartesian grid under which it has been imprisoned for so long, so as to open up its free expanse? what might it be to think of space as a form of duration, without breaks, without borders, without boundaries? and in the last instance, is this pure void not another name for the very being of consciousness itself?
depression	objectivethe aim of this study was to explore the preferred acculturation strategies adopted by indian subcontinental adolescents living in australia. the study also examined the demographic, ethnocultural, and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups' attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. methoda cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. multivariate data analysis was conducted. pearson 's correlation, analysis of variance, and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. resultsintegration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents' ethnicity, their ethnic identity, friendship choices, acculturative stress, sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. the findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of indian subcontinental adolescents, including their ethnic identity search and commitment, their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. conclusionseducational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups, especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. the inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups.
schizophrenia	individuals living with schizophrenia are 2-3 times more likely to experience type 2 diabetes mellitus. diabetes medication adherence is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. we conducted a meta analysis of diabetes medication adherence among people with schizophrenia, and compared this to those without schizophrenia. a systematic search strategy was used to identify all articles reporting adherence to diabetes medications among patients with schizophrenia. in total, 10 unique studies reporting data from 33,910 people with schizophrenia were included. random effects meta-analysis showed people with schizophrenia adhered to medication on 77.3% of days prescribed (n=32080, 95%ci=73.6-81%, i-2=99.2%,), and adhered on 4.6% more days per year than those without schizophrenia (p80% adherence over 12-24 month) to diabetes medication, which was significantly more than those without schizophrenia (or=1.34, 95%c1: 1.18-1.52, p < 0.01). factors which were positively associated with diabetes medication adherence were age, number of outpatient visits, along with multiple medication administration variables. future prospective research should examine diabetes monitoring, medication prescription, and subsequent adherence in fully representative samples. novel interventions for maximizing compliance to diabetes medication in this vulnerable population should also be explored.
prenatal_development	background. the brachial plexus is an important anatomical structure. it can be damaged in both the perinatal and postnatal periods as a result of injury. the available literature does not provide much discussion of the development of the brachial plexus in human fetuses. objectives. the goal of the study was a mathematical analysis of fetal brachial plexus growth and geometry. material and methods. the study examined 220 human brachial plexuses, derived from 110 fetuses (including 50 females - 45.45%) aged 14-32 weeks of fetal life, with a crown-rump length (crl) ranging from 80 to 233 mm. anthropological methods, preparation, digital image acquisition, the image j measurement tool, the scion image for windows program and statistical methods were applied. in each fetus, somatic as well as linear parameters were observed: lengths, diameters and distances between the nerves making up the brachial plexus geometry. results. in the majority of the linear parameters analyzed, no sexual dimorphism or asymmetry were observed. the following asymmetries and sexual dimorphisms appear to be significant from the clinical point of view: asymmetry in the length of the c-7 and th-1 nerve left radix, asymmetry in the diameters of the musculocutaneous nerve on the left and the median and ulnar nerves on the right; as well as an increased distance between nerves roots in female fetuses. the weekly growth of individual parts of the plexus varied, as did the correlation ratios among them. the most rapid growth was observed between the 14th and 18th weeks, and the slowest between the 24th and 28th weeks. four formulae were used in the mathematical growth model: linear regression, logarithmic function, the von bertalanffy growth model and the gompertz curve. conclusions. the prenatal development of the brachial plexus is not constant. the applied mathematical functions proved useful in describing its growth rate (adv clin exp med 2012, 2, 151-167).
leadership	following the call to investigate whether the theory of leadership could be applicable in temporary organizations, this research examined the associations among transformational leadership (tfl), subordinate work engagement (weg) and project turnover intention (pti) in project settings. in addition, a subordinate 's identification with the project is proposed as a social identity mechanism through which transformational project managers exert influence on subordinate work outcomes. the model is tested based on the data collected from a sample of 162 employees working in infrastructure projects located in china. transformational leadership is found to positively relate to subordinates' work engagement and negatively relate to subordinates' project turnover intentions. furthermore, project identification completely mediates the tfl-weg relationship, whereas it partially mediates the tfl pti relationship. these findings contribute to literature by extending the extant transformational leadership approaches in the context of temporary organization, and by broadening the leadership research in conjunction with social identity theory.

nonverbal_communication	considering the unique nature of online environments, which limit some aspects of nonverbal communication, fostering robust and lasting teacher student relationships in online classes may be challenging. moreover, the structural features of online settings may create a learning environment where students have minimal knowledge about the instructor. the role of teacher self-disclosure (sd) in e-learning settings rarely has been tested, although decades of instructional communication research demonstrate its significance. structural equation model analysis results suggest that teacher self-disclosure and students' emotional responses toward teacher sd enhance teacher student relationship satisfaction, which in turn increases perceived knowledge gain and class satisfaction. further, the current study compares teacher sd and its impacts in online and ftf classes by conducting a multiple group comparison analysis. findings suggest that the effect of teacher sd upon teacher student relationship satisfaction is stronger online compared to ftf classes.

social_cognition	functional neuroimaging studies have suggested the existence of 2 largely distinct social cognition networks, one for theory of mind (taking others' cognitive perspective) and another for empathy (sharing others' affective states). to address whether these networks can also be dissociated at the level of brain structure, we combined behavioral phenotyping across multiple socio-cognitive tasks with 3-tesla mri cortical thickness and structural covariance analysis in 270 healthy adults, recruited across 2 sites. regional thickness mapping only provided partial support for divergent substrates, highlighting that individual differences in empathy relate to left insular-opercular thickness while no correlation between thickness and mentalizing scoreswas found. conversely, structural covariance analysis showed clearly divergent network modulations by socio-cognitive and -affective phenotypes. specifically, individual differences in theory of mind related to structural integration between temporo-parietal and dorsomedial prefrontal regions while empathy modulated the strength of dorsal anterior insula networks. findings were robust across both recruitment sites, suggesting generalizability. at the level of structural network embedding, our study provides a double dissociation between empathy and mentalizing. moreover, our findings suggest that structural substrates of higher-order social cognition are reflected rather in interregional networks than in the the local anatomical markup of specific regions per se.
nonverbal_communication	with the disturbing increase of children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) in malaysia, a lot of efforts and studies are put forward towards understanding and managing matters related to asd. one way is to find means of easing the social communications among these children and their caretakers, particularly during intervention. if the caretaker is able to comprehend the children emotional state of mind prior to therapy, some sort of trust and attachment will be developed. however, regulating emotions is a challenge to these children. nonverbal communication such as facial expression is difficult for asd children. therefore, we proposed the use of walking patterns (i.e. gait) to detect the type of emotions of asd children. even though using gait for emotion recognition is common among normal individuals, none can be found done on children with asd. thus, the aim of this paper is to conduct a preliminary review on the possibilities of carrying out gait-based emotion detection among asd children with regards to the emotional types, gait parameters and methods of gait data acquisition.

false_memories	the present study investigates the relationship between violent false memories and delinquent and aggressive behavior in a sample of adolescents. two hundred eleven participants completed measures of aggressive and delinquent behavior and performed a modified version of the deese-roediger-mcdermott (drm) paradigm, a false memory task for lists of associated words. participants were presented with a list of ambiguously violent words and three lists of neutral words. for each list a free recall task was performed. violent false memories were significantly associated with delinquent behaviors in both genders, whereas a significant correlation with aggressive behaviors was found only in males. a multilevel multiple regression showed that the prediction of delinquent behaviors was improved by entering violent false memories into the model as a further predictor, whereas no effect was found for aggressive behaviors. these findings indicate a significant association of violent false memories with delinquent behavior in adolescents.

nonverbal_communication	background: in the interests of patient health outcomes, it is important for medical students to develop clinical communication skills. we previously proposed a telehealth communication skills training platform (eqclinic) with automated nonverbal behavior feedback for medical students, and it was able to improve medical students' awareness of their nonverbal communication. objective: this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of eqclinic to improve clinical communication skills of medical students. methods: we conducted a 2-group randomized crossover trial between february and june 2016. participants were second-year medical students enrolled in a clinical communication skills course at an australian university. students were randomly allocated to complete online eqclinic training during weeks 1-5 (group a) or to complete eqclinic training during weeks 8-11 (group b). eqclinic delivered an automated visual presentation of students' nonverbal behavior coupled with human feedback from a standardized patient (sp). all students were offered two opportunities to complete face-to-face consultations with sps. the two face-to-face consultations were conducted in weeks 6-7 and 12-13 for both groups, and were rated by tutors who were blinded to group allocation. student-patient observed communication assessment (soca) was collected by blinded assessors (n=28) at 2 time points and also by an sp (n=83). tutor-rated clinical communications skill in face-to-face consultations was the primary outcome and was assessed with the soca. we used t tests to examine the students' performance during face-to-face consultations pre-and postexposure to eqclinic. results: we randomly allocated 268 medical students to the 2 groups (group a: n=133; group b: n=135). soca communication skills measures (score range 4-16) from the first face-to-face consultation were significantly higher for students in group a who had completed eqclinic training and reviewed the nonverbal behavior feedback, compared with group b, who had completed only the course curriculum components (p=.04). furthermore, at the second face-to-face assessment, the group that completed a teleconsultation between the two face-to-face consultations (group b) showed improved communication skills (p=.005), and the one that had teleconsultations before the first face-to-face consultation (group a) did not show improvement. conclusions: the eqclinic is a useful tool for medical students' clinical communication skills training that can be applied to university settings to improve students clinical communication skills development.
schizophrenia	we investigated the relationship between the functional insertion/deletion (i/d) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) gene and the risk of nicotine dependence in croatian schizophrenia patients. we also tested whether interactions between ace-i/d polymorphism and smoking status affected the clinical psychopathology findings in patients as measured using positive and negative symptom scale (panss) scores. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to genotype 267 chronically ill schizophrenia patients (140 males/127 females). there were no significant differences in the distribution of ace genotypes and alleles in male or female schizophrenia patients who were stratified based on their smoking status. however, there was a trend toward a difference in the ace genotype distribution in female smokers vs. nonsmokers (chi(2) = 5.13, p = 0.077) that was due mainly to the significant overrepresentation of ace-id heterozygous genotypes in female smokers compared to nonsmokers (62.3 vs. 42.0%, p = 0.025). ace-id heterozygous females had about a twofold higher smoking risk than ace-ii and ace-dd homozygous carriers (or = 2.29, 95% ci 1.1-4.7, p = 0.026). we observed no contribution of the ace genotype-smoking interaction to panss psychopathology. this is the first study to investigate the possible association between ace-i/d polymorphism and nicotine dependence in schizophrenia. our results suggest that the ace-i/d polymorphism may be relevant in determining the risk of nicotine dependence in female patients with schizophrenia while the ace genotype-smoking interaction does not contribute to the clinical expression of schizophrenia.
nonverbal_communication	objectives: the aim of the present study is to investigate the organization of armstrong 's nonverbal behavior in deceptive statements and in those statements in which deception is not proven. the final aim of this study is to show that t-pattern methodology can be a useful tool in research about doping behavior. design: in this observational study we focused on armstrong 's micro-expressions (action units, gaze movements, head movements) drawing observational material from different videos excerpts where armstrong made doping-related statements. a baseline of armstrong 's deceptive behavior was established by selecting three video samples from 2005 in which he fully denied ever having taken performance-enhancing drugs. they were compared to the interview conducted by oprah winfrey in january 2013, in which he admitted doping but denied the specific charges of bullying and corruption. method: our approach is based on the detection of statistically significant hierarchical sequences of behaviors in time, called t-patterns (temporal patterns). the algorithm, implemented in theme software, determines whether apparently arbitrary events sequentially repeat, within a specified time interval, at a rate greater than that expected by chance. results: data analyses allowed identifying distinctive patterns for each of the two conditions. the baseline showed a very limited number of patterns, highlighting low level of complexity and the presence of stereotyped behaviors. in the oprah video samples, the number and complexity of distinctive patterns was significantly higher, and most of them included gaze shifting behaviors. conclusions: t-pattern methodology might be an effective strategy to detect nonverbal features of deception, integrated with more traditional and established practice, in order to improve anti-doping measures and fight this spreading phenomenon.

borderline_personality_disorder	this is the first of two companion papers describing concepts and techniques of a mentalization-based approach to understanding and managing family violence. we review evidence that attachment difficulties, sudden high levels of arousal, and poor affect control contribute to a loss of mentalizing capacity, which, in turn, undermines social learning and can favor the transgenerational transmission of violent interaction patterns. it is suggested that physically violent acts are only possible if mentalizing is temporarily inhibited or decoupled. however, being mentalized in the context of attachment relationships in the family generates epistemic trust within the family unit and reduces the likelihood of family violence. the implications of this framework for therapeutic work with families are discussed.
false_memories	although recent work suggests that opposite-sex facial attractiveness is less salient in memory when individuals are in a committed romantic relationship, romantic relationship quality can vary over time. in light of this, we tested whether activating concerns about romantic relationship quality strengthens memory for attractive faces. partnered women were exposed briefly to faces manipulated in shape cues to attractiveness before either being asked to think about a moment of emotional closeness or distance in their current relationship. we measured sensitivity in memory for faces as the extent to which they recognized correct versions of studied faces over versions of the same person altered to look either more or less-attractive than their original (i.e., studied) version. contrary to predictions, high relationship quality strengthened hit rate for faces regardless of the sex or attractiveness of the face. in general, women 's memories were more sensitive to attractiveness in women, but were biased toward attractiveness in male faces, both when responding to unfamiliar faces and versions of familiar faces that were more attractive than the original male identity from the learning phase. however, findings varied according to self-rated attractiveness and a psychometric measure of the quality of their current relationship. attractive women were more sensitive to attractiveness in men, while their less-attractive peers had a stronger bias to remember women as more-attractive and men as less-attractive than their original image respectively. women in better-quality romantic relationships had stronger positive biases toward, and false memories for, attractive men. our findings suggest a sophisticated pattern of sensitivity and bias in women 's memory for facial cues to quality that varies systematically according to factors that may alter the costs of female mating competition ('market demand') and relationship maintenance.
