prenatal_development	the increasing functional integrity of the organism during fetal maturation is connected with increasing complex internal coordination. we hypothesize that time scales of complexity and dynamics of heart rate patterns reflect the increasing inter-dependencies within the fetal organism during its prenatal development. we investigated multi-scale complexity, time irreversibility and fractal scaling from 73 fetal magnetocardiographic 30 min recordings over the third trimester. we found different scale dependent complexity changes, increasing medium scale time irreversibility, and increasing long scale fractal correlations (all changes p < 0.05). the results confirm the importance of time scales to be considered in fetal heart rate based developmental indices.

attention	roofers have long suffered from low back disorders (lbds), which are a primary nonfatal injury in construction. ergonomic studies have identified several risk factors associated with lbds in workplaces and developed biomechanical models for general lbd risk assessments. however, these models cannot be directly used for assessments in roof workplaces because they are designed for general tasks without considering roofers' posture variance and effects of working on slanted roof surfaces. this paper examined the relationship between roofing work-related factors and lbd risk among roofers using a laboratory assessment. a pitch-configurable wood platform was built to mimic the rooftop. the maximum trunk flexion angle and normalized electromyography (emg) signals were measured as indicators using a motion capture system and a skeletal muscle signal recording system under different settings, i.e., different roof slopes, postures, facing directions, and working paces. the results indicated the measured factors with significant effects on the lbd development and revealed unfavorable conditions (e.g., using a stooped posture to work on low-pitch rooftops at a fast pace) where the work on rooftops needs particular attention. such information is useful for systematic understanding of roofing nonfatal lbd developments among construction professionals and may enable development of interventions and guidelines for reducing the prevalence of lbds at roofing jobsites.

eating_disorders	billions of birds migrate long distances to either reach breeding areas or to spend the winter at more benign places. on migration, most passerines frequently stop over to rest and replenish their fuel reserves. to date, we know little regarding how they decide that they are ready to continue their journey. what physiological signals tell a bird 's brain that its fuel reserves are sufficient to resume migration? a network of hormones regulates food intake and body mass in vertebrates, including the recently discovered peptide hormone, ghrelin. here, we show that ghrelin reflects body condition and influences migratory behavior of wild birds. we measured ghrelin levels of wild garden warblers (sylvia borin) captured at a stopover site. further, we manipulated blood concentrations of ghrelin to test its effects on food intake and migratory restlessness. we found that acylated ghrelin concentrations of garden warblers with larger fat scores were higher than those of birds without fat stores. further, injections of unacylated ghrelin decreased food intake and increased migratory restlessness. these results represent experimental evidence that appetite-regulating hormones control migratory behavior. our study lays a milestone in migration physiology because it provides the missing link between ecologically dependent factors such as condition and timing of migration. in addition, it offers insights in the regulation of the hormonal system controlling food intake and energy stores in vertebrates, whose disruption causes eating disorders and obesity.
borderline_personality_disorder	suicidal behavior among u.s. military personnel persists as a significant public health issue. previous research indicates the primary motive for suicide attempts among military personnel is the desire to reduce or alleviate emotional distress, a finding that converges with studies in nonmilitary samples. much less is understood about the consequences of a first suicide attempt that could influence the occurrence of additional suicide attempts. in order to identify these contingencies, 134 active duty soldiers who had attempted suicide (n=69 first-time attempters, n=65 multiple attempters) participated in structured interviews focused on their experiences immediately following their first attempt. soldiers were more likely to have made multiple suicide attempts if they were younger at the time of their first attempt, were not admitted to a hospital or treatment program after their first attempt, or experienced emotional and psychological relief immediately afterwards. results suggest that soldiers who experience emotional and/or psychological relief immediately after their first suicide attempt or do not receive treatment are more likely to make additional suicide attempts.

prosocial_behavior	this paper explores the effect of video game content, context and experience on cooperative behavior over three research studies. study 1 is a cross-sectional correlation study exploring the relationship between the video game team-play frequency and pro-social behavior, study 2 is a 2 (game content: violent video game and neutral video game) x 2 (game context: single-play and team-play) design with the dependent variable being cooperative behavior and study 3 is a single factor design experiment which examines the effect of the gaming experience on cooperative behavior under a collaborative context. the main findings were that the team-play frequency had a positive correlation with pro-social behavior, and pro-social video game exposure significantly predicted pro-social behavior. collaborative play was found to significantly increase cooperation in both violent and neutral video games. however, the level of gaming experience tended to moderate the relationship between collaborative play and the level of cooperation.

false_memories	rating the relevance of words for the imagined situation of being stranded in the grasslands without survival material leads to exceptionally good memory for these words. this survival processing effect has received much attention because it promises to elucidate the evolutionary foundations of memory. however, the proximate mechanisms of the survival processing effect have to be identified before informed speculations about its adaptive function are possible. here, we test and contrast 2 promising accounts of the survival processing effect. according to the 1st account, the effect is the consequence of the prioritized processing of threat-related information. according to the 2nd account, thinking about the relevance of items for survival stimulates thinking about object function, which is a particularly elaborate form of encoding. experiment 1 showed that the emotional properties of the survival scenario, as manipulated by the negative or positive framing of the scenario, did not influence recall. a focus on threat at encoding led to worse recall than a focus on function. the latter finding was replicated in experiment 2, which further showed that focusing on threat did not lead to a memory advantage over a pleasantness control condition. the beneficial effect of inducing a functional focus at encoding even surpasses that of the standard survival processing instruction. together, the results support the theory that thinking about function is an important component of the survival processing effect.
problem-solving	a vast number of problem solving frameworks have been established in the realms of management, business, mathematics, healthcare, aerospace, law and etcetera towards facilitating effective decision making in normative form in particular. it was learnt that those problem solving frameworks are originated mainly from practical exercises of practitioners and/or improvement/revision of an earlier frameworks. against this bottom-up approach in the establishment of problem solving frameworks, this paper continues promoting the establishment of a problem solving framework following top-down approach by synthesizing the deductive inference i.e., the second inference process of pragmatism 's scientific method. the synthesis has resulted in the identification of the decision sub-processes of pragmatism 's deductive inference namely analysis and demonstration. this paper posits that these two decision processes are aligned with both the key and strategies of the decision processes of the renowned problem solving frameworks in practice in management, business, mathematics, healthcare and law and hence, the decision processes of deductive inference in particular and pragmatism 's philosophical method in general is an alternative for decision making processes and problem solving frameworks following the top-down approach.
prejudice	this study examines the factorial invariance of the scale on beliefs about children 's adjustment in same-sex families (sbcassf) across countries in three samples: chilean, spanish, and hispanic university students. the scale analyzes attitudes toward the consequences of the rearing and education of children by parents with a homosexual sexual orientation. the instrument consists of two subscales: individual opposition and normative opposition. the spanish sample is composed of 199 university students, the chilean sample is made up of 279 students, and the hispanic sample consists of 114 students. the results provide empirical evidence for the reliability of the sbcassf in the samples from the countries and its factorial invariance (strict invariance). results are also provided about differences between countries and by sex. the sbcassf could be a potentially useful measure for educators, psychologists, and other mental health professionals who wish to study beliefs about the child-rearing practices of same-sex parents.
antisocial_personality_disorder	currently, psychopathy and related terms such as antisocial personality disorder are popular yet problematic constructs within forensic psychology and other disciplines. psychopathy is traced typically to the works of pinel and prichard in the early 19(th) century, and it has even been linked to biblical passages, although there appears to be little or no support for the latter claim. the first use of the term psychopathy in german psychiatry of the mid-19(th) century referred only to psychological disturbance in general, or personality diseases', although german psychiatrists such as kraepelin did propose more specific definitions of the term related to social deviance. our modern understanding of psychopathy as a psychiatric disorder of an undetermined genetic origin involving antisocial elements and a lack of feeling or concern for others owes much to the clinical work and writings of cleckley. antisocial personality disorder appears similarly to derive from the work of psychiatric nosologists like kraepelin and schneider, while sociopathy is due more to the work of partridge in the 1920s and 1930s.
nonverbal_communication	whereas the question of verbal versus nonverbal primacy has gained intensive interest, considerably less attention has been devoted to parental response to children 's verbal/nonverbal incongruence. this study comprehensively analyzed parental responses to children 's incongruence during mutual interactions. parent-child interactions (n = 160) in structured joint game sequences were filmed in their homes and analyzed using a mixed multivariate design. unexpectedly, parents related almost equally to verbal and nonverbal channels. the analysis of a wide range of social and situational contexts, including child 's sex, parent 's sex, ses, and task difficulty, highlighted their significant effects and delineated the contexts that activated verbal primacy, nonverbal primacy, and incongruent responses. this study provides a composite theoretical framework for the relative dominance of verbal versus nonverbal communication.
leadership	voters do not associate female candidates with feminine stereotypes, but voters also do not associate female candidates with the qualities most valued in political leaders such as experience and knowledge. current research offers conflicting conclusions on whether female candidates benefit from breaking with feminine norms or face a backlash for being too aggressive and not likable enough. using a series of experiments, i show how counterstereotypic gender strategies, including women emphasizing masculine trait competencies, improve evaluations of female candidates along both masculine and feminine leadership dimensions. these results offer novel insights into how female candidates can overcome perceptual deficits among voters that they lack critical masculine leadership qualities. i also show that female candidates can overcome these biases without losing on traditional feminine strengths such as warmth and likability. however, counterstereotypic female candidates can face a ""likability"" backlash from out-partisan voters. these findings suggest counterstereotypes may be more beneficial for female candidates in a primary election context when voters are copartisans rather than general elections where candidates often need cross-partisan support.
child_abuse	objectives: to test the performance of a single 3d ir t2-weighted sequence compared to a whole-body mri protocol including dwi, t1-weighted and stir 3d ir (3s) in a pediatric population. methods: two radiologists (15 and 30 years of experience),reviewed wbmris: first the stir alone and 2 weeks later the 3s protocol. the indications were variable. only positive findings were explicitly reported. a third reader compared the results to gold standard (gs) exams specific for the pathology. agreement between the two readers, sensitivity and positive predictive value of stir were calculated. results: fifty-four wbmris were included (16 suspected child abuse, 8 chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (crmo), 11 lymphomas, 4 osteosarcomas, 9 neuroblastomas, 6 histiocytosis). the mean age was 6 years 10 months, range: 1 month to 15 years. agreement between readers was of 0.87 [0.82-0.91] for 3d stir, and 0.89 [0.83-0.93] for the 3s protocol. for reader 1 sensitivity of 3d stir was 81.6% and of 3s 81.0%. for reader 2 it was 74.1% for 3d stir and 74.7% for 3s. for both readers and for both protocols, the positive predictive value (ppv) depended on the type of disease (for example 100% histocytosis and osteosarcomas, >90% for child abuse, >85% crmo but <70% for lymphoma and neuroblastoma). conclusions: sensitivities were not different between the 2 protocols, for each reader and were different between the 2 readers for each protocol.

gender_roles	we examine the relationship between unemployment, life satisfaction and affective well-being depending on family status and, within couples, on the employment status of one 's partner. our data, that we collected using the day reconstruction method, show that unemployment is negatively related to life satisfaction, but not to affective well-being. living in a partnership strengthens the loss in life satisfaction of men, but weakens that of women. unemployment of a person 's partner is associated with a smaller loss in life satisfaction for unemployed men, but with a larger loss for women. we argue that these findings reflect to a large extent changes in cognitive well-being, which is closely related to identity utility. the unemployed 's feeling of identity appears to be affected by traditional gender roles.
depression	purpose/background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of quetiapine xr and lithium on actigraphy-measured circadian parameters in patients with bipolar ii depression. methods/procedures: this was an 8-week, open-label, prospective, randomized comparative study. the assessments included the 17-item hamilton depression rating scale score and actigraphic measures concerning the previous 7 days, collected at each visit (weeks 0 [baseline], 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8); the actigraphic data were analyzed with a cosinor analysis. findings/results: medication, time, and the interaction between medication and time were significantly associated with acrophase for the entire group (ps = 0.003, 0.020, and 0.042, respectively). more specifically, acrophase was significantly delayed at weeks 1 and 6 (ps = 0.004 and 0.039, respectively) in the quetiapine xr group. the f statistics significantly increased over time for the entire group (p < 0.001), and there was a significant increase in f statistics on weeks 4 and 6 in the quetiapine xr group (ps = 0.016 and 0.020, respectively) and on weeks 4 and 8 in the lithium group (ps = 0.001 and 0.016, respectively). in addition, scores on the 17-item hamilton depression rating scale were significantly associated with the f statistics during 8 weeks for the entire group (p = 0.008). implications/conclusions: both quetiapine xr and lithium affected several circadian parameters, including peak activity time and robustness of circadian rhythm, but exerted different effects on acrophase in patients with bipolar ii depression. in particular, clinical depressive symptoms were associated with robustness of circadian rhythm during the course of the 8-week treatment.
social_cognition	dopamine levels in the brain influence emotional experiences and empathic responses to others' misfortune. inspired by roles of catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) in dopamine degradation and the link between moral judgment and empathic responses, this study investigated to what extent the va1158met polymorphism of comtgene contributes to individual differences in moral permissibility and empathic dispositions. one thousand two hundred and seventy-two chinese han college students, who were differentiated with the comt va1158met (rs4680) polymorphism, rated permissibility of harm in moral dilemmas and scored their empathic dispositions with interpersonal reactivity index. the results showed a significant association between comtva1158met and the moral permissibility of committing harm. individuals with the val/val genotype, which is associated with lower levels of dopamine, endorsed impersonal harm as more impermissible than those with the val/met and met/met genotypes. results also showed that individuals with the val/val genotype showed higher empathic concern for others' misfortune. the findings provide the first evidence for the link between comt gene and the moral permissibility, highlighting the roles of dopamine in social cognition.

seasonal_affective_disorder	background: to assess the relationship between hours of sunlight and railway suicide attempts, 3-7 days before these attempts. methods: all railway suicide attempts causing railway suspensions or delays of 30 min or more between 2002 and 2006. we used a linear probability model to assess this relationship. this study was conducted at tokyo, kanagawa, and osaka prefectures in japan. data were collected from the railway delay incident database of the japanese railway technical research institute and public weather database of the japan meteorological agency, results: about 971 railway suicides attempts occurred between 2002 and 2006 in tokyo, kanagawa, and osaka. less sunlight in the 7 days leading up to the railway suicide attempts was associated with a higher proportion of attempts (p=0.0243). sunlight over the 3 days before an attempt had a similar trend (p=0.0888). no difference was found in sunlight hours between the clays with (median: 5.6 [iqr: 1.1-8.8]) and without (median: 5.7 [iqr: 1.0-8.9]) railway suicide attempts in the evening. finally, there was no apparent correlation between the railway suicide attempts and the monthly average sunlight hours of the attempted month or those of a month before. limitations: railway suicides were not the main suicidal methods in japan, conclusions: we observed an increased proportion of railway suicide attempts after several days without sunlight. light exposure (blue light or bright white light) in trains may be useful in reducing railway suicides, especially when consecutive days without sunshine are forecasted.

person_perception	clinicians make a variety of assessments about their clients, from judging personality traits to making diagnoses, and a variety of methods are available to do so, ranging from observations to structured interviews. a large body of work demonstrates that from a brief glimpse of another 's nonverbal behavior, a variety of traits and inner states can be accurately perceived. additionally, from these ""thin slices"" of behavior, even future outcomes can be predicted with some accuracy. certain clinical disorders such as parkinson 's disease and facial paralysis disrupt nonverbal behavior and may impair clinicians' ability to make accurate judgments. in certain contexts, personality disorders, anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts and outcomes can be detected from others' nonverbal behavior. additionally, thin slices can predict psychological adjustment to divorce, bereavement, sexual abuse, and wellbeing throughout life. thus, for certain traits and disorders, judgments from a thin slice could provide a complementary tool for the clinician 's toolbox.
media_violence	this study consists of the validation of a scale for the analysis of violent behavior in adolescents. it is a cross-sectional observational study. a total of 437 adolescent students from public and private schools in the city of recife in pernambuco state participated in the study by responding to a questionnaire. semantic and content validation was performed, followed by dimensionality, reliability, discriminant, trust and convergent analysis. the extraction method was principal component analysis with varimax rotation and kaiser normalization. the analysis resulted in a scale for assessment of aggressive behavior of teenagers with 39 items. seven factors were selected and cronbach 's total alpha was 0.830. discriminant analysis revealed groups of items that distinguish subjects between high and low level of violent behavior and between groups of items revealed a positive correlation among 17 items and the reliability of the instrument was confirmed in the retest. the scale revealed evidence of validity as a tool for assessing violent behavior among adolescents.
schizophrenia	auditory hyper-reactivity is a common sensory-perceptual abnormality that interrupts behavioral adaptations in autism spectrum disorders (asd). recently, prolonged acoustic startle response (asr) latency and hyper-reactivity to weak acoustic stimuli were reported in children with asd. indexes of asr and its modulation are known to be stable biological markers for translational research in the adult population. however, little is known about the stability of these indexes in children. thus, the objective of our study was to investigate the stability of neurophysiological asr indexes in children with asd and typical development (td). participants included 12 children with asd and 24 with td. mean startle magnitudes to acoustic stimuli presented at 65-105 db in increments of 10 db were analyzed. average peak startle latency (psl), asr modulation of habituation, and prepulse inhibition were also analyzed. these startle measures were examined after a follow-up period of 15.7 +/- 5.1 months from baseline. at both baseline and in the follow-up period, children with asd had significantly greater startle magnitudes to weak stimuli of 65-85 db and more prolonged psl compared with controls. intraclass correlation coefficients for these asr measures between both periods were 0.499-0.705. none of the asr measures differed significantly between the two periods. our results suggest that prolonged psl and greater startle magnitudes to weak stimuli in children with asd might serve as moderately stable neurophysiological indexes of asd. autism res2016.
