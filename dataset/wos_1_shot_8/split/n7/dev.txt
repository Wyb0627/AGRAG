molecular_biology	culture-based pathogen identification in skull base osteomyelitis, particularly for fungi, is often inaccurate. we report the case of patient with fungal skull base osteomyelitis cured by sustained antifungal therapy after 16 months of debilitating illness. due to medical complications, a strong clinical rationale was needed to justify long-term antifungal therapy. the offending fungus was identified by experimental molecular technology (ibis t5000 universal biosensor); invasive fungal disease was corroborated by biochemical assays. our discussion will help familiarize the otolaryngologist with existing biochemical and molecular diagnostics for invasive fungal disease. we encourage future investigators to study their application in cases of skull base osteomyelitis.
enzymology	a thermostable amidase produced by geobacillus subterraneus rl-2a was purified to homogeneity, with a yield of 9.54 % and a specific activity of 48.66 u mg(-1). the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 111 kda. the amidase of g. subterraneus rl-2a is constitutive in nature, active at a broad range of ph (4.5-11.5) and temperature (40-90 a degrees c) and has a half-life of 5 h and 54 min at 70 a degrees c. inhibition of enzyme activity was observed in the presence of metal ions, such as co2+, hg2+, cu2+, ni2+, and thiol reagents. the presence of mid-chain aliphatic and amino acid amides enhances the enzymatic activity. the acyl transferase activity was detected with propionamide, butyramide and nicotinamide. the enzyme showed moderate stability toward toluene, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, ethylene glycol except acetone, ethanol, butanol, propanol and dimethyl sulfoxide. the k (m) and v (max) of the purified amidase with nicotinamide were 6.02 +/- a 0.56 mm and 132.6 +/- a 4.4 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein by analyzing michaelis-menten kinetics. the results of maldi-tof analysis indicated that this amidase has homology with the amidase of geobacillus sp. c56-t3 (gi|297530427). it is the first reported wide-spectrum thermostable amidase from a thermophilic g. subterraneus.
southern_blotting	to investigate the basis of susceptibility to phenicols and oxazolidinones of the porcine enterococcus faecalis cppf5 despite the presence of the multiresistance gene cfr. southern blotting, conjugation and transformation analyses were conducted to confirm the plasmid location and transferability of cfr in cppf5. the genetic environment of cfr was determined by sequence analysis. transcription and translation of cfr were examined by rtpcr and western blotting, respectively, and modifications at a2503 within the 23s rrna sequence were identified by primer extension. electrotransformation and southern blotting indicated that cppf5 and its transformant 5b2-3 contained two cfr-carrying plasmids 50 and 12 kb in size. the complete 12270 bp sequence of the smaller plasmid, pcppf5, was determined and shared 99.9 (12269/12270 bp) identity with the corresponding region of the cfr-carrying plasmid pef-01 in e. faecalis of cattle origin. moreover, the genetic environment of cfr in the 50 kb plasmid was the same as that in pcppf5 according to sequencing results. although cfr mrna, cfr protein and a modification at the a2503 site were detected, the cfr-carrying transformant 5b2-3 did not have elevated mics of chloramphenicol, florfenicol and linezolid, indicating that cfr fails to mediate resistance to the respective antibiotics in e. faecalis. this is the first report of the cfr gene failing to elevate mics of the corresponding antibiotics. although the genetic basis for the apparent no resistance phenotype remains to be determined, this finding may have implications for surveillance studies that target the cfr gene.
northern_blotting	backgound: beta-carotene exhibits biological activity as provitamin a. key step in vitamin a formation is the cleavage of beta-carotene to retinal by an enzyme designated as beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase (bcm). recently, it is reported that expression of bcm gene in the intestine is under feedback regulation by retinoic acid (ra). however, the regulation of bcm gene expression in various other tissues is still unknown. aim of the study: in the present study, we identified the full-length cdna encoding the rat bcm gene and investigated the regulation of its expression in several tissues by ra in the presence of vitamin a deficiency. methods: we cloned the full-length cdna encoding bcm gene from a rat intestinal cdna library by hybridization screening. the bcm gene expression was examined using northern blotting and reverse transcription-pcr analysis. we also investigated whether bcm gene expression was regulated by retinoids in several tissues of vitamin a-deficient rats. results: sequence analysis of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 1,701 bases encoding a protein of 566 amino acids. the predicted polypeptide showed 94%, 81%, and 66% identity with mouse, human, and chicken bcm, respectively. rat bcm mrna was highly expressed in the intestine and liver, while there was weak expression in the testes, kidneys, and lungs. immunoblotting revealed that rat bcm is a 64-kda protein. bcm gene expression was increased in the small intestine by vitamin a deficiency compared with that in rats on a control diet, while this upregulation was suppressed by all-trans ra (atra) or 9-cis ra (9-cis ra). bcm gene expression in the lungs and testes was also suppressed by atra or 9-cis ra in rats with vitamin a deficiency. however, hepatic bcm gene expression was only decreased by atra and renal expression was not affected by either retinoid. as the small intestine is the major site of beta-carotene conversion, intestinal bcm gene expression may be more tightly regulated. conclusion: these data suggest that bcm gene expression in several tissues may be down-regulated by ra at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal. to prevent an excess of retinol, homeostasis may occur at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal in several tissues.
human_metabolism	purpose of review wasting diseases are characterized by progressive deterioration of nutritional status that negatively influences patients' outcome. the better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of wasting may lead to effective therapies. tryptophan metabolism has unique features suggesting a critical role in influencing human metabolism under normal and pathological conditions. recent findings during disease, inflammatory response favours the local depletion of the essential amino acid tryptophan, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. tryptophan depletion may also mediate immunotolerance to foreign antigens. in contrast, brain accumulation of tryptophan contributes to wasting by increasing oxidative stress and hypothalamic serotonin neurotransmission, and thereby triggering the onset of sickness behaviour followed by depressive-like behaviour. summary tryptophan metabolism is critical in mediating a number of important biological responses. restoring tryptophan metabolism may well result in enhanced recovery from disease.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: oridonin, the major terpene found in rabdosia rubescens (henmsl.) hara, is widely used as a dietary supplement and therapeutic drug. oridonin has been proven to possess good anti-tumour activity, but little is known about its effect on angiogenesis. the aim of this study was to investigate the antiangiogenic effects of oridonin in vivo and in vitro and prove that oridonin anti-tumour activity is based on suppressing angiogenesis. methods: in vitro, the antiangiogenesis effect was studied by proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and tube formation experiments on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (huvecs). in vivo, using the tg (fli1: gfp) zebrafish model, the embryonic vasculogenesis and postnatal regeneration were evaluated. the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) signalling pathway gene expressions were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). furthermore, the inhibition effects on tumour growth and metastasis were observed using a xenograft zebrafish tumour model and xenograft nude mouse tumour model. angiogenesis was assayed by immunostaining with cluster of differentiation 31. importantly, the proteins were identified as being differentially expressed in an in vivo model by two-dimensional electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (2d-ms) and western blot (wb). results: the results indicated that oridonin inhibited huvec proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation and induced cell apoptosis. oridonin inhibited zebrafish angiogenesis during embryonic development and tail fin regeneration. rt-pcr showed that oridonin decreased the vegfa, vegfr2, and vegfr3 expressions in zebrafish, while the tp53 expression increased. moreover, oridonin had strong effects on tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. 2d-ms identified a total of 50 proteins differentially expressed (17 up-expressed, 28 down-expressed). lastly, wb showed that claudin 1, claudin 4, and claudin 7 were closely related to tumour growth and metastasis. conclusion: this study demonstrated that oridonin could inhibit tumour growth and metastasis, which mainly based on oridonin antiangiogenic effects. claudin 1, claudin 4, and claudin 7 were the main contributors to the mechanism.
immunology	internal energy reserves of animals are limited, and the current investment in reproduction often decreases survival or future reproductive success. some studies showed that copulatory activities impair the strength of immune function in insects, while the recent evidence is contradictory. in this study we tested whether copulatory activity affects the rate of encapsulation response in males of calopteryx splendens damselfly in allopatric populations, and in sympatric populations where c. splendens stay together with their superior competitor c. virgo. we also counted the number of eugregarines, which are common parasites of damselflies. copulation activity did not affect the immunity of c. splendens males in allopatric populations. in sympatric populations c. splendens males had more gut parasites, and we found a significant interaction between parasite number and copulatory activity on the rate of encapsulation. our results suggest that the costs of reproduction are higher in infected males, which may affect reproductive investment and sexual selection.
genetics	microneurographic recordings of human muscle sympathetic nerve activity responses to sudden sensory stimuli (ie, arousal) have revealed 2 intraindividually reproducible response profiles in healthy young males that predict different neural and blood pressure responses to more sustained stress. approximately 50% of subjects inhibit muscle sympathetic nerve activity during arousal, whereas the remaining 50% do not, and the latter group displays a markedly greater blood pressure increase in response to arousal, as well as during and after 3 minutes of mental arithmetic. studying a group of monozygotic twins (10 pairs, 2 excluded from analysis), the aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of genetic determination of these sympathetic response profiles. muscle sympathetic burst incidence at rest was similar in twins, with a within-pair burst incidence ratio of 0.87 +/- 0.02 (sem) compared with 0.73 +/- 0.07 found in unrelated pairs (p= 0.002), confirming a previous study from our laboratory. in contrast, the sympathetic responses to arousal showed large twin within-pair variance (arousal inhibition ratio 0.56 +/- 0.11), which did not significantly differ (p= 0.939) from the variance in pairs of unrelated subjects (0.46 +/- 0.11). the finding that human muscle sympathetic nerve responses to arousal are less determined by genotype than the resting level of corresponding sympathetic nerve activity suggests that the arousal response pattern is more prone to be altered by environmental factors. this raises the possibility that these intraindividually reproducible sympathetic neural response profiles can be modified in a positive direction from a cardiovascular risk perspective.
cell_biology	phylogeny is often used to compare entire families of genes/proteins. we previously showed that classification of caenorhabditis elegans rho gtpases on the basis of their enzymatic properties was significantly different from sequence alignments. to further develop this concept, we have developed an integrated approach to classify c. elegans small gtpases based on functional data comprising affinity for gtp, sub-cellular localization, tissue distribution and silencing impact. this analysis led to establish a novel functional classification for small gtpases. to test the relevance of this classification in mammals, we focused our attention on the human orthologs of small gtpases from a specific group comprising arf- 1.2, evl-20, arl-1, y54e10br. 2, unc-108 and rab-7. we then tested their involvement in protein secretion and membrane traffic in mammalian systems. using this approach we identify a novel network containing 18 gtpases, and 23 functionally interacting proteins, conserved between c. elegans and mammals, which is involved in membrane traffic and protein secretion.
