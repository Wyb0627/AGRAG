molecular_biology	lung cancer, which has a low survival rate, is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. smoking and air pollution are the major causes of lung cancer; however, numerous studies have demonstrated that genetic factors also contribute to the development of lung cancer. a family history of lung cancer increases the risk for the disease in both smokers and never-smokers. this review focuses on familial lung cancer, in particular on the familial aggregation of lung cancer. the development of familial lung cancer involves shared environmental and genetic factors among family members. familial lung cancer represents a good model for investigating the association between environmental and genetic factors, as well as for identifying susceptibility genes for lung cancer. in addition, studies on familial lung cancer may help to elucidate the etiology and mechanism of lung cancer, and may identify novel biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis, targeted therapy and improved prevention strategies. this review presents the aetiology and molecular biology of lung cancer and then systematically introduces and discusses several aspects of familial lung cancer, including the characteristics of familial lung cancer, population-based studies on familial lung cancer and the genetics of familial lung cancer.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are a class of small non-coding rnas (18-24 nucleotides (nt)) that regulate gene expression. mirnas exist widely in animals, plants and humans, and play fundamental roles in many biological processes, such as growth, development, differentiation and reproduction, etc. mirna is believed to be involved in the regulation of nearly 30% of all human genes and its expression level is closely related to some major diseases of mankind. thus, quantitive detection and expression analysis of mirna are significant to the understanding of functional mechanism of mirnas, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and the development of the correlated gene drugs, etc. mirna detection is mostly based on the hybridization and amplification techniques of nucleic acids, which includs northern blotting technique, microarray, in situ hybridization, real-time reverse transcription pcr, isothermal rolling circle amplification and conjugated polymer-based mirna detection. with the discovery of mirna in different species and the thoroughly functional research of mirna, the detection methods have been improved continuously and the new techniques, involving amplification, labeled probe and detection, have been developed successively. this paper summarizes the progress of mirna detection, reviews the advantages and the disadvantages of all kinds of methods and prospects the mirna detection trends.
human_metabolism	purpose: demonstrate the utility of system dynamics computer modeling to study and gain insight into the impacts of physical activity and diet on weight gain and loss. methods: a holistic system dynamics computer model is presented that integrates the processes of human metabolism, hormonal regulation, body composition, nutrition, and physical activity. these processes are not independent of one another, and the model captures the complex interdependencies between them in the regulation of body weight and energy metabolism. the article demonstrates how such an integrative simulation model can serve as a viable laboratory tool for controlled experimentation to investigate the impacts of physical activity and diet on body weight and composition. results: in one experiment, weight loss from a moderate level of daily exercise was slightly less than the loss from dieting. although exercise did have a favorable impact on body composition by protecting against the loss in fat-free mass (ffm), it, however, failed to blunt the drop in resting energy expenditure (ree) that accompanies diet-based weight loss. the smaller loss in ffm did indeed induce a smaller drop in nominal ree, however, the preservation of ffm also affected a relatively larger loss in fm, which, in turn, induced a larger adaptive reduction in the metabolic rate. the two adaptations almost totally offset one another, causing minimal differences in ree. in a second experiment, exercise regimens of moderate- to high-level intensity proved counterproductive as weight-reducing strategies. however, when the diet was changed from a balanced composition to one that was highly loaded with carbohydrates, it became possible to sustain the intense exercise regimen over the experimental period and achieve a significant drop in body weight. conclusion: the results underscore the significant interaction effects between physical activity, diet, and body composition and demonstrate the utility of computer-based experimentation to study, gain insight into, and make predictions about their dynamics.
genetics	in genome-wide association studies (gwas), generalization is the replication of genotype-phenotype association in a population with different ancestry than the population in which it was first identified. current practices for declaring generalizations rely on testing associations while controlling the family-wise error rate (fwer) in the discovery study, then separately controlling error measures in the follow-up study. this approach does not guarantee control over the fwer or false discovery rate (fdr) of the generalization null hypotheses. it also fails to leverage the two-stage design to increase power for detecting generalized associations. we provide a formal statistical framework for quantifying the evidence of generalization that accounts for the (in)consistency between the directions of associations in the discovery and follow-up studies. we develop the directional generalization fwer (fwerg) and fdr (fdrg) controlling r-values, which are used to declare associations as generalized. this framework extends to generalization testing when applied to a published list of single nucleotide polymorphism-(snp)-trait associations. our methods control fwerg or fdrg under various snp selection rules based on p-values in the discovery study. we find that it is often beneficial to use a more lenient p-value threshold than the genome-wide significance threshold. in a gwas of total cholesterol in the hispanic community health study/study of latinos (hchs/sol), when testing all snps with p-values <5x10-8 (15 genomic regions) for generalization in a large gwas of whites, we generalized snps from 15 regions. but when testing all snps with p-values <6.6x10-5 (89 regions), we generalized snps from 27 regions.
southern_blotting	soybean transformation by ovary-drip was improved by optimizing the length of the transformation pathway by cutting the styles. these modifications facilitated soybean transformation manipulation and improved transformation reproducibility and efficiency. using a linear minimal gus gene cassette as the foreign dna, a maximum transformation frequency of 11% was obtained in flowers of the soybean cultivar 'liaodou 14' with their styles mostly removed, whereas removal of only the stigma, partial style cutting and partial ovary cutting gave transformation frequencies of 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. an average transformation frequency of 8.2% was obtained when 619 flowers from three soybean cultivars ('liaodou 14', 'liaodou 13', and 'tiefeng 29') were transformed by this optimized method. southern blotting analysis showed that the gus reporter gene (encoding beta-glucuronidase) was stably inherited with a simple pattern. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and gus staining confirmed the expression of the gus gene in transgenic plants.
immunology	background: the identification of immunogenic regions on the surface of antigens, which are able to be recognized by antibodies and to trigger an immune response, is a major challenge for the design of new and effective vaccines. the prediction of such regions through computational immunology techniques is a challenging goal, which will ultimately lead to a drastic limitation of the experimental tests required to validate their efficiency. however, current methods are far from being sufficiently reliable and/or applicable on a large scale. results: we developed sepia, a b-cell epitope predictor from the protein sequence, which is sufficiently fast to be applicable on a large scale. the originality of sepia lies in the combination of two classifiers, a naive bayesian and a random forest classifier, through a voting algorithm that exploits the advantages of both. it is based on 13 sequence-based features, whose values in a 9-residue sequence window are compiled to predict the epitope/non-epitope state of the central residue. the features are related to the type of amino acid, its conservation in homologous proteins, and its tendency of being exposed to the solvent, soluble, flexible, and disordered. the highest signal is obtained from statistical amino acid preferences, but all 13 features contribute non-negligibly in the predictor. sepia 's average prediction accuracy is limited, with an auc score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) that reaches 0.65 both in 10-fold cross-validation and on an independent test set. it is nevertheless slightly higher than that of other methods evaluated on the same test set. conclusions: sepia was applied to a test protein whose epitopes are known, human beta 2 adrenergic g-protein-coupled receptor, with promising results. although the actual auc score is rather low, many of the predicted epitopes cluster together and overlap the experimental epitope region. the reasons underlying the limitations of sepia and of all other b-cell epitope predictors are discussed.
southern_blotting	coccinia grandis l (family cucurbitaceae), a perennial dioecious herb with heteromorphic sex chromosomes has the quality of a model plant for analysis of sexual evolution in angiosperms. yet, little is known about the physical side, genetic orientation and substitution behavior of key gender-defining factors in this important plant species. screening of genomic dna with rapd primers was used for sex diagnosis and gender specificity of c. grandis in this study. bulk analyses of pooled dna from male and female genotypes resulted in the isolation of a putative male specific sex marker cgmsm. a sequence characterized amplified region (scar) marker cgy1 designed from cgmsm amplified an 829 bp fragment in the male c. grandis but not in the female plants. southern blotting confirmed it as a single copy locus in the male genome. further, the cgy1 marker accurately identified 11 male and 6 female genotypes from 17 individuals of c. grandis with unknown sex. sequence homology revealed high similarity between cgmsm (cgy1) and the putative mads-box domain of the apetala3 (ap3) mads-box gene which is responsible for development of petals and stamens in flowering plants. thus, the scar marker cgy1 could be used as an efficient tool for early sex identification in c. grandis and forms the basis for characterization of genes associated with evolutionary pathways in sexual dimorphism.

northern_blotting	eucheuma denticulatum, an economically and industrially important red alga, is a valuable marine resource. although micrornas (mirnas) play an essential role in gene post-transcriptional regulation, no research has been conducted to identify and characterize mirnas in e. denticulatum. in this study, we identified 134 mirnas (133 conserved mirnas and one novel mirna) from 2,997,135 small-rna reads by high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis. blast searching against mirbase uncovered 126 potential mirna families. a conservation and diversity analysis of predicted mirna families in different plant species was performed by comparative alignment and homology searching. a total of 4 and 13 randomly selected mirnas were respectively validated by northern blotting and stem-loop reverse transcription pcr, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the mirna sequencing data. altogether, 871 potential target genes were predicted using psrobot and targetfinder. target genes classification and enrichment were conducted based on gene ontology analysis. the functions of target gene products and associated metabolic pathways were predicted by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis. a cytoscape network was constructed to explore the interrelationships of mirnas, mirna-target genes and target genes. a large number of mirnas with diverse target genes will play important roles for further understanding some essential biological processes in e. denticulatum. the uncovered information can serve as an important reference for the protection and utilization of this unique red alga in the future.
immunology	the immune response is determined by the speed of the t cell reaction to antigens assured by a state of readiness for proliferation and cytokine secretion. proliferation, apoptosis and motion of many cell types are controlled by cytoplasmic proteases - mu- and m-calpain - and their inhibitor calpastatin, together forming the ""calpain-calpastatin system"" (ccs), assumed to modify their targets only upon activation-dependent cytoplasmic ca2+ increase. contrastingly to this notion, using quantitative real time pcr and semiquantitative flow cytometry respectively, we show here that the ccs genes are constitutively expressed, and that both calpains are constitutively active in resting, circulating human cd4(+) and cd8(+) lymphocytes. furthermore, we demonstrate that calpain inhibition in the resting t cells prevents them from proliferation in vitro and greatly reduces secretion of multiple cytokines. the mechanistic reason for these effects of calpain inhibition on t cell functions might be the demonstrated significant reduction of the expression of active (phosphorylated) upstream signalling molecules, including the phospholipase c gamma, p56lck and nf kappa b, in the inhibitor-treated cells. thus, we propose that the constitutive, self-regulatory calpain-calpastatin system activity in resting human t cells is a necessary, controlling element of their readiness for complex and effective response to antigenic challenge.
genetics	cyclists in the tour de france are endurance specialists. twin and family studies have shown that approximately 50% of the variance in a number of performance-related phenotypes (whether measured at baseline, i.e., natural talent, or in response to training) including those important to cycling can be explained by genetic variation. research into the specific genetic variants that are responsible has identified over 200 genes containing common genetic variants involved in the genetic predisposition to physical performance. however, typically these explain only a small portion of the variance, perhaps 1-2% and collectively they rarely explain anything approaching the 50% of the variance identified in the twin and family studies. thus, there is a gap in our understanding of the relationship between heritability and performance. this gap may be bridged by investigation of rare variants or epigenetic variation or by altering study designs through increased collaborations to pool existing cohorts together. initial findings from such efforts show promising results. this mini-review will touch on the genetics and epigenetics of sporting performance, how they relate to cyclists in the tour de france and where best future efforts may be directed as well as discuss some preliminary research findings.
genetics	alopecia areata (aa) is a common and stressful disorder that results in hair loss, and resistant to treatment in some cases. experimental and clinical evidence suggests that aa is caused by autoimmune attack against the hair follicles. the precise pathomechanism, however, remains unknown. here, we focus on the recent progress in multidisciplinary approaches to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and new treatments of aa in 996 publications from january 2010 to july 2016, and provide an overview of the current understanding in clinical management and research directions.

cell_biology	s6ks are major effectors of the mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, signaling for increased protein synthesis and cell growth in response to insulin, amp/atp levels, and amino acids. deregulation of this pathway has been related to disorders and diseases associated with metabolism, such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. s6k family is composed of two main members, s6k1 and s6k2, which comprise different isoforms resulted from alternative splicing or alternative start codon use. although important molecular functions have been associated with p70-s6k1, the most extensively studied isoform, the s6k2 counterpart lacks information. in the present study, we performed immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry (ms) analysis of flag-tagged p70-s6k1 and p54-s6k2 interactomes, after expression in hek293 cells. protein lists were submitted to crapome (contaminant repository for affinity purification) and saint (significance analysis of interactome) analysis, which allowed the identification of high-scoring interactions. by a comparative approach, p70-s6k1 interacting proteins were predominantly related to ""cytoskeleton"" and ""stress response,"" whereas p54-s6k2 interactome was more associated to ""transcription,"" ""splicing,"" and ""ribosome biogenesis."" moreover, we have found evidences for new targets or regulators of the s6k protein family, such as proteins ncl, npm1, eif2 alpha, xrcc6, parp1, and ilf2/ilf3 complex. this study provides new information about the interacting networks of s6ks, which may contribute for future approaches to a better understanding of the mtor/s6k pathway.
molecular_biology	the emergence of proteomics has led to major technological advances in mass spectrometry (ms). these advancements not only benefitted ms-based high-throughput proteomics but also increased the impact of mass spectrometry on the field of structural and molecular biology. here, we review how state-of-the-art ms methods, including native ms, top-down protein sequencing, cross-linking-ms, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange-ms, nowadays enable the characterization of biomolecular structures, functions, and interactions. in particular, we focus on the role of mass spectrometry in integrated structural and molecular biology investigations of biological macromolecular complexes and cellular machineries, highlighting work on crispr-cas systems and eukaryotic transcription complexes.
immunology	the tam family of receptors (i.e., tyro3, axl, and mertk), and their ligands growth arrest specific factor 6 (gas6) and protein s (pros1) contribute to several oncogenic processes, such as cell survival, invasion, migration, chemo-resistance, and metastasis, whereby expression often correlates with poor clinical outcomes. in recent years, there has been great interest in the study of tam receptors in cancer, stemming both from their roles as oncogenic signaling receptors, as well as their roles in tumor immunology. as a result, several classes of tam inhibitors that include small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, decoy receptors, as well as novel strategies to target tam ligands are being developed. this paper will review the biology of tam receptors and their ligands with a focus on cancer, as well as evidence-based data for the continued pursuit of tam/gas6 inhibitors in clinical practice.

enzymology	self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (scc-dftb) is a promising method for hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (qm/mm) simulations of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. the acylation reaction of fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah), a promising drug target, was investigated by applying a scc-dftb/charmm27 scheme. calculated potential energy barriers resulted in reasonable agreement with experiments for oleamide (oa) and oleoylmethyl ester (ome) substrates, outperforming previous calculations performed at the pm3/charmm22 level. furthermore, the experimental preference of faah in hydrolyzing oa faster than ome was adequately reproduced by calculations. all these findings indicate that the scc-dftb/charmm27 approach can be successfully applied to mechanistic investigations of faah-catalyzed reactions.
cell_biology	purpose of reviewto provide examples of mitochondria-specific metabolic events that influence tumor cell biology, and of metabolism-related mitochondrial biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer cells.recent findingscancer cell mitochondria are rewired to optimally serve the cancer cell under various conditions of cellular stress. the nonexhaustive list of mitochondrial alterations that support cancer cell proliferation, survival, and/or progression includes upregulation of oxidative metabolism and use of alternative substrates, oncometabolites, increased superoxide production, mutated mitochondrial dna, and altered mitochondrial morphology and dynamics. potential therapeutic targets include fatty acid oxidation, voltage-dependent anion channel-1, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and complex i.summarysome phenotypical traits, for example, chemoresistance and metastasis, are likely regulated by a fine-tuned balance between several metabolic processes and events that are upregulated in parallel and are also dependent on microenvironmental cues. many metabolism-related mitochondrial biomarkers show prognostic value, but the biological interpretation of the data may be confounded by the overall metabolic status and context. understanding metabolic regulation of stemness is important for targeting cancer stem cells. therapeutic targeting of cancer cell mitochondria remains experimental but promising, and more predictive markers will be needed for metabolism-based treatments and personalized medicine.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: high mobility group box-1 (hmgb1), a non-histone protein, plays an important role in autoimmune diseases. however, the significance of hmgb1 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis has not been reported. the purpose of this study was to explore whether hmgb1 participates in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis, and whether glycyrrhizin (gl), a direct inhibitor of hmgb1, attenuates the severity of thyroid inflammatory infiltration in a murine model of autoimmune thyroiditis. methods: a total of 80 male nod. h-2(h4) mice were randomly divided into a control or iodine supplement (nai) group at four weeks of age, and the control group was fed with regular water, whereas the nai group was supplied with 0.005% sodium iodine water. another 24 male nod. h-2(h4) mice were also randomized into three groups (eight mice per group) as follows: control, nai, and gl treatment after iodine supplementation (nai + gl). the nod.h-2 (h4) mice were fed with 0.005% sodium iodide water for eight weeks to enhance autoimmune thyroiditis. after iodine treatment, the mice received intraperitoneal injections of gl for four weeks. the severity of lymphocytic infiltration in the thyroid gland was measured by histopathological studies. the serum levels of hmgb1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (il)-6, il-1 beta, and thyroglobulin antibody titers were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. hmgb1 expression was measured by immunohistochemical staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction. tlr2, hmgb1, myd88, and nuclear transcription factor kappa b were measured by western blot. results: the mrna expression of hmgb1 was significantly higher at 8 and 16 weeks in the nai group than it was in the control group. serum levels of thyroglobulin antibodies, hmgb1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, il-6, and il-1 beta were significantly increased in the nai group, but they were dramatically attenuated with gl injection. the prevalence of thyroiditis and the infiltration of lymphocytes were significantly decreased in the nai + gl group. gl administration also significantly reduced the protein expression of tlr2, myd88, hmgb1 and nuclear transcription factor jb in the thyroid gland and attenuated the severity of thyroiditis. conclusion: hmgb1 may play a crucial role in autoimmune thyroiditis by causing inflammatory infiltration, thus increasing the severity of autoimmune thyroiditis. gl effectively attenuated thyroiditis in the iodine-induced nod. h-2(h4) mice via a molecular mechanism related to the inhibition of tlr2-hmgb1 signaling.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background and objectivemore than 100 salivary constituents have been found to show levels significantly different in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) from those found in healthy controls, and therefore have been suggested to be potential salivary biomarkers for oscc detection. however, many of these potential oscc salivary biomarkers are also involved in chronic inflammation, and whether the levels of these biomarkers could be affected by the presence of chronic periodontitis was not known. the objective of this pilot study was therefore to measure the levels of seven previously reported potential oscc salivary mrna biomarkers in patients with chronic periodontitis and compare them to levels found in patients with oscc and healthy controls. the seven salivary mrnas were interleukin (il)-8, il-1, dual specificity phosphatase 1, h3 histone family 3a, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, s100 calcium-binding protein p (s100p) and spermidine/spermine n1-acetyltransferase 1. material and methodsunstimulated whole saliva samples were collected from a total of 105 human subjects from the following four study groups: oscc; cpns (chronic periodontitis, moderate to severe degree, non-smokers); cps (chronic periodontitis, moderate to severe degree, smokers); and healthy controls. levels of each mrna in patient groups (oscc or chronic periodontitis) relative to the healthy controls were determined by a pre-amplification reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach with nested gene-specific primers. results were recorded and analyzed by the bio-rad cfx96 real-time system. mean fold changes between each pair of patient vs. control groups were analyzed by the mann-whitney u-test with bonferroni corrections. resultsonly s100p showed significantly higher levels in patients with oscc compared to both patients with cpns (p = 0.003) and cps (p = 0.007). the difference in s100p levels between patients with oscc and healthy controls was also marginally significant (p = 0.009). there was no significant difference in the levels of salivary il-8, il-1 and dual specificity phosphatase 1 mrnas between patients with oscc and patients with cpns (p = 0.510, 0.058 and 0.078, respectively); no significant difference in levels of salivary ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 and spermine n1-acetyltransferase mrnas between patients with oscc and patients with cps (p = 0.318 and 0.764, respectively); and no significant difference in levels of the h3 histone family 3a mrna between patients with oscc and either cps (p = 0.449) or healthy controls (p = 0.107). conclusionssalivary s100p mrna could be a reliable biomarker for oscc detection, regardless of the presence of chronic periodontitis. the presence of chronic periodontitis could significantly affect the levels of the other six mrnas, and negatively influence reliability for using them as biomarkers for oral cancer detection.
enzymology	gram-negative bacteria possess a characteristic outer membrane, of which the lipid a constituent elicits a strong host immune response through the toll-like receptor 4 complex, and acts as a component of the permeability barrier to prevent uptake of bactericidal compounds. lipid a species comprise the bulk of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and are produced through a multistep biosynthetic pathway conserved in most gram-negative bacteria. the final steps in this pathway involve the secondary acylation of lipid a precursors. these are catalyzed by members of a superfamily of enzymes known as lysophospholipid acyltransferases (lplats), which are present in all domains of life and play important roles in diverse biological processes. to date, characterization of this clinically important class of enzymes has been limited by a lack of structural information and the availability of only low-throughput biochemical assays. in this work, we present the structure of the bacterial lplat protein lpxm, and we describe a high-throughput, label-free mass spectrometric assay to characterize acyltransferase enzymatic activity. using our structure and assay, we identify an lplat thioesterase activity, and we provide experimental evidence to support an ordered-binding and ""reset"" mechanistic model for lpxm function. this work enables the interrogation of other bacterial acyltransferases' structure-mechanism relationships, and the assay described herein provides a foundation for quantitatively characterizing the enzymology of any number of clinically relevant lplat proteins.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: although fibrosis seems to be prognostic for adverse outcomes in adults with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (idc), little is known about the prevalence and development of fibrosis in pediatric idc hearts. we hypothesized that there is less activation of fibrosis at a molecular level in pediatric idc hearts than in failing adult hearts. methods and results: pediatric hearts were analyzed histologically to determine the prevalence of fibrosis. left ventricular tissue from adult and pediatric idc hearts and adult and pediatric nonfailing (nf) hearts were subjected to quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to study the expression of important mrnas that affect fibrosis. we found age-specific differences between idc and nf hearts in the regulation of noncoding galectin-3, corin, matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) 2, mmp-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp) 2, and timp-3. we also found markers that were similarly altered in both adult and pediatric idc hearts (interleukin-1 receptor like 1 receptor, timp-1, and timp-4). finally, micrornas 29a-c were significantly decreased in the pediatric idc patients. conclusions: pediatric idc patients demonstrate age-specific differences in the molecular pathways implicated in fibrosis in the adult heart. at the ultrastructural level the unique gene expression pattern appears to limit fibrosis in the failing pediatric heart.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: to enhance survival and generation of definitive endoderm cells from human embryonic stem cells in a simple and reproducible system. main methods: definitive endoderm (de) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hescs) was induced under a chemical-defined condition withdrawn insulin supplement and serum albumin. we dissected influence of ""alternative growth factors"", wnt3a, bmp4 and bfgf in activin a-driven differentiation by detection of de-associated genes expression and cell viability. expression of de-associated sox17 and foxa2 genes was analyzed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and western blot assays. quantitative evaluation of de efficiency was performed by flow cytometry analysis of cxcr4-expressed cell population. cell viability during de differentiation was analyzed by an annexin v/pi double staining test. key findings: supplementation with wnt3a, bmp4 or bfgf promoted de generation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. cell apoptosis elicited by activin a was significantly ameliorated by a cocktail with wnt3a, bmp4 and bfgf. this allowed for sustained cell viability without insulin-containing supplements, thereby indirectly improving the efficiency of de generation. therefore, the cocktail containing is optimal for efficient de generation in the presence of activin a and an insulin/albumin-free condition. significance: this optimal condition facilitates the balance between the productivity and the viability maintenance, and could be valuable for mass production of de with minimal variation.

enzymology	in this study, we investigated the possibility of reversed micelles, widely used as an enzyme reactor for lipases, for the determination of lipoxygenase activity. although it is rapid and simple, reversed micelles have some limitations, such as interference by uv-absorbing materials and surfactant. lipoxygenase activity in the reversed micelles was determined by reading the absorbance of the lipid hydroperoxidation product (conjugated diene) at 234 nm. among surfactants and organic media, aot and isooctane were most effective for the dioxygenation of linoleic acid in reversed micelles. the strong absorbance of aot in the uv region is a major obstacle for the direct application of the aot/isooctane reversed micelles to lipoxygenase activity determination. to prevent interference by aot, we added an aot removal step in the procedure for lipoxygenase activity determination in reversed micelles. the lipoxygenase activity was dependent on water content, and maximum activity was obtained at an r-value of 10.

enzymology	metabolic modeling can suggest which is the key enzyme activity that needs to be controlled or its activity enhanced for the required production of a metabolite in a pathway. it also helps to find possible drug targets (enzymes to be inhibited). in metabolic modeling, knowing the kinetics of the enzymes involved in a pathway is mandatory. most enzymatic reactions involve multi-substrates and follow an ordered sequential or ping-pong mechanism. the kinetic parameters involved in the model are obtained by fitting experimental data using a model based on the mechanism. the cleland model has been used for some years. the grouping of parameters, such as dissociation constant and michaelis-menten constant, makes the strategy meaningful and hence the cleland model is still in use. although other alternate methods, e.g., the king-altman method, are available, derivation by determinants can be used to derive a rate expression for the sequential or ping-pong mechanism, they are tedious. hence, a meaningful modification is suggested in this communication for deriving the enzyme mechanism which is based on thilakavathi et al. (biotech lett 28:1889-1894, 2006) to obtain the cleland model in an easier way.
northern_blotting	the emergence of small rnas as key and potent regulators of gene expression has prompted the need for robust detection and assay protocols to be developed for investigating their generation and tissue distribution. the physicochemical nature of these rnas allows traditional assay methods to be employed; however, due to the relatively small size of endo-sirnas, key changes to these protocols are required. here, we present a method for the nonradioactive detection of endo-sirnas in mouse tissue and microinjected xenopus oocytes. the method comprises steps for rna extraction, page, and low-stringency northern blotting using dig-labelled rna probes. moreover, it includes a strategy to design and generate cheap hybridization probes with greatly increased sensitivity. these methods may be used as a simple and robust protocol for nonradioactive detection of small rnas or be combined with other strategies to potentially enhance signal intensity.
enzymology	two valid targets for antibiotic development, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (hppk) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), catalyze consecutive reactions in folate biosynthesis. in francisella tularensis (ft), these two activities are contained in a single protein, fthppk-dhps. although pemble et al. (plos one 5, e14165) determined the structure of fthppk-dhps, they were unable to measure the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. in this study, we elucidated the binding and inhibitory activities of two hppk inhibitors (hp-18 and hp-26) against fthppk-dhps, determined the structure of fthppk-dhps in complex with hp-26, and measured the kinetic parameters for the dual enzymatic activities of fthppk-dhps. the biochemical analyses showed that hp-18 and hp-26 have significant isozyme selectivity, and that fthppk-dhps is unique in that the catalytic efficiency of its dhps activity is only 1/260,000 of that of escherichia coli dhps. sequence and structural analyses suggest that hp-26 is an excellent lead for developing therapeutic agents for tularemia, and that the very low dhps activity is due, at least in part, to the lack of a key residue that interacts with the substrate p-aminobenzoic acid (paba). a blast search of the genomes of ten f. tularensis strains indicated that the bacterium contains a single fthppk-dhps. the marginal dhps activity and the single copy existence of fthppk-dhps in f. tularensis make this bacterium more vulnerable to dhps inhibitors. current sulfa drugs are ineffective against tularemia; new inhibitors targeting the unique paba-binding pocket may be effective and less subject to resistance because any mutations introducing resistance may make the marginal dhps activity unable to support the growth of f. tularensis.
human_metabolism	flavonoids are biologically active compounds in food with potential health effects. we have used the caco-2 cell monolayer model to study the absorption and metabolism of two flavonols, a class of flavonoids, specifically kaempferol and galangin. metabolism experiments allowed identification of five kaempferol conjugates: 3-, 7- and 4'-glucuronide, a sulphate and a glucurono-sulphate; and four galangin conjugates: 3-, 5- and 7-glucuronides, and a sulphate, using specific enzyme hydrolysis, hplc-ms, and hplc with post-column metal complexation/tandem ms. transport studies showed that the flavonols were conjugated inside the cells then transported across the monolayer or effluxed back to the apical side. sulphated conjugates were preferentially effluxed back to the apical side, whereas glucuronides were mostly transported to the basolateral side. for kaempferol, a small amount of the unconjugated aglycone permeated in both directions, indicating some passive diffusion. when kaempferol-3-glucuronide and quercetin 7-sulphate were applied to either side of the cells, no permeation in either direction was observed, indicating that conjugates cannot re-cross the cell monolayer. formation of apical kaempferol-7- and 4'-glucuronides was readily saturated, whereas formation of other conjugates at the apical side and all at the basolateral side increased with increasing concentration of kaempferol, implying different transporters are responsible at the apical and basolateral sides. the results highlight the important but complex metabolic changes occurring in flavonoids during absorption.

enzymology	the radical s-adenosyl-l-methionine enzyme desii from streptomyces venezuelae is able to oxidize the c3 hydroxyl group of tdp-d-quinovose to the corresponding ketone via an alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical intermediate. it is unknown whether electron transfer from the radical intermediate precedes or follows its deprotonation, and answering this question would offer considerable insight into the mechanism by which the small but important class of radical-mediated alcohol dehydrogenases operate. this question can be addressed by measuring steady-state kinetic isotope effects (kies); however, their interpretation is obfuscated by the degree to which the steps of interest limit catalysis. to circumvent this problem, we measured the solvent deuterium kie on the saturating steady-state concentration of the radical intermediate using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. the resulting value, 0.22 +/- 0.03, when combined with the solvent deuterium kie on the maximum rate of turnover (v) of 1.8 +/- 0.2, yielded a kie of 8 +/- 2 on the net rate constant specifically associated with the alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical intermediate. this result implies that electron transfer from the radical intermediate does not precede deprotonation. further analysis of these isotope effects, along with the ph dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters, likewise suggests that desii must be in the correct protonation state for initial generation of the alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical. in addition to providing unique mechanistic insights, this work introduces a unique approach to investigating enzymatic reactions using kies.
enzymology	laccases are a promising candidate for crosslinking milk proteins in stirred fermented milks. it was applied in a post-processing step due to its acidic ph optimum reported in literature for rebodying of the gel and an improvement in structure. a laccase preparation from trametes versicolor had a lower oxidation activity in ultrafiltration permeate than in model buffer systems, and a ph optimum of 4.5. it was applied to stirred skim milk gels but no significant change in the storage modulus or apparent viscosity of yoghurt occurred. confocal laser scanning micrographs showed a more porous structure of the milk gel. some fresh cheese samples had improved rheological properties. a competing crosslinking activity and peptidolytic activity was assumed and smaller peptides were detected in acidified milk by fluorescence. mass spectrometry of the laccase preparation returned mainly laccase sequences. although this does not exclude proteases, it indicates that the radical mechanism of laccases may lead to protein degradation. industrial relevance: enzymatic modification of milk proteins can alter the structure of fermented milk gels and even create new structures. rheological properties can be improved via crosslinking, thus reducing costs due to the addition of protein powders or stabilisers. an innovative approach to combining biotechnology and food science and engineering is investigated. the study is interesting for both enzyme manufacturers and dairy companies as it aims to at least partially fill the knowledge gap between enzymology and their real-world application in dairy products. however, enzymatic treatment is an additional step and also incurs costs which should be taken into account.

immunology	interleukin-7 (il-7) is a cytokine that has been known since long in immunology, mainly regarding its effects on t-cells and b-cells. il-7 has been demonstrated to be necessary for both b-cell and t-cell proliferation and lack of il-7 causes immature immune cell arrest. interestingly, in recent years, certain studies have strongly suggested that the role of il-7 is far beyond the field of immunology, it might have direct or indirect effect on cancer. this review aims to summarize the role of il-7 in immunity and its role in the pathogenesis of neoplasia.
southern_blotting	telomeres at the ends of human chromosomes consist of tandem hexametric (ttaggg)n repeats, which protect them from degradation. at each cycle of cell division, most normal somatic cells lose approximately 50-100 bp of the terminal telomeric repeat dna. precise prediction of growth and estimation of the malignant potential of brain tumors require additional markers. dna extraction was performed from the 51 frozen tissues, and a non-radioactive chemiluminescent assay was used for southern blotting. one sample t-test shows highly significant difference in telomere length in meningioma and astrocytoma with normal range. according to our results, higher grades of meningioma and astrocytoma tumors show more heterogeneity in telomere length, and also it seems shortening process of telomeres is an early event in brain tumors.
northern_blotting	piwi-interacting rnas (pirna) are fully modified by 2'-o -methylation at their 3'-termini. this terminal methylation is required to prevent 3'-nucleotide addition, which serves as a tag for destabilization. in this chapter, we describe biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of 2'-o -methylation at 3'-termini of pirnas.
northern_blotting	the arabidopsis vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter gene, atnhx1, was introduced into soybean by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. four independent kanamycin resistant lines were obtained. the result of pcr, southern blotting and northern blotting analyses demonstrated that the atnhx1 gene was successfully inserted into the soybean genome and stably expressed in these kanamycin resistant lines. the stability of atnhx1 expression and salt resistance were evaluated in the soybean transformants for over 6 generations. two independently derived transgenic lines with high expression level of atnhx1 were selected, and propagated to generation t-5 in the absence of selection pressure. pcr and rt-pcr examinations revealed that atnhx1 was highly expressed in all investigated transgenic t-5 progenies. furthermore, all transgenic t-5 plants showed resistant to salt stress, same as those of homozygous t-2 plants. taken together, our results indicated that constitutive expression of atnhx1 enhanced salt tolerance in soybean for over 6 generations, suggesting a great potential use of atnhx1 for improving salt tolerance in plants by genetic engineering.
molecular_biology	we explore the integration of societal issues in undergraduate training within the life sciences. skills in thinking about science, scientific knowledge production and the place of science in society are crucial in the context of the idea of responsible research and innovation. this idea became institutionalized and it is currently well-present in the scientific agenda. developing abilities in this regard seems particularly relevant to training in the life sciences, as new developments in this area somehow evoke the involvement of all of us citizens, our engagement to debate and take part in processes of change. the present analysis draws from the implementation of a curricular unit focused on science-society dialogue, an optional course included in the biochemistry degree study plan offered at the university of porto. this curricular unit was designed to be mostly an exploratory activity for the students, enabling them to undertake in-depth study in areas/topics of their specific interest. mapping topics from students' final papers provided a means of analysis and became a useful tool in the exploratory collaborative construction of the course. we discuss both the relevance and the opportunity of thinking and questioning the science-society dialogue. as part of undergraduate training, this pedagogical practice was deemed successful.

molecular_biology	the ability to engineer cells to express a protein of interest in an inducible manner and stably for a long period is a valuable tool in molecular biology and also one that holds promise for regenerative medicine in the future. ccn proteins have been suggested to be involved in tissue regeneration. in this chapter, we describe an in vitro method for stable and inducible expression of ccn protein in a chondroprogenitor cell line and in chondrocytes in primary culture that does not involve the use of any viral vector.
enzymology	n-terminal acetylation (nta) is one of the most abundant protein modifications known, and the n-terminal acetyltransferase (nat) machinery is conserved throughout all eukarya. over the past 50 years, the function of nta has begun to be slowly elucidated, and this includes the modulation of protein protein interaction, protein-stability, protein function, and protein targeting to specific cellular compartments. many of these functions have been studied in the context of naa10/nata; however, we are only starting to really understand the full complexity of this picture. roughly, about 40% of all human proteins are substrates of naa10 and the impact of this modification has only been studied for a few of them. besides acting as a nat in the nata complex, recently other functions have been linked to naa10, including post-translational nta, lysine acetylation, and nat/kat-independent functions. also, recent publications have linked mutations in naa10 to various diseases, emphasizing the importance of naa10 research in humans. the recent design and synthesis of the first bisubstrate inhibitors that potently and selectively inhibit the nata/naa10 complex, monomeric naa10, and hnaa50 further increases the toolset to analyze naa10 function.

southern_blotting	dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (dfr) catalyzes the reduction of dihydroflavonols in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. in this study, we obtained the full-length cdna of dfr from calibrachoa hybrida, cadfr, through race-based technique. the cdna of cadfr is 1,351 bp with an open reading frame of 1, 152 bp, which encodes a putative protein of 383 amino acids. the cadfr protein is predicted with 42.74 kd in molecular weight and a pi value of 5.83. sequence alignment showed that cadfr had close relationship with dfrs from other species of the solanaceae family, and it belonged to the asp-type. we constructed 35s::cadfr overexpression vector and transformed it into three cultivars of petunia hybrida using the agrobacterium-mediated method. multiple transformants were selected in the presence of 50 mg/l kanamycin antibiotic and further verified by polymerase chain reaction and southern blotting analyses. we observed that the bud and flower color of transgenic petunia altered comparing with that of control plants. the dfr activities varied in most color-changed transgenic petunias. these results confirm the identity and function of cadfr and further suggest that integration of the cadfr can be used to change flower color of transgenic plants.

southern_blotting	chlorophyll biosynthesis is catalyzed by two multi subunit enzymes; a light-dependent and a light-independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase. the light-independent enzyme consists of three subunits (chll, chln and chlb) in photosynthetic bacteria and plastids in which the chlb gene encodes the major subunit that catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. we report here stable integration of the chlb gene from pinus thunbergii into the chloroplast genome of tobacco. using helium-driven biolistic gun, transplastomic clones were developed in vitro. the stable integration and homoplasmy for transgenes was confirmed by using pcr and southern blotting techniques. nodal cuttings of the homoplasmic transgenic and untransformed wild type shoots were cultured on ms medium in the dark. as expected, shoots developed from the cuttings of the wild type plants in the dark showed etiolated growth with no roots whereas shoots from the cuttings of the transgenic plants developed early and more roots. upon shifting from dark to light in growth room, leaves of the transgenic shoots showed early development of chlorophyll pigments compared to the wild type shoots. further, photosynthetically indistinguishable transgenic shoots also showed significant difference in root development from untransformed wild type shoots when cuttings were grown in the light. therefore, it may be concluded that the chlb gene is involved, directly or indirectly, in the root development of tobacco. further, the gene promotes early development of chlorophyll pigments, upon illumination from dark, in addition to its role in the light-independent chlorophyll formation when expressed together with subunits l&n in other organisms.
immunology	the concept of functional neutrophil subsets is new and their clinical significance in malignancies is unknown. our study investigated the role of cd16(dim) cd62l(high), cd16(high) cd62l(high) and cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subsets in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) patients. these neutrophil subsets may play different roles in immune-related activity in cancer, based on their profile, activation state and migration ability within a tumor site, which may be important in predicting cancer prognoses. tumor biopsies and blood were obtained from newly diagnosed untreated hnscc patients and healthy controls. neutrophil subsets and their phenotype were characterized using flow cytometry. isolated granulocytes were assessed for anti-tumor immune functions. compared to controls hnscc patients exhibited increased cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils in blood; this subset displayed a distinct phenotypes with high expression of cd11b and cd18. this subset was prone to migrate into the tumor facilitated by tumor-derived il-8. furthermore, il-8 was also found to activate neutrophils and thereby promoting subset transition. various assays demonstrated that activated cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils inhibited migration, proliferation and induced apoptosis of fadu cancer cells. neutrophil elastase detected in activated cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils and tumor biopsies suggested that cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils impart anti-tumoral activity via neutrophil extracellular traps. furthermore, increased fraction of cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils was shown to correlate with an increased survival rate. our study demonstrates the clinical relevance of the cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subset, providing evidence for its increased migration capacity, its anti-tumor activity including increased net formation and finally its correlation with increased survival in hnscc patients. what 's new? evidence is growing for distinct neutrophil subsets with diverse roles in cancer immunology, but a clinical link remains to be established. our study demonstrates the clinical relevance of the cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subset in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). patients harbored an increased fraction of anti-tumorigenic cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils in the circulation compared to healthy controls. the subset had an enhanced capacity to elicit neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) extrusion, and an increased fraction of cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophils in the circulation correlated with increased survival. the findings demonstrate an anti-tumoral role of the cd16(high) cd62l(dim) neutrophil subset in hnscc.
molecular_biology	background: representatives of the trematode family fasciolidae are responsible for major socio-economic losses worldwide. fascioloides magna is an important pathogenic liver fluke of wild and domestic ungulates. to date, only a limited number of studies concerning the molecular biology of f. magna exist. therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence of f. magna, and assess the phylogenetic relationships of this fluke with other trematodes based on the mtdna dataset. findings: the complete f. magna mt genome sequence is 14,047 bp. the gene content and arrangement of the f. magna mt genome is similar to those of fasciola spp., except that trne is located between trng and the only non-coding region in f. magna mt genome. phylogenetic relationships of f. magna with selected trematodes using bayesian inference (bi) was reconstructed based on the concatenated amino acid sequences for 12 protein-coding genes, which confirmed that the genus fascioloides is closely related to the genus fasciola; the intergeneric differences of amino acid composition between the genera fascioloides and fasciola ranged 17.97-18.24 %. conclusions: the determination of f. magna mt genome sequence provides a valuable resource for further investigations of the phylogeny of the family fasciolidae and other trematodes, and represents a useful platform for designing appropriate molecular markers.
genetics	a black fly species of the simulium feuerborni species-group of simulium (nevermannia) from cameron highland, peninsular malaysia, previously regarded as s. feuerborni edwards, originally described from east java, is described as simulium pairoti sp. nov. based on complete life stages. high intraspecific variations in the arrangement of the six pupal gill filaments, length of the stalk of the ventral paired filaments, and length of the anterodorsal projection of the cocoon, are noted in this species. this new species is readily distinguished from its congeners by having the characters of male genitalia with simple lamellate ventral plate, short inwardly-twisted styles, several parameral hooks, and a simple narrow median sclerite. morphological data reported herein plus the chromosomal and molecular data presented elsewhere support s. pairoti as a novel pseudocryptic species.

cell_biology	primary immunodeficiencies (pids) are a group of rare genetic diseases resulting in the impairment of one or more functions of the human immune system. common variable immunodeficiency (cvid) is one of the most prevalent pids, yet despite extensive genetic analysis, most patients do not have a monogenetic diagnosis. this has led to the theory that cvid must be a polygenetic condition. an alternative theory to a monogenetic or polygenetic underlying cause of cvid is that it is epigenetic phenomena that are causal in the majority of cvid patients. i will briefly discuss epigenetic regulation in b-cell biology and development, current examples of epigenetic diseases causing cvid-like primary antibody deficiencies, and how these observations may guide future investigation into the role of epigenetics in cvid.
molecular_biology	background: structural alignment of proteins is one of the most challenging problems in molecular biology. the tertiary structure of a protein strictly correlates with its function and computationally predicted structures are nowadays a main premise for understanding the latter. however, computationally derived 3d models often exhibit deviations from the native structure. a way to confirm a model is a comparison with other structures. the structural alignment of a pair of proteins can be defined with the use of a concept of protein descriptors. the protein descriptors are local substructures of protein molecules, which allow us to divide the original problem into a set of subproblems and, consequently, to propose a more efficient algorithmic solution. in the literature, one can find many applications of the descriptors concept that prove its usefulness for insight into protein 3d structures, but the proposed approaches are presented rather from the biological perspective than from the computational or algorithmic point of view. efficient algorithms for identification and structural comparison of descriptors can become crucial components of methods for structural quality assessment as well as tertiary structure prediction. results: in this paper, we propose a new combinatorial model and new polynomial-time algorithms for the structural alignment of descriptors. the model is based on the maximum-size assignment problem, which we define here and prove that it can be solved in polynomial time. we demonstrate suitability of this approach by comparison with an exact backtracking algorithm. besides a simplification coming from the combinatorial modeling, both on the conceptual and complexity level, we gain with this approach high quality of obtained results, in terms of 3d alignment accuracy and processing efficiency. conclusions: all the proposed algorithms were developed and integrated in a computationally efficient tool descs-standalone, which allows the user to identify and structurally compare descriptors of biological molecules, such as proteins and rnas. both pdb (protein data bank) and mmcif (macromolecular crystallographic information file) formats are supported.
human_metabolism	a study was undertaken to determine if humans excrete both amobarbital n-glucuronides and n-glucosides in urine after an oral dose of amobarbital. amobarbital n-glucuronides were synthesized and characterized. a reverse phase lc method using past-column ph adjustment and uv detection at 240 nm was developed and used for the quantification of the amobarbital n-glucosides and n-glucuronides in human urine. amobarbital was administered orally to seven male subjects and the total urine was collected for a period of 48-53 h after dosing. after filtration, the urine was injected directly onto the hplc column to analyze for the presence of metabolites. the previously identified (5s)-amobarbital n-glucoside was detected in all seven subjects. the (5r)-amobarbital n-glucoside was detected at lower concentrations in only four of the subjects. at the levels at which amobarbital n-glucosides were detected, there was no evidence for the formation and excretion of the amobarbital n-glucuronides. amobarbital n-glucuronidation is not a quantitatively significant pathway for the biodisposition of amobarbital in humans.

northern_blotting	type vii collagen is the major component of anchoring fibrils in the epidermal basement membrane. its expression has been analyzed by immunostaining or northern blotting, but rarely at the protein level. in this study, we have quantitatively examined the effects of ascorbic acid and various cytokines/growth factors on the protein synthesis and secretion of type vii collagen by human dermal fibroblasts in culture, using a developed, highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay with two kinds of specific monoclonal antibodies against the non-collagenous domain-1. ascorbic acid and its derivative induced a twofold increase in type vii collagen synthesis, and markedly increased the secretion of type vii collagen into the medium when compared with the control culture. this effect was not influenced by the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta 1). the synthesis of type vii collagen was elevated by tgf-beta 1, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta, but not by tgf-alpha. thus, our data indicate that the synthesis and secretion of type vii collagen in human dermal fibroblasts are regulated by ascorbate and the enhancement of type vii collagen gene expression by cytokines/growth factors is accompanied with elevated production of type vii collagen at the protein level.
enzymology	phosphonates are compounds that contain the chemically stable carbon-phosphorus (c-p) bond. they are widely distributed amongst more primitive life forms including many marine invertebrates and constitute a significant component of the dissolved organic phosphorus reservoir in the oceans. virtually all biogenic c-p compounds are synthesized by a pathway in which the key step is the intramolecular rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate. however c-p bond cleavage by degradative microorganisms is catalyzed by a number of enzymes c-p lyases, c-p hydrolases, and others of as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism. expression of some of the pathways of phosphonate catabolism is controlled by ambient levels of inorganic p (pi) but for others it is pi-independent. in this report we review the enzymology of c-p bond metabolism in bacteria, and also present the results of an in silico investigation of the distribution of the genes that encode the pathways responsible, in both bacterial genomes and in marine metagenomic libraries, and their likely modes of regulation. interrogation of currently available whole-genome bacterial sequences indicates that some 10% contain genes encoding putative pathways of phosphonate biosynthesis while similar to 40% encode one or more pathways of phosphonate catabolism. analysis of metagenomic data from the global ocean survey suggests that some 10 and 30%, respectively, of bacterial genomes across the sites sampled encode these pathways. catabolic routes involving phosphonoacetate hydrolase, c-p lyase(s), and an uncharacterized 2-aminoethylphosphonate degradative sequence were predominant, and it is likely that both substrate-inducible and pi-repressible mechanisms are involved in their regulation. the data we present indicate the likely importance of phosphonate-p in global biogeochemical p cycling, and by extension its role in marine productivity and in carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the oceans.
immunology	canine leishmaniosis (canl) is caused by the parasite leishmania infantum and is a systemic disease, which can present with variable clinical signs, and clinicopathological abnormalities. clinical manifestations can range from subclinical infection to very severe systemic disease. leishmaniosis is categorized as a neglected tropical disease and the complex immune responses associated with leishmania species makes therapeutic treatments and vaccine development challenging for both dogs and humans. in this review, we summarize innate and adaptive immune responses associated with l. infantum infection in dogs, and we discuss the problems associated with the disease as well as potential solutions and the future direction of required research to help control the parasite.
polymerase_chain_reaction	digital pcr (dpcr) is a powerful method for the absolute quantification and rare mutation detection of nucleic acids. however, the available dpcr platforms require either expensive instruments or complicated operation, which limit their extensive application. this paper describes a robust self-partition chip to perform dpcr in a very simple and inexpensive format. the chip is constructed by sandwiching a micromolded surfactant-doped pdms layer between two glass slides, containing 10,000 reaction compartments (0.785 nl each). the two simple strategies, ""glass-pdms-glass"" sandwich configuration and surfactant-doped surface modification, are used to enhance pcr compatibility and enable efficient amplification in the chip by minimizing water loss and nonspecific adsorption of protein. furthermore, powered by pre-degassing of its pdms substrate and an attached pdms slab, the chip autonomously loads and partitions sample into a high-density array of microwells for performing dpcr analysis. we evaluated the quantitative capabilities of the dpcr chip by measuring a ten-fold serial dilution of genomic dna from lung cancer cell line h1975. finally, we also demonstrate its feasibility in the accurate measurement of small copy number variations, which exhibited better accuracy than real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). such simple and low-cost platform promises to accelerate the widespread use of dpcr.

northern_blotting	we have cloned a novel transcriptional repressor protein, termed simirp58, which has high homology to rp58. both simirp58 and rp58 belong to the poz domain and kruppel zn finger (pok) family of proteins. using the luciferase assay system, we found that simirp58 also has transcriptional repressor activity like rp58. northern blotting and quantitative rt-pcr showed that simirp58 was expressed in testes at the highest level. in situ hybridization of testes showed that simirp58 is expressed by spermatocytes in only a portion of the seminiferous tubules. in contrast, expression of rp58 by spermatocytes was ubiquitous in all seminiferous, tubules. using cos-7 cells, we observed that simirp58 was localized in the cytoplasm, which is in contrast to rp58 that was localized in the nucleus. interestingly, co-transfection with simirp58 and rp58 induced changes in the localization patterns of both proteins.

human_metabolism	it was proved in two independent experimental studies with the same group of 11 young sportsmen that creatine (cr) given as food supplement interfered with the metabolism of one- and two-carbon units. cr, given in one dose of 5 g daily during one month, induced reciprocal changes of muscle mass and body fat. these changes were characteristic of each of the four proband groups, into which the probands were divided on basis of the increased or decreased level of cr in urine, and the increased or decreased levels of folates and vitamin b-12 in blood. the comparison of results of short- and long-term cr supplementations showed that individual deviations found within the rank of each group are characteristic for each person under study. the changes of the level of thiodiglycolic acid in urine proved to be good markers for deviations from homeostasis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim to investigate the role of delta 133p53 isoform in nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc)-mediated growth inhibition of mkn45 gastric cancer cells. methods the growth rate of mkn45 cells after treatment with different concentrations of only pdtc or ptdc in combination with cisplatin was detected by the cck-8 assay. mrna expression levels of delta 133p53, p53 beta, and the nf-kappa b p65 subunit and p65 protein levels were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunofluorescence, respectively. growth of mkn45 cells was significantly inhibited by pdtc alone in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). moreover, the inhibitory effect of cisplatin was remarkably enhanced in a dose- dependent manner by co-treatment with pdtc (p < 0.01). results rt-pcr analysis revealed that mrna expression of p65 was curbed significantly in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with only pdtc (p < 0.01), and this suppressive effect was further enhanced when co-treated with cisplatin (p < 0.01). with respect to the other p53 isoforms, mrna level of delta 133p53 was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with only pdtc or ptdc in combination with cisplatin (p0.05). a similar tendency of change in p65 protein expression, as observed for the corresponding mrna, was detected by immunofluorescence analysis (p0.01). conclusion delta 133p53 isoform (not p53 beta) is required in pdtc-induced inhibition of mkn45 gastric cancer cells, indicating that disturbance in the cross-talk between p53 and nf-kappa b pathways is a promising target in pharmaceutical research for the development of treatment strategies for gastric cancer.
enzymology	wound age evaluation is one of the most challenging issues in forensic pathology. in the first minutes or hours, standard histological examination may not determine whether the wound was inflicted in the pre- or post-mortem period. while red blood cell infiltration is classically considered as a sign of vital reaction, several studies have shown that extravasation of blood cells may also occur after death and cannot be used as a reliable marker in the diagnosis of wound vitality. numerous studies about wound vitality are available in the literature. they have evaluated markers involved in coagulation or inflammation, using various methods such as enzymology, molecular biology or immunohistochemistry. in this update, we first introduce some methodological principles. then, we review the main studies available in the literature. immunohistochemistry seems to be the most valuable method, given its easy application and the possibility to analyse the localization of the molecules of interest. some markers are promising, such as cd15, tnf alpha, il-6, il-1b, tgf alpha or tgf beta 1. prior to their application in daily practice, these early results need to be confirmed with other studies, conducted by independent teams and integrating multiple controls. most notably, the antibodies have to be tested in numerous postmortem wounds. indeed, a critical risk of overexpression in post-mortem wounds is present. some promising markers have been later invalidated because of post-mortem false positivity. finally, optimal sensitivity and specificity values could probably be reached by combining several markers, validated by large groups of pre- and post-mortem wounds.
human_metabolism	the diurnal light cycle has a crucial influence on all life on earth. unfortunately, modern society has modified this life- governing cycle by stressing maximum production and by giving insufficient attention to the ecological balance and homeostasis of the human metabolism. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of exposure or lack of exposure to natural light in a rest/ activity rhythm on cortisol and melatonin levels, as well as on psychological variables in humans under natural conditions. this is a cross- sectional study. the subjects were allocated split into two groups according to their workspace ( 10 employees in the ""with window'' group and 10 in the ""without window'' group). all participants were women and wore anactigraph ( actiwatch 2, philips respironics), which measures activity and ambient light exposure, for seven days. concentrations of melatonin and cortisol were measured from the saliva samples. participants were instructed to collect saliva during the last day of use of the actigraph at 08: 00 am, 4: 00 pm and 10: 00 pm. the subjects answered the self- reporting questionnaire- 20 ( srq- 20) to measure the presence of minor psychiatric disorders; the montgomery- asberg ( ma) scale was used to measure depression symptoms, and the pittsburgh sleep quality index questionnaire ( psqi) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep. the rayleigh analysis indicates that the two groups, `` with window'' an d `` without window'', exhibited similar activities and light acrophases. in relation to light exposure, the mesor was significantly higher ( t 2.651, p 0.023) in t he `` with window'' group ( 191.04 133.36) than in the `` without window'' group ( 73.8 42.05). additionally, the `` with window'' group presented the highest amplitude of light exposure ( 298.07 222.97). cortisol levels were significantly different between the groups at 10: 00 pm ( t 3.009, p 0.008; `` without window'' ( 4.01 0.91) `` with window'' ( 3.10 0.30)). in terms of the melatonin levels, the groups differed at two different times of day: 08: 00 am ( t 2.593, p 0.018) and 10: 00 pm ( t 2.939, p 0.009). the `` with window'' group had a lower melatonin level at 08: 00 am ( 3.54 0.60) but a higher level at 10: 00 pm ( 24.74 4.22) than the `` without window'' group. higher cortisol levels were positively correlated with minor psychiatric disorders and depressive symptoms ( ma) at 10: 00 pm. lower melatonin levels at 10: 00 pm were correlated with depressive symptoms and poor quality of sleep ( psqi). our study demonstrated that not only may light pollution affect human physiology but also lack of exposure to natural light is related to high levels of cortisol and lower levels of melatonin at night, and these, in turn, are related to depressive symptoms and poor quality of sleep.
immunology	people living nowadays with hiv and aids may be treated effectively regarding virus replication and immunology. however, non-aids-defining cancer is of growing relevance due to high incidence and unfavorable outcome. the aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on gastrointestinal (gi) carcinoma. although literature on gi cancer is rare, an increased incidence of esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and colorectal carcinoma has been demonstrated. however, there are only few reports on therapy strategies and outcome, so that, despite increased occurrence of many gi carcinomas, only little is known about individualized treatment options and outcome in hiv-positive patients. more efforts have to be undertaken to close this gap.

genetics	the genetic structure of european mudminnow populations throughout the species range was examined using mitochondrial dna and seven microsatellite loci. ten mitochondrial haplotypes were detected, suggesting three phylogeographic lineages, which likely diverged during the early and middle pleistocene. these three lineages geographically correspond to three regions: the danube drainage including the drava system and dniester delta, the sava system and the tisza system. high genetic diversity observed using mtdna was confirmed with microsatellite data, suggesting the existence of 14 populations in the studied area. the isolation-with-migration model showed that migration rates between populations were generally low and were highest between the drava and its tributary mura. according to the inferred relative population splitting times, umbra krameri likely spread from the eastern part of the species range to the west, which also showed the highest genetic diversity and largest population size. as reported by the time-calibrated phylogeny, separation of the european and american umbra occurred roughly at the end of late cretaceous and in the first half of the paleogene (60.57 ma with 95% highest probability density of 39.57-81.75). taking these results into account, appropriate guidelines are proposed to conserve european mudminnow populations.
polymerase_chain_reaction	escherichia coli o157 related foodborne illnesses continue to be one of the most important global public health problems in the world. this study aims to determine e. coli o157 prevalence in 375 chicken meat parts and giblets. the samples were collected randomly from several supermarkets and butchers in diyarbakir, a city in southeast turkey. they were analyzed and confirmed using the immunomagnetic separation (ims), vitek (r) 2 microbial identification system and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. this study also aims to detect the presence of flic(h7), eaea, stx(1), stx(2) and hlya genes by using pcr. the overall e. coli o157 prevalence in chicken meat parts and giblets was 1.3%. all of the e. coli o157 isolates carried rfbe(o157) and eaea genes; but not any flic(h7) and hlya genes. the e. coli o157 isolates obtained from drumstick and breast meat carried either stx(1) or stx(2) genes, which were related to important virulence factors of the disease.
northern_blotting	objective: symptoms of airway diseases are often associated with specific times of the day. for example, midnight worsening of cough is a frequent complaint of patients with laryngitis and bronchitis. we speculate that these symptoms are under the control of the circadian clock, and the clock genes in the airway epithelium play some important roles. in the present study, we tried to prove the time specific expressions of clock oscillating genes in the murine larynx. materials and methods: adult wild-type c57/b16 mice and mcry1(-/-)mcry2(-/-) mutant mice were used for this study. we employed immunohistochemistyr and/or northern blotting for examining the circadian expression of mper1, mper2, c/ebpbeta, hnf3beta, and muc5b. results: the expression of mper2 mrna showed a strong day-night expression difference, which was abolished after the lesion of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and in mcry1(-/-)mcry2(-/-) mutant mice. mper1 and mper2 proteins both showed very similar expression profiles in the epithelium and submucosal glands with a peak in the evening and a trough in the early morning. other nuclear proteins such as c/ebpbeta and hnf3beta did not show the rhythms. muc5b protein showed circadian oscillation in the laryngeal submucosal gland. conclusion: in this study, we confirmed the existence of a local laryngeal clock which is controlled by the central clock in the suprachiasniatic nucleus. muc5b protein in the submucosal mucous gland also showed circadian rhythm. we consider that these rhythmic expressions may cause the time specific symptoms among laryngeal diseases.

immunology	background: home-based interventions to improve indoor air quality have demonstrated benefits for asthma morbidity, yet little is known about the effect of environmental interventions in the school setting. objective: we piloted the feasibility and effectiveness of a classroom-based air cleaner intervention to reduce particulate pollutants in classrooms of children with asthma. methods: in this pilot randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effect of air cleaners on indoor air particulate pollutant concentrations in 18 classrooms (9 control, 9 intervention) in 3 urban elementary schools. we enrolled 25 children with asthma (13 control, 12 intervention) aged 6 to 10 years. classroom air pollutant measurements and spirometry were completed once before and twice after randomization. asthma symptoms were surveyed every 3 months. results: baseline classroom levels of fine particulate matter (particulate matter with diameter of <2.5 mu m [pm2.5]) and black carbon (bc) were 6.3 and 0.41 mu g/m(3), respectively. when comparing the intervention to the control group, classroom pm2.5 levels were reduced by 49% and 42% and bc levels were reduced by 58% and 55% in the first and second follow-up periods, respectively (p<.05 for all comparisons). when comparing the children randomized to intervention and control classrooms, there was a modest improvement in peak flow, but no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) and asthma symptoms. conclusions: in this pilot study, a classroom-based air cleaner intervention led to significant reductions in pm2.5 and bc. future large-scale studies should comprehensively evaluate the effect of school-based environmental interventions on pediatric asthma morbidity.

human_metabolism	folates belong to the b vitamin group based on the parental compound folic acid (fa). they are involved in important biochemical processes like dna synthesis and repair. fa is composed of a pteridine ring, p-aminobenzoic acid and glutamate moieties. the human metabolism is not able to synthesize folates and therefore obtain them from diet. fa, a synthetic vitamin, is used as a food fortificant because of its low price, relative stability and increased bioavailability compared to natural folate forms. fa is known to be a sensitive compound easily degradable in aqueous solution by ultraviolet and visible light towards various by-products. irradiation is a process for preservation of foods that uses accelerated electrons, gamma rays or x-rays. irradiation is proposed for the treatment of various food products, eliminating or reducing pathogens and insects, increasing the storage time and replacing chemical fumigants. this study concerns the identification of degradation products of fa after e-beam irradiation. fa aqueous solutions were irradiated with a van de graaff electrons beam accelerator (2 mev, 100 mu a current, 20 cm scan width, dose rate about 2 kgy/s). applied doses were between 0 (control) and 10.0 kgy. absorbed doses were monitored with fwt 60.00 radiochromic dosimeters.

human_metabolism	hydroxycinnamic acids are antioxidant phenolic compounds which are widespread in plant foods, contribute significantly to total polyphenol intakes, and are absorbed by humans. the extent of their putative health benefit in vivo depends largely on their bioavailability. however, the mechanisms of absorption and metabolism of these phenolic compounds have not been described. in this study, we used the in vitro caco-2 model of human small intestinal epithelium to investigate the metabolism of the major dietary hydroxycinnamates (ferulate, sinapate, p-coumarate, and caffeate) and of diferulates. the appearance of metabolites in the medium versus time was monitored, and the various conjugates and derivatives produced were identified by hplc-dad, lc/ms, and enzyme treatment with beta-glucuronidase or sulfatase. enterocyte-like differentiated caco-2 cells have extra- and intracellular esterases able to de-esterify hydroxycinnamate and diferulate esters. in addition, intracellular udp-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases existing in caco-2 cells are able to form the sulfate and the glucuronide conjugates of methyl ferulate, methyl sinapate, methyl caffeate, and methyl p-coumarate. however, only the sulfate conjugates of the free acids, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid, were detected after 24 h. the o-methylated derivatives, ferulic and isoferulic acid, were the only metabolites detected following incubation of caco-2 cells with caffeic acid. these results show that the in vitro model system differentiated caco-2 cells have the capacity to metabolize dietary hydroxycinnamates, including various phase i (de-esterification) and phase ii (glucuronidation, sulfation, and o-methylation) reactions, and suggests that the human small intestinal epithelium plays a role in the metabolism and bioavailability of these phenolic compounds.
polymerase_chain_reaction	although some novel antimicrobial peptides (amp) have been successfully isolated from bactrocera dorsalis hendel, the mechanisms underlying the induction of these peptides are still elusive. the homolog of nf-kappa b transcription factor relish, designated as bdrelish, was cloned from b. dorsalis. the full length cdna of bdrelish is 3954 bp with an open reading frame that encodes 1013 amino acids. similar to drosophila relish and the mammalian p100, it is a compound protein containing a conserved rel homology domain, an ipt (ig-like, plexins, transcription factors) domain and an i kappa b-like domain (four ankyrin repeats), the nuclear localization signal rkrrr is also detected at the residues 449-453, suggesting that it has homology to relish and it is a member of the rel family of transcription activator proteins. reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis reveals that bdrelish mrnas are detected in different quantities from various tissues and the highest transcription level of bdrelish is determined in fat body. the injection challenge of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureas significantly upregulated the expression of bdrelish. the injection of bdrelish dsrna markedly reduced the expression of bdrelish and decreased the transcription magnitude of antimicrobial peptides. individuals injected bdrelish dsrna died at a significantly faster rate compared with the control groups. therefore, bdrelish is vital for the transcription of amps to attack the invading bacteria.
human_metabolism	blackcurrant (bc) fruits are a rich source of biologically active anthocyanins but little is known of the anthocyanin content of commonly consumed bc products or how processing affects the absorption. we report that whereas fresh and frozen whole bc were a rich source of anthocyanins, containing 897 and 642 mg (100 g fw)(-1) of total anthocyanins the levels in all other products were substantially lower (0.05-10.3% of the levels in fresh fruit). further, when the absorption and excretion of bc was assessed in volunteers consuming a portion (100 g) of frozen whole bc (642 mg total anthocyanins) and, 300 g of a bc drink made by diluting concentrated syrup (33.6 mg total anthocyanins), only small quantities of bc anthocyanins were excreted in urine (fruit, 0.053 +/- 0.022%; drink, 0.036 +/- 0.043%; mean percent urinary yield +/- sd) and they were not detected in plasma. these data indicate that fresh and frozen bc, but not processed products, are rich sources of anthocyanins but, regardless of the food source, these anthocyanins are poorly bioavailable.

northern_blotting	clostridium kluyveri is unique in fermenting ethanol and acetate to butyrate, caproate, and h-2. the genes encoding butyrate-producing enzymes, including electron-bifurcating butyryl-coa dehydrogenase/electron transfer flavoprotein complex and nadh-dependent reduced ferredoxin:nadp(+) oxidoreductase, form a cluster, which is preceded by a gene annotated as the transcriptional regulator rex. northern blotting and rt-pcr experiments indicated that the gene cluster forms a large transcriptional unit that possibly includes several small transcriptional units. the deduced rex protein contains a winged helix dna-binding domain and a rossmann fold potentially interacting with nad(h). bioinformatics analysis revealed that rex can bind the promoter regions of numerous genes, which are involved in carbon and energy metabolism, including nadh oxidation, hydrogen production, atp synthesis, butyrate formation, and succinate metabolism. rex may regulate the transcription of genes encoding certain transcriptional regulators and transporters. electrophoretic mobility shift and isothermal titration calorimetry assays revealed that rex specifically formed protein-dna complexes with the promoter regions of target genes, which could be inhibited by nadh but restored by an excess amount of nad(+). these results suggest that rex plays a key role in the carbon and energy metabolism of c. kluyveri as a global transcriptional regulator in response to the cellular nadhinad' ratio.

southern_blotting	banana streak virus (bsv) is a significant constraint to banana production in kenya. the ability to quickly and reliably detect bsv is important for the management of the virus. hence, detection of the variability of bsv was necessary for the optimization of a suitable diagnostic protocol to be used for routine screening of tissue cultured material. in this study, 215 potentially infected banana plants from nine major banana growing regions in kenya were tested for bsv using serological and molecular techniques. virus particles were detected by immunosorbent electron microscopy (isem) in seven of the ten tested samples confirming the presence of bsv. immuno-capture-polymerase chain reaction (ic-pcr) using a degenerate primer was used on extracted viral dna and on immune-captured viral particles from 80 samples. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) confirmed the presence of bsv in 200 samples and ic-pcr in 38 of the 80 tested samples. a total of 33 sequences were obtained from eight samples by pcr (embl accession numbers am 905900-am905905) across the conserved reverse transcriptase/rnaseh region of the genome. pairwise comparison of the sequences suggested that they represented seven different isolates with sequence identity thresholds of 90-100%. southern blotting and hybridization with a radiolabelled probe of the lisulya clone, confirmed that both integrated and episomally replicating viral dna may be present in at least one of the kenya samples. therefore, the presence of bsv in kenya and some diversity within the kenyan population was confirmed. the diagnostic protocol was optimized for the confirmed isolates.
southern_blotting	background: currently, the technology called clearfield (r) is used in the development of crops resistant to herbicides that inhibit the enzyme acetohydroxy acid synthase (ahas, ec 2.2.1.6). ahas is the first enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway that produces the branched-chain of the essential amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. therefore, multiple copies of the ahas gene might be of interest for breeding programs targeting herbicide resistance. in this work, the characterization of the ahas gene was accomplished for the chenopodium quinoa regalona-baer cultivar. cloning, sequencing, and southern blotting were conducted to determine the number of gene copies. results: the presence of multiple copies of the ahas gene as has been shown previously in several other species is described. six copies of the ahas gene were confirmed with southern blot analyses. cqhas1 and cqahas2 variants showed the highest homology with ahas mrna sequences found in the nr database. a third copy, cqahas3, shared similar fragments with both cqahas1 and cqahas2, suggesting duplication through homeologous chromosomes pairing. conclusions: the presence of multiple copies of the gene ahas shows that gene duplication is a common feature in polyploid species during evolution. in addition, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction of sub-genomes in quinoa.

cell_biology	transgenic pigs failed to accord milk yield curve to lactate rhfix-a vitamin k (vk) dependent protein even fed with vk enriched to 8 times higher than nutritional requirement. a further higher vk supplementation may be required. homozygous transgenic sows (n = 4, 200 kg) at their 3rd nursing were divided into control and treatment groups and respectively received vk enriched and further menadione (soluble vk) supplemented diet (220 mg/kg vk enriched diet) for 33 days. at next lactation, control sows than received treatment and previous treated were fed on control diet. results revealed that menadione treatment increased milk bioactivity of rhfix from the 7th day of 73 to the 21st day of 153 iu/ml; it gradually decreased to 96 iu/ml on 35th day of lactation. under control feeding, bioactivity remained relatively unchanged. however, milk rhfix concentration and ratio of activated rhfix responded little to the treatment. the menadione-induced bioactivity curve agrees with the known lactation pattern of sow means rhfix secretion is still galactopoietic but requires high vk intake to show. the ineffectual vk spend on lactational carboxylation might be common in other mammary vk dependent expression system but can be effectively overcome by a high supplementation of menadione with a 5-folds improvement in quality.
molecular_biology	india is rich in genetic diversity of major pulse crops, but the productivity and the production of pulse crops remains low compared to the world and hence, there is a need to enhance the utilization for increasing the production. major pulse species for which genetic diversity is occurring in india include vigna, cajanus, cicer, pisum, lens, phaseolus and few minor pulses such as macrotyloma, canavalia, lathyrus, vicia, mucuna, moghania and rhynchosia etc. national bureau of pint genetic resources (nbpgr) is the nodal institute for the ""management of plant genetic resources in india. it has assembled-70,000 accessions of different pulse crops majoring cajanus cajan, cicer arietinum, phaseolus vulgaris, pisum sativum, vigna mungo, vigna radiata, vigna umbellata, vigna unguiculata, viceasp. and lens sp. through collection and introduction from india and from >70 other countries of the world. several pests of quarantine significance have been identified and salvaged from the exotic germplasm. the ex situ base collection at nbpgr conserve 64,744 accessions of 20 genera and 61 species of pulses. this germplasm has been characterized for agro-morphological, quality and biochemical traits, biotic and abiotic stresses for identifying trait-specific reference sets and 28 catalogues describing about 45,000 accessions of 14 pulse crops. a total of 121 accessions of various pulse crops have been registered as unique/potential donors. core and mini cores have been developed in chickpea, pigeonpea, common bean, mungbean, adzuki bean, cowpea, lentil, moth bean and pea both nationally and internationally. wild species of pulse crops have been utilized for transferring desirable traits into cultivated species. application of modern tools and technologies of molecular biology will accelrate the process of gene transfer for improvement of pulse crops.
genetics	background: at present, the metaphase ii (mii) oocytes have a very special structure that leads to complex difficulties associated with its vitrification, and their efficacy still needs a large amount of study to observe. the present study was to investigate whether transient hydrostatic pressure (thp), which was utilized for oocytes before vitrification, had positive effect on the oocytes' developmental ability and reactive oxygen species, and had no damage on meiotic spindle, zona pellucida, and dna copy number. methods: all the immature oocytes used in this research were collected between february 2015 and december 2015 in shanghai ji ai genetics & ivf institute. the mii oocytes, which were originated from metaphase i (mi) oocytes, were randomly distributed into three groups: a) fresh oocytes; b) vitrification; and c) vitrification after thp treatment. the embryo developmental outcome was evaluated after intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo culture. furthermore, the meiotic spindle behavior, reactive oxygen species (ros), zona pellucida (zp), and dna copy number variation were evaluated and compared among the three groups. results: a total of 568 mii oocytes were included in the study. embryos from group b had fewer cells on day 3 compared with group a and c (5.01 +/- 2.11 for group a, 3.89 +/- 2.21 for group b, and 4.69 +/- 2.05 for group c). the developmental feature of blastocyst in groups a and c were superior to those of group b. the mii oocytes were manipulated with thp before vitrification, and the equilibration time was significantly shorter in the vitrification procedure (244.9 +/- 30.1 vs. 181.5 +/- 10.1). the ros, zp of vitrified/warmed oocytes in group c were improved with thp before vitrification. thp had no influence on the meiotic spindle and dna copy number variation of vitrified/warmed oocytes. conclusions: the results of the study indicated that sublethal thp treatment before vitrification increased the developmental competence of human in vitro matured oocytes, reduced vitrification related changes in the ros, which occurred during oocyte vitrification, and did not damage the meiotic spindle, zp and dna copy number variation.

northern_blotting	human mitochondrial long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have not been described to date. by analysis of deep-sequencing data we have identified three lncrnas generated from the mitochondrial genome and confirmed their expression by northern blotting and strand-specific qrt-pcr. we show that the abundance of these lncrnas is comparable to their complementary mrnas and that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins involved in rna processing regulate their expression. we also identify the 5' and 3' transcript ends of the three lncrnas and show that mitochondrial rnase p protein 1 (mrpp1) is important for the processing of these transcripts. finally, we show that mitochondrial lncrnas form intermolecular duplexes and that their abundance is cell-and tissue-specific, suggesting a functional role in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.
immunology	johne 's disease, caused by infection with mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (map), is a chronic wasting disease of ruminants. hallmark symptoms of clinical johne 's disease include diarrhea, progressive weight loss, and premature death; symptoms due largely to chronic inflammation in the small intestine. map colonizes resident macrophages within the ileum of the small intestine, subsequently establishing a persistent infection in the host. it has been proposed that regulatory t cells may play a role in the progression of johne 's disease, either through promotion of tolerance to map or via a loss in homeostasis that subsequently allows widespread inflammation. in this report, we evaluated the presence of tregs, as well as other immune parameters, in the ileum and draining lymph nodes of map associated lesions. a lesion classification scheme was developed to categorize severity of map-induced lesions within infected tissues and subsequently regulatory t cell presence and overall immune activity were assessed corresponding to lesions of varying severity, in comparison to tissues from healthy control animals. our results revealed a relationship between animal health and overall lesion severity within the infected tissues, as well as a relationship between bacterial burden and severity of pathology. regulatory t cell abundance was shown to decrease with increasing lesion severity. within the ileum, the expression of many th1, th2, and treg-associated genes increased in mild lesions and decreased in severe lesions, whereas in the lymph nodes the expression of these genes tended to increase with increasing lesion severity. based on our results, we conclude that a local loss of t cell (including treg) activity occurs within severe heal lesions associated with map, resulting in a loss of homeostasis that ultimately leads to the progression of clinical johne 's disease.

southern_blotting	in chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, variants with mutations in the basal core promoter (bcp) and precore region predominate and associate with more severe disease forms. studies on their effect on viral replication remain controversial. increasing evidence shows that epigenetic modifications of cccdna regulate hbv replication and disease outcome. here we determined the transcription and viral replication efficiency of well-defined bcp and precore mutations and their effect on cccdna epigenetic control. hbv monomers bearing bcp mutations a1762t/g1764a and a1762t/g1764a/c1766t, and precore mutations g1896a, g1899a and g1896a/g1899a, were transfected into hepg2 cells using a plasmid-free approach. viral rna transcripts were detected by northern blot hybridization and rt pcr, dna replicative intermediates by southern blotting and rt pcr, and viral release was measured by elisa. acetylation of cccdna-bound histones was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assay and methylation of cccdna by bisulfite sequencing. bcp mutations resulted in low viral release, mrna transcription and pgrna/cccdna ratios that paralleled the acetylation of cccdna-bound h4 histone and inversely correlated with the hdac1 recruitment onto cccdna. independently of the mutations, cccdna was a target for methylation, accompanied by the upregulation of dnmt1 expression and dnmt1 recruitment onto cccdna. our results suggest that bcp mutations decrease viral replication capacity possibly by modulating the acetylation and deacetylation of cccdna-bound histones while precore mutations do not have a significant effect on viral replication. these data provide evidence that epigenetic factors contribute to the regulation of hbv viral replication.

human_metabolism	accelerator mass spectrometry (ams) is an extremely sensitive nuclear physics technique developed in the mid-70 's for radiocarbon dating of historical artefacts. the technique centres round the use of a tandem van de graaff accelerator to generate the potential energy to permit separation of elemental isotopes at the single atom level. ams was first used in the early 90 's for the analysis of biological samples containing enriched c-14 for toxicology and cancer research. since that time biomedical ams has been used in the study of (1) metabolism of xenobiotics in animals and humans (2) pathways of drug metabolism (3) biomarkers (4) metabolism of endogenous molecules including vitamins (5) dna and protein binding studies and (6) clinical diagnosis. a new drug development concept which relies on the ultrasensitivity of ams known as human microdosing (phase 0) is being used to obtain early human metabolism information of candidate drugs arising out of discovery. these various aspects of ams are reviewed in this article and a perspective on future applications of ams provided.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the eco-toxicological effects of bacillus thuringiensis (bt) maize on earthworm life-history traits were widely studied and the results were controversial, while their effects on earthworm bacterial community have been rarely studied. here, effects of two hybrids of bt maize [5422bt1 (event bt11) and 5422cbcl (mon810)] straw return on eisenia fetida bacterial community were investigated by the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) combing with dna sequencing, compared to near-isogenic non-bt maize (5422). bt maize straw return had significant effects on soil nutrients, especially for available nitrogen (n). the significant differences were shown in soil bacterial community between bt and non-bt maize treatments on the 75th and 90th d, which was closely correlated with soil available n, p and k rather than crylab protein. there was no statistically significant difference in the bacterial community of earthworm gut contents between bt and non-bt maize treatments. the significant differences in the bacterial community of earthworm casts were found among three maize varieties treatments, which were closely correlated with crylab protein and n levels. the differentiated bacterial species in earthworm casts mainly belonged to proteobacteria, including brevundimonas, caulobacter, pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, methylobacterium, asticcacaulis and achromobacter etc., which were associated with the mineralization, metabolic process and degradation of plants residues. therefore, bt maize straw return caused changes in the bacterial community of e. fetida casts, which was possibly caused by the direct (crylab protein) and non-expected effects (n levels) of bt maize straw.

enzymology	proteins targeted for degradation by the mycobacterial proteasome are covalently modified with prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (pup) in a process termed ""pupylation."" despite its name, pup is only ubiquitin-like in function and not sequence or structure. furthermore, the enzymology of pupylation appears to be distinct from protein modification by ubiquitin (ub) and other ubiquitin-like proteins (ubls). nonetheless, we have adapted methods established in the ub field for the production of reagents to isolate, identify, and analyze pupylated proteins in mycobacteria. these methods can be modified to study specific pupylated proteins in various pup-bearing bacteria or to identify posttranslational modifiers in other prokaryotes.
immunology	transfusion of blood cell components is frequent in the therapeutic arsenal; it is globally safe or even very safe. at present, residual clinical manifestations are principally inflammatory in nature. if some rare clinical hazards manifest as acute inflammation symptoms of various origin, most of them linked with conflicting and undesirable biological material accompanying the therapeutic component (infectious pathogen, pathogenic antibody, unwanted antigen, or allergen), the general feature is subtler and less visible, and essentially consists of alloimmunization or febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. the present essay aims to present updates in hematology and immunology that help understand how, when, and why subclinical inflammation underlies alloimmunization and circumstances characteristic of red blood cells and - even more frequently - platelets that contribute inflammatory mediators. modern transfusion medicine makes sustained efforts to limit such inflammatory hazards; efforts can be successful only if one has a clear view of each element 's role.
genetics	aim. we tested the performance of the tissue homogenizer bead beater millmix 20 (tehtnica - domel) for grinding the bone samples from skeletal remains for sub sequential extraction and dna typing of human identification short tandem repeats (strs). methods. we analyzed 60 bone dna extracts obtained from femurs and tibias. from 13 bones (6 femurs and 7 tibias) analyses were repeated two and from 4 femurs three times to evaluate the repeatability of the extraction method and grinding machine used. dna was obtained from 0.5 g of demineralizated bone powder and the samples were quantified using the human quantifiler or the investigator quantiplex kit. str typing was performed using the ngm or the investigator essplex plus kit to evaluate the quality of bone powder and tested extraction method. results. of the profiles obtained from 60 dna extracts, 73% were full, 17% acceptable, 8% quite acceptable and only 2% of the profiles were not suitable for interpretation which represent a 98% success rate. from 17 bones analyses were repeated two or three times and results obtained show high degree of repeatability since very similar results were obtained from almost all of the repetition. conclusion. grinding the bone samples using the millmix 20 has proven highly successful in recovery of high-quality powder from skeletal remains. we believe that the results obtained will contribute to the possibilities of using automated devices for grinding the bone samples, which would shorten the procedures for obtaining high-quality bone powder from skeletons in forensic laboratories.
southern_blotting	the significant breakthrough in plant biotechnology is the development of techniques to transform genes from unrelated sources into commercially important crop plants to develop resistance against insect pests. a local cotton cultivar mnh-93 was transformed through agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c58c(1) assisted by bombardment with tungsten particles. the agrobacterium strain contained the recombinant binary vector pkmab harboring crylab under 35s promoter. neomycin phosphotransferase (nptii) gene was used as a selectable marker at a concentration of 50 mg l-1. the transformation efficiency remained 0.26%. the primary transformants were analyzed for transgene integration and expression through pcr and southern blotting and western dot blot. the gene copy number was determined by southern analysis in order to find out the crylab integration sites. the bt protein being produced in the transgenic plants was quantified using imagequant software, which ranged from 0.00 to 1.35% of the total protein. the positive plant seeds obtained from to progeny were further raised under greenhouse and field conditions to evaluate their field performance. leaf biotoxicity assays were performed to determine the efficacy of introduced gene. the results showed that transgenic lines in t-1 progeny have appreciable level of resistance (40-60%) against lepidopteran pests in both green house and field conditions.
molecular_biology	family study can provide estimates of overall genetic influences on a particular trait because family relationships provide accurate measures of average genetic sharing. however, evidence of genetic contributions to skin phenotypes is limited, which may preclude genetic studies to identify genetic variants or to understand underlying molecular biology of skin traits. this study aimed to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to selected dermatologic phenotypes, that is, to melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity level in a korean twin-family cohort. we investigated more than 2,000 individuals from 486 families, including 388 monozygotic twin pairs and 82 dizygotic twin pairs. variance component method was used to estimate genetic influences in terms of heritability. heritability of skin melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity (arm and cheek) were estimated to be 0.44 [ 95% ci 0.38-0.49], 0.21 [ 95% ci 0.16-0.26], 0.13 [ 95% ci 0.07-0.18], and 0.11 [ 95% ci 0.06-0.16] respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. our findings suggest that genetics play a major role on skin melanin index, but only mild roles on sebum secretion and humidity. sebum secretion and skin humidity are controlled predominantly by environmental factors notably on shared environments among family members. we expect that our findings add insight to determinants of common dermatologic traits, and serve as a reference for biologic studies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	adipose and endothelial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular disease. perivascular adipose tissue (pvat) directly surrounds vessels and influences vessel function via a paracrine effect, and adenosine monophosphate (amp)-activated protein kinase (ampk) modulates the metabolic pathway, thus, the present study hypothesized that activation of ampk in pvat may regulate endothelial function in pathological settings. the present study investigated the effect of methotrexate (mtx) on adipocytokine expression in pvat with an emphasis on the regulation of endothelial function. the effects of mtx and the mechanisms involved were investigated using a relaxation assay and western blot analysis. reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to detect the mrna and protein expression levels. elisa assay was used to quantify the level of tnf-alpha and il-6. palmitic acid (pa) stimulation induced inflammation and dysregulation of adipocytokine expression in pvat. mtx treatment inhibited nuclear factor-kappa b p65 phosphorylation and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, whereas adiponectin expression increased. mtx increased ampk phosphorylation under basal and inflammatory conditions in pvat, whereas knockdown of ampk via small interfering rna diminished its modulatory effect, indicating that mtx inhibits inflammation in an ampk-dependent manner. the present study prepared conditioned medium from pa-stimulated pvat to induce endothelial dysfunction and observed that pre-treatment of pvat with mtx effectively restored the loss of acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in the rat aorta. the results of the present study demonstrated that mtx ameliorated inflammation-associated adipocytokine dysregulation and thus prevented endothelial dysfunction. these data provide further pharmacological evidence regarding the beneficial effects of mtx in cardiovascular diseases.
enzymology	since 1970s', chinese enzymologists have obtained a lot of distinguished achievements on the basic research on enzymes. at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of progress in biochemistry and biophysics, this paper is attempted to review the selected achievements from the systematically enzymic research in china.
southern_blotting	plant defensins are group of small, cysteine stabilized antimicrobial peptides rich in basic amino acids which inhibit growth of a multitude of phytopathogens. these defensins have been explored widely to generate transgenic crop plants resistant to varied fungal and bacterial diseases. in the present study, gene sequence coding for a seed defensin (sm-amp-d1) of common chickweed stellaria media was synthesized artificially and cloned downstream of a strong constitutive promoter in pcambia-1301 plant expression vector. transgenic banana plants expressing the sm-amp-d1 gene were subsequently generated via agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. transgenic nature of the regenerated banana plants was confirmed by genomic dna pcr and southern blotting analysis. northern blots demonstrated efficient expression of sm-amp-d1 mrna in transgenic banana plants. further, two selected transgenic lines challenged with a pathogenic isolate of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 1 showed improved resistance as compared to untransformed control banana plants. these transgenic lines continued to show resistance against foc race 1 6 months post-infection. this study demonstrates that overexpression of potent plant defensins such as sm-amp-d1 in important food crops like banana can lead to development of durable resistance against fungal pathogens.
cell_biology	in bacteria, the control of mrna stability is crucial to allow rapid adaptation to changing conditions. in most bacteria, rna degradation is catalyzed by the rna degradosome, a protein complex composed of endo- and exoribonucleases, rna helicases, and accessory proteins. in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis, the existence of a rna degradosome assembled around the membrane-bound endoribonuclease rnase y has been proposed. here, we have studied the intracellular localization of the protein that have been implicated in the potential b. subtilis rna degradosome, i.e., polynucleotide phosphorylase, the exoribonucleases j1 and j2, the dead-box rna helicase csha, and the glycolytic enzymes enolase and phosphofructokinase. our data suggests that the bulk of these enzymes is located in the cytoplasm. the rnases j1 and j2 as well as the rna helicase csha were mainly localized in the peripheral regions of the cell where also the bulk of messenger rna is localized. we were able to demonstrate active exclusion of these proteins from the transcribing nucleoid. taken together, our findings suggest that the interactions of the enzymes involved in rna degradation in b. subtilis are rather transient.
genetics	the current focus on delivery of personalised (or precision) medicine reflects the expectation that developments in genomics, imaging and other domains will extend our diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, and enable more effective targeting of current and future preventative and therapeutic options. the clinical benefits of this approach are already being realised in rare diseases and cancer but the impact on management of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, remains limited. this may reflect reliance on inappropriate models of disease architecture, based around rare, high-impact genetic and environmental exposures that are poorly suited to our emerging understanding of type 2 diabetes. this review proposes an alternative 'palette' model, centred on a molecular taxonomy that focuses on positioning an individual with respect to the major pathophysiological processes that contribute to diabetes risk and progression. this model anticipates that many individuals with diabetes will have multiple parallel defects that affect several of these processes. one corollary of this model is that research efforts should, at least initially, be targeted towards identifying and characterising individuals whose adverse metabolic trajectory is dominated by perturbation in a restricted set of processes.
molecular_biology	relationships between the abundance of potential geosmin- and 2-methylisoborneol-producing (2-mib) cyanobacteria and bacteria, and concentrations of the two taste and odour compounds (t&os) were examined in a 7 day incubation of natural water from the surface and bottom of three reservoirs in southeast queensland, australia. only a single known t&o-producing cyanobacterium (geitlerinema spp.) was detected by microscopy at low density, and only in one reservoir. densities of potential t&o-producing streptomyces (determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay) were highest in the bottom water and varied from 0.7 x 10(3) to 775 x 10(3) cells l-1. geosmin ranged from 6 to 59 ng l-1 (with the highest concentrations in the bottom water), while 2-mib varied from 6 to 47 ng l-1 (with the highest concentration in surface water). concentrations of both compounds declined during the incubation under both light and dark conditions. presence of the geosmin synthase gene, geoa, in cyanobacteria and streptomyces was examined by different pcr approaches. cloning of pcr products from amplification of geoa showed a high similarity to geoa in cyanobacteria, but not to streptomycetes. our results demonstrate that more research on the ecology and molecular biology of t&o producers is required to better understand the dynamics of t&os and to monitor emerging t&o episodes.
northern_blotting	the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (nasba) method of detecting noroviruses in artificially and naturally contaminated shellfish. we used 58 fecal samples that tested positive for noroviruses with electron microscopy (em) to develop an nasba assay for these viruses. oligonucleotide primers targeting the polymerase coding region were used to amplify the viral rna in an isothermal process that resulted in the accumulation of rna amplicons. these amplicons were detected by hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes that were highly specific for genogroup i (gi) and genogroup ii (gii) of noroviruses. the expected band of 327 bp appeared in denaturing agarose gel without any nonspecific band. the specific signal for each amplicon was obtained through northern blotting in many repeats. all fecal samples of which 46 (79.3%) belonged to gii and 12 (20.6%) belonged to gi were positive for noroviruses by em and by nasba. target rna concentrations as low as 5 pg/ml were detected in fecal specimens using nasba. when the assay was applied to artificially contaminated shellfish, the sensitivity to nucleic acid was 100 pg/1.5 g shellfish tissue. the potential use of this assay was also confirmed in naturally contaminated shellfish collected from different ponds in guangzhou city of china, of which 24 (18.76%) out of 128 samples were positive for noroviruses; of these, 19 (79.6 %) belonged to gii and 5 (20.4%) belonged to gi. the nasba assay provided a more rapid and efficient way of detecting noroviruses in fecal samples and demonstrated its potential for detecting noroviruses in food and environmental samples with high specificity and sensitivity.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose keratoconus (kc) is thinning of the central cornea. its etiology is unknown, but it may result from degrading of collagen type iv. the major protein in the cornea is collagen. matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) is able to degrade collagen type iv from the basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ecm). mmp-9 enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1). in the present study, we sought to investigate and evaluate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms in col4a3, mmp-9, and timp-1 on the risk of kc in an iranian population sample. methods this case-control study was performed on 140 kc patients and 150 healthy controls. genotyping of the col4a3 rs55703767, mmp-9 rs17576, and timp-1 rs6609533 polymorphisms was done using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (arms-pcr). result our findings showed that the rs55703767g/t polymorphism decreased the risk of kc (or = 0.26, 95% ci = 0.08-0.82, p = 0.022). rs17576a/g, associated with kc and the a allele, was significantly overrepresented in healthy individuals. rs6609533a/g (x-chromosome) increased the risk of kc in females (or = 2.27, 95% ci = 1.06-4.76, p = 0.036). in males, the allele frequency was not associated with kc risk/protection. conclusions this study indicates that in our population, the col4a3 rs55703767 polymorphism decreased the risk of kc. however, the timp-1 rs6609533 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of kc.
genetics	mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (lrrk2) gene are the most common genetic cause of parkinson 's disease. here, we investigated whether the g2019s lrrk2 mutation causes morphological and/or functional changes at nigro-striatal dopamine neurons. density of striatal dopaminergic terminals, nigral cell counts, tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels as well as exocytotic dopamine release measured in striatal synaptosomes, or striatal extracellular dopamine levels monitored by in vivo microdialysis were similar between >= 12-month-old g2019s knock-in mice and wild-type controls. in vivo striatal dopamine release was insensitive to the lrrk2 inhibitor nov-lrrk2-11, and was elevated by the membrane dopamine transporter blocker gbr-12783. however, g2019s knock-in mice showed a blunted neurochemical and motor activation response to gbr-12783 compared to wildtype controls. western blot and dopamine uptake analysis revealed an increase in dopamine transporter levels and activity in the striatum of 12-month-old g2019s ki mice. this phenotype correlated with a reduction in vesicular monoamine transporter 2 levels and an enhancement of vesicular dopamine uptake, which was consistent with greater resistance to reserpine-induced hypolocomotion. these changes were not observed in 3-month-old mice. finally, western blot analysis revealed no genotype difference in striatal levels of endogenous alpha-synuclein or alpha-synuclein bound to dopal (a toxic metabolite of dopamine). however, serine129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein levels were higher in 12-month-old g2019s knock-in mice. immunohistochemistry confirmed this finding, also showing no genotype difference in 3-month-old mice. we conclude that the g2019s mutation causes progressive dysfunctions of dopamine transporters, along with serine129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein overload, at striatal dopaminergic terminals, which are not associated with dopamine homeostasis dysregulation or neuron loss but might contribute to intrinsic dopaminergic terminal vulnerability. we propose g2019s knock-in mice as a presymptomatic parkinson 's disease model, useful to investigate the pathogenic interaction among genetics, aging, and internal or environmental factors leading to the disease.
genetics	background: the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213, a susceptibility variant for moyamoya disease (mmd), may be associated with non-mmd intracranial artery steno-occlusive disease of non-mmd type (nonmmd icad) in asian. we investigated whether the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 affect the development of non-mmd icad in koreans compared to mmd and control group. methods: we included 31 patients with non-mmd icad, 25 patients with mmd, and 100 participants as control group. the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of target and detection by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. clinical phenotype was compared between patients with and without the rs112735431 polymorphism in non-mmd icad and mmd. results: the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 was significantly associated with non-mmd icad (p = 0.001; odds ratio, 143; 95% confidence interval, 2.80-73.2) and mmd (p < 0.0001; odds ratio, 126.0; 95% confidence interval, 24.2-656.0). the rate of hypertension was more frequent in mmd with the rs112735431 polymorphism than mmd without polymorphism (p = 0.010). conclusions: the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 is highly associated not only with mmd but also with non-mmd icad in koreans. also, our study suggests that the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 may be linked to the hypertension in mmd. further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the rs112735431 polymorphism of the rnf213 and hypertension in patients with mmd.

northern_blotting	full length cdnas of cucumber mosaic virus (cmv) cb7 strain, causing necrosis on nicotiana glutinosa, were obtained by rt-pcr, using viral genomic rnas as templates. cdnas of cnw-cb7 genomic rnas were cloned and sequenced and results indicated that rnai, 2 and 3 was 3 356 nt, 3 045 nt and 2 218 nt, respectively (accordingly accession number ef216866, dq785470 and ef216867). infectious rna transcripts from cdna clones of cmv-cb7 were inoculated onto n. glutinosa and the seedlings of host plants displayed necrosis symptom, whist that of cmv-fny induced typical mosaic symptoms. through pseudorecombination between cmv-cb7 and cnw-fny genomic rnas, the genetic determinant of necrosis phenotype was mapped to rna2. chimeric infectious clones consisting of partial sequences of rna2 derived from cnw-cb7 and cnw-fny, respectively, were obtained by overlapping pcr. pathogenic analysis with those chimeric rna2 revealed that 2b gene or 3' utr of cmv-cb7 rna2 was responsible for the necrotic pathotype. northern blotting analysis reflected that both necrotic and non-necrotic viruses accumulated to similar levels of genomic rnas in host plants. therefore, necrotic phenotype induced on n. glutinosa was not related to the level of accumulation of cmv genomic rnas.
genetics	background: understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to high altitude life is of paramount importance for preserving and managing genetic diversity in highland animals. this objective has been addressed mainly in terrestrial fauna but rarely in aquatic animals. tibetan schizothoracinae fish is the ideal model system in evolutionary biology, carrying key insights into evolutionary genetics of speciation and adaptation at high altitude. gymnocypris przewalskii is the newly formed schizothoracinae fish species in the tibetan plateau, inhabits chronic cold, extreme saline and alkaline aquatic environment in lake qinghai, thus evolving the unique genomic signatures to adapt extremely severe environments. results: to characterize its genomic features, we assembled de novo transcriptome of g. przewalskii from lake qinghai. intriguingly, by comparative genomic analyses of g. przewalskii and 8 other fish species, we identified potential expansions in gene families related to energy metabolism, transport and developmental functions, possibly underlying the adaptation to these environmental stresses. through comprehensive molecular evolution analyses, we found that sets of genes controlling mitochondrion, ion homoeostasis, acid-base balance and innate immunity show significant signals of positive selection. compared to previous studies on highland fishes, we failed to identify any positively selected genes related to hypoxia response. conclusions: our findings provide comprehensive insights into the genetic basis of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme high altitude aquatic life on the tibetan plateau.
immunology	allogenic lymphocyte immunotherapy (lit) as a treatment for unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (ursa) is still controversial due to the lack of enough controls to evaluate its effectiveness. eighteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials with lit for ursa were included in the meta-analysis. live birth rates for each group were extracted, and the overall odds ratio (or) for lit was calculated. the success rate of treatment group was significantly higher (or 3.74, 95% ci 3.07 similar to 4.57). lit performed before and during pregnancy had dramatically improved the live birth rate in women with ursa (or 4.67, 95% ci 3.70 similar to 5.90). the overall or was 5.25 (95% ci 4.16 similar to 6.64), which supports a low dose of lymphocytes for treating ursa. our results indicate that lit provides a significantly beneficial effect over placebo for ursa. lit given before and during pregnancy is superior to lit given only before pregnancy, and the lower doses per treatment (less than 100 x 10(6) lymphocytes or 100 ml peripheral blood) achieved a better outcome.
polymerase_chain_reaction	exosomes secreted from the cell to the extracellular environment play an important role in intercellular communication. next-generation sequencing technology, which has achieved great development recently, allows us to detect more complete data and gain even deeper analyses of rna transcriptomes. in our research, we extracted exosomes from different gastric cancer cell lines and immortalized normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line and examined the amounts of exosomal proteins and rnas. our data showed that the secreted amount of cancer cell-derived exosomes, which contain proteins and rnas, was much higher than that of normal cell-derived exosomes. moreover, next-generation sequencing technology confirmed the presence of small non-coding rnas in exosomes. based on publicly available databases, we classified small non-coding rnas. according to the microrna profiles of exosomes, hsa-mir-21-5p and hsa-mir-30a-5p were two of the most abundant sequences among all libraries. the expression levels of the two micrornas, mir-100 and mir-148a, in exosomes were validated through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction result, consistent with the trend of sequencing result, indicated a significant difference in exosomes between gastric cancer and gastric mucosal epithelial cell lines. we also predicted novel microrna candidates but they need to be validated. this research provided an atlas of small noncoding rna in exosomes and may make a little contribution to the understanding of exosomal rna composition and finding parts of differential expression of rnas in exosomes.
northern_blotting	previous studies in our laboratory have shown that one of the earliest events during hepatocarcinogenesis in the albumin sv40 t antigen (alb sv40 t ag) transgenic rat is the duplication of chromosome 1q3.7-4.3, a region which contains the imprinted and coordinately regulated genes lgf2 and h19. we have also shown that this duplication is associated with the biallelic expression of the normally monoallelically-expressed h19. these results, however, are seemingly at odds with studies in the mouse that have shown a conservation of fetal regulatory patterns of these two genes in hepatic neoplasms. we therefore aimed in this study to determine the allelic origin of lgf2 expression in hepatocellular carcinomas of the ab sv40 t ag transgenic rat. sprague-dawley alb sv40 t ag transgenic rats and brown norway rats were reciprocally mated and the expression of lgf2 in hepatocellular carcinomas of the resulting f, transgene-positive female rats was analyzed by northern blotting and rt-pcr. we determined that lgf2 was expressed exclusively from the paternal allele, which prompted the study (by the same methods) of the allelic origin of h19 in the same hepatocellular carcinomas in order to determine if the two genes remained coordinately regulated. our results demonstrate fetal-like re-expression of lgf2 and deregulation of h19 in singular hepatocellular carcinomas of the rat. these results imply that another regulatory mechanism other than the generally accepted icr/ctcf mechanism may play a role in the control of lgf2 and h19 expression.

enzymology	biocatalysis currently is focusing on enzymatic and multi-enzymatic cascade processes instead of single steps imbedded into chemical pathways. alongside this scientific revolution, this review provides an overview on multi-enzymatic cascades that are responsible for the biosynthesis of some terpenes, alkaloids and polyethers, which are important classes of natural products. herein, we illustrate the development of studies inspired by multi- and chemo-enzymatic approaches to build the core moieties of polyethers, polypeptide alkaloids, piperidines and pyrrolidines promoted by the joint action of oxidoreductases, hydrolases, cyclases, transaminases and imine reductases.

southern_blotting	few naturally-occurring plasmids are maintained in mammalian cells. among these are genomes of gamma-herpesviruses, including epstein-barr virus (ebv) and kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), which cause multiple human malignancies(1-3). these two genomes are replicated in a licensed manner, each using a single viral protein and cellular replication machinery, and are passed to daughter cells during cell division despite their lacking traditional centromeres(4-8). much work has been done to characterize the replications of these plasmid genomes using methods such as southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). these methods are limited, though. quantitative pcr and southern blots provide information about the average number of plasmids per cell in a population of cells. fish is a single-cell assay that reveals both the average number and the distribution of plasmids per cell in the population of cells but is static, allowing no information about the parent or progeny of the examined cell. here, we describe a method for visualizing plasmids in live cells. this method is based on the binding of a fluorescently tagged lactose repressor protein to multiple sites in the plasmid of interest(9). the dna of interest is engineered to include approximately 250 tandem repeats of the lactose operator (laco) sequence. laco is specifically bound by the lactose repressor protein (laci), which can be fused to a fluorescent protein. the fusion protein can either be expressed from the engineered plasmid or introduced by a retroviral vector. in this way, the dna molecules are fluorescently tagged and therefore become visible via fluorescence microscopy. the fusion protein is blocked from binding the plasmid dna by culturing cells in the presence of iptg until the plasmids are ready to be viewed. this system allows the plasmids to be monitored in living cells through several generations, revealing properties of their synthesis and partitioning to daughter cells. ideal cells are adherent, easily transfected, and have large nuclei. this technique has been used to determine that 84% of ebv-derived plasmids are synthesized each generation and 88% of the newly synthesized plasmids partition faithfully to daughter cells in hela cells. pairs of these ebv plasmids were seen to be tethered to or associated with sister chromatids after their synthesis in s-phase until they were seen to separate as the sister chromatids separated in anaphase(10). the method is currently being used to study replication of kshv genomes in hela cells and slk cells. hela cells are immortalized human epithelial cells, and slk cells are immortalized human endothelial cells. though slk cells were originally derived from a kshv lesion, neither the hela nor slk cell line naturally harbors kshv genomes(11). in addition to studying viral replication, this visualization technique can be used to investigate the effects of the addition, removal, or mutation of various dna sequence elements on synthesis, localization, and partitioning of other recombinant plasmid dnas.
immunology	prostate cancer (pca) has become the second leading cause of male cancer-related mortality in the united states. mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) are able to migrate to tumor tissues, and are thus considered to be novel antitumor carriers. however, due to their immunosuppressive nature, the application of mscs in pca therapy remains limited. in this study, we investigated the effect of mscs overexpressing an nad-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (mscs-sirt1) on prostate tumor growth, and we analyzed the underlying mechanisms. our results show that mscs accelerate prostate tumor growth, whereas mscs-sirt1 significantly suppresses tumor growth. natural killer (nk) cells and macrophages are the prominent antitumor effectors of the mscs-sirt1-induced antitumor activity. ifn-gamma and c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10 (cxcl10) are highly expressed in mscs-sirt1 mice. the antitumor effect of mscs-sirt1 is weakened when cxcl10 and ifn-gamma are inhibited. these results show that mscs-sirt1 can effectively inhibit prostate cancer growth recruiting nk cells and macrophages in a tumor inflammatory microenvironment.
polymerase_chain_reaction	circular rnas are a special class of endogenous rnas characterized by jointing 3' and 5' ends together via exon or intron circularization. recent studies found that circular rnas are involved in the development of some human diseases. however, little is known about their roles in human gastric cancer. in this study, we chose hsa_circ_0001895 as a targeted circrna to investigate its clinical significances in gastric cancer patients. hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels in five gastric cancer cell lines and 257 specimens of tissues were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. then, the potential relationship between hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels and patients' clinicopathological factors was investigated. a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed for evaluating the diagnostic value of hsa_circ_0001895. hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels in five detected gastric cancer cell lines (ags, bgc-823, hgc-27, mgc-803, and sgc-7901) were all significantly downregulated than those in normal gastric epithelial ges-1 cells. besides, compared with healthy control tissues, it was downregulated not only in 69.8% (67/96) gastric cancer tissues but also in gastric precancerous lesions. moreover, hsa_circ_0001895 expression levels were significantly correlated with cell differentiation, borrmann type, and tissue carcino-embryonic antigen expression. our results suggested that hsa_circ_0001895 may play crucial roles during gastric cancerogenesis and is a potential biomarker for clinical prognosis prediction.
southern_blotting	intracellular delivery of a functional gene or a nucleic acid sequence to specifically knockdown a harmful gene is a potential approach to precisely treat a critical human disease. the intensive efforts in the last few decades led to the development of a number of viral and non-viral synthetic vectors. however, an ideal delivery tool in terms of the safety and efficacy has yet to be established. recently, we have developed ph-sensing inorganic nanocrystals of carbonate apatite for efficient and cell-targeted delivery of gene and gene-silencing rna. here we show that addition of very low level of fluoride to the particle-forming medium facilitates a robust increase in transgene expression following post-incubation of the particles with hela cells. confocal microscopic observation and southern blotting prove the cytoplasmic existence of plasmid dna delivered by likely formed fluoridated carbonate apatite particles while degradation of plasmid dna presumably by cytoplasmic nucleases was noticed following delivery with apatite particles alone. the beneficial role of fluoride in enhancing carbonate apatite-mediated gene expression might be due to the buffering potential of generated fluoridated apatite in endosomal acidic environment, thereby increasing the half-life of delivered plasmid dna.

enzymology	some cancers have been shown to have a higher temperature than surrounding normal tissue. this higher temperature is due to heat generated internally in the cancer. the higher temperature of cancer (compared to surrounding tissue) enables a thermodynamic analysis to be carried out. here i show that there is increased entropy production in cancer compared with surrounding tissue. this is termed excess entropy production. the excess entropy production is expressed in terms of heat flow from the cancer to surrounding tissue and enzymic reactions in the cancer and surrounding tissue. the excess entropy production in cancer drives it away from the stationary state that is characterised by minimum entropy production. treatments that reduce inflammation (and therefore temperature) should drive a cancer towards the stationary state. anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and also thyroxine analogues have been shown (using various criteria) to reduce the progress of cancer.
cell_biology	recent studies have established resident memory t cells (t-rm) as the dominant memory lymphocyte population surveying most nonlymphoid tissues. unlike other memory t cell lineages, t-rm do not recirculate through blood and are permanently confined to their tissue of residence. t-rm orchestrate local immune responses and have been shown to accelerate local pathogen control in many experimental infection models. here we briefly summarize recent advances in t-rm differentiation, maintenance, and their protective function. while little is known, we have speculated on the potential implications of t-rm for transplantation biology. areas of emphasis include the role of passenger t-rm in controlling latent viral recrudescence in donor organs, donor t-rm as a source of graft-versus-host disease, the ability of t-rm to potently induce inflammation through sensing and alarm functions, and differentiation of host t cells into t-rm in response to local cues inside the allograft. further investigation of t-rm in the context of transplantation might identify therapeutic targets to prolong graft survival. this review discusses the phenotype, function, and potential relevance for transplantation of resident memory t cells.
enzymology	c-14-labeled nicotinamide cofactors are widely employed in biomedical investigations: for example, to delineate c-14-labeled nicotinamide cofactors are widely employed in biomedical investigations, for example, to delineate metabolic pathways, to elucidate enzymatic mechanisms, and as substrates in kinetic isotope effect (kie) experiments. the c-14 label has generally been located remote from the reactive position, frequently at the adenine ring. rising costs of commercial precursors and disruptions in the availability of enzymes required for established syntheses have recently made the preparation of labeled nicotinamides such as [ad-c-14]nadph unviable. here, we report the syntheses and characterization of several alternatives: [carbonyl-c-14]nadph, 4r-[carbonyl-c-14, 4-h-2]nadph, and [carbonyl-c-14, 4-h-2(2)]nadph. the new procedures use [carbonyl-c-14]nicotinamide as starting material, because it is significantly cheaper than other commercial c-14 precursors of nadph, and require only one commercially available enzyme to prepare nad(p)(+) and nad(p)h. the proximity of carbonyl-c-14 to the reactive center raises the risk of an inopportune c-14 isotope effect. this concern has been alleviated via competitive kie measurements with escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecdhfr) that use this specific carbonyl-c-14 nadph. a combination of binding isotope effect and kie measurements yielded no significant c-12/c-14 isotope effect at the amide carbonyl (kie = 1.003 +/- 0.004). the reported procedure provides a high-yield, high-purity, and cost-effective alternative to labeled nicotinamide cofactors synthesized by previously published routes.

enzymology	ghrelin-o-acyltransferase (goat) is an 11-transmembrane integral membrane protein that octanoylates the metabolism-regulating peptide hormone ghrelin at ser3 and may represent an attractive target for the treatment of type ii diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. protein octanoylation is unique to ghrelin in humans, and little is known about the mechanism of goat or of related protein-o-acyltransferases hhat or porc. in this study, we explored an in vitro microsomal ghrelin octanoylation assay to analyze its enzymologic features. measurement of k-m for 10-mer, 27-mer, and synthetic tat-peptide-containing ghrelin substrates provided evidence for a role of charge interactions in substrate binding. ghrelin substrates with amino-alanine in place of ser3 demonstrated that goat can catalyze the formation of an octanoyl-amide bond at a similar rate compared with the natural reaction. a ph-rate comparison of these substrates revealed minimal differences in acyltransferase activity across ph 6.0-9.0, providing evidence that these reactions may be relatively insensitive to the basicity of the substrate nucleophile. the conserved his338 residue was required both for ser3 and amino-ala3 ghrelin substrates, suggesting that his338 may have a key catalytic role beyond that of a general base.

human_metabolism	background: numerous diseases have been related with free radicals overproduction and oxidative stress. botanical preparations possess a multitude of bioactive properties, including antioxidant potential, which has been mainly related with the presence of phenolic compounds. however, the mechanisms of action of these phytochemicals, in vivo effects, bioavailability and bio-efficacy still need research. scope and approach: the present report aims to provide a critical review on the aspects related with the in vivo antioxidant activity of phenolic extracts and compounds from plant origin. key findings: biological functions beyond the human metabolism were discussed, comparing in vivo vs. in vitro studies, as also focusing the conditioning factors for phenolic compounds bioavailability and bioefficacy. furthermore, an upcoming perspective about the use of phytochemicals as life expectancy promoters and anti-aging factors in human individuals was provided. conclusions: overall, and despite all of those advances, the study of the biological potential of numerous natural matrices still remains a hot topic among the scientific community. in fact, the available knowledge about the responsible phytochemicals for the biological potential, their mechanisms of action, the establishment of therapeutic and prophylactic doses, and even the occurrence of biochemical interrelations, is considerable scarce.

northern_blotting	several studies have reported previously that acute myeloid leukemia (aml) may express wt1 detected by rt-pcr and/or northern blotting. the diagnostic utility of wt1 expression in aml using immunohistochemistry has not been reported previously. paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 55 aml, 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), and 10 normal bone marrow specimens were immunostained for wt1 (anti-n terminus antibody). 22/55 aml cases (40%) demonstrated nuclear immunopositivity for wt1, including 20/47 bone marrow trephines and 2/4 granulocytic sarcomas. all the all and normal bone marrow specimens were negative. a significant proportion of aml expresses nuclear immunostaining for wt1, a finding that has only been described previously in wilms' tumor and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. this finding is important for the correct interpretation of immunohistochemical findings in the diagnosis of ""small round cell'' tumors of childhood, especially in cases of extramedullary deposits of aml, in which traditional myeloid markers may be negative.
cell_biology	aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the self-assembling peptide nanofibre scaffolds (sapns) on the growth, proliferation and retinal neuronal differentiation of the stem/progenitor cells (scs) derived from the ciliary pigment epithelium (cpe) of human cadaveric eye. here sapns (rada16-i, pm), which is well described in previous studies, commercially available and xeno-free. the cpe cells isolated were cultured in dmem/f12 supplemented with n2 and growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor, encapsulated in the scaffolds. the entrapped scs actively expanded and formed clone-like clusters in the scaffolds. many cells in the cluster were proliferating, as revealed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine uptake and could be maintained for up to 6 days and expressed neural progenitor markers such as beta-iii tubulin, nestin, pax6 and musashi1. upon differentiation of these cells in conditioned medium, the cells exhibited retinal neuronal markers such as s-opsin, rhodopsin and recoverin. the rt2 profiler polymerase chain reaction array experiments showed selective gene expression, possibly involved in neural stem/progenitor cell adhesion and differentiation. these findings suggest the suitability of the three-dimensional culture system for the proliferation and maintenance of cpe stem/progenitor cells (cpe-ns) and for possible use in ex vivo studies of small molecules, drug deliveries for retinal diseases and for use in combination with directed stem/progenitor cell differentiation. and ultimately for tissue replacement therapies. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
human_metabolism	lipoprotein(a), a variant of ldl carrying the adhesive glycoprotein apo(a), is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. lipoprotein(a) (lp(a)) is found in humans and subhuman primates but rarely in lower mammals. better understanding of the evolutionary advantage of this molecule should elucidate its physiological role. we developed a new mouse model with two characteristics of human metabolism: the expression of lp(a) and the lack of endogenous ascorbate (vitamin c) production. we show that dietary deficiency of ascorbate increases serum levels of lp(a). moreover, chronic hypoascorbemia and complete depletion of ascorbate (scurvy) leads to lp(a) accumulation in the vascular wall and parallels atherosclerotic lesion development. the results suggest that dietary ascorbate deficiency is a risk factor for atherosclerosis independent of dietary lipids. we provide support for the concept that lp(a) functions as a mobile repair molecule compensating for the structural impairment of the vascular wall, a morphological hallmark of hypoascorbemia and scurvy.
immunology	the commonality of antibiotic usage in medicine means that understanding the resulting consequences to the host is vital. antibiotics often decrease host microbiome community diversity and alter the microbial community composition. many diseases such as antibiotic-associated enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders have been linked to a disrupted microbiota. the complex interplay between host, microbiome, and antibiotics needs a tractable model for studying host-microbiome interactions. our freshwater vertebrate fish serves as a useful model for investigating the universal aspects of mucosal microbiome structure and function as well as analyzing consequential host effects from altering the microbial community. methods include host challenges such as infection by a known fish pathogen, exposure to fecal or soil microbes, osmotic stress, nitrate toxicity, growth analysis, and measurement of gut motility. these techniques demonstrate a flexible and useful model system for rapid determination of host phenotypes.
immunology	hyperglycemia is the most prominent sign that characterizes diabetes. hyperglycemia favors malignant cell growth by providing energy to cancer cells. clinical studies also showed an increased risk of diabetes being associated with different types of cancers. in addition, poorly regulated glucose metabolism in diabetic patients is often found with increased levels of chronic inflammatory markers, e.g., interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and emerging evidence has highlighted activation of the immune response in the progression and development of cancer cells. therefore, uncontrolled proinflammatory responses could conceivably create a chronic inflammatory state, promoting a tumor-favorable microenvironment and potentially triggering immune overactivation and cancer growth. to further understand how hyperglycemia contributes to immune overactivation, the tumor microenvironment and the development of chronic inflammation-associated tumors may provide insights into tumor biology and immunology. this paper provides a brief introduction to hyperglycemia-associated diseases, followed by a comprehensive overview of the current findings of regulatory molecular mechanisms of glycosylation on proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix under hyperglycemic conditions. then, the authors discuss the role of hyperglycemia in tumorigenesis (particularly in prostate, liver, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers), as well as the contribution of hyperglycemia to chronic inflammation. the authors end with a brief discussion on the future perspectives of hyperglycemia/tumorigenesis and potential applications of alternative effective therapeutic strategies for hyperglycemia-associated cancers.

enzymology	a simple immobilization method for candida rugosa lipase on superparamagnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles is described. the fe3o4 nanoparticles were coated with pei and candida rugosa lipase was adsorbed on these particles via electrostatic interactions. the immobilization resulted in marginal simultaneous purification. however, the immobilized preparation showed 110x higher transesterification activity in low-water media. it was also efficient in kinetic resolution of (+/-)-1-phenylethanol with ee(p) of 99 % and e=412 within 24 h.
cell_biology	background: recent advances in our basic knowledge of the tissue damage and regeneration pathology have combined with a remarkable progress in stem cell biology so the prospect of clinical tissue repair strategies is a tangible reality. we tried to describe a better view about mesenchymal stem cell (msc) mechanisms in wound healing and tissue regeneration, sending any ideas for next advanced therapies. content: sustaining injury, whether minor or major, is part of every organism life. therefore, efficient response mechanisms to damage have developed. wound healing is a perplexing multi-step processes which can be divided into three major phases: inflammation, proliferation, and scar formation/remodeling. though the compartementalization of this process into discrete stages give the illusion of simplicity, but in reality it is much more complicated. so that efficient healing can occur, complex interactions between multiple cell types, soluble factors and extracellular matrix components are required to rebuild the tissue. even under optimal conditions, the healing process drives to fibrosis or scar. the latest technology that makes a huge difference in the wound healing process is stem cell therapy, which offers a novel approach to many diseases. summary: wound healing therapies continue to rapidly evolve, with advances in basic science and engineering research heralding the development of new therapies, as well as ways to modify existing treatments. stem cell-based therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic concepts for wound healing. advances in stem cell biology have enabled researchers and clinicians alike with access to cells capable of actively modulating the healing response.
cell_biology	estuarine and marine ecosystems are subject to different sources of stress including changes in environmental physicochemical variables (nutrients, oxygen availability, temperature, salinity, ph) or exposure to a large cocktail of environmental pollutants. in the estuary of bilbao, despite the improvement in environmental quality due to replacement of most polluting industries and the progressive implementation of an integrated sewage treatment plan, chronic pollution by metals and hydrocarbons still remains, together with eutrophication and pollution by emerging contaminants. the unit of formation and research ""protection of ecosystem health"" was created in 2012 through the strategic aggregation of three consolidated research groups: cell biology in environmental toxicology (cbet), phytoplankton of estuaries and coastal areas (fiteac) and research on marine and estuarine pelagic environment and planktonic communities (maresplank). the three groups have a long tradition in studying the health of marine and estuarine ecosystems from different perspectives, focusing in the bay of biscay and especially in the estuary of bilbao. in this work we review data on the health status of the bilbao estuary using early warning tools at the cell and tissue levels, phytoplankton assemblages and zooplankton ecology. in spite of the seasonal and interannual variability recorded for some parameters, a general recovery trend was observed for the health status in the estuary of bilbao, with sporadic critical events such as the prestige oil spill.

molecular_biology	soybean oil is an important carbon source in kitasamycin fermentation by streptomyces kitasatoensis. in this study, three different surfactants, tween 80, tween 85, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds), were added in the fermentation medium to improve soybean oil utilization. results indicated that all of these surfactants promote kitasamycin biosynthesis. when 0.5 g/l sds was added at the beginning of fermentation, kitasamycin production increased by 55% and a(5) content improved by 12%, compared with the control treatment (i.e., no surfactant added). oil consumption rate and lipase activity were also improved in the presence of sds, producing more organic acids benefiting kitasamycin biosynthesis. high butyric acid concentration in the fermentation medium containing sds repressed c-3 acetylation and promoted a(5) component accumulation. additionally, utilization of oil components by s. kitasatoensis was altered. specifically, linoleic acid was primarily used in the fermentation process with sds, whereas oleic acid was primarily used in the fermentation process where no surfactant had been added.

molecular_biology	serrated polyps have long been thought to lack malignant potential in the human colorectum. however, identification of the serrated pathway to colorectal cancer based on molecular biology has improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers. accordingly, serrated polyps such as traditional serrated adenoma and sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (ssa/p) are now considered to be precursor lesions of the serrated pathway. recently, serrated polyps were classified into three subtypes, consisting of hyperplastic polyp, ssa/p, and traditional serrated adenoma, according to the world health organization classification. it has been suggested that ssa/p in the proximal colon are a precursor lesion of pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and are characterized by braf mutation and a cpg island methylator phenotype with or without microsatellite instability. however, ssa/p is more challenging to detect by colonoscopy and is likely to account for some interval cancers, particularly in the proximal colon because it presents flat or sessile, isochroous appearance, and occasionally has a mucous cap. furthermore, the possibility has been raised that pathologists misclassify ssa/p as hyperplastic polyp. it is important for gastroenterologists to recognize the endoscopic features of serrated polyps to facilitate their detection and removal and also to establish postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines. in this review, we discuss the recent classification of serrated polyps; the molecular characteristics of the serrated pathway; appropriate diagnostic methods using endoscopy, including a new image-enhanced endoscopic technique; and management of these lesions.
southern_blotting	as important forage crops, gramineous forage plants can also play role in improving natural environment, maintaining water and soil erosion with turfgrass plants together. using the particle bombardment transformation system nicotianamine synthase gene was introduced into the callus of lolium perenne. twenty transgenic ryegrass lines were obtained from 105 pieces of g418-resistant calli, giving a 5.15% transformation frequency. pcr and southern blotting analysis showed that target gene was integrated into the genome of the transgenic plants. transgenic plants displayed excellent drought resistant by expression of nashor gene in the field aridity experiment. the chlorophyll content of leaves in transgenic plant was higher than that of the controls in normal condition. the further observation infield experiment and identified resistance for these transgenic plants are underway.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) in oral fluids (of) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) is gaining increasing popularity. however, the different steps leading to a result have not been extensively evaluated. the aim of the present study was to examine the effect on the performance of qrt-pcr with different sampling materials, conditions of storage of the of, the need for centrifuging of, as well as to compare rna extraction methods and pcr mixes. for the assays, pen-based oral fluids were used, which were pooled and spiked in a serial dilution (up to genotype 10(circle) tcid50/ml) of type 1 prrsv isolate 3267. centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min resulted in an increase in sensitivity (1-2 pcr cycles) that was significant (p<0.05) at the lowest dilution tested. the trizol and magmax rna extraction methods gave the maximum sensitivity, lowest threshold cycle (ct), at equivalent virus concentrations. the agpath-id one-step rt-pcr kit pcr mix reagents were more sensitive for the detection of prrsv using a purified plasmid as standard, but lsi vetmax prrsv eu/na prrsv reagents resulted in a slightly better sensitivity with of (p <0.05). the present results may be useful to standardize protocols for optimizing detection of type i prrsv in of by qrt-pcr.

enzymology	plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites to defend themselves from pathogen attack, while pathogens have evolved to overcome plant defences by producing enzymes that degrade or modify these defence compounds. however, many compounds targeted by pathogen enzymes currently remain enigmatic. identifying host compounds targeted by pathogen enzymes would enable us to understand the potential importance of such compounds in plant defence and modify them to make them insensitive to pathogen enzymes. here, a proof of concept metabolomics-based method was developed to discover plant defence compounds modified by pathogens using two pathogen enzymes with known targets in wheat and tomato. plant extracts treated with purified pathogen enzymes were subjected to lc-ms, and the relative abundance of metabolites before and after treatment were comparatively analysed. using two enzymes from different pathogens the in planta targets could be found by combining relatively simple enzymology with the power of untargeted metabolomics. key to the method is dataset simplification based on natural isotope occurrence and statistical filtering, which can be scripted. the method presented here will aid in our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions and may lead to the development of new plant protection strategies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: tick-borne haemoparasitic diseases (tbhds), caused by theileria, babesia, anaplasma and ehrlichia, are common in regions of the world where the distributions of host, pathogen and vector overlap. many of these diseases threaten livestock production and some also represent a concern to human public health. the primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the above-mentioned pathogens in a large number of blood samples (n = 1979) collected from sheep (n = 1727) and goats (n = 252) in turkey. a secondary aim was to assess the diagnostic sensitivity of a number of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests and the reverse line blotting (rlb) assay. dna samples were screened using species-specific pcr for the presence of theileria ovis, theileria sp. mk, t. lestoquardi, t. uilenbergi, t. luwenshuni, babesia ovis, anaplasma ovis and a. phagocytophilum while rlb was undertaken to test for the presence of all known theileria, babesia, anaplasma and ehrlichia species. the diagnostic sensitivity of these two approaches was then compared in terms of their ability to detect single species and mixed infections. results: overall, 84 and 74.43% of the small ruminants sampled were identified as hosting one or more pathogen(s) by species-specific pcr and rlb respectively. the presence of theileria sp. ot1, t. luwenshuni and t. uilenbergi in turkey was revealed for the first time while the presence of babesia motasi, b. crassa and t. separata in turkish small ruminants was confirmed using molecular methods. a high prevalence of mixed infection was evident, with pcr and rlb approaches indicating that 52.24 and 35.42% of animals were co-infected with multiple species, respectively. more than 80% of the mixed infections contained t. ovis and/or a. ovis. the rlb approach was found to be capable of detecting mixed infections with species such as theileria sp. ot1, theileria sp. ot3, t. separata, b. crassa and babesia spp. conclusion: the results indicated that pathogens causing tbhds are highly prevalent in sheep and goats in turkey. the diagnostic sensitivity of species-specific single pcr was generally higher than that of rlb. however, the latter approach was still capable of identifying a high proportion of individuals containing mixed-species infections. the use of species-specific single pcr is recommended to accurately estimate pathogen prevalence and to identify co-infected hosts.
molecular_biology	a total of similar to 38.6 million mortalities occur due to liver cancer annually, worldwide. although a variety of therapeutic methods are available, the efficacy of treatment at present is extremely limited due to an increased risk of malignancy and inherently poor prognosis of liver cancer. gene therapy is considered a promising option, and has shown notable potential for the comprehensive therapy of liver cancer, in keeping with advances that have been made in the development of cancer molecular biology. the present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of the abilities of the hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein of newcastle disease virus (ndv), the pro-apoptotic factor apoptin from chicken anaemia virus, and the interferon- inducer interleukin-18 (il-18) in antagonizing liver cancer. therefore, a recombinant dna plasmid expressing the three exogenous genes, vp3, il-18 and hemagglutinin neuraminidase (hn), was constructed. flow cytometry, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and analysis of caspase-3 activity were performed in h22 cell lines transfected with the recombinant dna plasmid. in addition, 6-week-old c57bl/6 mice were used to establish a h22 hepatoma-bearing mouse model. mice tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. the results of the present study revealed that the recombinant dna vaccine containing the vp3, il-18 and hn genes inhibited cell proliferation and induced autophagy via the mitochondrial pathway in vivo and in vitro.
polymerase_chain_reaction	composite lymphomas (cls) are defined as two unrelated lymphomas occurring at the same time within the same tissue. the incidence of these tumors is low. of all possible combinations between lymphomas, the least frequent are the ones combining peripheral t-cell lymphoma (ptcl) and hodgkin lymphoma (hl). we recently identified five cases of cl composed of ptcl and classical hl, mixed cellularity type. we investigated histological and clinical features of these cases. immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections. ptcl cells were positive for cd8 and tia-1 in four of the five cases. hodgkin and reed-sternberg (hrs) cells were positive for cd30 and weakly positive for pax5 in all cases, positive for cd15 in three of five cases, positive for cd20 in one of five cases, and negative for eber. monoclonal rearrangement of the t-cell receptor (tcr) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (igh) genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using whole paraffin sections. we concluded more precisely the monoclonality of the igh rearrangement of hrs cells based on single-cell pcr for igh and dna sequencing analysis after laser microdissection of single cells in one case. hl can occur in cd8-positive and tia-1-positive ptcl. clinicians should recognize the possibility of these cl.
polymerase_chain_reaction	lung cancer is the most frequent cause of mortality in cancer patients; non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) accounts for similar to 80% of lung cancer cases. micrornas (mirnas) have been revealed to perform an important role in cancer development and progression. based on a custom mirna microarray analysis of patients with nsclc, mirna-615-3p (mir-615-3p) downregulation was identified in nsclc tissues compared with normal lung tissues, which suggested that mir-615-3p acted as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer. the overexpression of mir-615-3p was then validated using 40 pairs of nsclc and adjacent normal tissue samples using a taqman reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. in order to investigate the tumor suppressor function of mir-615-3p, the ectopic expression of mir-615-3p in the nsclc a549, h1299 and h1650 cell lines was established. the results revealed that overexpressed mir-615-3p markedly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in the 3 nsclc cell lines compared with the cells overexpressing the negative control sequence (nc). additional investigation revealed that mir-615-3p overexpression significantly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase in the a549, h1299 and h1650 cell lines compared with the cells overexpressing nc. finally, ectopic expression of mir-615-3p was found to repress the cell migration and invasion of the 3 lung cancer cell lines. the results of the present study demonstrate, for the first time, that mir-615-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in nsclc, and may be a novel potential molecular therapeutic target for patients with nsclc.
enzymology	plp is well-regarded for its role as a coenzyme in a number of diverse enzymatic reactions. transamination, deoxygenation, and aldol reactions mediated by plp-dependent enzymes enliven and enrich deoxy sugar biosynthesis, endowing these compounds with unique structures and contributing to their roles as determinants of biological activity in many natural products. the importance of deoxy aminosugars in natural product biosynthesis has spurred several recent structural investigations of sugar aminotransferases. the structure of a pmp-dependent enzyme catalyzing the c-3 deoxygenation reaction in the biosynthesis of ascarylose was also determined. these studies, and the crystal structures they have provided, offer a wealth of new insights regarding the enzymology of plp/pmp-dependent enzymes in deoxy sugar biosynthesis. in this review, we consider these recent achievements in the structural biology of deoxy sugar biosynthetic enzymes and the important implications they hold for understanding enzyme catalysis and natural product biosynthesis in general. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

genetics	background: a steadily increasing pattern of breast cancer mortality has been reported in south korea since the late 1980s. this paper explored the trends of educational inequalities of female breast cancer mortality between 1983 and 2012 in korea, and conducted age-period-cohort (apc) analysis by educational level. methods: age-standardized mortality rates of breast cancer per 100,000 person-years were calculated. relative index of inequality (rii) for breast cancer mortality was used as an inequality measure. apc analyses were conducted using the web tool for apc analysis provided by the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the u.s. national cancer institute. results: an increasing trend in breast cancer mortality among korean women between 1983 and 2012 was due to the increased mortality of the lower education groups (i.e., no formal education or primary education and secondary education groups), not the highest education group. the breast cancer mortality was higher in women with a tertiary education than in women with no education or a primary education during 1983-1992, and the reverse was true in 1993-2012. consequently, rii was changed from positive to negative associations in the early 2000s. the lower education groups had the increased breast cancer mortality and significant cohort and period effects between 1983 and 2012, whereas the highest group did not. conclusions: apc analysis by socioeconomic position used in this study could provide an important clue for the causes on breast cancer mortality. the long-term monitoring of socioeconomic patterning in breast cancer risk factors is urgently needed.
northern_blotting	a full-length cdna of an immunogenic protein was cloned from a cdna library of the local egyptian cattle tick boophilus annulatus. antibodies raised against b. annulatus larval proteins were used to screen a cdna expression library. a 936 bp cloned fragment was sequenced and showed an open reading frame of 516 bp encoding a protein of 171 amino acids. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with protein data bank revealed that the sequence is related to a sequence isolated from the hard tick haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (hq05). southern blot analysis of b. annulatus genomic dna showed that the cloned cdna hybridized to double bands per restriction digest, suggesting that the cloned cdna is a double copy gene. amino acid analysis of the cloned gene revealed the presence of two casein kinase 11 phosphorylation sites in the n-terminal domain suggesting that this molecule may be involved in the signal transduction or gene expression pathways. rt-pcr and northern blotting revealed the presence of two isoforms of the ba05 gene in salivary glands and in the 3-day-old eggs. the cloned gene without the signal peptide, was expressed in escherichia coli under t7 promotor of pet-30b vector, and purified under denaturation conditions. the purified protein appeared as a single band on 12% sds-page with a molecular weight around 22.8 kda including the histidine tag of the vector. antibodies raised against the purified molecule were used to detect the b. annulatus homologue to the hq05 gene in whole tick, larvae and gut protein extracts. immunoblotting revealed the presence of this molecule ba05 only in whole tick and larval protein extracts and not in the gut protein extract. using the same antibodies, homologues to the ba05 gene were detected in other tick species as hyalomma dromedarii and rhipicephalus sp. but not in ornithodoros moubata.

molecular_biology	background: pim-3 kinase is a highly homologous serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. few studies have been conducted to define the role of pim-3 in solid tumors, especially in prostate cancer. the aim of this study was to define the role of pim-3 in development and prognosis of prostate cancer. material/methods: we collected specimens from 160 patients with prostate cancer, as well as 100 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. realtime polymerase chain reaction was used for the assessment of pim-3 expression at the rna level and western blot was used to quantify the pim-3 protein synthesis in 3 different cell lines. results: we found that pim-3 mrna expression in prostate cancer tissue was significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (p<0.05). accordingly, the protein level expression of pim-3 in prostate cancer cell lines was also significantly higher than that in control cells. in addition, the expression status of pim-3 mrna was significantly associated with pathological parameters such as pre-surgery prostate specific antigen, gleason score, pathological stage, and lymphoid metastasis. high expression of pim-3 also significantly decreased the survival rate of patients after surgery. conclusions: pim-3 expression is an important risk factor for prostate cancer; we are the first team to report pim-3 as a valuable biomarker in chinese.
human_metabolism	in this study, it was found that the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of musa basjoo flowers was a rich source of antioxidant, due to its high total phenolic contents and significant antioxidant activity. ten phenolic compounds were isolated from this plant. they are gallic acid (1), caffeic acid methyl ester (2), guaiacylglycerol (3), 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-acrylic acid 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methoxy carbonyl ethyl ester (4), thero-guaiacylglycerol 8-o-beta-d-glycopyranoside (5), quercitrin (6), buein (7), (2r, 3s)-5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanonol (8), isoquercitrin (9) and 1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-hepta-4e, 6e-dien-3-one (10). in addition, compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 possessed potent strong free radical scavenging activity. compounds 1 and 10 with powerful activity showed the higher content, implying important roles of 1 and 10 for the antioxidant activity of musa basjoo flower. the study suggested that components of musa basjoo flower possessed good antioxidant capacities and the species could be used in the prevention of diseases related to oxidant by-products of human metabolism.
immunology	background: the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology (eaaci) is in the process of developing the eaaci guidelines on allergen immunotherapy (ait) for the management of insect venom allergy. to inform this process, we sought to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of ait in the management of insect venom allergy. methods: we undertook a systematic review, which involved searching 15 international biomedical databases for published and unpublished evidence. studies were independently screened and critically appraised using established instruments. data were descriptively summarized and, where possible, meta-analysed. results: our searches identified a total of 16 950 potentially eligible studies; of which, 17 satisfied our inclusion criteria. the available evidence was limited both in volume and in quality, but suggested that venom immunotherapy (vit) could substantially reduce the risk of subsequent severe systemic sting reactions (or = 0.08, 95% ci 0.03-0.26); meta-analysis showed that it also improved disease-specific quality of life (risk difference = 1.41, 95% ci 1.04-1.79). adverse effects were experienced in both the build-up and maintenance phases, but most were mild with no fatalities being reported. the very limited evidence found on modelling cost-effectiveness suggested that vit was likely to be cost-effective in those at high risk of repeated systemic sting reactions and/or impaired quality of life. conclusions: the limited available evidence suggested that vit is effective in reducing severe subsequent systemic sting reactions and in improving disease-specific quality of life. vit proved to be safe and no fatalities were recorded in the studies included in this review. the cost-effectiveness of vit needs to be established.
cell_biology	caveolin-2 (cav2) is a major protein component of caveolae in membranes of vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, yet its absence alters the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibers. to gain insight into cav2 function in skeletal muscle, we tested the hypothesis that genetic deletion of cav2 would alter microvascular reactivity and depress contractile function of skeletal muscle in vivo. in the left gluteus maximus muscle (gm) of anesthetized cav2(-/-) and wild-type (wt) male mice (age, 6 mo), microvascular responses to physiological agonists and to gm contractions were studied at 34 degrees c. for feed arteries (fa), first- (1a), second( 2a) and third-order (3a) arterioles, respective mean diameters at rest (45, 35, 25, 12 mu m) and during maximal dilation (65, 55, 45, 30 mu m) were similar between groups. cumulative dilations to ach (10(-9) to 10(-5) m) and constrictions to norepinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) m) were also similar between groups, as were steady-state dilations during rhythmic twitch contractions (2 and 4 hz; 30 s). for single tetanic contractions (100 hz; 100, 250, and 500 ms), rapid onset vasodilation (rov) increased with contraction duration throughout networks in gm of both groups but was reduced by nearly half in cav2(-/-) mice compared with wt mice (p < 0.05). nevertheless, maximal force during tetanic contraction was similar to 40% greater in gm of cav2(-/-) vs. wt mice (152 +/- 14 vs. 110 +/- 3 mn per square millimeter, respectively; p < 0.05). thus, while structural and functional properties of resistance networks are well maintained in the gm of cav2(-/-) mice, diminished rov with greater force production reveals novel physiological roles for cav2 in skeletal muscle.
molecular_biology	aim: aim of the present study is to evaluate the risk of residual neoplastic foci, in patients treated with breast conservative surgery, based on duct carcinoma in situ (dcis) grading. materials and methods: the study is based on a retrospective analysis of 419 resection specimens relative to 161 patients. all these patients underwent surgical re-excision when the first specimen had shown one or more margins involved by dcis. margins were oriented and the side of margin involved was recorded. clonal analysis, using the mitochondrial dna (mtdna) technique, was obtained in selected cases. results: residual neoplastic foci were found in 145 out of 419 (34.6%) re-excised specimens. specifically, residual foci of dcis grade 2 and 3 were found more frequently in the margin facing the nipple (33.3% and 51.6%, respectively). on the contrary foci of dcis grade 1 did not show any specific distribution. clonal mt dna analysis evidenced that dcis grade 3 foci present in the re-excision specimens were genetically similar to the tumor removed in the first specimen, while dcis grade 1 foci were not clonally related each other. conclusions: the present data further confirm that dcis grade 3 is characterized by a circumscribed neoplastic process extending along the large ducts probably of a single mammary lobe. on the contrary dcis grade 1 is characterized by multiple independent neoplastic foci,, dispersed through several lobes indicating a field where multiple independent foci of cancer harbor.

enzymology	spore photoproduct lyase (spl) repairs a special thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, which is commonly called spore photoproduct or sp at the bacterial early germination phase. sp is the exclusive dna photo-damage product in bacterial endospores; its generation and swift repair by spl are responsible for the spores' extremely high uv resistance. the early in vivo studies suggested that spl utilizes a direct reversal strategy to repair the sp in the absence of light. the research in the past decade further established spl as a radical sam enzyme, which utilizes a tri-cysteine cxxxcxxc motif to harbor a [4fe-4s] cluster. at the 1 + oxidation state, the cluster provides an electron to the s-adenosylmethionine (sam), which binds to the cluster in a bidentate manner as the fourth and fifth ligands, to reductively cleave the c-s bond associated with the sulfonium ion in sam. generating a reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl (5'-da) radical. this 5'-da radical abstracts the pror hydrogen atom from the c6 carbon of sp to initiate the repair process; the resulting sp radical subsequently fragments to generate a putative thymine methyl radical, which accepts a back-donated h atom to yield the repaired tpt. sam is suggested to be regenerated at the end of each catalytic cycle; and only a catalytic amount of sam is needed in the spl reaction. the h atom source for the back donation step is suggested to be a cysteine residue (c141 in bacillus subtilis spl), and the h-atom transfer reaction leaves a thiyl radical behind on the protein. this thiyl radical thus must participate in the sam regeneration process; however how the thiyl radical abstracts an h atom from the 5'-da to regenerate sam is unknown. this paper reviews and discusses the history and the latest progress in the mechanistic elucidation of spl. despite some recent breakthroughs, more questions are raised in the mechanistic understanding of this intriguing dna repair enzyme. this article is part of a special issue entitled: radical sam enzymes and radical enzymology.

human_metabolism	hydrogen sulfide is presented in textbooks as toxic, environmentally unacceptable species, however some positive effects in human metabolism were discovered in the last decades. it is important to offer students also some new information about this compound. as didactic tool in this case may serve serial precipitation of cd2+, cu2+, zn2+, mn2+ and pb2+ ions forming various colored sulfides in bubblers with chemically generated hydrogen sulfide stream. this experiment has strong and diverse color effect for enhancing the visual perception to motivate students to understand more abstract and complex information about hydrogen sulfide. it also may be helpful in analytical chemistry courses for conditional precipitation equilibrium teaching and calculations.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: by the end of the 2013-2016 west african ebola virus disease (evd) outbreaks, a total of 3814 cases (probable and confirmed) and 2544 deaths were reported in guinea. clearly, surveillance activities aiming at stopping human-to-human transmission have been the breakthrough of evd outbreak management, but their application has been at times easier said than done. this article presents five confirmed or probable evd cases that arose in conakry towards the end of the guinea epidemic, which demonstrate flaws in surveillance and follow-up. case presentation: for case 1, safe burial requirements were not followed. for cases 1 and 2, negative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) results were interpreted as no infection. for the first case, the sample may have not been taken properly while for the second the disease was possibly at its early stage. case 3 was stopped at a border health checkpoint and despite her high temperature she was allowed to continue the bus journey. for case 4, an oral swab sample was supposedly taken after death but could not be found for retrospective testing. despite characteristic symptomatology, case 5 was not identified as a suspect case for as long as 3 weeks. conclusion: in epidemic contexts, health systems must be able to track all samples of suspect cases and deaths, regardless of their laboratory results. social mobilization in communities and training in health care facilities must be strengthened at the tail of an outbreak, to avoid the natural slackening of disease surveillance, in particular for long-lasting and deadly epidemics.
northern_blotting	the long-day plant petunia x hybrida 'fantasy red' was found to produce a considerable number of premature abortive flower buds when placed under short light period stress. suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh) was performed to compare the gene expression profiles between normal and abortive petunia flower buds as induced by short light periods. using reverse northern blotting, a total of 912 positive clones were successfully identified and sequenced, and 289 non-redundant, differentially expressed transcripts were obtained. according to the blast2go and kegg pathway analyses, the significant distinct cellular component was identified as mitochondrion, and the notable different metabolic pathways were ascribed to carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism. the quality of the ssh libraries was verified through quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis of 14 genes. in addition, six of these genes were demonstrated to be of temporal and/or spatial specificity using qrt-pcr, implying that they might be responsible for the premature flower abortion. furthermore, phms2 (kc465381), a sequence sharing a high degree of similarity with male sterility 2 gene was characterized, and its inconsistent expression pattern predicted a novel role for phms2 in flower bud abortion. the data presented here provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of premature flower abortion under short light periods and, hence, may be of value for assessing candidate genes with potential for creating novel germplasms with enhanced photoperiod stress tolerance. crown copyright (c) 2013 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
northern_blotting	object. because of toxicity at high concentrations, nitric oxide (no) contributes to spinal cord injury (sci) secondary lesions. at low concentrations no modulates nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) activation. the authors investigated the activity of neuronal and endothelial no synthase (nnos and enos) to determine correlations with nf-kappa b activation and inducible nos (inos) expression soon after sci. methods. in 48 adult male wistar rats clip-based (50 g/mm(2)/10 seconds) sci was induced, and spinal cords were removed at different intervals for the following evaluations: 1) assaying specific activity of nnos and enos; 2) electrophoresis mobility shift assay for activated nf-kappa b, 3) northern blotting for inos; 4) immunohistochemistry for inos and nf-kappa b; and 5) immunofluorescence for inos and nf-kappa b. at 15 minutes postinjury, enos activity decreased significantly (p < 0.001). as did nnos activity at 1 hour compared with these levels in control animals and rats killed at 15 and 30 minutes after sci (p < 0.001). basal nf-kappa b levels were variable in controls and at 15 and 30 minutes after injury. one hour postinjury, nf-kappa b activation was diffuse. inducible nos messenger rna localized diffusely, peaking 6 hours after injury and remaining stable until 24 hours postinjury. immunohistochemical analysis showed diffuse inos and nf-kappa b staining, especially in neurons inside and around the lesion. immunofluorescence demonstrated that injured neurons were a source of nf-kappa b and inos soon after injury. conclusions. both nnos and enos exhibited different regulation and roles soon after injury: nnos correlated with nf-kappa b activation, whereas enos may have participated in vascular changes of the injured spinal cord. neurons seemed to play a pivotal role in modulating and amplifying the inflammatory response in the injured spinal cord.
human_metabolism	the factors dramatically influencing thermal comfort usually involve air temperature, radiant temperature, air humidity, air velocity, clothes insulation, and metabolic rate. however, under some special conditions, e. g., altitude environment, the air pressure should be taken into account. exposure to altitude tends to produce deterioration in human heat diffusion performance, rate of convective heat transfer decreases, and rate of convective heat transfer increases with altitude, energy balance between human body and environment is different from in the normal conditions. in the experiments, thermal perception of 20 test persons (240 person-times) was observed by subjective questionnaire in a simulated hypobaric chamber where the air parameters were controllable. the temperature was set at 22 degrees c, and the barometric conditions were set at 1, 0.95, 0.9, 0.8 atm of simulated hypobaric conditions, corresponding altitude of 0, 400, 800, 2,000 m, respectively. experiments solved the metabolic rate raised with pressure drop, and the measured pmv differed from actual thermal sensation votes in hypobaric conditions. moreover, the falling barometric pressure leads to decline in alveolar oxygen, a variety of adaptive physiological processes for oxygen delivery, human metabolism, and thermoregulatory responses as well as thermal perception change. however, the present thermal sensation models were built in the normal environment and there were many divergences in conclusions. combined with the experiments, this article builds the thermal sensation estimating model under the hypobaric conditions by principal component analysis. the purpose of this study was to make clear whether hypobaric exposure will affect people 's thermal sensation and maybe helpful to establish the indoor thermal comfort criterion in the hypobaric environment.
enzymology	physical activity is frequently used as a strategy to decrease pathogenesis and improve outcomes in chronic pathologies such as metabolic or cardiac diseases. in mice, it has been shown that voluntary wheel running (vwr) could induce an aerobic training effect and may provide a means of exploring the relationship between physical activity and the progression of pathology, or the effect of a drug on locomotor activity. to the best of our knowledge, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and other non-invasive methods had not been investigated for training evaluation in mice; therefore, it was proposed to test an mri method coupled with a cardiorespiratory gating system on c57bi/6 mice for in vivo heart anatomical and functional characterization in both trained and untrained animals. twenty mice were either assigned to a 12-week vwr program or to a control group (con - no wheel in the cage). at week 12, mri scans showed an increase in the left ventricular (lv) wall mass in the vwr group compared with the con group. the ex vivo measurements also found an increase in the heart and lv weight, as well as an increase in oxidative enzyme activities (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase [cox] in the soleus). in addition, correlations have been observed between ex vivo lv/body weight ratio, cox activity in the soleus and in vivo mri lv wall mass/body weight. in conclusion, mouse cardiac mri methods coupled with a cardiorespiratory gating system are sufficiently effective and feasible for non-invasive, training-induced heart hypertrophy characterization, and may be used for longitudinal training level follow-up in mouse models of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
genetics	population-genomic analyses are essential to understanding factors shaping genomic variation and lineage-specific sequence constraints. the dearth of such analyses for unicellular eukaryotes prompted us to assess genomic variation in paramecium, one of the most well-studied ciliate genera. the paramecium aurelia complex consists of similar to 15 morphologically indistinguishable species that diverged subsequent to two rounds of whole-genome duplications (wgds, as long as 320 mya) and possess extremely streamlined genomes. we examine patterns of both nuclear and mitochondrial polymorphism, by sequencing whole genomes of 10-13 worldwide isolates of each of three species belonging to the p. aurelia complex: p. tetraurelia, p. biaurelia, p. sexaurelia, as well as two outgroup species that do not share the wgds: p. caudatum and p. multimicronucleatum. an apparent absence of global geographic population structure suggests continuous or recent dispersal of paramecium over long distances. intergenic regions are highly constrained relative to coding sequences, especially in p. caudatum and p. multimicronucleatum that have shorter intergenic distances. sequence diversity and divergence are reduced up to similar to 100-150 bp both upstream and downstream of genes, suggesting strong constraints imposed by the presence of densely packed regulatory modules. in addition, comparison of sequence variation at non-synonymous and synonymous sites suggests similar recent selective pressures on paralogs within and orthologs across the deeply diverging species. this study presents the first genome-wide population-genomic analysis in ciliates and provides a valuable resource for future studies in evolutionary and functional genetics in paramecium.
cell_biology	systems cell biology understanding of development requires characterization of all the molecules produced in the biological system. decades of research and new-generation sequencing provided functional information on key genes and transcripts. however, there is less information available on how differential gene expression translates into the domains of functionally important proteins, peptides, and metabolites, and how changes in these molecules impact development. mass spectrometry (ms) is the current technology of choice for the detection and quantification of large numbers of proteins and metabolites, because it requires no use of antibodies, functional probes, or a priori knowledge of molecules produced in the system. this review focuses on recent technologies that have improved ms sensitivity for proteins and metabolites and enabled new functionalities to assess their temporal and spatial changes during vertebrate embryonic development. this review highlights case studies, in which new-generation ms tools have enabled the study of hundreds-to-thousands of proteins and metabolites in tissues, cell populations, and single cells in model systems of vertebrate development, particularly the frog (xenopus), zebrafish, and mouse. new-generation ms expands the toolbox of cell and developmental studies, raising exciting potentials to advance basic and translational research in the life sciences.
enzymology	the 16th international meeting on the enzymology and molecular biology of carbonyl metabolism, castle of ploen (schleswig-holstein, germany), july 10-15, 2012, covered all aspects of nad(p)-dependent oxido-reductases that are involved in the general metabolism of xenobiotic and physiological carbonyl compounds. starting 30 years ago with enzyme purification, structure elucidation and enzyme kinetics, the carbonyl society members have meanwhile established internationally recognized enzyme nomenclature systems and now consider aspects of enzyme genomics and enzyme evolution along with their roles in diseases. the 16th international meeting included lectures from international speakers from all over the world.
molecular_biology	the mouse isolated perfused kidney (mipk) is a technique for keeping a mouse kidney under ex vivo conditions perfused and functional for 1 hr. this is a prerequisite for studying the physiology of the isolated organ and for many innovative applications that may be possible in the future, including perfusion decellularization for kidney bioengineering or the administration of anti-rejection or genome-editing drugs in high doses to prime the kidney for transplantation. during the time of the perfusion, the kidney can be manipulated, renal function can be assessed, and various pharmaceuticals administered. after the procedure, the kidney can be transplanted or processed for molecular biology, biochemical analysis, or microscopy. this paper describes the perfusate and the surgical technique needed for the ex vivo perfusion of mouse kidneys. details of the perfusion apparatus are given and data are presented showing the viability of the kidney 's preparation: renal blood flow, vascular resistance, and urine data as functional, transmission electron micrographs of different nephron segments as morphological readouts, and western blots of transport proteins of different nephron segments as molecular readout.
genetics	the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)/crispr-associated protein 9 (cas9) system provides a technological breakthrough in mutant generation. several methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (pcr)/restriction enzyme (re) assay, t7 endonuclease i (t7ei) assay, surveyor nuclease assay, page-based genotyping assay, and high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis-based assay have been developed for screening crispr/cas9-induced mutants. however, these methods are time and labour-intensive and may also be sequence-limited or require very expensive equipment. here, we described a cost-effective and sensitive screening technique based on conventional pcr, annealing at critical temperature pcr (act-pcr), for identifying mutants. act-pcr requires only a single pcr step followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. we demonstrated that act-pcr accurately distinguished crispr/cas9-induced mutants from wild type in both rice and zebrafish. moreover, the method can be adapted for accurately determining mutation frequency in cultured cells. the simplicity of act-pcr makes it particularly suitable for rapid, large-scale screening of crispr/cas9-induced mutants in both plants and animals. copyright (c) 2017, institute of genetics and developmental biology, chinese academy of sciences, and genetics society of china. published by elsevier limited and science press. all rights reserved.
northern_blotting	objective-endothelial activation is implicated in atherogenesis and diabetes. the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (ppar-delta) in endothelial activation remains poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of ppar-delta and the mechanism involved. methods and results-in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs), the synthetic ppar-delta ligands gw0742 and gw501516 significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and e-selectin (assayed by real-time rt-pcr and northern blotting), as well as the ensuing endothelial-leukocyte adhesion. activation of ppar-delta upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 1, catalase, and thioredoxin and decreased reactive oxygen species production in ecs. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that gw0742 switched the association of bcl-6, a transcription repressor, from ppar-delta to the vascular cell adhesion molecule ( vcam)-1 promoter. small interfering rna reduced endogenous ppar-delta expression but potentiated the suppressive effect of gw0742 on ec activation, which suggests that the nonliganded ppar-delta may have an opposite effect. conclusions-we have demonstrated that ligand activation of ppar-delta in ecs has a potent antiinflammatory effect, probably via a binary mechanism involving the induction of antioxidative genes and the release of nuclear corepressors. ppar-delta agonists may have a potential for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes.
northern_blotting	pneumocystis carinii (pc) adhesion to alveolar epithelial cells is well established and is thought to be a prerequisite for the initiation of pneumocystis pneumonia. pc binding events occur in part through the major pc surface glycoprotein msg, as well as an integrin-like molecule termed pcint1. recent data from the pc sequencing project also demonstrate dna sequences homologous to other genes important in candida spp. binding to mammalian host cells, as well as organism binding to polystyrene surfaces and in biofilm formation. one of these genes, flo8, a transcription factor needed for downstream camp/pka-pathway-mediated activation of the major adhesion/flocculin flo11 in yeast, was cloned from a pc cdna library utilizing a partial sequence available in the pc genome database. a chef blot of pc genomic dna yielded a single band providing evidence this gene is present in the organism. blastp analysis of the predicted protein demonstrated 41 % homology to the saccharomyces cerevisiae flo8. northern blotting demonstrated greatest expression at ph 6.0-8.0, ph comparable to reported fungal biofilm milieu. western blot and immunoprecipitation assays of pcflo8 protein in isolated cyst and tropic life forms confirmed the presence of the cognate protein in these pc life forms. heterologous expression of pcflo8 cdna in flo8 delta-deficient yeast strains demonstrated that the pcflo8 was able to restore yeast binding to polystyrene and invasive growth of yeast flo8 delta cells. furthermore, pcflo8 promoted yeast binding to hek293 human epithelial cells, strengthening its functional classification as a flo8 transcription factor. taken together, these data suggest that pcflo8 is expressed by pc and may exert activity in organism adhesion and biofilm formation.
southern_blotting	accumulated data have shown that most human somatic cells or tissues show irreversible telomere shortening with age, and that there are strong associations between telomere attrition and aging-related diseases, including cancers, diabetes and cognitive disorders. although it has been largely accepted that telomere attrition is one of the major causes of aging-related disorders, critical aspects of telomere biology remain unresolved, especially the lack of standardized methodology for quantification of telomere length. another frustrating issue is that no potentially promising methods for safe prevention of telomere erosion, or for telomere elongation, have been devised. here, we review several methods for quantification of telomere length currently utilized worldwide, considering their advantages and drawbacks. we also summarize the results of our recent studies of human cells and tissues, mainly using quantitative fluorescence insitu hybridization and southern blotting, including those derived from patients with progeria-prone werner syndrome and trisomy 21, and several strains of induced pluripotent stem cells. we discuss the possible merits of using telomere shortness as an indicator, or a new marker, for diagnosis of precancerous states and aging-related disorders. in addition, we describe newly found factors that are thought to impact telomere dynamics, providing a new avenue for examining the unsolved issues related to telomere restoration and maintenance. geriatr gerontol int 2016; 16 (suppl. 1): 30-42.
genetics	understanding how genetics influences inter-individual variation of antibody titers in response to measles vaccination is vital to understanding possible sources of vaccine failure as well as improved vaccine development. although it is recognized that both the human leukocyte antigen (hla) genes and the immunoglobulin allotype genes play significant roles in immune response, there is significant variation in antibody titers that is not explained by these genes. to obtain a more complete estimate of the role of the entire genome, we used a large panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate the heritability of antibody response to measles vaccine. based on 935 subjects with european ancestry, we estimated the heritability to be 49% (standard error 0.17). we also estimated the heritability attributable to each chromosome, and found a large range in chromosome-specific heritabilities. notably, chromosome 1 had the largest estimate (28%), while chromosome 6, which harbors hla, had an estimated heritability of 13%. compared with a prior study of twins in the same community, which resulted in a heritability estimate of 88.5%, our study suggests there are either many rare genetic variants, or many common genetic variants of small effect sizes that contribute to variations of antibody titers in response to measles vaccine.

cell_biology	cell culture is a well-established standard technique and a fundamental tool in biology and medicine. establishment of a novel culture method by meeting various challenges can sometimes open up new fields of cell biology and medicine. an artificial microenvironment for cultured cells is made up of complicated factors, including cytokines, scaffold material type, cell-cell interactions, and physical stress. to replicate the tissue architecture, cell-cell interactions, and specific physical microenvironment, we previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a three-dimensional culture system, and further established two simple culture systems: air-liquid interface (ali) and fluid flow stress (ffs). a three-dimensional collagen gel culture system can replicate cell-cell interactions in vitro. as skin is constantly exposed to air, the ali system closely mimicked the skin microenvironment and maintained the homeostasis of the epidermis and dermis. the ali culture system also revealed the possibility of skin regeneration through ectopic mesenchymal cell involvement. fluid streaming and shear stress were recently demonstrated to constitute the critical microenvironment for various cell types. the ffs system demonstrated that fluid streaming induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of mesothelial cells, leading to peritoneal fibrosis. our novel culture systems will hopefully open up new fields of regenerative medicine and pathological research.
genetics	male secondary sexual traits and female mate choice traits must contain heritable variation for sexual selection to operate. however, for female mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. to complicate matters, both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an important synergistic role. using a cross-fostering design, we therefore aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. to assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social environment and thus on learned components. among the different male song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. specifically, the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout repertoires. in contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in female mate choice. female mate choice contained a learned component as females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. thus, our study provides important insights into the role of the social environment for both birdsong and female mate choice. however, the absence of a heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable) male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. overall, our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre- and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual selection.

cell_biology	extracellular adenosine is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that modulates a wide array of biological processes. recently, significant advances have been made in our understanding of a(2b) adenosine receptor (a(2b)ar). in this review, we first summarize some of the general characteristics of a(2b)ar, and then we describe the multiple binding partners of the receptor, such as newly identified alpha-actinin-1 and p105, and discuss how these associated proteins could modulate a(2b)ar 's functions, including certain seemingly paradoxical functions of the receptor. growing evidence indicates a critical role of a(2b)ar in cancer, renal disease, and diabetes, in addition to its importance in the regulation of vascular diseases, and lung disease. here, we also discuss the role of a(2b)ar in cancer, renal disease, and diabetes and the potential of the receptor as a target for treating these three diseases.
enzymology	the emergence of next-generation sequencing has provided new opportunities in the discovery of new nonribosomal peptides (nrps) and nrp synthethases (nrpss). however, there remain challenges for the characterization of these megasynthases. while genetic methods in native hosts are critical in elucidation of the function of fungal nrps, in vitro assays of intact heterologously expressed proteins provide deeper mechanistic insights in nrps enzymology. our previous work in the study of nrps takes advantage of saccharomyces cerevisiae strain bj5464-npga as a robust and versatile platform for characterization of fungal nrpss. here we describe the use of yeast recombination strategies in s. cerevisiae for cloning of the nrps coding sequence in 2 mu-based expression vector; the use of affinity chromatography for purification of nrps from the total s. cerevisiae soluble protein fraction; and strategies for reconstitution of nrpss activities in vitro.
genetics	the potential impact of using human genetic data linked to longitudinal electronic medical records on drug development is extraordinary; however, the practical application of these data necessitates some organizational innovations. vanderbilt has created resources such as an easily queried database of >2.6 million de-identified electronic health records linked to biovu, which is a dna biobank with more than 230,000 unique samples. to ensure these data are used to maximally benefit and accelerate both de novo drug discovery and drug repurposing efforts, we created the accelerating drug development and repurposing incubator, a multidisciplinary think tank of experts in various therapeutic areas within both basic and clinical science as well as experts in legal, business, and other operational domains. the incubator supports a diverse pipeline of drug indication finding projects, leveraging the natural experiment of human genetics.
polymerase_chain_reaction	backgroundnovel fusion transcripts (fts) caused by chromosomal rearrangement are common factors in the development of cancers. in the current study, the authors used massively parallel rna sequencing to identify new fts in colon cancers. methodsrna sequencing (rna-seq) and tophat-fusion were used to identify new fts in colon cancers. the authors then investigated whether the novel ft nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group a, member 2 (nr5a2)-kelch-like family member 29 ft (klhl29ft) was transcribed from a genomic chromosomal rearrangement. next, the expression of nr5a2-klhl29ft was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in colon cancers and matched corresponding normal epithelia. resultsthe authors identified the ft nr5a2-klhl29ft in normal and cancerous epithelia. while investigating this transcript, it was unexpectedly found that it was due to an uncharacterized polymorphic germline insertion of the nr5a2 sequence from chromosome 1 into the klhl29 locus at chromosome 2, rather than a chromosomal rearrangement. this germline insertion, which occurred at a population frequency of 0.40, appeared to bear no relationship to cancer development. moreover, expression of nr5a2-klhl29ft was validated in rna specimens from samples with insertions of nr5a2 at the klhl29 gene locus, but not from samples without this insertion. it is interesting to note that nr5a2-klh29ft expression levels were significantly lower in colon cancers than in matched normal colonic epithelia (p =.029), suggesting the potential participation of nr5a2-klhl29ft in the origin or progression of this tumor type. conclusionsnr5a2-klhl29ft was generated from a polymorphism insertion of the nr5a2 sequence into the klhl29 locus. nr5a2-klhl29ft may influence the origin or progression of colon cancer. moreover, researchers should be aware that similar fts may occur due to transchromosomal insertions that are not correctly annotated in genome databases, especially with current assembly algorithms. cancer 2017;123:1507-1515. (c) 2017 american cancer society. a novel fusion transcript identified by rna sequencing, nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group a, member 2 (nr5a2)-kelch-like family member 29 fusion transcript (klhl29ft), was generated from a polymorphism insertion at the klhl29 locus instead of a chromosome rearrangement. the expression of nr5a2-klhl29ft appears to be lower in colon cancers than in matched normal tissues, suggesting potential participation of nr5a2-klhl29ft in the origin or progression of colon cancer.
northern_blotting	background: nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappa b), a transcription factor, is abundantly expressed in many tumors and regulates many tumor-relative genes such as c-myc and caspase-8, which nf-kappa b-mediated genes activation serves as an anti-tumor pathway by regulating expression of these tumor-relative genes. given the important roles of these genes in tumor control, the present study was to test the hypothesis that nf-kappa b decoy odns transfected into tumor cells in vitro and in vivo might affect growth and apoptosis. methods: first, nf-kappa b decoy oligodeoxynucleotides were designed according to the nf-kappa b elements in the promoter region of c-myc gene. then, supression effects of decoy odns on proliferation of five carcinoma cell lines were assessed by mtt assay. apoptosis of carcinoma cells was determined by chromosome dna ladder and flow cytometric analysis (fcm). thirdly, suppression effects of nf-kappa b decoy odns on proliferation of carcinoma in vivo were investigated in nude mice. to confirm mechanisms of action, a pgl3-c-myc luciferase expression vector containing a fragment of the c-myc promoter was constructed and co-transfected with nf-kappa b decoy odns into skov-3 cells by lipofectaminetm2000. expression levels of endogenous c-myc and caspase-8 genes were assessed by northern blotting. lastly, nuclear extracts were prepared from skov-3 cells and dna-protein interactions were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). results: treatment of cancer cell lines with nf-kappa b decoy odns resulted in strong suppression of proliferation, especial of the skov-3 ovarian cancer cell line in vitro and in vivo. induction of apoptosis of skov-3 was observed in dna gel electrophoresis and fcm. activity of luciferase was significantly reduced in the nf-kappa b decoy-transfected cells, but not in cells transfected with a control decoy. furthermore, we found that transcripts of endogenous c-myc gene were reduced, while caspase-8 transcripts were induced. emsa demonstrated specific binding of the nf-kappa b decoy to nf-kappa b protein. conclusions: these findings indicatd that nf-kappa b activation plays an important role in proliferation in many cancers, esspecially ovarian carcinomas. inhibitors of nf-kappa b may thus offer promise as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of tumors via manipulating expression of desired target genes. nf-kappa b decoy odns may allow development of therapeutic and investigative tools for human malignancies.
immunology	objective: long-term prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remains poor owing to the lack of treatment options for advanced hcc. cytokine-induced killer (cik) cells are ex vivo expanded t lymphocytes expressing both nk- and t-cell markers. cik cell therapy alone is insufficient for treating advanced hcc. thus, this study aimed to determine whether treatment with cik cells combined with valproic acid (vpa) could provide a synergistic effect to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse model of hcc. methods: upregulation of natural killer group 2d (nkg2d) ligands (retinoic acid early inducible 1 [rae-1], mouse; major histocompatibility complex class i polypeptide-related sequence a [mic-a], human) were evaluated by facs. vpa concentrations that did not reduce tumor volume were calculated to avoid vpa cytotoxicity in a c3h mouse model of hcc. cik cells were generated from mouse splenocytes using interferon gamma, a cd3 monoclonal antibody, and interleukin 2. the potential synergistic effect of cik cells combined with vpa was evaluated in the mouse model and tissue pathology was investigated. results: after 40h of incubation with vpa, rae-1 and mic-a expression were increased in 4 hcc cell lines compared with that in control (2.3-fold in mh-134, 2.4-fold in huh-7, 3.7-fold in snu-761, and 6.5-fold in snu-475). the maximal in vivo vpa dosage that showed no significant cytotoxicity compared with control was 10mg/kg/day. cik cells were well generated from c3h mouse splenocytes. after 7d of treatment with cik cells plus vpa, a synergistic effect was observed on relative tumor volume in the mouse model of hcc. while the relative tumor volume in untreated control mice increased to 11.25, that in the combination treatment group increased to only 5.20 (p = 0.047). conclusions: the vpa-induced increase in nkg2d ligands expression significantly enhanced the effects of cik cell therapy in a mouse model of hcc.
genetics	the dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and postures. there are many different clinical manifestations and underlying causes. deep brain stimulation (dbs) provides an effect treatment, but outcomes can vary considerably among the different subtypes of dystonia. several variables are thought to contribute to this variation including age of onset and duration of dystonia, specific characteristics of the dystonic movements, location of stimulation and stimulator settings, and others. the potential contributions of genetic factors have received little attention. in this review, we summarize evidence that some of the variation in dbs outcomes for dystonia is due to genetic factors. the evidence suggests that more methodical genetic testing may provide useful information in the assessment of potential surgical candidates, and in advancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms that influence dbs outcomes.
enzymology	a specific and sensitive substrate for the assay of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (cellulase) has been prepared. the substrate mixture comprises benzylidene end-blocked 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-cellotrioside (bzcnpg3) in the presence of thermostable beta-glucosidase. hydrolysis by exo-acting enzymes such as beta-glucosidase and exo-beta-glucanase is prevented by the presence of the benzylidene group on the non-reducing end d-glucosyl residue. on hydrolysis by cellulase, the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-glycoside is immediately hydrolysed to 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol and free d-glucose by the b-glucosidase in the substrate mixture. the reaction is terminated and colour developed by the addition of a weak alkaline solution. the assay procedure is simple to use, specific, accurate, robust and readily adapted to automation. this procedure should find widespread applications in biomass enzymology and in the specific assay of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase in general.

polymerase_chain_reaction	little is known about consequences of spartina alterniflora invasion on soil sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb). this study compared the abundance, diversity, and community structure of srb in s. alterniflora and in native plant communities along a successional gradient (bare mudflat, young/mature s. alterniflora, suaeda salsa, and phragmites australis) in coastal salt marshes of eastern china. quantitative polymerase chain reaction of dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrb) gene was applied to assess srb abundance, and the diversity and composition of srb was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing of partial dsrb gene. we found that s. alterniflora had a significantly higher abundance and diversity of srb than native plant species. for all plant covers, desulfobacteraceae was the largest soil srb group, with a relative abundance of 33.6%, followed by desulfobulbaceae (29.2%). s. alterniflora showed a higher relative abundance of desulfobacteraceae (42.5%) than native species (29.5%) did. notably, s. alterniflora invasion decreased the relative abundance of a srb branch clustering with the thermophilic thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii. in conclusion, s. alterniflora invasion of the eastern coast of china has greatly increased the abundance and diversity of srb communities and altered their structure. this might further influence carbon mineralization and inhibit the production of methane in china 's coastal marshes.
human_metabolism	body-on-a-chip systems replicate the size relationships of organs, blood distribution and blood flow, in accordance with human physiology. when operated with tissues derived from human cell sources, these systems are capable of simulating human metabolism, including the conversion of a prodrug to its effective metabolite, as well as its subsequent therapeutic actions and toxic side-effects. the system also permits the measurement of human tissue electrical and mechanical reactions, which provide a measure of functional response. since these devices can be operated with human tissue samples or with in vitro tissues derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (ips), they can play a significant role in determining the success of new pharmaceuticals, without resorting to the use of animals. by providing a platform for testing in the context of human metabolism, as opposed to animal models, the systems have the potential to eliminate the use of animals in preclinical trials. this article will review progress made and work achieved as a direct result of the 2015 lush science prize in support of animal-free testing.
northern_blotting	the long-term cardiac effects of amiodarone resemble many aspects of hypothyroidism. the anti-arrhythmic potential of amiodarone may therefore be the result of a drug-induced, local hypothyroid-like condition. to investigate this controversial issue, we compared gene expression profiles in the hearts of rats treated with amiodarone with those of rats with hypothyroidism. wistar male rats were assigned to 3 groups (n = 6-8): control, systemic hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism) and amiodarone treatment (amiodarone, 150 mg/kg/day, p.o., 4 weeks). electrocardiogram (ecg) recordings, gene profiling by dna microarray and northern blotting were carried out. amiodarone, like hypothyroidism, caused significant prolongation of rr and qt intervals in ecgs. microarray analysis of 8435 genes in the left ventricular myocardium revealed a significant similarity in expression profiles between hypothyroidism and amiodarone (r=0.63, p<0.00001). the gene expression profiles of hypothyroidism and amiodarone showed closer correlation when top 100 up-regulated and 100 down-regulated genes in hypothyroidism, (total 200 genes)were analyzed (r=0.78,p<0.00001). northern blots of left ventricular myocardium, showed a parallel decrease in mrnas for myosin heavy chain (mhc)-alpha and a parallel increase for myosin heavy chain (mhc)-beta in hypothyroidism and amiodarone. in the liver and pituitary, in contrast, northern blots showed quite different changes in the transcripts of the representative t3-responsive genes in the hypothyroidism and amiodarone. in conclusion, long-term treatment with amiodarone causes cardioselective hypothyroid-like alterations in gene expression profiles. the potent anti-arrhythmic activity of amiodarone may be attributable, in part at least, to this unique transcriptional remodeling.

cell_biology	melatonin affects a variety of physiological processes including circadian rhythms, cellular redox status, and immune function. importantly, melatonin significantly influences t-cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial to protect mammals against cancers and infections, but are associated with pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. this review focuses on our current understanding of the significance of melatonin in t-cell biology and the beneficial effects of melatonin in t-cell response-based diseases. in addition to expressing both membrane and nuclear receptors for melatonin, t cells have the four enzymes required for the synthesis of melatonin and produce high levels of melatonin. meanwhile, melatonin is highly effective in modulating t-cell activation and differentiation, especially for th17 and treg cells, and also memory t cells. mechanistically, the influence of melatonin in t-cell biology is associated with membrane and nuclear receptors as well as receptor-independent pathways, for example, via calcineurin. several cell signaling pathways, including erk1/2-c/ebp alpha, are involved in the regulatory roles of melatonin in t-cell biology. through modulation in t-cell responses, melatonin exerts beneficial effects in various inflammatory diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. these findings highlight the importance of melatonin signaling in t-cell fate determination, and t cell-based immune pathologies.
southern_blotting	molecular pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) is largely associated with mutational changes in the braf, ras family and ret genes. our aim was to assess clinico-pathological and prognostic correlations of these ptc-specific gene alterations, with a particular emphasis on the braf mutation, in a group of 266 serbian ptc patients, for the first time. the reference center-based retrospective cohort included 201 (75.6%) females and 65 (24.4%) males aged 48.0 +/- 16.1 years (8-83 years old, range) diagnosed and treated for ptc during 1993-2008. follow-up period was 53.1 +/- 41.6 months (7-187 months, range). braf and ras mutations were determined by direct sequencing of genomic dna. ret/ptc rearrangements were analyzed by rt-pcr/southern blotting. genetic alterations were detected in 150/266 tumors (56.4%). one tumor displayed two genetic alterations. the braf(v600e) was found in 84/266 (31.6%) cases, ras mutations in 11/266(4.1%) and ret/ptc in 55/266(20.7%; 42/266 (15.8%)ret/ptc1 and 13/266 (4.9%)ret/ptc3). on multivariate analysis braf(v600e) was associated with the classical papillary morphology (p = 0.05), the higher pt category (p = 0.05) and advanced clinical stage (p = 0.03). in a proportional hazard model, braf(v600e) did not appear to be an independent risk factor for the faster recurrence (p = 0.784). we conclude that under the extensive thyroid surgery and limited application of radioiodine ablation braf(v600e) may not be an indicator of poorer disease-free survival during the short to middle follow-up period. however, it has a potential to contribute to patients stratification into high- and low-risk groups.
immunology	in many wild animal populations, hosts are at risk of parasites and malnutrition and resource costs of defence may be difficult to afford. we postulate that proteins, important in homeostasis and immunity, play a complex but central role in condition dependence and resource costs of mammalian immune defence. to test this, we measured plasma concentrations of albumin, total proteins. self-reactive antibodies and parasite-specific igg in female soay sheep. using a principal component analysis, we found a new metric of condition reflecting individual variation in acquisition, assimilation and/or recycling of plasma proteins that predicted overwinter survival. controlling for this metric, an age-dependent trade-off between antibody titres and protein reserves emerged, indicating costs of mounting an antibody response: younger individuals survived best when prioritising immunity while older individuals fared better when maintaining high-protein nutritional plane. these findings suggest fascinating roles for protein acquisition and allocation in influencing survival in wild animal populations.
enzymology	the ability to undergo non-oxidative metabolism from ethanol to fatty acid ethyl esters (faees) varies greatly among tissues and organs. to gain a greater understanding of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism to faee, we aimed to collect all published data on faee synthesis in mammalian organs and tissues to identify all tissues, organs, and enzymes that are known to, or likely possess faee-synthetic activity. a systematic search for relevant papers was performed and two independent reviewers examined potentially relevant abstracts (articles on faees that pertain to ethanol exposure) to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. information on faee synthesis was retrieved from papers meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and summarized by organ/tissue/matrix examined. the systematic search through four databases yielded 78 articles that investigated faee synthesis by tissues, tissue fractions and cell lines, and 29 articles that attempted to purify and/or characterize the enzymes involved in faee synthesis. two enzyme activities have been studied: faee synthase (faees, which conjugates ethanol and free fatty acid) and acyl-coa: ethanol o-acyltransferase (aeat, which conjugates ethanol and fatty acyl-coa). both activities are expressed by a variety of different enzymes. faees activity is the most widely studied and has been purified from several tissues and shown to be associated with several well-known enzymes, while the identity of enzymes possessing aeat activity remains unknown. the organs and tissues that have been shown to synthesize faees are discussed, with special emphasis on the studies that attempted to elucidate the enzymology of faee synthesis in those tissues.
southern_blotting	non-heading chinese cabbage (brassica rapa l. ssp. chinensis) is a popular vegetable in asian countries. the diamondback moth (dbm), plutella xylostella (l.), an insect with worldwide distribution, is a main pest of brassicaceae crops and causes enormous crop losses. transfer of the anti-insect gene into the plant genome by transgenic technology and subsequent breeding of insect-resistant varieties will be an effective approach to reducing the damage caused by this pest. we have produced transgenic non-heading chinese cabbage plants expressing the potato proteinase inhibitor ii gene (pinii) and tested the pest resistance of these transgenic plants. non-heading chinese cabbages grown for 45 days on which buds had formed were used as experimental materials for agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration transformation. forty-one resistant plants were selected from 1166 g of seed harvested from the infiltrated plants based on the resistance of the young seedlings to the herbicide basta. the transgenic traits were further confirmed by the chlorophenol red test, pcr, and genomic southern blotting. the results showed that the bar and pinii genes were co-integrated into the resistant plant genome. a bioassay of insect resistance in the second generation of individual lines of the transgenic plants showed that dbm larvae fed on transgenic leaves were severely stunted and had a higher mortality than those fed on the wild-type leaves.
molecular_biology	several clinical trials have demonstrated that some patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (cml-cp) who achieve sustained deep molecular responses on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki) therapy can safely suspend therapy and attempt treatment-free remission (tfr). many tfr studies to date have enrolled imatinib-treated patients; however, the feasibility of tfr following nilotinib or dasatinib has also been demonstrated. in this review, we discuss available data from tfr trials and what these data reveal about the molecular biology of tfr. with an increasing number of ongoing tfr clinical trials, tfr may become an achievable goal for patients with cml-cp.
southern_blotting	to study the calmodulin (cam) signal transduction pathway of gracilaria lemaneiformis under heat stress, peptidase (denoted as metalloprotease of g. lemaneiformis (glmp)), a calmodulin-binding protein of g. lemaneiformis was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. the full complementary dna (cdna) and genomic dna encoding glmp was obtained by using rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) and genome walking techniques, respectively. the dna sequence of glmp consisted of 1,130 nucleotides, containing an open reading frame (orf) of 462 nucleotides, with an intron of 71 nucleotides. the orf of the isolated glmp was predicted to encode 153 amino acids, including the zinc metalloprotease hexxh consensus motif characteristic of glmp. southern blotting indicated that there were two copies of glmp in g. lemaneiformis. the yeast two-hybrid results showed that the expressed glmp could interact with cam, proving that glmp was a type of calmodulin-binding protein. next, the transcription of cam and glmp of g. lemaneiformis was analyzed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) under heat shock of 28 and 32 a degrees c. the expression level displayed a cyclical upward trend. these results indicate that glmp and cam may play important roles in high-temperature tolerance of g. lemaneiformis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	cell transfer between mother and fetus were demonstrated previously in several species which possess haemochorial placenta (e.g. in humans, mice, rats, etc.). here we report the assessment of fetal and maternal microchimerism in non-transgenic (non-tg) new zealand white rabbits which were pregnant with transgenic (tg) fetuses and in non-tg newborns of tg does. the tg construct, including the venus fluorophore cdna driven by a ubiquitous cytomegalovirus enhancer, chicken -actin promoter (caggs), was previously integrated into the rabbit genome by sleeping beauty transposon system. three different methods [fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr)] were employed to search for tg cells and gene products in blood and other tissues of non-tg rabbits. venus positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were not detected in the blood of non-tg littermates or non-tg does by flow cytometry. tissue samples (liver, kidney, skeletal and heart muscle) also proved to be venus negative examined with fluorescence microscopy, while histology sections and pbmcs of tg rabbits showed robust venus protein expression. in case of genomic dna (gdna) sourced from tissue samples of non-tg rabbits, caggs promoter-specific fragments could not be amplified by qpcr. our data showed the lack of detectable cell transfer between tg and non-tg rabbits during gestation.
northern_blotting	mac-2 binding protein (mac-2bp) is a secreted tumor antigen that is elevated in many cancers and implicated in tumor metastasis, as well as cell adhesion and immune functions. we focused on the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (htert) induced mac-2bp expression and the relationship between mac-2bp expression and the progression of gastric cancer. a cdna expression array analysis was performed on the telomerase-negative cell line, sw13, which was engineered to overexpress htert when compared with the parental sw13 cell. htert-induced mac-2bp expression was confirmed via rt-pcr and northern blotting. elisa and flow cytometric analyses revealed that mac-2bp protein was increased by 2- to 4-fold in htert-overexpressing cells compared with the mock control. mac-2bp expression was significantly reduced when the overexpressed htert was neutralized by the introduction of htert-specific sirna. these results suggest that mac-2bp expression is modulated by htert. mac-2bp levels in both gastric cancer cells and tumor tissues were determined via northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. mac-2bp protein was highly expressed in most gastric cancer cell lines, and gastric tumor tissues were stained more densely than normal tissues. the intracellular and secreted mac-2bp levels were also evaluated ilia elisa, indicating that mac-2bp was expressed and secreted more abundantly in gastric cancer patients than in healthy donors. the elevated serum mac-2bp level in gastric tumor patients was also significantly associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.05) and higher tumor stage (p = 0.04). our findings suggest that mac-2bp is induced by htert. and that it may prove to be a useful prognostic marker for the detection of malignant progression of metastatic stomach cancers.

polymerase_chain_reaction	introduction: tuberculosis (tb) is a leading killer worldwide. end tb strategy aims at ending the tb epidemic by 2030. early, accurate, and affordable diagnosis represents a cornerstone to achieve this goal. innovative strategies for tb diagnostics have been introduced. however, the ideal assay is yet unavailable and conventional methods remain necessary for diagnosis. unique properties of nanoparticles (nps) have allowed their utilization in tb detection via targeting disease biomarkers.area covered: until now, around thirty-five tb np-based assays have been partially or fully characterized. accuracy, low-cost, and short time-to-result represent the common properties of proposed platforms. tb nanodiagnostics now encompass almost all clinical aspects of the disease including active tb, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, rifampicin resistant tb, tb/hiv co-infection, latent tb, and extra-pulmonary tb. this review summarizes state-of-the-art knowledge of tb nanodiagnostics for the last 10years. special consideration is given for fabrication concepts, detection strategies, and clinical performance using various clinical specimens. the potential of tb nanodiagnostics to fulfill the need for ideal mtb testing is assessed.expert commentary: tb nanodiagnostics show promise to be ideal detection tools that can meet the rigorous demands to end the tb epidemic by 2030.
molecular_biology	model animals are crucial to biomedical research. among the commonly used model animals, the amphibian, xenopus, has had tremendous impact because of its unique experimental advantages, cost effectiveness, and close evolutionary relationship with mammals as a tetrapod. over the past 50years, the use of xenopus has made possible many fundamental contributions to biomedicine, and it is a cornerstone of research in cell biology, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, immunology, molecular biology, neurobiology, and physiology. the prospects for xenopus as an experimental system are excellent: xenopus is uniquely well-suited for many contemporary approaches used to study fundamental biological and disease mechanisms. moreover, recent advances in high throughput dna sequencing, genome editing, proteomics, and pharmacological screening are easily applicable in xenopus, enabling rapid functional genomics and human disease modeling at a systems level.
genetics	canine influenza is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by two subtypes (h3n2 and h3n8) of canine influenza virus (civ). currently, only inactivated influenza vaccines (itvs) are available for the prevention of civs. historically, live-attenuated influenza vaccines (laivs) have been shown to produce better immunogenicity and protection efficacy than iivs. here, we have engineered a civ h3n2 law by using the internal genes of a previously described civ h3n8 law as a master donor virus (mdv) and the surface ha and na genes of a circulating civ h3n2 strain. our findings show that civ h3n2 law replicates efficiently at low temperature but its replication is impaired at higher temperatures. the civ h3n2 laiv was attenuated in vivo but induced better protection efficacy in mice against challenge with wild-type civ h3n2 than a commercial civ h3n2 iiv. this is the first description of a laiv for the prevention of civ h3n2 in dogs.
molecular_biology	cancer is a complex disease: its pathology cannot be properly understood in terms of independent players-genes, proteins, molecular pathways, or their simple combinations. this is similar to many-body physics of a condensed phase that many important properties are not determined by a single atom or molecule. the rapidly accumulating large 'omics' data also require a new mechanistic and global underpinning to organize for rationalizing cancer complexity. a unifying and quantitative theory was proposed by some of the present authors that cancer is a robust state formed by the endogenous molecular-cellular network, which is evolutionarily built for the developmental processes and physiological functions. cancer state is not optimized for the whole organism. the discovery of crucial players in cancer, together with their developmental and physiological roles, in turn, suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure within molecular biology systems. such a structure enables a decision network to be constructed from experimental knowledge. by examining the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of the network, robust states corresponding to normal physiological and abnormal pathological phenotypes, including cancer, emerge naturally. the nonlinear dynamical model of the network leads to a more encompassing understanding than the prevailing linear-additive thinking in cancer research. so far, this theory has been applied to prostate, hepatocellular, gastric cancers and acute promyelocytic leukemia with initial success. it may offer an example of carrying physics inquiring spirit beyond its traditional domain: while quantitative approaches can address individual cases, however there must be general rules/laws to be discovered in biology and medicine.
molecular_biology	berberine is traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal (gi) motility disorders. the interstitial cells of cajal (iccs) are the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract, which are responsible for the production of gut movements. the present study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine on pacemaker potentials (pps) in cultured icc clusters from the mouse small intestine, and sought to identify the receptors involved and the underlying mechanisms of action. all experiments were performed on cultured iccs, and a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record pps from icc clusters (current clamp mode). under current clamp mode, berberine was shown to decrease the amplitude and frequency of pps. however, these effects were suppressed by treatment with glibenclamide, a specific atp-sensitive k+ channel blocker. nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride (a kappa opioid receptor antagonist) did not suppress berberine-induced pp inhibition, whereas ici 174,864 (a delta opioid receptor antagonist) and ctop (a mu opioid receptor antagonist) did suppress the inhibitory effects of berberine. pretreatment with sq-22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) or with kt-5720 (a protein kinase a inhibitor) did not suppress the effects of berberine; however, pretreatment with 1h-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) or kt-5823 [a protein kinase g (pkg) inhibitor] did. in addition, berberine stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp) production in iccs. these observations indicate that berberine may inhibit the pacemaker activity of icc clusters via atp-sensitive k+ channels and the cgmp-pkg-dependent pathway by stimulating mu and delta opioid receptors. therefore, berberine may provide a basis for the development of novel agents for the treatment of gi motility dysfunction.
molecular_biology	breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. therapeutic treatments for breast cancer generally include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrinotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. with the development of molecular biology, immunology and pharmacogenomics, immunotherapy becomes a promising new field in breast cancer therapies. in this review, we discussed recent progress in breast cancer immunotherapy, including cancer vaccines, bispecific antibodies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. several additional immunotherapy modalities in early stages of development are also highlighted. it is believed that these new immunotherapeutic strategies will ultimately change the current status of breast cancer therapies.
genetics	aims genetic polymorphisms may contribute to platelet reactivity in diabetic patients; however, the information on their influence on long-term antiplatelet therapy is lacking. our aim was to evaluate the role of previously described genetic variants and platelet reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. methods blood samples were obtained from 303 caucasian patients. genome-wide genotyping was performed using illumina human omni 2.5-quad microarrays, and individual genotyping of selected snps was performed using a custom sequenom iplex assay in conjunction with the mass array platform. platelet reactivity was measured with verifynow aspirin assay and pfa-100 assay. univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of genetic variants and platelets reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. results among the 237 patients included in the follow-up, death from any cause occurred in 34 (14.3%) patients and cardiovascular events occurred in 51 (21.5%) patients within a median observation time of 71 months (5.9 years). in univariate analyses, significant association in the presence of minor alleles in txba2r (rs1131882) with primary (hr 2.54, 95% ci 1.15-5.60, p = 0.021) and secondary endpoint (hr 2.06, 95% ci 1.06-4.04, p = 0.034) was observed. in addition, multivariate analyses revealed the impact of this polymorphism on primary (hr 2.34, 95% ci 1.09-5.00, p = 0.029) and secondary endpoint (hr 1.89, 95% ci 1.00-3.57, p = 0.048). conclusions results of the study demonstrate for the first time an association between genetic polymorphism within txba2r gene encoding platelet 's surface receptor and long-term survival of diabetic patients treated with asa.
immunology	as the prevalence and socioeconomic burden of allergic rhinitis is steadily increasing every year, it is essential that clinical practitioners diagnose and manage allergic rhinitis in an evidence-based manner. therefore, the korean academy of asthma, allergy and clinical immunology developed new clinical guidelines for korean patients and practitioners. we first performed a questionnaire survey to address the core questions, about which clinical practitioners are the most curious. a large group of physicians (allergists), pediatricians, and otorhinolaryngologists developed answers for those questions by performing a systematic literature review and determining the appropriate levels of recommendation. in this article, we propose 11 answers for core questions regarding the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.
molecular_biology	imaging of frster resonance energy transfer (fret) is a powerful tool for examining cell biology in real-time. studies utilizing fret commonly employ two-dimensional (2d) culture, which does not mimic the three-dimensional (3d) cellular microenvironment. a method to perform quenched emission fret imaging using conventional widefield epifluorescence microscopy of cells within a 3d hydrogel environment is presented. here an analysis method for ratiometric fret probes that yields linear ratios over the probe activation range is described. measurement of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) levels is demonstrated in chondrocytes under forskolin stimulation using a probe for epac1 activation (icue1) and the ability to detect differences in camp signaling dependent on hydrogel material type, herein a photocrosslinking hydrogel (pc-gel, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and a thermoresponsive hydrogel (tr-gel). compared with 2d fret methods, this method requires little additional work. laboratories already utilizing fret imaging in 2d can easily adopt this method to perform cellular studies in a 3d microenvironment. it can further be applied to high throughput drug screening in engineered 3d microtissues. additionally, it is compatible with other forms of fret imaging, such as anisotropy measurement and fluorescence lifetime imaging (flim), and with advanced microscopy platforms using confocal, pulsed, or modulated illumination.
human_metabolism	the effects of water-soluble nonstarch polysaccharides (snsp) on human metabolism are considered to be beneficial because they decrease postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia following ingestion of starch-rich foods. the mechanisms by which snsp attenuate the postprandial rise in blood glucose are not well understood but their presence increases the viscosity of gastrointestinal contents, which affects physiological functions, e.g. gastric emptying and peristalsis. increased viscosity and decreased water activity during hydrothermal treatment of starch could influence alpha-amylase action. using guar galactomannan as a representative of snsp, we found that galactomannan has a direct noncompetitive inhibitory effect on alpha-amylase with a k(i) value of approximately 0.5% (3.3 mum). the inhibition is not time dependent and studies suggest direct binding of the enzyme to galactomannan; the resulting galactomannan-amylase complex being inactive. processing of starch at low water levels greatly affects the catalytic efficiency of a-amylase. the k(m) value for starch heat treated in limited water is raised and k(cat) is lowered relative to starch gelatinised in excess water. since galactomannan has no effect on the k(m) of alpha-amylase, we conclude that the inhibitory action of the polymer is not secondary to a decrease in available water. neither does it seem to be a consequence of impaired diffusion of enzyme, substrate and products because of an increase in viscosity of the medium. thus, the effects of snsp in lowering postprandial glycaemia not only involve modifications of gut physiology, but also include direct inhibition of the first stage in the biochemical degradation of starch.

human_metabolism	altered metabolism is linked to the appearance of various human diseases and a better understanding of disease-associated metabolic changes may lead to the identification of novel prognostic biomarkers and the development of new therapies. genome-scale metabolic models (gems) have been employed for studying human metabolism in a systematic manner, as well as for understanding complex human diseases. in the past decade, such metabolic models - one of the fundamental aspects of systems biology - have started contributing to the understanding of the mechanistic relationship between genotype and phenotype. in this review, we focus on the construction of the human metabolic reaction database, the generation of healthy cell type- and cancer-specific gems using different procedures, and the potential applications of these developments in the study of human metabolism and in the identification of metabolic changes associated with various disorders. we further examine how in silico genome-scale reconstructions can be employed to simulate metabolic flux distributions and how high-throughput omics data can be analyzed in a context-dependent fashion. insights yielded from this mechanistic modeling approach can be used for identifying new therapeutic agents and drug targets as well as for the discovery of novel biomarkers. finally, recent advancements in genome-scale modeling and the future challenge of developing a model of whole-body metabolism are presented. the emergent contribution of gems to personalized and translational medicine is also discussed.
southern_blotting	three kpc-2-producing escherichia coli (e1, e2, and e3) were recovered from water samples of an urban river in the city of harbin, china. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. molecular characterization and genetic relatedness of the isolates were determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and pcr-directed phylotyping. plasmids were analyzed by conjugation, s1-pfge, southern blotting and pcr-based replicon typing (pbrt). the genetic environment of the bla (kpc-2) gene was determined using pcr and sequencing. pcr analyses revealed that the e1 isolate carried the bla (kpc-2), bla (cmy-2), bla (tem-1), bla (ctx-m-14), and qnrb2 genes and belonged to sequence type st410, phylogenetic type a; the e2 isolate was assigned to st131-b2 and carried the bla (kpc-2), bla (tem-1), bla (ctx-m-3), bla (dha-1), aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnrs1 genes; while the e3 isolate was of st648-d and possessed bla (kpc-2), bla (tem-1), bla (oxa-1), bla (ctx-m-15), arma, and aac(6')-ib-cr genes. pfge demonstrated that each of the three kpc-2-producing e. coli isolates exhibited an individual xbai patterns. the bla (kpc-2) gene was located on plasmids of 60-140 kb with inca/c, incn, or non-typeable replicon types. the genetic environment of bla (kpc-2) of the three strains was consistent with the genetic structure of bla (kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048.
genetics	next generation sequencing (ngs) is the emerging technology in forensic genomics laboratories. it offers higher resolution to address most problems of human identification, greater efficiency and potential ability to interrogate very challenging forensic casework samples. in this study, a trial set of dna samples was artificially degraded by progressive aqueous hydrolysis, and analyzed together with the corresponding unmodified dna sample and control sample 2800 m, to test the performance and reliability of the forenseq(tm) dna signature prep kit using the miseq sequencer (illumina). the results of replicate tests performed on the unmodified sample (1.0 ng) and on scalar dilutions (1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 ng) of the reference sample 2800 m showed the robustness and the reliability of the ngs approach even from sub-optimal amounts of high quality dna. the degraded samples showed a very limited number of reads/sample, from 2.9-10.2 folds lower than the ones reported for the less concentrated 2800 m dna dilution (0.1 ng). in addition, it was impossible to assign up to 78.2% of the genotypes in the degraded samples as the software identified the corresponding loci as low coverage (< 50x). amplification artifacts such as allelic imbalances, allele drop outs and a single allele drop in were also scored in the degraded samples. however, the forenseq(tm) dna sequencing kit, on the illumina miseq, was able to generate data which led to the correct typing of 5.1-44.8% and 10.9-58.7% of 58 of the strs and 92 snps, respectively. in all trial samples, the snp markers showed higher chances to be typed correctly compared to the strs. this ngs approach showed very promising results in terms of ability to recover genetic information from heavily degraded dna samples for which the conventional pcr/ce approach gave no results. the frequency of genetic mistyping was very low, reaching the value of 1.4% for only one of the degraded samples. however, these results suggest that further validation studies and a definition of interpretation criteria for ngs data are needed before implementation of this technique in forensic genetics.
southern_blotting	background: facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd), a common autosomal dominant muscular disorder, is caused by contraction of the d4z4 repeats on 4q35. the complicated genotype-phenotype correlation among different ethnic population remains a controversial subject. we aimed to refine this correlation in order to provide new information for genetic counseling. methods: here, a cohort of 136 chinese families including 178 affected individuals and 137 unaffected members were investigated. genetic analyses were performed using the p13e-11, 4qa and 4qb probes after pulsed field gel electrophoresis separation and southern blotting. a 10-grade fshd clinical severity scale was adopted for clinical assessment. the genotype-phenotype correlation was established by linear regression analyses. results: we observed a roughly inversed correlation between the short ecori fragment size and age-corrected clinical severity score in 154 symptomatic patients (p < 0.05). compared to male patients, a significant higher proportion of females in both asymptomatic carriers and severe patients showed larger variation in the size of short ecori fragment. a high incidence (19/42, 45.2%) of asymptomatic (or minimally affected) carriers was found in familial members. conclusions: although the number of d4z4 repeats is known as one of the critical influences on genotype-phenotype correlation, a majority of phenotypic spectrum was still incompatible with their heterozygous contraction of the d4z4 repeat, especial in female cases. our results suggest that there are multi-factors synergistically modulating the phenotypic expression.
polymerase_chain_reaction	rna-sequencing of the patient 's bone marrow detected fusion transcripts in which the coding sequence of the fam53b gene (from 10q26) was fused to a genomic sequence (from 19q13) that mapped upstream of the slc7a10 locus. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction together with sanger sequencing verified the presence of this fusion transcript. the fam53b fusion transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein. however, it may code for a truncated fam53b protein consisting of the first 302 amino acids of fam53b together with amino acids from the 19q13 sequence. functionally, the truncated fam53b would be similar to the protein encoded by the fam53b sequence with accession no. bc031654.1 (fam53b protein accession no. aah31654.1). furthermore, the truncated protein contains the entire conserved domain of the fam53 protein family. the chromosome aberration t(10;19)(q26;q13) detected in this study was previously reported in a single case of all, in which it was also the sole karyotypic change. both patients entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission following treatment.
human_metabolism	the consumption of fish and shellfish is a major route of human exposure to arsenic (as), because they contain relatively large concentrations of organoarsenicals, in particular arsenobetaine (ab). ab is considered non-toxic because of its rapid excretion from the human body. however, previous studies on human metabolism and excretion of ab have used the compound in solution rather than considering the effects that occur during the digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract. in this preliminary study, we used microcosms inoculated with human faecal matter to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of ab by microorganisms associated with the large intestine. samples were recovered over 30 days, centrifuged, filtered and the supernatant analysed for total as content and as speciation, using icp-ms and hplc-icp-ms respectively. after 7 days the total as in the supernatants from the aerobic experiment fell to a minimum of 65% of the total added, recovering to 15% less than added after 30 days. by using anion and cation exchange chromatography coupled to icp-ms detection, arsenobetaine (ab), dimethylarsinic acid (dma), dimethylarsinoylacetic acid (dmaa) and trimethylarsine oxide (tmao) were identified as degradation products. results from the aerobic system showed that after 7 days incubation the ab had been degraded to dma, dmaa and tmao and after 30 days the degraded ab reappeared in the samples. the results for the anaerobic system showed no degradation of ab over the 30 day course of the experiment. these findings demonstrate for the first time that biocatalytic capability for ab degradation exists within the human gastrointestinal tract.

molecular_biology	the present article reviews the biotechnological research in zingiber montanum (koenig) link ex a. dietr. (cassumunar ginger). studies on biotechnological interventions in this plant were focused mainly on the application of tissue culture techniques. recently, attentions are being drawn towards the genomic studies which mostly aimed at establishing the genetic relationship of different gene pools. the present review summarizes the various aspects of tissue culture protocol for in vitro micropropagation, in vitro microrhizome induction, in vitro conservation technology and molecular biology studies of this medicinal plant. this review will help in further research of this plant in areas related to tissue culture for propagation and increased production of important secondary metabolites, phylogenetic analysis and genetic engineering. moreover, it will offer an insight into crop improvement and breeding programs of this important underutilized medicinal plant for improved yield and quality of secondary metabolites.
northern_blotting	cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), the rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin (pg) biosynthesis, plays a key role in inflammation, tumorigenesis, development and circulatory homeostasis. cox-2 expression is rapidly and sensitively regulated by various stimuli, and also its regulation is distinct among cell types at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. therefore, it is important to consider these features of cox-2 expression in the reporter assays we describe in this chapter. emphasis should be made with regard to two points. firstly, cox-2 reporter assays should be evaluated by intrinsic cox-2 expression, such as rt-pcr, northern blotting, western blotting, or by pge(2) measurement. secondly, one must carefully choose several conditions in the reporter assays for experimental purposes.
genetics	hop with powdery mildew [hpm: caused by podosphaera macularis (wallr.) u. braun & s. takam.] results in significant losses in hop production by reducing yield and quality. one means of increasing yield and quality is the production of resistant hop lines. breeding for resistance can be significantly improved and accelerated by use of marker-assisted selection. the objective of this preliminary study was to identify qtls and markers for genetic resistance to hpm. a bi-parental mapping population between the resistant line ""newport'' and susceptible line '21110m'. phenotypic data was scored under controlled greenhouse conditions. significant differences among offspring were observed and disease resistance did not follow a distinct binomial distribution, suggesting quantitative genetic control. genotyping-by-sequencing resulted in approximately 375 k snp markers, which were filtered down to 2263 markers mapped to 10 linkage groups. interval mapping identified four qtls with one on linkage group 1 and three located on linkage group 6. composite interval mapping identified three qtls, all located on linkage group 6. mixed linear models identified 15 markers associated with expression of resistance to hpm. three of these 15 snps were also identified in qtl-cim analysis. evaluation of the scaffolds containing the significant snp markers identified seven putative genes-several of which appear involved in disease resistance in other plant species. the snp markers identified in this study still require validation in unrelated populations prior to implementation in breeding programs.
immunology	inflammation is a local response to infection and tissue damage mediated by activated macrophages, monocytes, and other immune cells that release cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. for a long time, humoral and cellular mechanisms have been studied for their role in regulating the immune response, but recent advances in the field of immunology and neuroscience have also unraveled specific neural mechanisms with interesting therapeutic potential. the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (cap) has been described to control innate immune responses and inflammation in a very potent manner. in the early 2000s, tracey and collaborators developed a technique that stimulates the vagus nerve and mimics the effect of the pathway. the methodology is based on the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at low voltage and frequency, in order to avoid any side effects of overstimulation, such as deregulation of heart rate variability. electrical devices for stimulation are now available, making it easy to set up the methodology in the laboratory. the goal of this research was to investigate the potential involvement of prostaglandins in the cap. unfortunately, based on earlier attempts, we failed to use the original protocol, as the induced inflammatory response either was too high or was not suitable for enzymatic metabolism properties. the different settings of the original surgery protocol remained mostly unchanged, but the conditions regarding inflammatory induction and the time point before sacrifice were improved to fit our purposes (i. e., to investigate the involvement of the cap in more limited inflammatory responses). the modified version of the original protocol, presented here, includes a longer time range between vagus nerve stimulation and analysis, which is associated with a lower induction of inflammatory responses. additionally, while decreasing the level of lipopolysaccharides (lps) to inject, we also came across new observations regarding mechanistic properties in the spleen.
southern_blotting	originally prenatal diagnosis was confined to the diagnosis of metabolic disorders and depended on assaying enzyme levels in amniotic fluid. with the development of recombinant dna technology. molecular diagnosis became possible for some genetic conditions late in the 1970s. here we briefly review the history of molecular prenatal diagnostic testing, using duchenne muscular dystrophy as an example, and describe how over the last 30 years we have moved from offering testing to a few affected individuals using techniques. such as southern blotting to identify deletions, to more rapid and accurate pcr-based testing which identities the precise change in dystrophin for a greater number of families. we discuss the potential for safer, earlier prenatal genetic diagnosis using cell free fetal dna in maternal blood before concluding by speculating on how more recent techniques, such as next generation sequencing. might further impact on the potential for molecular prenatal testing. progress is not without its challenges, and as cytogenetics and molecular genetics begin to unite into one, we foresee the main challenge will not be in identifying the genetic change, but rather in interpreting its significance. particularly in the prenatal setting where we frequently have no phenotype on which to base interpretation. copyright (c) 2010 john wiley & sons. ltd.
polymerase_chain_reaction	this study aimed to evaluate the recovery of structurally intact human norovirus (nov) during kimchi fermentation at varying temperatures. lactic acid bacteria (lab), ph, and acidity during storage and fermentation were also measured to assess the correlation between nov reduction and microbial or physicochemical property alterations. lab number, nov g titer, ph, acidity, and the ability of nov gii.4 to persist in kimchi stored at 4 degrees c and 10 degrees c (survivability) as determined using nano magnetic beads conjugated with poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride) combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification were investigated up to 28 days post inoculation. nov was detected in all test samples after 28 days although the nov recovery quantity was reduced to 1.31 (4 degrees c) and 1.66 (10 degrees c ) login genomic copies/reaction. the time required to reduce the amount of virus by 2.57 logic, (t(d)) on survival plots of nov determined using a modified weibull model was 2445 days at 4 degrees c and 138 days at 10 degrees c. these results indicate that nov from food preparation or processing is able to persistently survive in kimchi. therefore, preventing nov transmission is important for protecting kimchi against nov contamination.

southern_blotting	among microsporidia, nosema bombycis has a novel arrangement of lsurrna, ssurrna, its, igs and 5srrna. to determine the distribution of rdna among the chromosomes, we performed genome-wide screening and southern blotting with three probes (ssu, its and igs). southern blotting revealed that ribosomal rna genes are distributed on all chromosomes of n. bombycis, which is contrary to the previous result, which concluded that the n. bombycis rrna genes were limited to a single chromosome. this wide distribution is similar to that of the rdna unit of encephalitozoon cuniculi. screening of the n. bombycis genome detected 53 lsurrna elements, 43 ssurrna elements and 36 5srrna elements. however, it is still difficult to determine their loci on the chromosomes as the genomic map is unfinished.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the human leukocyte antigen (hla) system plays critical roles in regulating immune responses to various vaccines. this study aimed to evaluate the association of hla class ii gene polymorphisms and the long-term duration of anti-hbs response in children vaccinated against hepatitis b during infancy. methods: totally 297 children 5-7 years after the completion of primary vaccination against hepatitis b in infancy, without booster immunization or natural resolved infection, were enrolled. of them, 86 children with anti-hbs= 10 miu/ml were defined as long-term responders. ten alleles in hla-dr and -dq subregions were detected by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. results: the frequency of hla-dqb1*0401 was 15.1% in the long-term non- or hypo-responder group, relatively higher than 7.6% in the long-term responder group (or = 2.17, 95% ci 1.01-4.73), however, the difference had no statistical significance after bonferroni correction (p = 0.470). the frequencies of seven hla-drb1 alleles, including (*)01, (*)03, (*)04, (*)07, (*)08, (*)11, and (*)1301/1302, and two hla-dqb1 alleles, including (*)0201 and (*)0501, were each similarly distributed in the long-term non- or hypo responders and responders respectively. conclusion: none of the ten hla class ii gene alleles previously reported to be related with short-term antibody response to hepatitis b vaccine is associated with the long-term antibody response after vaccination during infantile.

enzymology	melanoma is an aggressive tumor that expresses the pigmentation enzyme tyrosinase. tyrosinase expression increases during tumorigenesis, which could allow for selective treatment of this tumor type by strategies that use tyrosinase activity. approaches targeting tyrosinase would involve gene transcription or signal transduction pathways mediated by p53 in a direct or indirect manner. two pathways are proposed for exploiting tyrosinase expression: (a) a p53-dependent pathway leading to apoptosis or arrest and (b) a reactive oxygen species-mediated induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in p53 mutant tumors. both strategies could use tyrosinase-mediated activation of quercetin, a dietary polyphenol that induces the expression of p53 and modulates reactive oxygen species. in addition to antitumor signaling properties, activation of quercetin could complement conventional cancer therapy by the induction of phase ii detoxification enzymes resulting in p53 stabilization and transduction of its downstream targets. in conclusion, recent advances in tyrosinase enzymology, prodrug chemistry, and modern chemotherapeutics present an intriguing and selective multitherapy targeting system where dietary bioflavonoids could be used to complement conventional cancer treatments.
cell_biology	natural killer (nk) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are known for their ability to kill transformed and virus-infected cells. nk cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, and studies on mouse models have revealed that nk cell development is a complex, yet tightly regulated process, which is dependent on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. the development of nk cells can be broadly categorized into two phases: lineage commitment and maturation. efforts to better define the developmental framework of nk cells have led to the identification of several murine nk progenitor populations and mature nk cell subsets, each defined by a varied set of cell surface markers. nevertheless, the relationship between some of these nk cell subsets remains to be determined. the classical approach to studying both nk cell development and function is to identify the transcription factors involved and elucidate the mechanistic action of each transcription factor. in this regard, recent studies have provided further insight into the mechanisms by which transcription factors, such as id2, foxo1, kruppel-like factor 2, and gata-binding protein 3 regulate various aspects of nk cell biology. it is also becoming evident that the biology of nk cells is not only transcriptionally regulated but also determined by epigenetic alterations and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by micrornas. this review summarizes recent progress made in nk development, focusing primarily on transcriptional regulators and their mechanistic actions.
enzymology	botryococcene biosynthesis is thought to resemble that of squalene, a metabolite essential for sterol metabolism in all eukaryotes. squalene arises from an initial condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (fpp) to form presqualene diphosphate (pspp), which then undergoes a reductive rearrangement to form squalene. in principle, botryococcene could arise from an alternative rearrangement of the presqualene intermediate. because of these proposed similarities, we predicted that a botryococcene synthase would resemble squalene synthase and hence isolated squalene synthase-like genes from botryococcus braunii race b. while b. braunii does harbor at least one typical squalene synthase, none of the other three squalene synthase-like (ssl) genes encodes for botryococcene biosynthesis directly. ssl-1 catalyzes the biosynthesis of pspp and ssl-2 the biosynthesis of bisfarnesyl ether, while ssl-3 does not appear able to directly utilize fpp as a substrate. however, when combinations of the synthase-like enzymes were mixed together, in vivo and in vitro, robust botryococcene (ssl-1+ssl-3) or squalene biosynthesis (ssl1+ssl-2) was observed. these findings were unexpected because squalene synthase, an ancient and likely progenitor to the other botryococcus triterpene synthases, catalyzes a two-step reaction within a single enzyme unit without intermediate release, yet in b. braunii, these activities appear to have separated and evolved interdependently for specialized triterpene oil production greater than 500 mya. coexpression of the ssl-1 and ssl-3 genes in different configurations, as independent genes, as gene fusions, or targeted to intracellular membranes, also demonstrate the potential for engineering even greater efficiencies of botryococcene biosynthesis.
molecular_biology	aim: to review the literature on the oral health status of the population, evidence-based understanding of epigenetic mechanisms, and its significant role in diseases occurring in the oral cavity. background: epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that does not involve changes to the underlying dna sequence. in other words, it is a change in phenotype without a change in genotype, which in turn affects the way cells read genes. epigenetic change is a regular and natural occurrence but can also be influenced by several factors including age, the environment/lifestyle, and disease state. the field of epigenetics is quickly growing, and it is believed that both the environment and lifestyle can interact with the genome to influence epigenetic change. these changes may be reflected at various stages throughout a person 's life and even in later generations. conclusion: epigenetic codes help us understand the biological phenotype that arises from the interaction of the human genome with the environment in health and in disease. epigenetics is a major turn away from molecular biology. current epigenetics not only offers new insights into gene regulation and heredity, but also it challenges the way we think about evolution, genetics, and development. most interestingly, it suggests testable mechanisms whereby environmental factors (ranging from stress to infection) can influence genetic expression.
enzymology	nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (naprt, ec 2.4.2.11) catalyzes the conversion of nicotinate (na) to nicotinate mononucleotide, the first reaction of the preiss-handler pathway for the biosynthesis of nad(+). even though naprt activity has been described to be responsible for the ability of na to increase nad(+) levels in human cells more effectively than nicotinamide (nam), so far a limited number of studies on the human naprt have appeared. here, extensive characterization of a recombinant human naprt is reported. we determined its major kinetic parameters and assayed the influence of different compounds on its enzymatic activity. in particular, atp showed an apparent dual stimulation/inhibition effect at low/high substrates saturation, respectively, consistent with a negative cooperativity model, whereas inorganic phosphate was found to act as an activator. among other metabolites assayed, including nucleotides, nucleosides, and intermediates of carbohydrates metabolism, some showed inhibitory properties, i.e. coa, several acyl-coas, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, whereas dihydroxyacetone phosphate and pyruvate exerted a stimulatory effect. furthermore, in light of the absence of crystallographic data, we performed homology modeling to predict the protein three-dimensional structure, and molecular docking simulations to identify residues involved in the recognition and stabilization of several ligands. most of these residues resulted universally conserved among naprts, and, in this study, their importance for enzyme activity was validated through site-directed mutagenesis.

molecular_biology	the aim of this study was to compare the data obtained using the new liaison (r) xl chemiluminescence system to search for hbsag, antihcv, and anti-hiv1-2/p24 ag with those obtained using the vitros system currently adopted by the microbiology unit of the hospital of legnano. routine samples of patients who were referred by practitioners for the determination of hbsag (1,000 samples) and/or anti-hcv (1,002 samples) and/or anti-hiv1-2 (995 samples) were simultaneously analyzed using both systems. the concordant positive and discordant samples were re-examined for confirmation by means of an hbsag neutralization assay, anti-hcv immunoblot, or anti-hiv1-2 western blot; hbv-dna, or hcv-rna or hiv-rna was also sought in the discordant samples. samples of patients known to be positive were tested (100 hbsag positive, 100 anti-hcv positive, and 100 hiv 1-2 positive) as well throughout treatment, with viremia levels becoming undetectable after treatment. the hbsag, anti-hcv, and anti-hiv1-2 concordance between the two systems in routine series was respectively 99.8%, 98.5% and 99.7%, and 100% for all markers in samples known positive. the various molecular biology and confirmatory tests of the discordant samples were all negative (except for one anti-hcv positive sample). measure of cohen 's kappa coefficient for hbsag, anti-hcv, and anti-hiv gave k values of respectively 0.992, 0.946, and 0.980. in conclusion, the performance of the liaison (r) xl system in the routine laboratory determination for all three markers was comparable with that of the vitros system.

southern_blotting	flavobacterium columnare, the etiological agent of columnaris disease, is one of the most important and widespread bacterial pathogens of freshwater fish. in this study, we constructed two artificial selectable markers (chloramphenicol and spectinomycin resistance) for gene transfer in f. columnare. these two new artificial selectable markers, which were created by placing the chloramphenicol or spectinomycin resistance gene under the control of the native acs regulatory region of f. columnare, were functional in both f. columnare and escherichia coli. the integrative/conjugative plasmids constructed by using these markers were introduced into f. columnare g(4) via electroporation or conjugation. the integrated plasmid dna was confirmed by southern blotting and pcr analysis. these two markers can be employed in future investigations into gene deletion and the pathogenicity of virulence factors in f. columnare.
molecular_biology	background: the immunoprecipitation (ip) assay is a valuable molecular biology tool applied across a breadth of fields. the standard assay couples ip to immunoblotting (ip/ib), a procedure severely limited as it is not easily scaled for high-throughput analysis. results: here we describe and characterize a new methodology for fast and reliable evaluation of an immunoprecipitation reaction. flip (fluorescence ip) relies on the expression of the target protein as a chromophore-tagged protein and couples ip with the measurement of fluorescent signal coating agarose beads. we show here that flip displays similar sensitivity to the standard ip/ib procedure but is amenable to high-throughput analysis. we applied flip to the screening of mouse monoclonal antibodies of unknown behavior in ip procedures. the parallel analysis of the considered antibodies using flip and ip/western shows good correlation between the two procedures. we also show application of flip using unpurified antibodies (hybridoma supernatant) and we developed a publicly available tool for the easy analysis and quantification of flip signals. conclusions: altogether, our characterizations of this new methodology show that flip is an appealing and reliable tool for any application of high-throughput ip.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the present study investigated ubiquitin specific peptidase 39 (usp39) gene knockdown on smmc-7721 cells in vitro and in vivo, and the role of usp39 in regulating the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). two small interfering rnas (sirna) were constructed, which targeted the usp39 gene and control sequences were synthesized and inserted into a pgcsil-gfp lentiviral vector. the full length of usp39 cdna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and cloned into pegfp-n2, and the recombinant plasmids were transfected into cells. knockdown efficiency and upregulation of usp39 was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and western blotting. the impact of usp39 on the growth of smmc-7721 cells in vitro was examined using an mtt assay, colony formation, flow cytometry (fcm) and immunohistochemical staining. the impact of usp39 on the growth of smmc-7721 cells in vivo was examined by assessing tumorigenicity in nude mice. western blotting was performed to examine the mechanism of usp39 regulation on smmc-7721 cell growth. recombinant vectors containing specific and scrambled usp39 sirna sequences were constructed and transfected into smmc-7721 cells. usp39 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in smmc-7721 cells, while upregulation of usp39 promoted the growth of tumor cells. fcm indicated that usp39 knockdown led to g2/m arrest and induced apoptosis in smmc-7721 cells. usp39 knockdown inhibited xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and led to the downregulation of the transcription factor forkhead box m1 (foxm1). gene expression of foxm1 targets, including polo-like kinase 1, cyclin b1 and centromere protein a also decreased following usp39 knockdown. the results suggest that knockdown of usp39 inhibits the growth of hcc in vitro and in vivo, potentially through the induction of g2/m arrest by regulating the pre-mrna splicing of foxm1.
immunology	rabbit is the third most commonly used animal model in different fields of scientific research, such as reproductive biology, fertility and embryo transfer studies, and immunology. this animal species, often used in antibodies production, has minority of scientific records about the immunological status of its reproductive organs. the aim of this study was to find histological and immunological changes in rabbit female reproductive tract during different reproductive stages. the study was carried out on female rabbits, divided in three groups, according to the following stages of reproductive cycle: estrous, ovulation and pregnancy. histological and immunohistochemical stains for t- and b-cells were performed on tissue samples of cornu uteri and cervix. t lymphocytes were predominant in all anatomical parts of the uterus, in all stages of the cycle. the highest number of those cells was recorded at estrous, while the lowest was recorded at pregnancy. cervix expressed more immunological activity than cornu uteri. the distribution and the number of immune positive cells in the rabbit female reproductive tract depend on its hormonal status.
cell_biology	prostate cancer is known to frequently recur in bone; however, how dormant cells switch its phenotype leading to recurrent tumor remains poorly understood. we have isolated two syngeneic cell lines (indolent and aggressive) through in vivo selection by implanting pc3mm stem-like cells into tibial bones. we found that indolent cells retained the dormant phenotype, whereas aggressive cells grew rapidly in bone in vivo, and the growth rates of both cells in culture were similar, suggesting a role of the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of dormancy and recurrence. indolent cells were found to secrete a high level of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc), which significantly stimulated the expression of bmp7 in bone marrow stromal cells. the secreted bmp7 then kept cancer cells in a dormant state by inducing senescence, reducing stemness, and activating dormancy-associated p38 mapk signaling and p21 expression in cancer cells. importantly, we found that sparc was epigenetically silenced in aggressive cells by promoter methylation, but 5-azacytidine treatment reactivated the expression. furthermore, high sparc promoter methylation negatively correlated with disease-free survival of prostate cancer patients. we also found that the cox2 inhibitor ns398 down-regulated dnmts and increased expression of sparc, which led to tumor growth suppression in bone in vivo. these findings suggest that sparc plays a key role in maintaining the dormancy of prostate cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.
enzymology	bioligninolysis involves living organisms and/or their products in degradation of lignin, which is highly resistant, plant-originated polymer having three-dimensional network of dimethoxylated (syringyl), monomethoxylated (guaiacyl), and non-methoxylated (p-hydroxyphenyl) phenylpropanoid and acetylated units. as a major repository of aromatic chemical structures on earth, lignin bears paramount significance for its removal owing to potential application of bioligninolytic systems in industrial production. early reports illustrating the discovery and cloning of ligninolytic biocatalysts in fungi was truly a landmark in the field of enzymatic delignification. however, the enzymology for bacterial delignification is hitherto poorly understood. moreover, the lignin-degrading bacterial genes are still unknown and need further exploration. this review deals with the current knowledge about ligninolytic enzyme families produced by fungi and bacteria, their mechanisms of action, and genetic regulation and reservations, which render them attractive candidates in biotechnological applications.
northern_blotting	porcine cfl2b gene play an important role in the muscle development and myofibrillar formation in pig. to explore whether cfl2b expression affects muscle fiber trait, the porcine cfl2b full-length cdna was amplified using homology based cdna cloning and smart race. then the full length cdna of porcine cfl2b was inserted into pegfp-n1 and transfected into c2c12 cells. the cells stably expressing cfl2b were selected by g418. we examined the expression of myhc 2x, myhc 2b and myhc1/slow in c2c12 cells stably expressing cfl2b. the results showed that the level of myhc 2x and myhc 2b mrna were dramatically increased compared with control cells, while the level of myhc1/slow mrna is not changed. to identify the transcription events of cfl2b, the porcine cfl2b mrna was detected by northern blotting, two transcripts, long transcript (3,012 bp) and short transcript (1,466 bp) were found in porcine skeletal muscles. the nucleotide sequence of cfl2b shares 88.1 and 74.9% homology with the cfl2b gene in human and mouse. the deduced amino acid sequence of cfl2b (166 amino acids) in pig shares 100, 99.1% identity with the cfl2b in human and mouse, respectively. taken together, our research revealed that porcine cfl2b may be involved in the regulation muscle fiber trait by affecting the expression of myhc.
enzymology	in eukaryotes, oxidized pufas, so-called oxylipins, are vital signaling molecules. the first step in their biosynthesis may be catalyzed by a lipoxygenase (lox), which forms hydroperoxides by introducing dioxygen into pufas. here we characterized csplox1, a phylogenetically distant lox family member from cyanothece sp. pcc 8801 and determined its crystal structure. in addition to the classical two domains found in plant, animal, and coral loxs, we identified an n-terminal helical extension, reminiscent of the long alpha-helical insertion in pseudomonas aeruginosa lox. in liposome flotation studies, this helical extension, rather than the beta-barrel domain, was crucial for a membrane binding function. additionally, csplox1 could oxygenate 1,2-diarachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, suggesting that the enzyme may act directly on membranes and that fatty acids bind to the active site in a tail-first orientation. this binding mode is further supported by the fact that csplox1 catalyzed oxygenation at the n-10 position of both linoleic and arachidonic acid, resulting in 9r- and 11r-hydroperoxides, respectively. together these results reveal unifying structural features of loxs and their function. while the core of the active site is important for lipoxygenation and thus highly conserved, peripheral domains functioning in membrane and substrate binding are more variable.
polymerase_chain_reaction	several simian adenoviruses (advs) have been detected and isolated in various species of non-human primates with the goals of monitoring the health of wildlife and investigating their potential for zoonotic disease transmission. here, we provide evidence of adv infection in wild assamese macaques (macaca assamensis assamensis) at phu khieo wildlife sanctuary, thailand, based on polymerase chain reaction of non-invasively collected fecal samples. eight out of 110 fecal samples (7.3%), or five out of 87 monkeys (5.7%), showed evidence of adv infection. all infected individuals were infants or juveniles. phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence of hexon and polymerase genes revealed two different adv genotypes. one genotype clustered in the human adv-g group, while another showed 100% identity with previously reported advs of captive chinese rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta), which may be tentatively classified as a new species of adv in non-human primates while awaiting further supporting evidence.
molecular_biology	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv), which is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea in china and other countries, is responsible for serious economic losses in the pork industry. inactivated pedv vaccine plays a key role in controlling the prevalence of pedv. however, consistently low viral titers are obtained during the propagation of pedv in vitro; this represents a challenge to molecular analyses of the virus and vaccine development. in this study, we successfully isolated a pedv isolate (strain nj) from clinical samples collected during a recent outbreak of diarrhea in piglets in china, using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (iec). we found that the isolate was better adapted to growth in iecs than in vero cells, and the titer of the iec cultures was 10(4.5) tcid50/0.1 ml at passage 45. mutations in the s protein increased with the viral passage and the mutations tended towards attenuation. viral challenge showed that the survival of iec-adapted cultures was higher at the 45th passage than at the 5th passage. the use of iecs to isolate and propagate pedv provides an effective approach for laboratory-based diagnosis of pedv, as well as studies of the epidemiological characteristics and molecular biology of this virus.
enzymology	in the spirit of gillespie 's stochastic approach we have formulated a theory to explore the advancement of the interfacial enzyme kinetics at the single enzyme level which is ultimately utilized to obtain the ensemble average macroscopic feature, lag-burst kinetics. we have provided a theory of the transition from the lag phase to the burst phase kinetics by considering the gradual development of electrostatic interaction among the positively charged enzyme and negatively charged product molecules deposited on the phospholipid surface. it is shown that the different diffusion time scales of the enzyme over the fluid and product regions are responsible for the memory effect in the correlation of successive turnover events of the hopping mode in the single trajectory analysis which again is reflected on the non-gaussian distribution of turnover times on the macroscopic kinetics in the lag phase unlike the burst phase kinetics.

northern_blotting	obesity has been linked to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, with elevated markers of systemic inflammation. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) is a transmembrane adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. in human obesity, elevated expression of the soluble form of icam-1 (sicam-1) is positively correlated with abdominal fat deposition. increases in adiposity have also been correlated with macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. here we investigate adipose tissue production and transcriptional regulation of icam-1 in a mouse model of dietary obesity. after feeding mice a high-fat diet, icam-1 expression in serum and adipose tissue was analyzed by elisa, northern blotting, real-time quantitative pcr, and flow cytometry. after 6 mo on the high-fat diet, sicam-1 levels significantly correlated with body weight and abdominal fat mass. icam-1 mrna was expressed in adipose tissue of mice, with significantly higher levels in males than females. after only 3 wk, there were adipose tissue-specific increases in mrnas for icam-1, il-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) in male mice. analysis of the stromal-vascular fraction of male adipose tissue revealed cd11b-negative cells with increased surface icam-1 and cd34. we also found two populations of f4/80+, cd11b+, icam-1+ cells, one of which also expressed cd14 and cd11c and was increased in response to a high-fat diet. these results indicate that within 3 wk on a high-fat diet, male mice exhibited significant increases in pro-inflammatory factors and immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue that may represent links between obesity and its associated inflammatory complications.
enzymology	anticoagulant heparin has been shown to possess important biological functions that vary according to its fine structure. variability within heparin 's structure occurs owing to its biosynthesis and animal tissue-based recovery and adds another dimension to its complex polymeric structure. the structural variations in chain length and sulfation patterns mediate its interaction with many heparin-binding proteins, thereby eliciting complex biological responses. the advent of novel chemical and enzymatic approaches for polysaccharide synthesis coupled with high throughput combinatorial approaches for drug discovery have facilitated an increased effort to understand heparin 's structure-activity relationships. an improved understanding would offer potential for new therapeutic development through the engineering of polysaccharides. such a bioengineering approach requires the amalgamation of several different disciplines, including carbohydrate synthesis, applied enzymology, metabolic engineering, and process biochemistry.
enzymology	in mycobacteria, polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrpss) produce complex lipidic metabolites by using a thio-template mechanism of catalysis. in this study, we demonstrate that off-loading reductase (r) domain of mycobacterial nrpss performs two consecutive [2 + 2]e(-) reductions to release thioester-bound lipopeptides as corresponding alcohols, using a nonprocessive mechanism of catalysis. the first crystal structure of an r domain from mycobacterium tuberculosis nrps provides strong support to this mechanistic model and suggests that the displacement of intermediate would be required for cofactor recycling. we show that 4e(-) reductases produce alcohols through a committed aldehyde intermediate, and the reduction of this intermediate is at least 10 times more efficient than the thioester-substrate. structural and biochemical studies also provide evidence for the conformational changes associated with the reductive cycle. further, we show that the large substrate-binding pocket with a hydrophobic platform accounts for the remarkable substrate promiscuity of these domains. our studies present an elegant example of the recruitment of a canonical short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member as an off-loading domain in the context of assembly-line enzymology.
immunology	the identification of an antigenic epitope by the immune system allows for the understanding of the protective mechanism of neutralizing antibodies that may facilitate the development of vaccines and peptide drugs. peptide scanning is a simple and efficient method that straightforwardly maps the linear epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mab). here, the authors present an epitope determination methodology involving serially truncated recombinant proteins, synthetic peptide design, and dot-blot hybridization for the antigenic recognition of nervous necrosis virus coat protein using a neutralizing mab. this technique relies on the dot-blot hybridization of synthetic peptides and mabs on a polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) membrane. the minimum antigenic region of a viral coat protein recognized by the rg-m56 mab can be narrowed down by step-by-step trimmed peptide mapping onto a 6-mer peptide epitope. in addition, alanine scanning mutagenesis and residue substitution can be performed to characterize the binding significance of each amino acid residue making up the epitope. the residues flanking the epitope site were found to play critical roles in peptide conformation regulation. the identified epitope peptide may be used to form crystals of epitope peptide-antibody complexes for an x-ray diffraction study and functional competition, or for therapeutics.
polymerase_chain_reaction	rapid methods for the detection and clinical treatment of human norovirus (hunov) are needed to control foodborne disease outbreaks, but reliable techniques that are fast and sensitive enough to detect small amounts of hunov in food and aquatic environments are not yet available. we explore the interactions between hunov and concanavalin a (con a), which could facilitate the development of a sensitive detection tool for hunov. biophysical studies including hydrogen/deuterium exchange (hdx) mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance (spr) revealed that when the metal coordinated region of con a, which spans asp16 to his24, is converted to nine alanine residues (mcon am), the affinity for hunov (gii.4) diminishes, demonstrating that this ca2+ and mn2+ coordinated region is responsible for the observed virus-protein interaction. the mutated carbohydrate binding region of con a (mcon a(cbr)) does not affect binding affinity significantly, indicating that mcr of con a is a major region of interaction to hunov (gii.4). the results further contribute to the development of a hunov concentration tool, con a-immobilized polyacrylate beads (con a-pab), for rapid detection of genotypes from genogroups i and ii (gi and gii). this method offers many advantages over currently available methods, including a short concentration time. hunov (gi and gii) can be detected in just 15 min with 90% recovery through con a-pab application. in addition, this method can be used over a wide range of ph values (ph 3.0 - 10.0). overall, this rapid and sensitive detection of hunov (cl and gii) will aid in the prevention of virus transmission pathways, and the method developed here may have applicability for other foodborne viral infections.

human_metabolism	the n-acetyl-s-(1-carbamoyl-2-hydroxy-ethyl)-l-cysteine (iso-gama) could be identified as a further human metabolite of acrylamide. in this study, we report the excretion of d(3)-iso-gama in human urine after single oral administration of deuterium labelled acrylamide (d(3)-aa). one healthy male volunteer ingested a dose of about 1 mg d(3)-aa which is equivalent to a dose of 13 mu g/kg bodyweight. over a period of 46 h the urine was collected and the d(3)-iso-gama levels analysed by lc-esi-ms/ms. the excretion of iso-gama begins five hours after application. it rises to a maximum concentration (c (max)) of 43 mu g/l which was quantified in the urine excreted after 22 h (t (max)). the excretion pattern is parallel to that of the major oxidative metabolite n-acetyl-s-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxy-ethyl)-l-cysteine (gama). total recovery of iso-gama was about 1% of the applied dose. together with n-acetyl-s-(2-carbamoylethyl)-l-cysteine (aama) and gama, 57% of the applied dose is eliminated as mercapturic acids. the elimination kinetics of the three mercapturic acids of aa are compared. we show that dietary doses of acrylamide (aa) cause an overload of detoxification via aama and lead to the formation of carcinogenic glycidamide (ga) in the human body.
human_metabolism	laxative senna products and several of their specific components have been submitted to a large number of genetic tests. while most studies gave negative responses, results from some of the studies suggest that components of senna products, particularly emodin and aloe-emodin, have genotoxic activity. assessment of the genotoxicity profile of these substances, in light of other data from animal and human metabolism or kinetic studies, human clinical trials and rodent carcinogenicity studies do not support concerns that senna laxatives pose a genotoxic risk to humans when consumed under prescribed use conditions.

polymerase_chain_reaction	octamer 4 (oct4), a member of the pit-oct-unc transcription factor family required to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, has been previously identified to be associated with tumorigenesis and malignant transformation of numerous types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). the present data shows that oct4 enhances cancer stem cell properties and increases invasion ability in the huh7 cell line. to increase understanding of the role of oct4 in hcc, the present study used a functional genomics approach and analyzed the resulting transcriptional profiles to identify oct4-dependent genes in huh7. affymetrix genechip human genome u133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to determine differential gene expression profiles and then validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. the present study found that altered expression of 673 genes (fold-change >= 2) affected multiple signaling pathways linked with self-renew and metastasis. among these differentially expressed genes, the present study noticed that the key component of the wnt signaling pathway lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (lef1) and twist family bhlh transcription factor 1 were upregulated by oct4, whilst cadherin 2 was downregulated. additional studies found that the nuclear beta-catenin aggregation was increased in oct4 overexpressed hcc cell lines. these results suggest that oct4 regulates lef1 to active lef1/beta-catenin dependent wnt signaling pathway and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. the present findings provide novel mechanistic insight into an important role of oct4 in hcc.
cell_biology	background: lake malawi cichlids represent one of a growing number of vertebrate models used to uncover the genetic and developmental basis of trait diversity. rapid evolutionary radiation has resulted in species that share similar genomes but differ markedly in phenotypes including brains and behavior, nuptial coloration and the craniofacial skeleton. research has begun to identify the genes, as well as the molecular and developmental pathways that underlie trait divergence. results: we assemble a compendium of gene expression for lake malawi cichlids, across pharyngula (the phylotypic stage) and larval stages of development, encompassing hundreds of gene transcripts. we chart patterns of expression in bone morphogenetic protein (bmp), fibroblast growth factor (fgf), hedgehog (hh), notch and wingless (wnt) signaling pathways, as well as genes involved in neurogenesis, calcium and endocrine signaling, stem cell biology, and numerous homeobox (hox) factors-in three planes using whole-mount in situ hybridization. because of low sequence divergence across the malawi cichlid assemblage, the probes we employ are broadly applicable in hundreds of species. we tabulate gene expression across general tissue domains, and highlight examples of unexpected expression patterns. conclusions: on the heels of recently published genomes, this compendium of developmental gene expression in lake malawi cichlids provides a valuable resource for those interested in the relationship between evolution and development.
immunology	biomaterial vaccines offer new capabilities that can be exploited for both infectious disease and cancer. we recently developed a novel vaccine platform based on self-assembly of immune signals into immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (ipems). these ipem vaccines are electrostatically assembled from peptide antigens and nucleic acid-based toll-like receptor agonists (tlras) that serve as molecular adjuvants. gold nanoparticles (aunps) coated with ipems stimulate effector cytokine secretion in vitro and expand antigen-specific t cells in mice. here we investigated how the dose, injection route, and choice of molecular adjuvant impacts the ability of ipems to generate t cell immunity and anti-tumor response in mice. three injection routesintradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscularand three ipem dosing levels were employed. intradermal injection induced the most potent antigen-specific t cell responses and, for all routes, the level of response was dose-dependent. we further discovered that these vaccines generate durable memory, indicated by potent, antigen-specific cd8(+) t cell recall responses in mice challenged with vaccine 49 days after a prime-boost immunization regimen. in a common exogenous antigen melanoma model, ipem vaccines slowed or stopped tumor growth more effectively than equivalent ad-mixed formulations. further, ipems containing cpga tlr9awere more potent compared with ipems containing polyic, a tlr3a. these findings demonstrate the ability of ipems to enhance response to several different classes of vaccine cargos, supporting ipems as a simple vaccine platform that mimics attractive features of other nanoparticles using immune signals that can be self-assembled or coated on substrates. biotechnol. bioeng. 2017;114: 423-431.

genetics	oenococcus oeni is a wine-associated lactic acid bacterium (lab) responsible mostly for wine malolactic fermentation (mlf). this fastidious bacterium (auxotrophic for many amino acids and slow growing) possesses remarkable adaptability to harsh physicochemical conditions and can reprogramme its metabolic pathways to enhance its survival in wine. thus, o. oeni is an instructive bacterial model for investigating stress response mechanisms in lab. however, the lack of appropriate techniques to modify the o. oeni genome has hampered molecular studies of this species. the application of recent advances in molecular genetics promises to provide a better understanding of the regulation of stress responses in this species in the future.
genetics	evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. yet only one result, fisher 's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. i argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. i suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: fisher 's average-excess equation, robertson 's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder 's equation, and fisher 's fundamental theorem. these derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. a key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.
northern_blotting	the arabidopsis thaliana bzip60 (atbzip60) transcription factor regulates stress signaling. however, its involvement in plant salt tolerance is not fully understood. in this investigation, cell suspension cultures of three different plant species: tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), rice (oryza sativa l.), and slash pine (pinus elliottii engelm.) were transformed via agrobacterium tumefaciens lba4404 harboring pbi-atbzip60deltac. integration of atbzip60deltac into the genome of tobacco, rice, or slash pine has been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, southern blotting, and northern blotting analyses. six transgenic cell lines from each of three species were used to analyze the salt tolerance conferred by the overexpression of atbzip60deltac. our results demonstrated that expression of atbzip60deltac enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic cells in all transgenic lines and that improved salt tolerance was associated with increased activities of both ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, and decreased lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). this investigation has demonstrated that the expression of atbzip60deltac gene in transgenic cell lines attenuated salt-induced oxidative damage by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the overexpression of atbzip60deltac gene could be an alternative choice for engineering plant salt tolerance.
genetics	natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (nramp) encoded by the slc11a1 gene is a membrane-associated transporter of divalent metal ions. murine slc11a1 has two known alleles, a functional slc11a1(gly169), which is found in dba2/j, nod/ltj, and 129p3/j and related mouse strains, and a non-functional slc11a1(asp169), that is found in c56bl/6j (b6) and balb/cj mice. b6 mice congenic for slc11a1(gly169) (b6-slc11a1(g169)) are markedly resistant to the intracellular pathogens salmonella, leishmania, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. we examined the host cell response and replication of francisella in b6-slc11a1(g169) mice. bone marrow-derived macrophages from either b6-slc11a1(g169) or b6 mice were both effectively invaded by francisella live vaccine strain (lvs). however, at 16 hours post-infection (hpi), the number of lvs bacteria recovered from b6 macrophages had increased roughly 100-fold, while in b6-slc11a1(g169) mice the number decreased 10-fold. when the mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) b6 mice lost significant amounts (similar to 15%) of weight, where as b6-slc11a1(g169) mice lost no weight. three days after infection in b6-slc11a1(g169) mice, we failed to recover viable francisella from the lungs, livers, or spleens. by contrast, b6 mice had bacterial burdens approaching 1x10(6) cfu/organ in all three organs. to further examine the degree of resistance imparted by slc11a1(gly169) expression, we challenged mice deficient in tlr2, tlr4, and tlr9, but expressing the functional slc11a1 (b6-slc11a1(g169) tlr2/4/9(-/-)). surprisingly, b6-slc11a1(g169) tlr2/4/9(-/-)mice had no notable weight loss. eighty percent of b6-slc11a1(g169) tlr2/4/9(-/-)mice yielded no detectable francisella in any organ tested. additionally, slc11a1(g169) produced little detectable cytokine either in the lung or serum compared to b6 mice. mice expressing slc11a1(gly169) survived even high doses (similar to 80 ld50) of lvs inoculation. these data taken together serve to highlight that functional slc11a1(gly169) can compensate the lack of tlr2/4/9. thus slc11a1 is a critical player in murine resistance to pulmonary francisella infection, but not footpad infection.
polymerase_chain_reaction	invasive candidiasis remains one of the most serious community and healthcare-acquired infections worldwide. conventional candida detection methods based on blood and plate culture are time-consuming and require at least 2-4 days to identify various candida species. despite considerable advances for candidiasis detection, the development of simple, compact and portable point-of-care diagnostics for rapid and precise testing that automatically performs cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, purification and detection still remains a challenge. here, we systematically review most prominent conventional and nonconventional techniques for the detection of various candida species, including candida staining, blood culture, serological testing and nucleic acid-based analysis. we also discuss the most advanced lab on a chip devices for candida detection.
cell_biology	advances in understanding adult stem cell biology have facilitated the development of novel cell-based therapies for cancer. recent developments in conventional therapies (eg, tumor resection techniques, chemotherapy strategies, and radiation therapy) for treating both metastatic and primary tumors in the brain, particularly glioblastoma have not resulted in a marked increase in patient survival. preclinical studies have shown that multiple stem cell types exhibit inherent tropism and migrate to the sites of malignancy. recent studies have validated the feasibility potential of using engineered stem cells as therapeutic agents to target and eliminate malignant tumor cells in the brain. this review will discuss the recent progress in the therapeutic potential of stem cells for tumors in the brain and also provide perspectives for future preclinical studies and clinical translation.
immunology	it is possible that during long lasting chronic infections such as tuberculosis (tb) and leprosy individuals who generate a stronger immune response will produce a chronic shift in the systemic levels of inflammatory proteins. consequently, the systemic immunological shift could affect inflammatory responses against other persistent pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease (pd). objectiveto determine if in vitro exposure to mycobacterium tuberculosis or m. leprae lysates impacts subsequent immune responses to p. gingivalis; and to propose a new dialogue between experimental immunology and paleopathology. material and methodswe sequentially (2 days protocol) exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy donors to bacterial lysates either from m. tuberculosis, or m. leprae, or p. gingivalis. after collecting all supernatants, we measured the expression of immune proteins tnf and ifn using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. resultsearly exposure (day 1) of pbmcs to m. leprae or m. tuberculosis lysates induces an inflammatory shift detected by the increase of tnf and ifn when the same cells are subsequently (day 2) exposed to oral pathogen p. gingivalis. discussionby extrapolating these results, we suggest that chronic infections, such as tb and leprosy, could generate a systemic immunological shift that can affect other inflammatory processes such the one present in pd. we propose that the presence and severity of pd should be explored as a proxy for inflammatory status or competence when reconstructing the health profile in past populations.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: sensitive methods for detecting asymptomatic malaria infections are essential for identifying potential transmission reservoirs and obtaining an accurate assessment of malaria epidemiology in low-endemicity areas aiming to eliminate malaria. pcr techniques to detect parasite nucleic acids (dna or rna) are among the most commonly used molecular methods. however, most of these methods are of low throughput and cannot be used for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies. a recently developed capture and ligation probe-pcr (clip-pcr) is claimed to have the sensitivity of molecular techniques and the high throughput capacity needed for screening purposes. this study aimed to compare several molecular methods for detecting asymptomatic and submicroscopic plasmodium infections in healthy residents of a malaria-hypoendemic region in southeast asia, where malaria elimination is in sight. method: this study compared three molecular detection methods side-by-side, namely nested pcr targeting the rrna genes, nested rt-pcr to detect parasite rrna, and clip-pcr to detect parasite rrna in 1005 healthy individuals in northeastern myanmar. for nested pcr and rt-pcr, parasite dna and total rna were extracted from similar to 100 mu l of blood, whereas rna used for clip-pcr was from a 3 mm disk of dried blood filter paper. the sensitivity and specificity of these methods were compared with those of conventional light microscopy. in addition, rt-pcr and quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) targeting the pvs25 gene in plasmodium vivax were used to assess gametocyte prevalence in the samples. results: light microscopy detected plasmodium infections in only 1.19% of the residents harbouring the parasites. clip-pcr had slightly better performance and detected plasmodium infections in 1.89% of the population. further improvement was achieved by nested pcr to detect parasite dna, which detected p.vivax and plasmodium falciparum infections in 2.39% of the residents. the nested rt-pcr targeting rrna, however, detected as many as 187 (18.61%) individuals having plasmodium infections with p. vivax being the predominant species (176 p. vivax, 5 p. falciparum and 6 p. falciparum/p.vivax mixed infections). of the 210 plasmodium-positive samples detected by all molecular methods, 115 were pvs25-positive by qrt-pcr, indicating that a large proportion of asymptomatic individuals were gametocyte carriers. conclusion: nested rt-pcr based on the detection of asexual-stage parasite rrna was the most sensitive, with a more than sixfold higher sensitivity than the other two molecular methods of parasite detection. clip-pcr has an increased throughput, but its sensitivity in this study was much lower than those of other molecular methods, which may be partially due to the smaller amount of rna input used.
cell_biology	purpose of review the purpose of the present review is to provide an update on the current development in the field of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) and their potential use in the prevention and therapeutic settings, and an evaluation of the b-cell abnormalities that may impair antibody responses in hiv infection. recent findings major advances have been achieved in the characterization of bnabs directed against different vulnerable regions of hiv envelope (env). recent observations have clearly demonstrated the ability of bnabs to prevent hiv infection in the nonhuman primate model of hiv infection and to suppress viremia in individuals with chronic hiv infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. furthermore, substantial advances have also been obtained in the development of hiv env proteins and immunization strategies inducing bnabs in small animal models. several studies have also shed light on the b-cell abnormalities associated with the viremic phase of hiv infection that cause impaired b-cell maturation and antibody responses. of note, preliminary observations have provided evidence for a correlation between the expansion of a specific population of b cells, for example, germinal center b cells, the expansion of t follicular helper cells (tfh), and the generation of neutralizing antibodies. summary the recent observations on the antiviral effects of bnabs in vivo indicate that bnabs may play a central role in both the prevention and the therapeutic settings. the identification of the role of germinal center b cells and tfh cells as critical components of the immune response leading to the generation of neutralizing antibodies, will allow the development of specific immunization strategies for the stimulation of germinal center b cells and tfh cells. a lot of work still remains to be done for the delineation of b-cell and tfh cell biology from human lymphoid tissues and in the development of hiv env proteins and immunization strategies leading to the generation of bnabs.
molecular_biology	the reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes. this knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. on the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on ppis. based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the ppi and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. in particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application. their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown, and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis.
enzymology	gangliosides are important signaling molecules in the cell membrane and are processed by several enzymes. deficiencies in these enzymes can cause human lysosomal storage diseases. building an understanding of the pathways of glycosphingolipid catabolism requires methods for the analysis of these enzymatic activities agm3-derived fret probe was synthesized chemoenzymatically for the detection and quantitation of a range of ganglioside-degrading enzymes, both in cell lysates and in living cells. this is the first substrate that enables the ratiometric fluorogenic assay of sphingolipid ceramide ndeacylase and endoglycoceramidase and can detect and localize neuraminidase activity in living cells. it is therefore a valuable tool for building a better understanding of membrane-confined enzymology. it also enables the robust and reliable assay of ganglioside-degrading enzymes in a microtiter plate, thus opening the door to screening for novel or engineered biocatalysts or for new inhibitors.
polymerase_chain_reaction	some species of the arcobacter genus are considered emerging foodborne and waterborne en. however, the presence of arcobacter spp. in vegetables very little is known, because most studies have focused on foods of animal origin. on the other hand, quinolones are considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of infection by campylobacteria in human patients, but few data are currently available about the resistance levels to these antibiotics among arcobacter species. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of arcobacters isolated from fresh vegetables such as lettuces, spinaches, chards and cabbages. resistance to quinolones of the isolates was also investigated. one hundred fresh vegetables samples purchased from seven local retail markets in valencia (spain) during eight months were analysed. the study included 41 lettuces, 21 spinaches, 34 chards and 4 cabbages. samples were analysed by culture and by molecular methods before and after enrichment. by culture, 17 out of 100 analysed samples were arcobacter positive and twenty-five isolates were obtained from them. direct detection by pcr was low, with only 4% arcobacter spp. positive samples. this percentage increased considerably, up 20%, after 48 h enrichment. by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp), 17 out of the 25 isolates were identified as a. butzleri and 8 as a. cryaerophilus. only two a. butzleri isolates showed resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. the sequencing of a fragment of the qrdr region of the gyra gene from the quinolones-resistant isolates revealed the presence of a mutation in position 254 of this gene (c-t transition). this study is the first report about the presence of pathogenic species of arcobacter spp. in chards and cabbages and confirms that fresh vegetables can act as transmission vehicle to humans. moreover, the presence of a. butzleri quinolone resistant in vegetables could pose a potential public health risk.

cell_biology	phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated (mek) signaling are central to the survival and proliferation of many cell types. multiple lines of investigation in murine models have shown that control of the pi3k pathway is particularly important for regulatory t cell (treg) stability and function. pi3k and mek inhibitors are being introduced into the clinic, and we hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of pi3k, and possibly mek, in mixed cultures of human mononuclear cells would preferentially affect cd4(+) and cd8(+) lymphocytes compared with tregs. we tested this hypothesis using four readouts: proliferation, activation, functional suppression, and signaling. results showed that tregs were less susceptible to inhibition by both and isoform-specific pi3k inhibitors and by an mek inhibitor compared with their conventional cd4(+) and cd8(+) counterparts. these studies suggest less functional reliance on pi3k and mek signaling in tregs compared with conventional cd4(+) and cd8(+) lymphocytes. therefore, the pi3k and mek pathways are attractive pharmacologic targets for transplantation and treatment of autoimmunity. in vitro agents that block the pi-3 kinase and/or mek pathways preferentially block nonregulatory t cells, relatively sparing regulatory t cells, suggesting that these pathways may be attractive targets in transplantation.
cell_biology	limbal stemcell (lsc) deficiency is a visually debilitating condition caused by abnormal maintenance of lscs. it is treated by transplantation of donor-derived limbal epithelial cells (lecs), the success of which depends on the presence and quality of lscs with in the transplant. understanding the immunobiological responses of these cells within the transplants could improve cell engraftment and survival. however, human corneal rings used as a source of lscs are not always readily available for research purposes. as an alternative, we hypothesized that a human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial cell (htcec) line could be used as a model for studying lsc immunobiology. htcec constitutively expressed human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i but not class ii molecules. however, when stimulated by interferon-gamma, htcecs then expressed hla class ii antigens. some htcecs were also migratory in response to cxcl12 and expressed stem cell markers, nanog, oct4, and sox2. in addition because both htcecs and lecs contain side population (sp) cells, which are an enriched lsc population, we used these sp cells to show that some htcec sp cells coexpressed abcg2 and abcb5. htcec sp and non-side population (nsp) cells also expressed cxcr4, but the sp cells expressed higher levels. both were capable of colony formation, but the nsp colonies were smaller and contained fewer cells. in addition, htcecs expressed delta np63 alpha. these results suggest the htcecline is a useful model for further understanding lscbiology by using an in vitro approach without reliance on a supply of human tissue.
northern_blotting	we used pcr-based methods to clone and sequence four previously unidentified cellulase cdnas: cbhi-i, cbhi-ii, cbhii-i and egii. cbhi-i, cbhi-ii and cbhii-i consist of 1710, 1610 and 1453 bp, respectively, and encode for 512, 458 and 442 amino acids, respectively. egii consists of 1180bp encoding for 310 amino acids, and belongs to family 61 of the glycosyl hydrolases. cbhi-i, cbhii-i and egii all have a modular structure, with the catalytic domain (cd) and cellulose-binding domain (cbd) located at the c-terminus in cbhi-i and egii, and at the n-terminus in cbhii-i. cbhi-ii shows high homology to cbhi-i but lacks a cbd. northern blotting revealed that cbhi-i, cbhi-ii and cbhii-i were coordinately expressed at various stages of the mushroom developmental cycle (substrate colonization to mature fruit body), although the number of cbhi-i transcripts was much smaller. no egii expression was detectable during the substrate colonization phase but transcription levels increased as fruit body morphogenesis progressed.
immunology	group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ilc3), defined by expression of the transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t, play key roles in the regulation of inflammation and immunity in the gastrointestinal tract and associated lymphoid tissues. ilc3 consist largely of two major subsets, ncr+ ilc3 and lti-like ilc3, but also demonstrate significant plasticity and heterogeneity. recent advances have begun to dissect the relationship between ilc3 subsets and to define distinct functional states within the intestinal tissue microenvironment. in this review we discuss the ever-expanding roles of ilc3 in the context of intestinal homeostasis, infection and inflammation - with a focus on comparing and contrasting the relative contributions of ilc3 subsets.
molecular_biology	background/purpose: mutations in the tet oncogene family member 2 gene (tet2) are frequently found in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml). reports of tet2 mutations in children are limited. we assessed the prevalence of tet2 mutations in taiwanese children with aml and analyzed their prognosis. methods: between 1997 and 2010, a total of 69 consecutive children with aml were enrolled at the national taiwan university hospital. the analysis for tet2 mutations was performed using direct sequencing. clinical characteristics and overall survival (os) were compared between patients with and without tet2 alterations. results: intronic and missense mutations were identified. no nonsense or frameshift mutations were observed. two putative disease-causing missense mutations (s609c and a1865g) were identified in one patient. we estimated the prevalence of tet2 mutations in the current patient population to be 1.4%. the most common polymorphism was i1762v (45%), followed by v218m (12%), p29r (6%), and f868l (6%). patients with polymorphism i1762v had an increased 10-year survival rate compared with patients without i1762v (48.4% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.049) by chi-square test; os was not different when examined using the kaplan-meier method (p = 0.104). conclusion: the prevalence of tet2 mutations in children with aml compared with adults with aml was lower and less complex. patient prognosis associated with tet2 mutations in children requires further investigation. copyright (c) 2015, formosan medical association. published by elsevier taiwan llc.
genetics	background: the taxonomic status of the brown dog tick rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu stricto) is a subject of ongoing debate; there is a consensus that populations of this tick species should be referred to as r. sanguineus (sensu lato) until its taxonomic status is resolved. recent genetic studies revealed the existence of more than one lineage of r. sanguineus (s.l.) in temperate countries. in this study, we assessed the genetic identity of ticks collected from rural dogs living in several areas located in all major geographical regions of portugal. methods: a total of 347 ticks were collected from rural dogs living in different regions of portugal. these ticks were morphologically identified and partial mitochondrial 16s rrna gene sequences (similar to 300 bp) were obtained from representative specimens. results: the ticks were morphologically identified as ixodes ricinus (seven males and 27 females), rhipicephalus bursa (one male), rhipicephalus pusillus (one female) and r. sanguineus (s.l.) (two larvae, 101 nymphs, 108 males and 100 females). partial mitochondrial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from 58 r. sanguineus (s.l.) specimens, and all of them were genetically identified as belonging to the so-called temperate lineage of r. sanguineus (s.l.) conclusions: these results strongly suggest that the temperate species of r. sanguineus (s.l.) is the only representative of this tick group found on dogs in portugal. it also adds weight to the hypothesis that rhipicephalus turanicus is not present in this country, although further investigations are necessary to confirm this.
molecular_biology	protein-protein interactions are fundamental for virtually all functions of the cell. a large fraction of these interactions involve short peptide motifs, and there has been increased interest in targeting them using peptide-based therapeutics. peptides benefit from being specific, relatively safe, and easy to produce. they are also easy to modify using chemical synthesis and molecular biology techniques. however, significant challenges remain regarding the use of peptides as therapeutic agents. identification of peptide motifs is difficult, and peptides typically display low cell permeability and sensitivity to enzymatic degradation. in this review, we outline the principal highthroughput methodologies for motif discovery and describe current methods for overcoming pharmacokinetic and bioavailability limitations.
human_metabolism	aims/hypothesis: we investigated the effects of rosiglitazone on nefa and triglyceride metabolism in type 2 diabetes. methods: in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of rosiglitazone in diet-treated type 2 diabetic subjects, we measured arteriovenous differences and tissue blood flow in forearm muscle and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, used stable isotope techniques, and analysed gene expression. responses to a mixed meal containing [ 1,1,1- c-13] tripalmitin were assessed. results: rosiglitazone induced insulin sensitisation without altering fasting nefa concentrations (- 6.6%, p= 0.16). postprandial nefa concentrations were lowered by rosiglitazone compared with placebo (- 21%, p= 0.04). adipose tissue nefa release was not decreased in the fasting state by rosiglitazone treatment (+ 24%, p= 0.17) and was associated with an increased fasting hormone-sensitive lipase rate of action (+ 118%, p= 0.01). postprandial triglyceride concentrations were decreased by rosiglitazone treatment (- 26%, p< 0.01) despite unchanged fasting concentrations. rosiglitazone did not change concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants. adipose tissue blood flow increased with rosiglitazone (+ 32%, p= 0.03). postprandial triglyceride [c-13] palmitic acid concentrations were unchanged, whilst nefa [c-13] palmitic acid concentrations were decreased (p= 0.04). in muscle, hexokinase ii mrna expression was increased by rosiglitazone (+ 166%, p= 0.001) whilst the expression of genes involved in insulin signalling was unchanged. adipose tissue expression of fabp4, lpl and fat/cd36 was increased. conclusions/interpretation: rosiglitazone decreases postprandial nefa and triglyceride concentrations. this may represent decreased spillover of nefas from adipose tissue depots. decreased delivery of nefas to the liver may lead to lowered postprandial triglyceride concentrations. upregulation of hexokinase ii expression in muscle may contribute to insulin sensitisation by rosiglitazone.
genetics	despite extensive genetics and breeding research, effective control of leaf rust caused by puccinia triticina eriks. and an important foliar disease of wheat, has not been achieved. this is mainly due to the widespread use of race-specific seedling resistance genes, which are rapidly overcome by new virulent races. there is increased emphasis now on the use of race-nonspecific adult plant resistance (apr) genes for durable control of leaf rust. the objective of this study was the evaluation of aegilops tauschii coss. (the d-genome donor of bread wheat) for apr, previously known to be a rich source of seedling resistance genes to leaf rust. a geographically diverse collection of a. tauschii maintained by the wheat genetics resource center was evaluated for apr in the field with a leaf rust composite culture of predominant races. out of a total of 371 a. tauschii accessions, 50 with low to moderate levels of disease severity were subsequently tested at the seedling stage in the greenhouse with four races and one composite culture of leaf rust. nine accessions displayed moderate resistance to one or more races of leaf rust at the seedling stage. the remaining 41 seedling-susceptible accessions are potential sources of new apr genes. accessions from afghanistan only displayed apr whereas both seedling resistance and apr were common in the caspian sea region (iran and azerbaijan). the apr in these newly identified a. tauschii accessions will be further characterized for novelty, effectiveness, and race-specificity.
cell_biology	brucella species are facultative intracellular pathogens that infect animals as their natural hosts. transmission to humans is most commonly caused by direct contact with infected animals or by ingestion of contaminated food and can lead to severe chronic infections. brucella can invade professional and non-professional phagocytic cells and replicates within endoplasmic reticulum (er)-derived vacuoles. the host factors required for brucella entry into host cells, avoidance of lysosomal degradation, and replication in the er-like compartment remain largely unknown. here we describe two assays to identify host factors involved in brucella entry and replication in hela cells. the protocols describe the use of rna interference, while alternative screening methods could be applied. the assays are based on the detection of fluorescently labeled bacteria in fluorescently labeled host cells using automated wide-field microscopy. the fluorescent images are analyzed using a standardized image analysis pipeline in cellprofiler which allows single cell-based infection scoring. in the endpoint assay, intracellular replication is measured two days after infection. this allows bacteria to traffic to their replicative niche where proliferation is initiated around 12 hr after bacterial entry. brucella which have successfully established an intracellular niche will thus have strongly proliferated inside host cells. since intracellular bacteria will greatly outnumber individual extracellular or intracellular non-replicative bacteria, a strain constitutively expressing gfp can be used. the strong gfp signal is then used to identify infected cells. in contrast, for the entry assay it is essential to differentiate between intracellular and extracellular bacteria. here, a strain encoding for a tetracycline-inducible gfp is used. induction of gfp with simultaneous inactivation of extracellular bacteria by gentamicin enables the differentiation between intracellular and extracellular bacteria based on the gfp signal, with only intracellular bacteria being able to express gfp. this allows the robust detection of single intracellular bacteria before intracellular proliferation is initiated.
molecular_biology	background: appendiceal cancers are rare and consist of carcinoid, mucocele, pseudomyxoma peritonei (pmp), goblet cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma histologies. current treatment involves surgical resection or debulking, but no standard exists for adjuvant chemotherapy or treatment for metastatic disease. methods: samples were identified from approximately 60,000 global tumors analyzed at a referral molecular profiling clia-certified laboratory. a total of 588 samples with appendix primary tumor sites were identified (male/female ratio of 2: 3; mean age =55). sixty-two percent of samples were adenocarcinomas (used for analysis); the rest consisted of 9% goblet cell, 15% mucinous; 6% pseudomyxoma, and less than 5% carcinoids and 2% neuroendocrine. tests included sequencing [sanger, next generation sequencing (ngs)], protein expression/ immunohistochemistry (ihc), and gene amplification [fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) or cish]. results: profiling across all appendiceal cancer histological subtypes for ihc revealed: 97% brcp, 81% mrp1, 81% cox-2, 71% mgmt, 56% topo1, 5% pten, 52% egfr, 40% ercc1, 38% sparc, 35% pdgfr, 35% topo2a, 25% rrm1, 21% ts, 16% ckit, and 12% for tle3. ngs revealed mutations in the following genes: 50.4% kras, 21.9% p53, 17.6% gnas, 16.5% smad4, 10% apc, 7.5% atm, 5.5% pik3ca, 5.0% fbxw7, and 1.8% braf. conclusions: appendiceal cancers show considerable heterogeneity with high levels of drug resistance proteins (bcrp and mrp1), which highlight the difficulty in treating these tumors and suggest an individualized approach to treatment. the incidence of low ts (79%) could be used as a backbone of therapy (using inhibitors such as 5fu/capecitabine or newer agents). therapeutic options includetopo1 inhibitors (irinotecan/topotecan), egfr inhibitors (erlotinib, cetuximab), pdgfr antagonists (regorafenib, axitinib), mgmt (temozolomide). clinical trials targeting pathways involving kras, p53, gnas, smad4, apc, atm, pik3ca, fbxw7, and braf may be also considered. overall, appendiceal cancers have similar patterns in their molecular profile to pancreatic cancers (can we say this, any statistical analysis done?) and have differential expression from colorectal cancers. these findings indicate the need to evaluate patient samples for patterns in marker expression and alteration, in order to better understand the molecular biology and formulate a personalized therapy approach in these difficult to treat cancers (supported by a grant from caris life sciences).
genetics	background: substance use and misuse and suicidal thoughts and behaviors tend to co-occur. the purpose of this study was to examine whether (a) suicidal ideation and attempt are related to onset of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use and dependence; (b) early use of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis is associated with onset of suicidal ideation and attempt; and (c) whether these associations persist while controlling for covariates, such as family history of alcohol problems, major depression and other internalizing and externalizing disorders. methods: the prospective cohort of the collaborative study of the genetics of alcoholism (coga; n=3277) was used. cross-sectional and discrete time logistic regression (i.e. survival) analyses examined associations between suicidal ideation and attempt and onset of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use and dependence. survival models also examined whether individual early substance use was related to onset of ideation and attempt. results: ideation was related to 0.71-0.77 odds of onset of subsequent alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use. attempt was associated with 1.44-1.61 odds of later alcohol, nicotine and cannabis dependence, even after accounting for covariates. evidence for early substance use being related to subsequent onset of ideation or attempt was limited. several sex and race differences emerged. limitations: the sample was ascertained for family history of alcoholism; not all participants had been followed up allowing for censored observations; reporting bias. conclusion: suicide attempts are associated with increased likelihood of onset of substance dependence.
genetics	environmental dna (edna) comprises dna fragments that have been shed into the environment by organisms, and which can be extracted from environmental samples such as water or soil. characterization of edna can allow researchers to infer the presence or absence of species from a particular site without the need to locate and identify individuals, and therefore may provide an extremely valuable tool for quantifying biodiversity. however, as is often the case with relatively new protocols, methodological challenges remain. a number of earlier reviews have discussed these challenges, but none have provided extensive treatment of the critical decisions surrounding molecular markers and primer development for use in edna assays. this review discusses a number of options and approaches that can be used when determining which primers and gene regions are most appropriate for either targeted species detection or metabarcoding macro-organisms from edna. the latter represents a new field that is growing rapidly, and which has the potential to revolutionize future assessments of community and ecosystem diversity.
genetics	michelia yunnanensis franch., is a traditional ornamental, aromatic, and medicinal shrub that endemic to yunnan province in southwest china. although the species has a large distribution pattern and is abundant in yunnan province, the populations are dramatically declining because of overexploitation and habitat destruction. studies on the genetic variation and demography of endemic species are necessary to develop effective conservation and management strategies. to generate such knowledge, we used 3 pairs of universal cpdna markers and 10 pairs of microsatellite markers to assess the genetic diversity, genetic structure, and demographic history of 7 m. yunnanensis populations. we calculated a total of 88 alleles for 10 polymorphic loci and 10 haplotypes for a combined 2,089 bp of cpdna. m. yunnanensis populations showed high genetic diversity (ho = 0.551 for nuclear markers and hd = 0.471 for cpdna markers) and low genetic differentiation (f-st = 0.058). geographical structure was not found among m. yunnanensis populations. genetic distance and geographic distance were not correlated (p >0.05), which indicated that geographic isolation is not the primary cause of the low genetic differentiation of m. yunnanensis. additionally, m. yunnanensis populations contracted similar to 20,000-30,000 years ago, and no recent expansion occurred in current populations. results indicated that the high genetic diversity of the species and within its populations holds promise for effective genetic resource management and sustainable utilization. thus, we suggest that the conservation and management of m. yunnanensis should address exotic overexploitation and habitat destruction.
northern_blotting	background and objectives: calprotectin, a heterodimer of s100a8 and s100a9 with antimicrobial properties, is expressed in gingival keratinocytes and plays an important role in innate immunity. because calprotectin expression is localized in the spinous cell layer of the gingival epithelium, we hypothesized that the expression of calprotectin in keratinocytes is related to the differentiation stage. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between calprotectin expression and keratinocyte differentiation using some factors that regulated its differentiation. material and methods: normal human gingival keratinocytes were isolated from gingival tissues obtained at the extraction of wisdom teeth, and were cultured in serum-free keratinocyte medium supplemented with interleukin-1 alpha or calcium, which promote keratinocyte differentiation, and transforming frowth factor-beta (tgf-beta) or retinoic acid, which suppress its differentiation. the expression of s100a8/a9 mrna and the production of calprotectin in normal human gingival keratinocytes were examined by northern blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. the expression of cytokeratin 14, involucrin and filaggrin (marker proteins of keratinocyte differentiation) was investigated by immunohistochemical staining, and the dna-binding activity of ccaat/enhancer binding protein alpha (c/ebp alpha), a transcription factor, was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. results: the expression of s100a8/a9 mrna and the production of calprotectin were increased by interleukin-1 alpha and calcium, but decreased by tgf-beta. ra inhibited the expression of s100a8/a9 and keratinocyte differentiation, which were induced by interleukin-1 alpha. c/ebp alpha dna-binding activity in normal human gingival keratinocytes was enhanced by interleukin-1 alpha and calcium, but suppressed by tgf-beta. conclusion: the present study suggests that calprotectin expression is related to keratinocyte differentiation and that c/ebp alpha is a regulator of calprotectin expression in keratinocytes.
immunology	middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (mers-cov) is transmitted via the respiratory tract and causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome by infecting lung epithelial cells and macrophages. macrophages can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it. mers-cov infects cells via its spike (s) glycoprotein that binds on dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (dpp4) receptor present on macrophages. whether this spike/dpp4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown. herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with mers-cov s glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce tnfa and il-6 in naive and lps-activated thp-1 macrophages and augmented lps-induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine il-10. mers-cov s glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of tlr signaling irak-m as well as of the transcriptional repressor ppar gamma. inhibition of dpp4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or sirna abrogated the effects of mers-cov s glycoprotein on irak-m, ppar gamma and il-10, confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by dpp4 receptor. the effect was observed both in thp-1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes. these findings support a dpp4-mediated suppressive action of mers-cov in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity.
enzymology	the microtubule (mt) cytoskeleton supports a broad range of cellular functions, from providing tracks for intracellular transport, to supporting movement of cilia and flagella, to segregating chromosomes in mitosis. these functions are facilitated by the organizational and dynamic plasticity of mt networks. an important class of enzymes that alters mt dynamics is the depolymerizing kinesin-like proteins, which use their catalytic activities to regulate mt end dynamics. in this review, we discuss four topics surrounding these mt-depolymerizing kinesins. we provide a historical overview of studies focused on these motors and discuss their phylogeny. in the second half, we discuss their enzymology and biophysics and give an overview of their known cellular functions. this discussion highlights the fact that mt-depolymerizing kinesins exhibit a diverse range of design principles, which in turn increases their functional versatility in cells.
northern_blotting	objective: to determine the role of dkkl1 in mouse development, viability, and fertility. design: prospective experimental study. setting: government research institution. animal(s): mice of c57bl/6. b6d2f1/j, and 129x1/svj strains, as well as transgenic mice of mixed c57bl/6 and 129x1/svj strains were used for the studies. intervention(s): expression of the dkkl1 gene was characterized during early mouse development, and the effects of dkkl1 ablation on reproduction and fertility were characterized in vitro and in vivo. main outcome measure(s): dkkl1 rna expression was determined by northern blotting hybridization as well as quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. in vitro fertilization assays were used to assess fertility of sperm from male mice lacking functional dkkl1. result(s): dkkl1 is a gene unique to mammals that is expressed primarily in developing spermatocytes and its product localized in the acrosome of mature sperm. here we show that dkkl1 also is expressed in the trophectoderm/placental lineage. surprisingly, embryos lacking dkkl1 protein developed into viable, fertile adults. nevertheless, the ability of sperm that lacked dkkl1 protein to fertilize wild-type eggs was severely compromised in vitro. because this defect could be overcome either by removal of the zona pellucida or by the presence of wild-type sperm. dkkl1, either directly or indirectly, facilitates the ability of sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida. penetration of the zona pellucida by dkkl1 sperm was delayed in vivo as well as in vitro, but the delay in vivo was compensated by other factors during preimplantation development. accordingly, dkkl1 i males offer an in vitro fertilization model for identifying factors that may contribute to infertility. conclusion(s): dkkl1 is a mammalian-specific, acrosomal protein that strongly affects in vitro fertilization, although the effect is attenuated in vivo.

polymerase_chain_reaction	natural killer (nk) cell activity is regulated by activating and inhibitory signals transduced by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir). diversity in kir gene repertoire among individuals may affect disease outcome. sepsis development and severity may be influenced by genetic factors affecting the immune response. here, we examined sixteen kir genes and their human leucocyte antigen (hla) class i ligands in critical patients, aiming to identify patterns that could be associated with sepsis. male and female patients (ages ranging between 14 and 94 years-old) were included. dna samples from 211 patients with sepsis and 60 controls (critical care patients with no sepsis) collected between 2004 and 2010 were included and genotyped for kir genes using the polymerase chain reaction method with sequence-specific oligonucleotide (pcr-sso), and for hla genes using the polymerase chain reaction method with sequence-specific primers (pcr-ssp). the frequencies of activating kir2ds1 and kir3ds1 in sepsis patients when compared to controls were 41.23% versus 55.00% and 36.49% versus 51.67% (p = 0.077 and 0.037 respectively before bonferroni correction). these results indicate that activating kir genes 2ds1 and 3ds1 may more prevalent in critical patients without sepsis than in patients with sepsis, suggesting a potential protective role of activating kir genes in sepsis.

molecular_biology	the process of curing a patient by removing his illness by extracting blood is a very old one. many years ago, phlebotomy was practiced to cure illness. now, this old process, placed on a rational basis with therapeutic apheresis (ta), is being followed in clinical practice. therapeutic plasma exchange (tpe) with hollow fiber modules has been used in different severe diseases for more than 40 years. based on many years of experience with the extracorporeal circulation in end-stage renal disease, the authors herein give an overview of ta in immunological diseases, especially in hematologic, autoimmune and dermatologic diseases. updated information on immunology and molecular biology of different immunological diseases is discussed in relation to the rationale for apheresis therapy and its place in combination with other modern therapies. with the introduction of novel and effective biologic agents, ta is indicated only in severe cases, such as in rapid progression despite immunosuppressive therapy and/or biologic agents. in mild forms of autoimmune disease, treatment with immunosuppressive therapies and/or biologic agents seems to be sufficient. the prognosis of autoimmune diseases with varying organ manifestations has improved in recent years, due in part to very aggressive therapy schemes. for the immunological diseases that can be treated with ta, the guidelines of the german working group of clinical nephrology and of the apheresis applications committee of the american society for apheresis are cited. ta has been shown to effectively remove the autoantibodies from blood and lead to rapid clinical improvement.
human_metabolism	this review is focused on creatine (cr) (methyl guanidine acetic acid) and its application in the form of a dietary supplement. it has been especially utilized by athletes, but its pronounced therapeutic potential is also discussed in the present article. it is supposed that human body uses cr for the formation of creatine phosphate (pcr), which is necessary for muscular work as a source of energy. the effects of supplemented cr on dynamics of methionine cycle and other related metabolic pathways have not been fully explained yet. the review is focused on the description of affects caused by its application on human body and metabolism. already the application of small amounts of cr rapidly increases levels of thiodiglycolic acid (tdga) in urine after its supplementation, which phenomenon can serve as a sensitive marker of disturbance in metabolic pathways of 2c units and of thiolic compounds. strong differences between initial and terminal tdga levels in urine indicate that cr disturbed the equilibria of redox processes, catalyzed by folates and vitamin b-12. some theories for explanation of these effects are described in this manuscript. nevertheless, similarly as in other metabolic studies, the results are significantly affected by the probands' individual responses, which reflect their individual genetic makeup. the various methods such as voltammetric (generally electrochemical), chromatographic, mass spectrometric, enzymatic etc., which have been most frequently utilized for determination of discussed compounds in common laboratories, have been reported.
cell_biology	the field of stem cell biology, cell therapy, and regenerative medicine has expanded almost exponentially, in the last decade. clinical trials are evaluating the potential therapeutic use of stem cells in many adult and pediatric lung diseases with vascular component, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), or pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). extensive research activity is exploring the lung resident and circulating progenitor cells and their contribution to vascular complications of chronic lung diseases, and researchers hope to use resident or circulating stem/progenitor cells to treat chronic lung diseases and their vascular complications. it is becoming more and more clear that progress in mechanobiology will help to understand the various influences of physical forces and extracellular matrix composition on the phenotype and features of the progenitor cells and stem cells. the current review provides an overview of current concepts in the field.
molecular_biology	research on fungal pathogens with the aim to identify virulence determinants strictly relies on the generation of defined, recombinant strains, a task that is executed by means of a sophisticated molecular biology toolbox. recent developments in fungal genome engineering have opened a new frontier by implementing the crispr-cas9 technology, based on expression of the cas9 endonuclease that is loaded by a single guiding rna (sgrna) molecule to target a defined site in the recipient genome. this novel approach has been adapted successfully to engineer fungal genomes, among them the one of the human-pathogenic mould aspergillus fumigatus. implementation of the required components was achieved by various means that differ with respect to expression of the cas9 enzyme and sgrna delivery. validation of crispr-cas9-mediated mutagenesis could be executed by targeting selected candidate genes of a. fumigatus to provide a promising perspective for screening and multiplexing approaches to scrutinize the virulome of this opportunistic fungal pathogen in a comprehensive manner, such as by analyzing genetic polymorphisms or the function of gene families.
molecular_biology	background: hepatitis b virus (hbv) as an infectious disease that has nine genotypes (a-i) and a 'putative' genotype j. objectives: the aim of this study was to identify the rare codon clusters (rcc) in the hbv genome and to evaluate these rccs in the hbv proteins structure. methods: for detection of protein family accession numbers (pfam) in hbv proteins, the uniprot database and pfam search tool were used. protein family accession numbers is a comprehensive and accurate collection of protein domains and families. it contains annotation of each family in the form of textual descriptions, links to other resources and literature references. genome projects have used p famex tensively for large-scale functional annotation of genomic data; pfam database is a large collection of protein families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments and hidden markov models (hmms). the pfam search tools are databases that identify pfam of proteins. these pfam ids were analyzed in sherlocc program and the location of rccs in hbv genome and proteins were detected and reported as translated embl nucleotide sequence data library (trembl) entries. the trembl is a computer-annotated supplement of swiss-prot that contains all the translations of european molecular biology laboratory (embl) nucleotide sequence entries not yet integrated in swiss-prot. furthermore, the structures of trembl entries proteins were studied in the pdb database and 3d structures of the hbv proteins and locations of rccs were visualized and studied using swiss pdb viewer software (r). results: the pfam search tool found nine protein families in three frames. results of pfams studies in the sherlocc program showed that this program has not identified rccs in the external core antigen (pf08290) and truncated hbeag gene (pf08290) of hbv. by contrast, the rccs were identified in gene of hepatitis core antigen (pf00906 and the residues 224-234 and 251-255), large envelope protein s (pf00695 and the residues 53-56 and 70-84), x protein (pf00739 and the residues 10-24, 29-83, 95-99. 122-129, 139-143), dna polymerase (viral) n-terminal domain (pf00242 and the residues 59-62, 214-217, 407-413) and protein p (pf00336 and the residues 225-228). in hbv genome, seven rccs were identified in the gene area of hepatitis core antigen, large envelope protein s anddnapolymerase, while protein structures of trembl entries sequences found in sherlocc program outputs were not complete. conclusions: based on the location of detected rccs in the structure of hbv proteins, it was found that these rccs may have a critical role in correct folding of hbv proteins and can be considered as drug targets. the results of this study provide new and deep perspectives about structure of hbv proteins for further researches and designing new drugs for treatment of hbv.
enzymology	lipase inhibitors are the main anti-obesity drugs prescribed these days, but the complexity of their mechanism of action is making it difficult to develop new molecules for this purpose. the efficacy of these drugs is known to depend closely on the physico-chemistry of the lipid-water interfaces involved and on the unconventional behavior of the lipases which are their target enzymes. the lipolysis reaction which occurs at an oil-water interface involves complex equilibria between adsorption-desorption processes, conformational changes and catalytic mechanisms. in this context, surfactants can induce significant changes in the partitioning of the enzyme and the inhibitor between the water phase and lipid-water interfaces. surfactants can be found at the oil-water interface where they compete with lipases for adsorption, but also in solution in the form of micellar aggregates and monomers that may interact with hydrophobic parts of lipases in solution. these various interactions, combined with the emulsification and dispersion of insoluble substrates and inhibitors, can either promote or decrease the activity and the inhibition of lipases. here, we review some examples of the various effects of surfactants on lipase structure, activity and inhibition, which show how complex the various equilibria involved in the lipolysis reaction tend to be.
molecular_biology	context: marine cyanobacteria offer a robust resource for natural products drug discovery due to the secondary metabolites they produce.objective: to identify novel cyanobacterial compounds that exhibit cns psychoactive effects.materials and methods: cyanobacteria were collected from las perlas archipelago, panama and subjected to dichloromethane/methanol extraction and fractionation by column chromatography before being screened for affinity against a panel of cns targets. a 50:50 ethyl acetate:methanol fraction of one cyanobacterial extract (2064h) was subjected to hplc and the major peak was isolated (2064h3). at a dose of 20g per animal, 2064h and 2064h3 were tested in mice using behavioral assays that included the forced swim, open field and formalin tests.results: 2064h was shown to bind to the serotonin 2c (5-ht2c) receptor, a known target for depression and pain treatment. 2064h showed 59.6% inhibition of binding of [h-3]-mesulergine with an ic50 value of 179ng/ml and did not show inhibition of binding greater than 45% with any other receptors tested. both 2064h and 2064h3 decreased immobility time in the first minute of the tail suspension test. 2064h increased time, distance and number of entries in the center region in the first half of the open field test. 2064h increased overall nocifensive behaviors in the formalin test.discussion and conclusion: overall, manipulating the 5-ht2c receptor with these receptor-specific ligands derived from cyanobacteria altered pain, depression and anxiety-like behaviors, illustrating the importance of this receptor in affective behaviors. these results demonstrate the potential of cyanobacteria as a source for cns active compounds.
genetics	adaptation produces hard or soft selective sweeps depending on the supply of adaptive genetic polymorphism. the evolution of pesticide resistance in parasites is a striking example of rapid adaptation that can shed light on selection processes. plasmopara viticola, which causes grapevine downy mildew, forms large populations, in which resistance has rapidly evolved due to excessive fungicide use. we investigated the pathways by which fungicide resistance has evolved in this plant pathogen, to determine whether hard or soft selective sweeps were involved. an analysis of nucleotide polymorphism in 108 field isolates from the bordeaux region revealed recurrent mutations of cytb and cesa3 conferring resistance to quinone outside inhibiting (qoi) and carboxylic acid amide (caa) fungicides, respectively. higher levels of genetic differentiation were observed for nucleotide positions involved in resistance than for neutral microsatellites, consistent with local adaptation of the pathogen to fungicide treatments. no hitchhiking was found between selected sites and neighbouring polymorphisms in cytb and cesa3, confirming multiple origins of resistance alleles. we assessed resistance costs, by evaluating the fitness of the 108 isolates through measurements of multiple quantitative pathogenicity traits under controlled conditions. no significant differences were found between sensitive and resistant isolates, suggesting that fitness costs may be absent or negligible. our results indicate that the rapid evolution of fungicide resistance in p. viticola has involved a soft sweep.
enzymology	the main focus of enzymology is on the enzyme rates, substrate structures, and reactivity, whereas the role of solvent dynamics in mediating the biological reaction is often left aside owing to its complex molecular behavior. we used integrated x-ray- and terahertz-based time-resolved spectroscopic tools to study protein-water dynamics during proteolysis of collagen-like substrates by a matrix metalloproteinase. we show equilibration of structural kinetic transitions in the millisecond timescale during degradation of the two model substrates collagen and gelatin, which have different supersecondary structure and flexibility. unexpectedly, the detected changes in collective enzyme-substrate-water-coupled motions persisted well beyond steady state for both substrates while displaying substrate-specific behaviors. molecular dynamics simulations further showed that a hydration funnel (i.e., a gradient in retardation of hydrogen bond (hb) dynamics toward the active site) is substrate-dependent, exhibiting a steeper gradient for the more complex enzyme-collagen system. the long-lasting changes in protein-water dynamics reflect a collection of local energetic equilibrium states specifically formed during substrate conversion. thus, the observed long-lasting water dynamics contribute to the net enzyme reactivity, impacting substrate binding, positional catalysis, and product release.
northern_blotting	fresh-cut papaya fruit undergo rapid tissue deterioration during storage. a comparative gene expression study was conducted to isolate genes differentially expressed upon fresh-cut processing by means of mrna differential display rt-pcr. differential display analysis was performed on intact and fresh-cut papaya fruit stored in parallel for 12h at 5 degrees c with three different one-base-anchored oligo dt and eight arbitrary primers. confirmation of true positive bands was performed by northern blotting. fourteen differentially expressed cdnas ranging from 154 to 777 bp were cloned, sequenced and compared to genbank sequences. the partial cdnas showed significant homologies to signaling pathway genes, membrane proteins, cell-wall enzymes, proteases, ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, and enzymes involved in plant defense responses. northern blot analysis with probes of each of the partial clones revealed that most of the genes corresponding to partial cdnas were expressed in a fresh-cut dependent manner during 8 days storage. the transcripts for pc18-5, pa19-3 and pc17 were not detectable on northern blots. the results suggest that fresh-cut processing induces the expression of proteins involved in membrane degradation, free radical generation, and enzymes involved in global stress responses.

human_metabolism	iodine is a biologically important trace element. its behaviour in the environment and in human metabolism is determined by the type of iodine species which takes part in chemical reactions. knowledge of their concentrations is necessary to understand and describe the iodine reaction paths. a separation procedure is proposed for quick determination of common forms of iodine-iodide, iodate ions, molecular iodine and organoiodine (in the form of ch3i). the procedure consists of sequential sorption by passing the sample solution first through a solid-phase extraction cartridge to separate i-2 and ch3i from io3- and i- then through an anion-exchange resin in a cartridge to retain the latter two species. each loaded cartridge is eluted to separate the sorbed pair of species. concentration determination of the resulting four solutions can be performed by standard methods, e.g. by spectrophotometry, tracer counting or with ion-selective electrodes.
genetics	this paper reveals that nearly 25 years after the national academy of sciences (nas), biological effects of ionizing radiation (beir) i committee (1972) used russell 's dose-rate data to support the adoption of the linear-no-threshold (lnt) dose response model for genetic and cancer risk assessment, russell acknowledged a significant under-reporting of the mutation rate of the historical control group. this error, which was unknown to beir i, had profound implications, leading it to incorrectly adopt the lnt model, which was a decision that profoundly changed the course of risk assessment for radiation and chemicals to the present.
molecular_biology	skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in our body, is responsible for generating the force required for movement, and is also an important thermogenic organ. skeletal muscle is an enigmatic tissue because while on the one hand, skeletal muscle regeneration after injury is arguably one of the best-studied stem cell-dependent regenerative processes, on the other hand, skeletal muscle is still subject to many degenerative disorders with few therapeutic options in the clinic. it is important to develop new regenerative medicine-based therapies for skeletal muscle. future therapeutic strategies should take advantage of rapidly developing technologies enabling the differentiation of skeletal muscle from human pluripotent stem cells, along with precise genome editing, which will go hand in hand with a steady and focused approach to understanding underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle development, regeneration, and disease. in this review, i focus on highlighting the recent advances that particularly have relied on developmental and molecular biology approaches to understanding muscle development and stem cell function. copyright (c) 2016 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
human_metabolism	human liver microsomes (hlms) are used to simulate human xenobiotic metabolism in vitro. in forensic and clinical toxicology, hlms are popularly used to study the metabolism of new designer drugs for example. in this work, we present an automated online extraction system we developed for hlm experiments, which was compared to a classical offline approach. furthermore, we present studies on the metabolism of 11 cathinones; for eight of these, the metabolism has not previously been reported. metabolites were identified based on ms2 and ms3 scans. fifty-three substances encompassing various classes of drugs were employed to compare the established offline and the new online methods. the metabolism of each of the following 11 cathinones was studied using the new method: 3,4-methylenedioxy-n-benzylcathinone, benzedrone, butylone, dimethylcathinone, ethylone, flephedrone, methedrone, methylone, methylethylcathinone, naphyrone, and pentylone. the agreement between the offline and the online methods was good; a total of 158 metabolites were identified. using only the offline method, 156 (98.7%) metabolites were identified, while 151 (95.6%) were identified using only the online method. the metabolic pathways identified for the 11 cathinones included the reduction of the keto group, desalkylation, hydroxylation, and desmethylenation in cathinones containing a methylenedioxy moiety. our method provides a straightforward approach to identifying metabolites which can then be added to the library utilized by our clinical toxicological screening method. the performance of our method compares well with that of an established offline hlm procedure, but is as automated as possible.
southern_blotting	p>the t(14;18) translocation is the most distinguishing molecular finding in follicular lymphoma (fl). however, the reported frequencies of t(14;18) in fl show significant variation, which is often attributed to geographical and/or methodological factors. the methods used to detect t(14;18) include southern blotting, conventional cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and polymerized chain reaction (pcr). because of its practicality and superior sensitivity, pcr is becoming the more commonly used method in clinical laboratories. the identification of the main breakpoint regions on chromosome 18, including the major breakpoint region (mbr), the minor cluster region (mcr), and the newly defined intermediate cluster region (icr), increased the detection frequency of pcr. in our study, using a highly sensitive nested pcr strategy with primers for mbr, mcr and icr regions, we were able to detect t(14;18) in 95% of fl patients, which is one of the highest reported frequencies using pcr. we screened 58 fl patient samples collected retrospectively from different hospitals in jordan. dna was extracted from archival paraffin-embedded samples, some of which were >10 years old. the respective breakpoint distributions were, 47 for mbr (81%), two for mcr (3.5%) and six for icr (10.3%). in this report, we analyze this high frequency of t(14;18) detection in a general review of the recent literature, in an attempt to assess the geographical vs. methodological influences on the reported frequencies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	breast cancer is a disease of unknown etiology; however, the major risk factors are genetic alterations. studies have demonstrated an association between insulinlike growth factor 1 (igf-1) gene polymorphism and cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, in addition to its role in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness. two polymorphic variants of the igf-1 gene are highlighted in association with breast cancer, rs6220 and rs7136446, although controversy exists as to this relationship. the current study included 137 women (68 breast cancer cases and 69 controls without breast cancer) who had 3 ml of peripheral blood drawn for the study of genomic dna extracted from leukocytes using the genotyping technique by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the cc genotype (rs7136446) was present in 4 women (5.9%) from the case group and in 2 (3.0%) women from the control group (p = 0.67), while the gg genotype (rs6220) occurred in 8 (11.5%) women from the case group and in 5 (7.2%) women from the control group (p = 0.75). no statistically significant difference was observed between the cc genotype of variant rs7136446 in premenopausal case and control women (p = 0.31), thus as there was also no significant difference between case and control postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). concerning the gg genotype of rs6220, it occurred in 6 (14.2%) premenopausal case and 4 (8%) control women (p = 0.71) and no difference was found in postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). in the current study, igf-1 gene polymorphism of snp variants rs6220 and rs7136446 had no statistically significant association with breast cancer, both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
molecular_biology	somatic embryogenesis is an important biotechnological tool in breeding and conservation programmes for woody species. it exists an increasing interest in the improvement of somatic embryogenesis induction in commercial species such as pinus radiata. one approach to obtain markers of successful somatic embryogenesis can be the study of protein profiling in a descriptive study. in order to accomplish this objective, 2-d and maldi-tof/tof-ms analysis were used in the identification and quantification of proteins from pinus radiata d. don somatic embryos derived from 4 cell lines that were generated under different environmental conditions at initiation stage. based on the swiss-prot database, among the 139 proteins detected, 25 of them appeared only in those cell lines with low initiation percentage at the initial stage of somatic embryogenesis. only two proteins were detected differentially in cell lines with high initiation rates. approximately 60% of the proteins identified were related to carbohydrate metabolic process and defence response. this study gives new insights about the proteomics in forest trees, as well as provides clues on the underlying causes of the mechanisms governing pinus radiata somatic embryogenesis process, and can serve as a tool for facing the improvement ofthe breeding programmes.
genetics	age-related cataracts are frequently associated with degenerative changes in the ocular lens including the aggregation of proteins mainly crystallins, but also other proteins including amyloids (a beta) leading to the hypothesis that cataracts could be used as ""biomarkers"" for alzheimer disease. even if this hypothesis was rejected by david beebe 's last paper (bei et al., exp. eye res., 2015), it is a fascinating aspect to look for commonalities between eye diseases and neurological disorders. in this review, i discuss such commonalities between eye and brain mainly from a developmental point of view. the finding of the functional homology of the drosophila eyeless gene with the mammalian pax6 gene marks a first highlight in the developmental genetics of the eye this result destroyed the ""dogma"" of the different evolutionary routes of eye development in flies and mammals. the second highlight was the finding that pax6 is also involved in the development of the forebrain supporting the pleiotropic role of many genes. these findings opened a new avenue for research showing that a broad variety of transcription factors, but also structural proteins are involved both, in eye and brain development as well as into the maintenance of the functional integrity of the corresponding tissue(s). in this review recent findings are summarized demonstrating that genes whose mutations have been identified first to be causative for congenital or juvenile eye disorders are also involved in regenerative processes and neurogenesis (pax6), but also in neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson (e.g. pitx3) or in neurological disorders like schizophrenia (e.g. crybb1, crybb2).

immunology	chronic granulomatous disease is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency disorder that reduces the superoxide generation ability of phagocytes, leading to recurrent infections and granulomatous inflammation. we report the case of a previously healthy 3-year-old boy who presented with classic features of crohn disease. suspicion from histopathologiclogic assessment allowed early diagnosis and treatment for chronic granulomatous disease before the onset of infections.
molecular_biology	environmental epigenetics is the study of how environmental signals affect gene expression. within this growing field of molecular biology, experiments on the epigenetic effects of 'maternal care' on offspring health have received much scientific and public attention and are often called upon to showcase how environmental epigenetics will create a new understanding of life as inherently 'biosocial.' while, on the one hand, this research is exciting and offers possible opportunities for collaboration between molecular biology and the social sciences, it is also necessary to consider its political dimensions. in this paper, we show how commonsense assumptions about sex, gender, sexuality, and class are present in the design, interpretation, and dissemination of experiments on the epigenetic effects of maternal care. as these experiments come to support claims about human motherhood through a dense speculative cross-traffic between epigenetic studies in rodents and psychological and epidemiological studies in humans, current research trends work to illustrate rather than interrogate existing stereotypes about maternal agency and responsibility. with this analysis, we offer a cautionary perspective regarding the potentials and challenges for new forms of collaborative biosocial knowledge practices emerging out of environmental epigenetics.
immunology	objective: to describe the evolution of serological markers among hiv and hepatitis b coinfected patients, with emphasis on evaluating the reactivation or seroreversion of these markers. methods: the study population consisted of patients met in an aids outpatient clinic in sao paulo state, brazil. we included in the analysis all hiv-infected and who underwent at least two positive hepatitis b surface antigen serological testing during clinical follow up, with tests taken six months apart. patients were tested with commercial kits available for hepatitis b serological markers by microparticle enzyme immunoassay. clinical variables were collected: age, sex, cd4+ t-cell count, hiv viral load, alanine aminotransferase level, exposure to antiretroviral drugs including lamivudine and/or tenofovir. results: among 2,242 hiv positive patients, we identified 105 (4.7%) patients with chronic hepatitis b. follow up time for these patients varied from six months to 20.5 years. all patients underwent antiretroviral therapy during follow-up. among patients with chronic hepatitis b, 58% were hepatitis b ""e"" antigen positive at the first assessment. clearance of hepatitis b surface antigen occurred in 15% (16/105) of patients with chronic hepatitis b, and 50% (8/16) of these patients presented subsequent reactivation or seroreversion of hepatitis b surface antigen. among hepatitis b ""e"" antigen positive patients, 57% (35/61) presented clearance of this serologic marker. during clinical follow up, 28.5% (10/35) of those who initially cleared hepatitis b ""e"" antigen presented seroreversion or reactivation of this marker. conclusions: among hiv coinfected patients under antiretroviral therapy, changes of hbv serological markers were frequently observed. these results suggest that frequent monitoring of these serum markers should be recommended.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: gene polymorphisms are associated with sensitivity to platinum drugs. this study aimed to investigate the polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 locus and abcc2 rs717620 locus, and the sensitivity of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) to platinum drugs in a xinjiang uygur population. material/methods: the gene polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 and abcc2 rs717620 of uygur nsclc patients were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp). the relationship between the prognosis of advanced nsclc uygur patients and the gene polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 and abcc2 rs717620 was analyzed using progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) as the major outcome indicators. results: the median pfs of patients with advanced nsclc was 6.9 months and the os of uygur patients with advanced nsclc was 10.8 months. kaplan-meier survival analysis indicated that survival time of patients with gstp1 ag + gg was significantly longer than in patients with aa gene (p<0.05), and survival time of patients with abcc2 ct + tt was significantly longer than in patients with the cc gene (p<0.05). conclusions: polymorphisms of gstp1 rs1695 and abcc2 rs717620 can be used to predict the outcomes of uygur patients with advanced nsclc who have received platinum-based chemotherapy. additionally, this information could be used to guide the individualized treatment of uygur patients with advanced nsclc.
southern_blotting	silene latifolia is a dioecious plant with heteromorphic xy sex chromosomes. previous studies of sex chromosome-linked genes have suggested a gradual divergence between the x-linked and the y-linked genes in proportion to the distance from the pseudoautosomal region. however, such a comparison has yet to be made for the noncoding regions. to better characterize the nonrecombining region of the x and y chromosomes, we sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing the sex chromosome-linked paralogs slap3x and slap3y, including 115 kb and 73 kb of sequences, respectively, flanking these genes. the synonymous nucleotide divergence between slap3x and slap3y indicated that recombination stopped approximately 3.4 million years ago. sequence homology analysis revealed the presence of six long terminal repeat retrotransposon-like elements. using the nucleotide divergence calculated between left and right long terminal repeat sequences, insertion dates were estimated to be 0.083-1.6 million years ago, implying that all elements detected were inserted after recombination stopped. a reciprocal sequence homology search facilitated the identification of four homologous noncoding dna regions between the x and y chromosomes, spanning 6.7% and 10.6% of the x chromosome-derived and y chromosome-derived sequences, respectively, investigated. genomic southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the noncoding dna flanking slap3x/y has homology to many regions throughout the genome, regardless of whether they were homologous between the x and y chromosomes. this finding suggests that most noncoding dna regions rapidly lose their counterparts because of the introduction of transposable elements and indels (insertion-deletions) after recombination has stopped.
human_metabolism	diclofenac (dcf) is a common anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that is often detected in waste wasters, effluents and surface waters. recently, dcf was included in the watch list of substances in eu that requires its environmental monitoring in the member states. dcf is also known to harmfully affect several environmental species already at concentrations of150 d) favor the dcf elimination due to sludge adaptation. longer hrts (>2-3 d) could significantly increase the elimination of dcf during biological wastewater treatment. bioaugmentation could be used to enhance dcf elimination, however, this requires more research on microbial communities that are able to degrade dcf. also, further research is needed to gain more information about the deconjugation processes and biotic and abiotic transformation and the nature of transformation products.

southern_blotting	conserved domain such as nucleotide binding site (nbs) was found in several cloned plant disease resistance genes. based on the nbs domain, resistance gene analogues (rgas) have been isolated. a full-length cdna, spr1 was obtained by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) method. sequence analysis indicated that the length of spr1 was 3 066 bp, including a complete open reading frame of 2 667 bp encoding spr1 protein of 888 amino acids. compared with known nbs-lrr genes, it presented relatively high amino acid sequence identity. the polypeptide has a typical structure of nontir-nbs-lrr genes, with nb-arc, cc, and lrr domains. the spr1-related sequences belonged to multicopy gene family in sweetpotato genome according to the result of southern blotting. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed spr1 expressed in all tested tissues. the cloning of putative resistance gene from sweetpotato provides a basis for studying the structure and function of sweetpotato disease-resistance relating genes and disease resistant genetic breeding in sweetpotato. the gene has been submitted to the genbank database, and the accession number is ef428453.
human_metabolism	the mechanism of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs on the human organism is still not fully understood. new insights on the drugs' action can be provided by a metabolomics-driven approach, which offers a detailed view of the physiological state of an organism. here, we report a metabolome-wide association study with 295 metabolites in human serum from 1,762 participants of the kora f4 (cooperative health research in the region of augsburg) study population. our intent was to find variations of metabolite concentrations related to the intake of various drug classes and-based on the associations found-to generate new hypotheses about on-target as well as off-target effects of these drugs. in total, we found 41 significant associations for the drug classes investigated: for beta-blockers (11 associations), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (four assoc.), diuretics (seven assoc.), statins (ten assoc.), and fibrates (nine assoc.) the top hits were pyroglutamine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, pseudouridine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, respectively. for beta-blockers we observed significant associations with metabolite concentrations that are indicative of drug side-effects, such as increased serotonin and decreased free fatty acid levels. intake of ace inhibitors and statins associated with metabolites that provide insight into the action of the drug itself on its target, such as an association of ace inhibitors with des-arg(9)-bradykinin and aspartylphenylalanine, a substrate and a product of the drug-inhibited ace. the intake of statins which reduce blood cholesterol levels, resulted in changes in the concentration of metabolites of the biosynthesis as well as of the degradation of cholesterol. fibrates showed the strongest association with 2-hydroxyisobutyrate which might be a breakdown product of fenofibrate and, thus, a possible marker for the degradation of this drug in the human organism. the analysis of diuretics showed a heterogeneous picture that is difficult to interpret. taken together, our results provide a basis for a deeper functional understanding of the action and side-effects of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs in the general population.
molecular_biology	engaging undergraduates in research is essential for teaching them to think like scientists, and it has become a desired component of classroom and laboratory instruction. research projects that span an entire semester expose students to a variety of concepts and techniques and allow students to use experiments to learn scientific principles, understand why specific techniques are applicable, critically analyze varied data, and examine how experimentation leads to acquiring knowledge. to provide an experience with these features, a semester long research project was integrated into a combined lecture and laboratory course, molecular biology. the project utilized the zebrafish model to examine gene expression during embryonic development and required students to develop and test hypotheses about the timing of expression of previously uncharacterized genes. the main goals for the project were to provide opportunities for students to develop critical thinking skills required for conducting research and to support the content goals of the course. to determine whether these goals were met, student performance on the steps of the project and related pre-test and post-test questions was examined.

southern_blotting	to date, lemna and spirodela species of the family lemnaceae are the only species that have been used to produce recombinant proteins for pharmaceutical and veterinary purposes. wolffia arrhiza is the most evolutionarily advanced species of the lemnaceae. a rootless duckweed, it is the most promising target for biopharmingas a candidate for submerged cultivation in a fermenter. as a first step toward future biotechnological use of wolffia, we established a stable transformation system for it based on agrobacterium-mediated transformation. following inoculation with the bacteria, wolffia cluster explants were cultured for 2 weeks on media containing 2.0 mg l(-1) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2.0 mg l(-1) n-6-benzyladenine. explants were then transferred to growth regulator-free media in the presence of 5.0 mg l(-1) hygromycin b to select antibiotic-resistant plants. other selective agents-kanamycin and phosphinothricin-were not suitable for wolffia, nor was application of particle bombardment for the delivery of foreign dna to wolffia explants. the developed agro transformation conditions yielded stably transformed lines of wolffia, confirmed by southern blotting, with an efficiency of 0.2-0.4 % transgenes per 100 explants.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are a new family of small rna molecules found in plants and animals. we developed a comprehensive strategy for identifying new mirna homologues by mining the repository of available citrus expressed sequence tags (ests). by adopting a range of filtering criteria, we identified a total of 38 potential mirnas - nine, five, nine and 15 mirnas in citrus trifoliata (ctr-mirnas), c. clementina (ccl-mirnas), c. reticulata (crt-mirnas) and c. sinensis (csi-mirnas), respectively - from more than 430,000 est sequences in citrus. using the potential mirna sequences, we conducted a further blast search of the mrna database and found six potential target genes in these citrus species. eight mirnas were selected in order to verify their existence in citrus using northern blotting, and the functions of several mirnas in mirna-mediated gene regulation are experimentally suggested. it appears that all these mirnas regulate expression of their target genes by cleavage, which is the most common situation in gene regulation mediated by plant mirnas. our achievement in identifying new mirnas in citrus provides a powerful incentive for further studies on the important roles of these mirnas.
enzymology	the unique light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por) is an important model system for understanding how light energy can be harnessed to power enzyme reactions. the ultrafast photochemical processes, essential for capturing the excitation energy to drive the subsequent hydride-and proton-transfer chemistry, have so far proven difficult to detect. we have used a combination of time-resolved visible and ir spectroscopy, providing complete temporal resolution over the picosecond-microsecond time range, to propose a new mechanism for the photochemistry. excited-state interactions between active site residues and a carboxyl group on the pchlide molecule result in a polarized and highly reactive double bond. this so-called ""reactive"" intramolecular charge-transfer state creates an electron-deficient site across the double bond to trigger the subsequent nucleophilic attack of nadph, by the negatively charged hydride from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. this work provides the crucial, missing link between excited-state processes and chemistry in por. moreover, it provides important insight into how light energy can be harnessed to drive enzyme catalysis with implications for the design of light-activated chemical and biological catalysts.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introductionwomen with polycystic ovary syndrome have a three-fold higher risk of endometrial cancer. insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia may be pertinent factors in the pathogenesis of both conditions. the aim of this study was to investigate endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression in polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer endometrium, and to correlate endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression with serum lipid profiles. material and methodsa cross-sectional study was performed at nottingham university hospital, uk. a total of 102 women (polycystic ovary syndrome, endometrial cancer and controls; 34 participants in each group) were recruited. clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before endometrial biopsies were obtained from all participants. taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction for endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene and its systemic protein expression were analyzed. resultsthe body mass indices of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (29.282.91kg/m(2)) and controls (28.58 +/- 2.62kg/m(2)) were not significantly different. women with endometrial cancer had a higher mean body mass index (32.22 +/- 5.70kg/m(2)). sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was significantly increased in polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer endometrium compared with controls (p<0.0001). sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was positively correlated with body mass index (r=0.017, p=0.921) and waist-hip ratio (r=0.023, p=0.544) in polycystic ovary syndrome, but this was not statistically significant. similarly, statistically insignificant positive correlations were found between endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression and body mass index in endometrial cancer (r=0.643, p=0.06) and waist-hip ratio (r=0.096, p=0.073). sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was significantly positively correlated with triglyceride in both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer (p=0.028 and p=0.027, respectively). quantitative serum sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene correlated with endometrial gene expression (p<0.05). conclusionssterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression is significantly increased in the endometrium of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and women with endometrial cancer compared with controls and positively correlates with serum triglyceride in both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer.
cell_biology	the complex pathology of spinal cord injury (sci), involving a cascade of secondary events and the formation of inhibitory barriers, hampers regeneration across the lesion site and often results in irreversible loss of motor function. the limited regenerative capacity of endogenous cells after sci has led to a focus on the development of cell therapies that can confer both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative benefits. stem cells have emerged as a candidate cell source because of their ability to self-renew and differentiate into a multitude of specialized cell types. while ethical and safety concerns impeded the use of stem cells in the past, advances in isolation and differentiation methods have largely mitigated these issues. a confluence of work in stem cell biology, genetics, and developmental neurobiology has informed the directed differentiation of specific spinal cell types. after transplantation, these stem cell-derived populations can replace lost cells, provide trophic support, remyelinate surviving axons, and form relay circuits that contribute to functional recovery. further refinement of stem cell differentiation and transplantation methods, including combinatorial strategies that involve biomaterial scaffolds and drug delivery, is critical as stem cell-based treatments enter clinical trials. biotechnol. bioeng. 2017;114: 245-259.

immunology	cancer is a serious hazard to human health all around the world; however, many current therapies remain toxic and poor. in view of the understanding of immunology and tumor biology, cancer immunotherapy with minimal toxicity has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer treatment because of immune surveillance. unfortunately, the efficacy of immunotherapy was impeded and resisted due to the tumor immune evasion mechanism. hence, targeted cancer immunotherapy has been proposed to tackle the tumor immune suppression and complexity of malignant tumor cells. nanotechnology-based immunotherapy has improved the limitations and enhanced the therapeutic efficiency of traditional immunotherapy. this review illustrates the recent progresses in immunotherapy based on nanotechnology, and reveals that nanodevices could be utilized for active and passive cancer immunotherapy.
northern_blotting	aim: to clone delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase gene of moltierella isabellina and to functionally characterize this gene in vitro and in vivo. methods: reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to clone the open reading frame of delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase gene (d12d) of mortierella isabellina. plasmids pemicl12 and pymicl12 were constructed with it. pemicl12 was transformed into escherichia coli (e. coll) strain bl21 using cacl2 method for expression after induction with iptg. ptmicl12 was transformed into saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in-vsc1 using lithium acetate method for expression under the induction of galactose. northern blotting method was used to investigate the effect of temperature on the transcriptional level of this gene in s. cerevisiae strain in-vsc1. results: recombinant plasmids pemicl12 and ptmicl12 were successfully constructed and transformed into e. coli and s. cerevisiae separately with appropriate method. after induction with iptg and galactose, it was found that expression of delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase genes in e. coli and s. cerevisiae under appropriate conditions led to the production of active delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase, which could convert 17.876% and 17.604% of oleic acid respectively to linoleic acid by gc-ms detection in vitro and in vivo. conclusion: cloning and expression of m. isabellina d12d gene in e. coli and s. cerevisiae is successfully completed.

immunology	polycomb group proteins regulate chromatin structure and have an important regulatory role on gene expression in various cell types. two polycomb group complexes (polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1) and 2 (prc2)) have been identified in mammalian cells. both prc1 and prc2 compact chromatin, and also catalyze histone modifications. prc1 mediates monoubiquitination of histone h2a, whereas prc2 catalyzes methylation of histone h3 on lysine 27. these alterations of histones can lead to altered gene expression patterns by regulating chromatin structure. numerous studies have highlighted the role of the prc2 catalytic component enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2) in neoplastic development and progression, and ezh2 mutations have been identified in various malignancies. through modulating the expression of critical genes, ezh2 is actively involved in fundamental cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. in addition to cancer cells, ezh2 also has a decisive role in the differentiation and function of t effector and t regulatory cells. in this review we summarize the recent progress regarding the role of ezh2 in human malignancies, highlight the molecular mechanisms by which ezh2 aberrations promote the pathogenesis of cancer, and discuss the anti-tumor effects of ezh2 targeting via activating direct anti-cancer mechanisms and anti-tumor immunity.
northern_blotting	cell fate determination and differentiation during neurogenesis and myogenesis involve the sequential expression of several basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factors. the expression of neurod1/2 and the expression of nscl(nh1h)1/2 are closely related in many developing peripheral and central neuronal cells, suggesting an epistatic relationship between these two bhlh transcription factor families during neurogenesis. to investigate this relationship, a murine neuroblastoma cell culture system and single/double knock-out (ko) mice of neurod1 and neurod2 were utilized for the gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, respectively. both neurod1 and neurod2 were able to induce the transcription of nscl1 in vitro: however, they were not able to activate nscl2 transcription. the dna-binding ability of neurod1 was essential for nscl1 induction. to examine the epistatic relationship in vivo, we examined the expression of nscl1 and nscl2 in neurod1 and neurod2 ko mice and neurod1/2 compound mo mice by in situ hybridization, rt-pcr and northern blotting. the expression of nscl1 was lower in the neurod1 ko mice and was not further decreased in the double ko mice. however, the expression of nscl2 did not change in either the single ko or double ko mice. these results demonstrate that neurod1 is an upstream regulator of the nscl1 gene but not the nscl2 gene in mice. in addition, neurod2 is not involved in this regulatory pathway in vivo.

northern_blotting	a method for determining mrna half-lives in the polymorphic fungus candida albicans is described. it employs growth in a defined medium, the inhibition of transcription with thiolutin (10-20 mu g/ml), and quantitative northern blotting. the method is effective for the a72, sc5314, and cai-4 strains of c. albicans, and for mrnas that have a wide variety of decay rates and steady-state abundances. the range of half-lives detected (from 4-168 min) shows that this method is effective for mrnas with widely varying half-lives. the mrna decay rates obtained are compared with those for orthologous mrnas from saccharomyces cerevisiae. this procedure should work for a broad range of c. albicans strains and can be adapted to other fungal species.
human_metabolism	we developed a fast, selective and sensitive on-line lc/lc-ms/ms method for the simultaneous determination of nine parabens and seven environmental phenols in urine. parabens are widely used as antimicrobial preservatives. bisphenol a, triclosan, triclocarban, 2-phenylphenol, and benzophenones are used inter alia in disinfectants, sunscreens and in polymers. some of these substances are suspected endocrine disruptors. limits of quantification and analytical quality criteria fully met the needs for determining exposure levels occurring in the general population. we analyzed 157 spot urine samples from the general german population (59 females, 39 males and 59 children). for the parabens, we found methyl, ethyl and n-propyl paraben with high detection rates (77-98%), followed by n-butyl (36%), iso-butyl (17%), iso-propyl (3%) and benzyl paraben (3%). we detected no pentyl and heptyl paraben. urinary concentrations were highest for methyl paraben (median 24.5 mu g/l; 95th percentile 379 mu g/l) followed by ethyl (1.4 mu g/l; 35.2 mu g/l) and n-propyl paraben (1.2 mu g/l; 68.1 mu g/l). other environmental phenols with high detection rates were bpa (95%), triclosan (45%) and benzophenone 1 and 3 (26%). for most of the parabens/environmental phenols we found higher urinary levels in females than in males or children, probably due to differences in (personal care) product use. however, high levels (in the mg/l range) were also observed in children. exposure to the above substances is occurring worldwide. differences between countries do seem to exist and might be caused by different product compositions or different use habits. human metabolism data is urgently needed to extrapolate from urinary biomarker levels to doses actually taken up.

enzymology	dye-decolorizing peroxidases (dyps; ec 1.11.1.19) are heme enzymes that comprise a family of the dimeric alpha+beta barrel structural superfamily of proteins. the first dyp, identified relatively recently in the fungus bjerkandera adusta, was characterized for its ability to catalyze the decolorization of anthraquinone-based industrial dyes. these enzymes are now known to be present in all three domains of life, but do not appear to occur in plants or animals. they are involved in a range of physiological processes, although in many cases their roles remain unknown. this has not prevented the development of their biocatalytic potential, which includes the transformation of lignin. this review highlights the functional diversity of dyps in the light of phylogenetic, structural and biochemical data. the phylogenetic analysis reveals the existence of at least five classes of dyps. their potential physiological roles are discussed based in part on synteny analyses. finally, the considerable biotechnological potential of dyps is summarized. crown copyright (c) 2015 published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
enzymology	the diversity of reactions catalyzed by enzymes reliant on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) demonstrates the catalytic versatility of this cofactor and the plasticity of the protein scaffolds of the major fold types of plp-dependent enzymes. the enzymes of the transsulfuration (cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-lyase) and reverse transsulfuration (cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-iyase) pathways interconvert l-cysteine and l-homocysteine, the immediate precursor of l-methionine, in plants/bacteria and yeast/animals, respectively. these enzymes provide a useful model system for investigation of the mechanisms of substrate and reaction specificity in plp-dependent enzymes as they catalyze distinct side chain rearrangements of similar amino acid substrates. exploration of the underlying factors that enable enzymes to control the substrate and reaction specificity of this cofactor will enable the engineering of these properties and the development of therapeutics and antimicrobial compounds. recent studies probing the role of active-site residues, of the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways, as determinants of substrate and reaction specificity are the subject of this review. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

southern_blotting	manganese superoxide dismutase (mn-sod) plays a crucial role in antioxidant responses to environmental stress. to determine whether mn-sod affects heat resistance of gracilaria lemaneiformis, we cloned mn-sod cdna sequences of two strains of this red alga, wild type and cultivar 981. both cdna sequences contained an orf of 675 bp encoding 224 amino acid residues. the cdna sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of the two strains shared relatively high identity (more than 99%). no intron existed in genomic dna of mn-sod in g. lemaneiformis. southern blotting indicated that there were multiple copies, possibly four, of mn-sod in both strains. both in the wild type and cultivar 981, sod mrna transcription and sod activity increased under high temperature stress, while cultivar 981 was more heat resistant based on its sod activity. this research suggests that there may be a direct relationship between sod activity and the heat resistance of g. lemaneiformis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	metabolic imbalance impairs fertility, because changes in concentrations of metabolites and hormones in the blood and follicular fluid create an unfavourable environment for early embryonic development. insulin is a key metabolic hormone known for its effects on fertility: insulin concentrations are increased during energy balance disturbances in diabetes or metabolic syndrome. still, insulin is frequently used at supraphysiological concentrations for embryo in vitro culture with unknown consequences for the developmental potential of the offspring. in the present study we investigated the effects of insulin exposure during in vitro bovine oocyte maturation on developmental rates, embryo quality and gene expression. supplementation of the maturation media with insulin at 10 or 0.1 mu gml(-1) decreased blastocyst rates compared with an insulin-free control (19.8 +/- 1.3% and 20.4 +/- 1.3% vs 23.8 +/- 1.3%, respectively; p<0.05) and led to increased cell numbers (nearly 10% more cells on day 8 compared with control; p<0.05). transcriptome analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (nrf2) stress response and cell differentiation, validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. to conclude, the results of the present study demonstrate that insulin exposure during in vitro oocyte maturation has a lasting effect on the embryo until the blastocyst stage, with a potential negative effect in the form of specific gene expression perturbations.
immunology	according to the brazilian association of organ transplants, in 2015, 19,408 bone transplants were performed in brazil, over 90% by dental surgeons. the surgical technique itself has a respectable number of reports regarding its clinical efficacy, as measured by long-term survival of dental implants in grafted areas. uncertainty remains, however, as to whether fresh frozen grafts from human bone donors remain immunologically innocuous in the body of the host. six male with no previous medical history of note, including systemic diseases, surgery or blood transfusion were selected. these patients underwent reconstructive procedures (sinus lifting) using fresh frozen human bone from a tissue bank. all patients had venous blood samples collected prior to surgery and 6 months after the procedure. anti-hla analysis for the detection of hla(human leukocyte antigen) antibodies was performed using methods such as the lab screen pra class i and class ii, lab screen single antigen class i and class ii, luminex platform. reactive individuals to the screening tests (lab screen pra) were further investigated to determine the specificity of the antibodies detected (lab screen single antigen) with a cutoff value of median fluorescence intensity >= 500. as a result, it was observed that two patients (33%) were positive in screening tests, one presenting with anti-hla class i and ii sensitization and the other with anti-hla class ii. the specificity analysis showed that the patients sensitized to hla class ii presented 4 specificities, 3 of which immunologically relevant. in the second individual, 23 specificities were identified, 6 of which immunologically important for hla class i and 4 specificities for hla class ii, 3 of these were immunologically important. all specificities detected had average fluorescence. these findings are suggestive that sinus-lifting procedures with allogeneic bone can induce immunological sensitization.
genetics	giardia duodenalis is a flagellated intestinal protozoan responsible for infections in various hosts including humans and several wild and domestic animals. few studies have correlated environmental contamination and clinical infections in the same region. the aim of this study was to compare groups of giardia duodenalis from clinical and environmental sources through population genetic analyses to verify haplotype sharing and the degree of genetic similarity among populations from clinical and environmental sources in the metropolitan region of campinas. the results showed high diversity of haplotypes and substantial genetic similarity between clinical and environmental groups of g.duodenalis. we demonstrated sharing of giardia genotypes among the different populations studied. the comparison between veterinary and human sequences led us to identify new zoonotic genotypes, including human isolates from genetic assemblage c. the application of a population genetic analysis in epidemiological studies allows quantification of the degree of genetic similarity among populations of giardia duodenalis from different sources of contamination. the genetic similarity of giardia isolates among human, veterinary, and environmental groups reinforced the correlation between clinical and environmental isolates in this region, which is of great importance for public health.
genetics	renewable energy production is expanding rapidly despite mostly unknown environmental effects on wildlife and habitats. we used genetic and stable isotope data collected from golden eagles (aquila chrysaetos) killed at the altamont pass wind resource area (apwra) in california in demographic models to test hypotheses about the geographic extent and demographic consequences of fatalities caused by renewable energy facilities. geospatial analyses of h-2 values obtained from feathers showed that 25% of these apwra-killed eagles were recent immigrants to the population, most from long distances away (>100 km). data from nuclear genes indicated this subset of immigrant eagles was genetically similar to birds identified as locals from the h-2 data. demographic models implied that in the face of this mortality, the apparent stability of the local golden eagle population was maintained by continental-scale immigration. these analyses demonstrate that ecosystem management decisions concerning the effects of local-scale renewable energy can have continental-scale consequences.
molecular_biology	chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qpcr analysis (chip-qpcr) is a widely used technique to study gene expression. a large number of students in molecular biology and more generally in life sciences will be confronted with the use of this technique, which is quite difficult to set up and can lead to misinterpretation if not carefully managed. this article describes a four-session laboratory practical designed for masters students to introduce this technique. during the practical, students work in pairs. they extract chromatin from mcf-7 culture cells stimulated or not by estrogens, then immunoprecipitate the transcription factor estrogen receptor alpha using an antibody directed against it. students then measure the enrichment of promoter dna target sequences from the chromatin that coprecipitates by qpcr. these are two estrogen responsive genes, ps2 (trefoil factor one) and pgr (the progesterone receptor). they learn how to analyze their chip-qpcr data by two methods: percent input and fold enrichment, and are taught about the interpretation limits of these two calculation methods. thus, this practical is a good framework for an in-depth discussion of how this technique can be used to study gene expression and for raising awareness of the importance of careful interpretation of results.

genetics	polg gene encodes the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase gamma, essential for mitochondrial dna (mtdna) replication and repair. mutations in polg have been linked to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, resulting in autosomal recessive or dominant mitochondrial diseases. these mutations have been associated with heterogeneous phenotypes, presenting with varying severity and at different ages of onset, ranging from the neonatal period to late adult life. we screened 13 patients for polg mutations. all patients underwent a complete neurological examination, and in most of cases, muscle biopsy was performed. we detected 15 different variations in 13 unrelated italian patients. two mutations were novel and mapped in the pol domain (p.thr989dup and p.ala847thr) of the enzyme. we also report new cases carrying controversial variations previously described as incompletely penetrant or a variant of unknown significance. our study increases the range of clinical presentations associated with mutations in polg gene, underlining some peculiar clinical features, such as peo associated with corneal edema, and epilepsy, severe neuropathy with achalasia. the addition of two new substitutions, including the second report of an in-frame duplication, to the growing list of defects increases the value of polg genetic diagnosis in a range of neurological presentations.
cell_biology	in traditional microbiology laboratory activities, different strains of bacteria are exposed to uv radiation for varying lengths of time. this article provides information that expands on these activities (or uses them alone) with caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism with which to study the effects of uv radiation. these activities might be used in an introductory class to teach students the basics of working with c. elegans. in cell biology and microbiology classes, students might learn about how uv radiation can damage cells and cause cancer. these activities can also be used to teach the students about how genetic background can affect the sensitivity to uv radiation. in the laboratory, the students design their own activities by altering the parameters of the basic uv radiation experiment. by performing these laboratory activities, students will learn about uv radiation and about all parts of the scientific process.
immunology	lymphocyte differentiation is set to produce myriad immune effector cells with the ability to respond to multitudinous foreign substances. the uniqueness of this developmental system lies in not only the great diversity of cellular functions that it can generate but also the ability of its differentiation intermediates and mature effector cells to expand upon demand, thereby providing lifelong immunity. surprisingly, the goals of this developmental system are met by a relatively small group of dna-binding transcription factors that work in concert to control the timing and magnitude of gene expression and fulfill the demands for cellular specialization, expansion, and maintenance. the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which these lineage-promoting transcription factors operate have been a focus of basic research in immunology. the mechanisms of development discerned in this effort are guiding clinical research on disorders with an immune cell base. here, i focus on ikaros, one of the earliest regulators of lymphoid lineage identity and a guardian of lymphocyte homeostasis.
southern_blotting	an efficient protocol for genetic transformation of somatic embryos of quercus robur by selection in a temporary immersion system is reported. the transformation frequency was 5 times higher than achieved by conventional culture on semi-solid medium, ranging between 6 and 26 % for the four genotypes evaluated. clumps of globular or torpedo somatic embryos were precultured for 7-10 days, inoculated with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain eha105:p35sgusint and cocultivated for 4 days before being cultured for 4 weeks on semi-solid selection medium supplemented with 25 mg l-1 kanamycin. explants were transferred to rita(a (r)) bioreactors and subjected to a two-step selection protocol involving immersion in liquid medium supplemented with 25 mg l-1 kanamycin, for 18 weeks, and then with 75 mg l-1 kanamycin. putatively transformed explants appeared after serial transfer to selection medium over 12-16 weeks. the presence of neomycin phosphotransferase ii and beta-glucuronidase genes in the plant genome was confirmed by histochemical and molecular analysis, and the copy number was determined by southern blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. transformed somatic embryos were germinated and transferred to soil for acclimatization, approximately 8 months after inoculation of the original tissue with bacteria. as the limiting factor for recovery of plants from oak embryogenic lines is the low embryo conversion rate, axillary shoot lines were established from transformed germinated embryos. transformed embryos and shoots were cultured in medium with or without kanamycin and the responses to several morphogenetic processes (recovery after cryopreservation, germination, shoot proliferation, and rooting) were evaluated.
southern_blotting	telomere dysfunction is believed to be a significant factor in carcinogenesis. to elucidate the carcinogenesis mechanism in gastric cancer, the expression of telomeric proteins and changes in telomere length were investigated during multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. tissue samples were obtained during surgical operations from the normal gastric mucosa of 10 patients, the precancerous lesions of 15 patients, the gastric cancer tissues (gc) of 20 patients, and of tumors due to gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis (gclm) from 5 patients. the expression of trf1, trf2, and tin2 proteins was measured by western blotting, while the expression of tert, ku70, and brca1 proteins was detected using the immunohistochemical method. the mean telomere length was determined by southern blotting. compared with normal gastric mucosa tissues, the expression of trf1, trf2, and tin2 proteins was significantly higher in precancerous lesions, gc, and gclm (p < 0.01). the expression of trf1, trf2, and tin2 proteins was significantly higher in gc and gclm than in precancerous lesions (p < 0.01). the expression of tert and ku70 proteins in precancerous lesions and gc tissues was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa tissues (p < 0.01). the expression of tert and ku70 proteins in gc tissues was significantly higher than in precancerous lesions (p < 0.01). in normal gastric mucosa, the brca1 protein was primarily located in the cell nucleus. in precancerous lesions and gc, the expression of the brca1 protein was apparent in the cell cytoplasm. the mean telomere length in precancerous lesions, gc, and gclm was significantly shorter than that in normal gastric mucosa tissues (p < 0.05). the mean telomere length in gc and gclm was significantly shorter than that in precancerous lesions (p < 0.05). the mean telomere length in all tissue samples was inversely correlated with the level of trf1, trf2, tin2, tert, and ku70 proteins. our results suggest that the over-expression of telomeric proteins, trf1, trf2, tin2, tert, and ku70, and the transposition of the brca1 protein may work together to reduce the telomere length in precancerous lesions and gastric cancer, and could contribute to the multistage carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. these findings offer new insight into the mechanism of carcinogenesis in gastric cancer.
southern_blotting	pointed gourd (trichosanthes dioica roxb.), a perennial dioecious plant of the family cucurbitaceae has recently emerged as an important cash crop due to its great medicinal and nutritive value. breeding programmes in pointed gourd have several constraints such as poor germination, vegetative means of propagation and dioecy. identification of male and female at the seedling stage is a pre-requisite for the genetic improvement of this species. screening of genomic dna with inter simple sequence repeat (issr) primers was used for early detection of male and female plants in this study. using pooled dna from male and female genotypes and 40 issr primers, a putative male specific marker tdmsm was produced. it was converted into a sequence tagged marker tdstsm which could successfully amplify 720 bp product in male but not in the female. southern blotting confirmed it as a single copy locus found only in male plant. further, the tdstsm marker was used to accurately detect 9 males and 6 females from 15 individuals of pointed gourd with unknown sex. thus, the sts primers designed from issr fragment tdmsm could be used as an effective and reliable molecular marker for early sex diagnosis in t. dioeca.

genetics	scientific discoveries and technological advancements are inseparable but not always take place in a coherent chronological manner. in the next, we will provide a seemingly unconnected and serendipitous series of scientific facts that, in the whole, converged to unveil dna and its duplication. we will not cover here the many and fundamental contributions from microbial genetics and in vitro biochemistry. rather, in this journey, we will emphasize the interplay between microscopy development culminating on super resolution fluorescence microscopy (i.e., nanoscopy) and digital image analysis and its impact on our understanding of dna duplication. we will interlace the journey with landmark concepts and experiments that have brought the cellular dna replication field to its present state.
northern_blotting	background/aims: connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis and suggested as a downstream mediator of the fibrogenic master cytokine tgf-beta. methods: we investigated the effect of tgf-beta 1 on ctgf/ccn2 expression in cultured rat hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes by means of western and northern blotting, immunocytochemistry, reporter gene analysis, and metabolic labelling. results: we found that the expression of ctgf/ccn2 in hepatic stellate cells is (i) only marginally (if at all) stimulated by tgf-beta and by a constitutively active type i tgf-beta receptor, (ii) independent from smad2/3 phosphorylation, (iii) not reduced by tgf-beta 1 antagonists or alk5-receptor inhibitors and (iv) not upregulated during transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in culture. however, expression and secretion of ctgf/ccn2 in cultured hepatocytes increased spontaneously during culture and was strongly stimulated by tgf-beta 1. in bile-duct ligated and ccl4-treated rat livers, a strong ctgf/ ccn2 expression in hepatocytes was noticed. endothelin-1 stimulated ctgf/ccn2 expression in stellate cells but not in hepatocytes. pathway specific signalling inhibitors point to the involvement of non-smad signalling cascades but their contribution to ctgf/ccn2 regulation is different in both cell types. conclusions: the results do not reveal a relevant interrelation between tgf-beta function and ctgf/ccn2 expression in hepatic stellate cells, which is in contrast to hepatocytes.

immunology	multiple mutation combinations in the igg fc have been characterized to tailor immune effector function or igg serum persistence to fit desired biological outcomes for monoclonal antibody therapeutics. an unintended consequence of introducing mutations in the fc (particularly the c(h)2 domain) can be a reduction in biophysical stability which can correlate with increased aggregation propensity, poor manufacturability, and lower solubility. herein, we characterize the changes in igg conformational and colloidal stability when 2 sets of c(h)2 mutations ""tm"" (l234f/l235e/p331s) and ""yte"" (m252y/s254t/ t256e) are combined to generate an antibody format lacking immune receptor binding and exhibiting extended half-life. in addition to significantly lowered thermostability, we observe greater conformational flexibility for tm-yte in c(h)2, increased self-association, and poorer solubility and aggregation profiles. to improve these properties, we dissected the contributions of individual mutations within tm-yte on thermostability and substituted destabilizing mutations with new mutations that raise thermostability. one novel combination, fqq-yte (l234f/l235q/k322q/m252y/s254t/t256e), had significantly improved conformational and colloidal stability, and was found to retain the same biological activities as tm-yte (extended half-life and lack of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity). our engineering approach offers a way to improve the developability of antibodies containing fc mutations while retaining tailored biological activity.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background and objectiveperiodontal disease is a chronic infectious disease that results in bone loss. many epidemiological studies have reported the progression of periodontal tissue destruction in patients with diabetes; however, the associated mechanism remains unclear. in this study, we comprehensively investigated how diabetes affects the periodontal tissue and alveolar bone loss using a ligature-induced periodontitis model in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (stz) mice. material and methodsdiabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin in 6-wk-old c57/bl6j male mice. a silk ligature was tied around the maxillary left second molar in 9-wk-old wild-type (wt) and stz mice. bone loss was evaluated at 3 and 7 d after ligation. mrna expression levels in the gingiva between the two groups were examined by dna microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction at 1, 3 and 7 d post-ligation. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase staining of the periodontal tissue was performed for evaluation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in histological analysis. resultsin the gingiva, hyperglycemia upregulated the osteoprotegerin (opg) mrna expression and downregulated osteocalcin mrna expression. in the ligated gingiva, tumor necrosis factor- (tnf-) mrna expression was upregulated at 1 d post-ligation in stz mice but not in wt mice. at 3 d post-ligation, alveolar bone loss was observed in stz mice, but not in wt mice. significantly severe alveolar bone loss was observed in stz mice compared to wt mice at 7 d post-ligation. bone metabolic analysis using dna microarray showed significant downregulation in the mrna expression of glioma-associated oncogene homologue 1 (gli1) and collagen type vi alpha 1 (col6a1) at the gingiva of the ligated site in stz mice compared to that in wt mice. quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that gli1 and col6a1 mrna expression levels were significantly downregulated in the gingiva of the ligated site in stz mice compared to wt mice. histological analysis showed lower alkaline phosphatase activity in stz mice. in addition, an increased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were observed at the ligated sites in stz mice. conclusionsthese results suggest that an imbalance of bone metabolism causes osteoclastosis in insulin-deficient diabetes, and that alveolar bone loss could occur at an early phase under this condition.
human_metabolism	one of the most important of the nutrient intake values (nivs) is the average nutrient requirement (anr). the anr is defined as an intake value that will be adequate for half of the individuals in a group of people with similar characteristics. it is used to estimate the prevalence of adequacy, and it serves as the basis for the individual nutrient level (inlx). the determination of adequacy is a complex process, with the resulting value of the anr dependent on the criterion or functional outcome chosen to define nutrient adequacy. because nutrients have multiple sites of action in human metabolism, it is possible to demonstrate abnormal function in one parameter measured or observed as a result of inadequate intake of a nutrient, while other parameters requiring the same nutrient appear normal or within normal ranges. thus, depending on the criterion of adequacy selected, the requirement for a given nutrient may be at a lower or a higher intake amount. in harmonizing development of nivs, it is important to clearly identify the criterion of adequacy selected and the rationale for its selection. rarely are available data sufficient to provide dose-response information from which to select a level of intake at which half of the individuals demonstrate adequacy and half appear to demonstrate inadequacy. three levels of intake, of which at least one level of intake is below the requirement for most of the individuals in the sample, and one level of intake is above their requirement, are useful for establishing, a level at which half of the group might be considered to demonstrate adequacy. types of human nutrient studies that may be used to obtain data are discussed, as well as characteristics of the sample size needed to demonstrate adequacy. the variation in requirements is also an important aspect in predicting levels of intake that will have defined probabilities of adequacy for groups (to develop the inlx, where x is the defined probability chosen). an analysis of the origins of different types of variability is presented. when estimating energy requirements, a special case of nivs, important issues must be considered. additionally, an example of evaluating data used to establish an anr for vitamin a, and the effect of variability in requirements for vitamin a, is provided.
cell_biology	complications resulting from impaired fracture healing have major clinical implications on fracture management strategies. novel concepts taken from developmental biology have driven research strategies towards the elaboration of regenerative approaches that can truly harness the complex cellular events involved in tissue formation and repair. advances in polymer technology and a better understanding of naturally derived scaffolds have given rise to novel biomaterials with an increasing ability to recapitulate native tissue environments. this coupled with advances in the understanding of stem cell biology and technology has opened new avenues for regenerative strategies with true clinical translatability. these advances have provided the impetus to develop alternative approaches to enhance the fracture repair process. we provide an update on these advances, with a focus on the development of novel biomimetic approaches for bone regeneration and their translational potential.
human_metabolism	the use of caffeine, nicotine and some major metabolites was investigated by wastewater analysis in 13 sewage treatment plants (stps) across italy, and their suitability was tested as qualitative and quantitative biomarkers for assessing population size and dynamics. a specific analytical method based on mass spectrometry was developed and validated in raw urban wastewater, and included two caffeine metabolites, 1-methylxanthine and 7-methylxanthine, never reported in wastewater before. all these compounds were found widely at the mu g/l level. mass loads, calculated by multiplying concentrations by the wastewater daily flow rate and normalized to the population served by each plant, were used to compare the profiles from different cities. some regional differences were observed in the mass loads, especially for nicotine metabolites, which were significantly higher in the south than in the center and north of italy, reflecting smoking prevalences from population surveys. there were no significant weekly trends, although the mean mass loads of caffeine and its metabolites were slightly lower during the weekend. most caffeine and nicotine metabolites fulfilled the requirements for an ideal biomarker for the assessment of population size, i.e. being easily detectable in wastewater, stable in sewage and during sampling, and reflecting human metabolism. nicotine metabolites were tested as quantitative biomarkers to estimate population size and the results agreed well with census data. caffeine and its metabolites were confirmed as good qualitative biomarkers, but additional information is needed on the caffeine metabolism in relation to the multiple sources of its main metabolites. this exploratory study opens the way to the routine use of nicotine metabolites for estimating population size and dynamics.

southern_blotting	the basic leucine zipper (bzip) proteins are ubiquitous in plants and play important roles in plant defense responses. in this study, based on an expressed sequence tag from a suppression subtractive hybridization cdna library of lilium regale wilson during fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lilii infection, a novel bzip transcription factor gene lrbzip1 was isolated from l. regale root using the rapid amplification of cdna ends method. the predicted protein of lrbzip1 with 142 amino acid residues contains a basic domain signature and a leucine zipper motif. the quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis showed that the transcription level of lrbzip1 was higher in roots of l. regale than in young stems and leaves. moreover, the expression of lrbzip1 was up-regulated in the incompatible interaction between l. regale and f. oxysporum f. sp. lilii as well as after treatments with stress-related signaling molecules. to verify the function of lrbzip1, a constitutive expression vector of lrbzip1 was constructed and transferred into tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l. cv xanthi). the results of southern blotting and qrt-pcr analyses demonstrated that the lrbzip1 was integrated into genome of the tobacco transformants and highly expressed. under normal conditions, the t1 transgenic tobacco lines showed higher antioxidant enzyme activities and transcription levels of several resistance-related genes than the wild type. moreover, the t1 transgenic tobacco plants showed strong resistance to f. oxysporum f. sp. lilii infection.
genetics	due to the high plasticity of coralline algae, identification based on morphology alone can be extremely difficult, so studies increasingly use a combination of morphology and genetics in species delimitation. a dna barcoding study was carried out on maerl-forming coralline algae using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene, co1, and the plastid gene, psba, on field specimens from falmouth and oban together with herbarium specimens from the natural history museum, uk, and the smithsonian institution, washington, usa. results revealed the presence in the north of britain of a new species, lithothamnion erinaceum melbourne & j. brodie, sp. nov., which was previously misidentified as lithothamnion glaciale. the results also indicated that lithothamnion lemoineae, which had earlier been recorded from britain, was not present. one of the biggest concerns at present is how organisms will respond to climate change and ocean acidification, and it is imperative that investigations are put on a firm taxonomic basis. our study has highlighted the importance of using molecular techniques to aid in the elucidation of cryptic diversity.
enzymology	in recent years, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the paramount physiological importance of the gut microbiota on various aspects of human health and development. particular focus has been set on probiotic members of this community, the best studied of which are assigned into the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium genera. effects such as pathogen exclusion, alleviation of inflammation and allergies, colon cancer, and other bowel disorders are attributed to the activity of probiotic bacteria, which selectively ferment prebiotics comprising mainly non-digestible oligosaccharides. thus, glycan metabolism is an important attribute of probiotic action and a factor influencing the composition of the gut microbiota. in the quest to understand the molecular mechanism of this selectivity for certain glycans, we have explored the routes of uptake and utilization of a variety of oligosaccharides differing in size, composition, and glycosidic linkages. a combination of ""omics"" technologies bioinformatics, enzymology and protein characterization proved fruitful in elucidating the protein transport and catabolic machinery conferring the utilization of glucosides, galactosides, and xylosides in the two clinically validated probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04. importantly, we have been able to identify and in some cases validate the specificity of several transport systems, which are otherwise poorly annotated. further, we have demonstrated for the first time that non-naturally occurring tri- and tetra-saccharides are internalized and efficiently utilized by probiotic bacteria in some cases better than well-established natural prebiotics. selected highlights of these data are presented, emphasising the importance and the diversity of oligosaccharide transport in probiotic bacteria.
genetics	balancing selection describes any form of natural selection, which results in the persistence of multiple variants of a trait at intermediate frequencies within populations. by offering up a snapshot of multiple co-occurring functional variants and their interactions, systems under balancing selection can reveal the evolutionary mechanisms favouring the emergence and persistence of adaptive variation in natural populations. we here focus on the mechanisms by which several functional variants for a given trait can arise, a process typically requiring multiple epistatic mutations. we highlight how balancing selection can favour specific features in the genetic architecture and review the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms shaping this architecture. first, balancing selection affects the number of loci underlying differentiated traits and their respective effects. control by one or few loci favours the persistence of differentiated functional variants by limiting intergenic recombination, or its impact, and may sometimes lead to the evolution of supergenes. chromosomal rearrangements, particularly inversions, preventing adaptive combinations from being dissociated are increasingly being noted as features of such systems. similarly, due to the frequency of heterozygotes maintained by balancing selection, dominance may be a key property of adaptive variants. high heterozygosity and limited recombination also influence associated genetic load, as linked recessive deleterious mutations may be sheltered. the capture of deleterious elements in a locus under balancing selection may reinforce polymorphism by further promoting heterozygotes. finally, according to recent genomewide scans, balanced polymorphism might be more pervasive than generally thought. we stress the need for both functional and ecological studies to characterize the evolutionary mechanisms operating in these systems.
genetics	purpose of review new risk stratification systems and treatment strategies have been introduced in recent years. we aim to provide an overview of these recent changes and summarise these data in a concise article that would be useful for clinicians. recent findings apart from clinical stage, disease genetics are now recognised as important prognostic risk factors, and various new cytogenetic changes with negative prognostic impact have been identified. new technologies such as minimal residual disease detection are also playing an important role in prognostic assessment. recent introduction of combination therapy with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs is showing promising results in high-risk patients and may partially abrogate the negative impact associated with some of the adverse risk factors. summary recent advance has improved our understanding of high-risk multiple myeloma, and new therapeutic agents are now coming through the pipeline for this patient group with once dismal outcome.
genetics	in october 2015, zika virus (zikv) outbreak the brazilian ministry of health (moh). in response, the brazilian society of medical genetics established a task force (sbgm-zetf) to study the phenotype of infants born with microcephaly due to zikv congenital infection and delineate the phenotypic spectrum of this newly recognized teratogen. this study was based on the clinical evaluation and neuroimaging of 83 infants born during the period from july, 2015 to march, 2016 and registered by the sbgm-zetf. all 83 infants had significant findings on neuroimaging consistent with zikv congenital infection and 12 had confirmed zikv igm in csf. a recognizable phenotype of microcephaly, anomalies of the shape of skull and redundancy of the scalp consistent with the fetal brain disruption sequence (fbds) was present in 70% of infants, but was most often subtle. in addition, features consistent with fetal immobility, ranging from dimples (30.1%), distal hand/finger contractures (20.5%), and feet malpositions (15.7%), to generalized arthrogryposis (9.6%), were present in these infants. some cases had milder microcephaly or even a normal head circumference (hc), and other less distinctive findings. the detailed observation of the dysmorphic and neurologic features in these infants provides insight into the mechanisms and timings of the brain disruption and the sequence of developmental anomalies that may occur after prenatal infection by the zikv.
molecular_biology	sex differentiation of flower buds is an important developmental process that directly affects fruit yield of cucumber (cucumis sativus l). plant hormones, such as gibberellins (gas) and ethylene can promote development of male and female flowers, respectively, however, the regulatory mechanisms of ga-induced male flower formation and potential involvement of ethylene in this process still remain unknown. in this study, to unravel the genes and gene networks involved in ga-regulated cucumber sexual development, we performed high throughout rna-seq analyses that compared the transcriptomes of shoot tips between ga(3) treated and untreated gynoecious cucumber plants. results showed that ga(3) application markedly induced male flowers but decreased ethylene production in shoot tips. furthermore, the transcript levels of m (csacs2) gene, ethylene receptor csetr1 and some ethylene-responsive transcription factors were dramatically changed after ga(3) treatment, suggesting a potential involvement of ethylene in ga regulated sex expression of cucumber. interestingly, ga(3) down-regulated transcript of a c-class floral homeotic gene, cag2, indicating that ga may also influence cucumber sex determination through an ethylene-independent process. these results suggest a novel model for hormone-mediated sex differentiation and provide a theoretical basis for further dissection of the regulatory mechanism of male flower formation in cucumber. statement: we reveal that ga can regulate sex expression of cucumber via an ethylene dependent manner, and the m (csacs2), csetr1, and erfs are probably involved in this process. moreover, cag2, a c-class floral homeotic gene, may also participate in ga-modulated cucumber sex determination, but this pathway is ethylene-independent.
cell_biology	natural killer (nk) cells are innate immune lymphocytes that play critical roles in host defense against viral infection and surveillance against malignant transformation. long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are important immune system regulators. here, we analyzed human primary lymphocyte lncrna expression profiles to identify nk-lncrna signatures. we detected numerous novel nk-specific lncrnas with potential roles in regulating human nk cell differentiation and function. expression of lnc-cd56, an nk-specific lncrna, was positively correlated with that of cd56, a classical human nk cell surface marker. we showed that lnc-cd56 may function as a positive regulator of cd56 in primary human nk cells and differentiated nk cells from human cd34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. our data provide an annotated human nk cell lncrna expression catalog and demonstrate a key role for lncrnas in nk cell biology.
immunology	altered mental status in cryptococcal meningitis results in poorer survival, but underlying causes of altered mentation are poorly understood. within two clinical trials, we assessed risk factors for altered mental status (gcs score<15) considering baseline clinical characteristics, csf cytokines/chemokines, and antiretroviral therapy. among 326 enrolled participants, 97 (30%) had gcs<15 and these patients had lower median csf cryptococcal antigen titers (p = .042) and ccl2 (p = .005) but higher opening pressures (320 vs. 269 mm h2o; p = .016), il-10 (p = .044), and ccl3 (p = .008) compared with persons with gcs = 15. altered mental status may be associated with host immune response rather than cryptococcus burden.
human_metabolism	a new high-performance capillary electrophoresis assay for aminothiols in human blood, including homocysteine, a marker of several human metabolism disorders, has been developed. sample preparation involves conversion of disulfides to free thiols with triphenylphosphine, precipitation of proteins with sulfosalicylic acid, and conjugation of the thiols with monobromobimane. derivatized thiols were separated in a sodium phosphate buffer using a fused-silica capillary (65 cmx50 mum i.d.) at 30 degreesc. with the electric field of 250 v cm(-1), separation of homocysteine, glutathione and cysteine occurred at less than 10 min. detection at 250 or 234 nm was used to confirm the monobimane-thiols peaks. the detection limit was similar to5 nmol/ml for all labeled aminothiols. the proposed method for these compounds' analysis included simple sample preparation, high selectivity, good linearity (r(2)>0.999), high reproducibility (within-run precision for derivatized aminothiol peaks area rsd<5% for three times consequently injected sample); high reliability and the small volumes required for analysis made it suitable for clinical studies.

enzymology	the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag) is predominantly biosynthesized by sn-1-diacylglycerol lipase alpha (dagl-alpha) in the cns. selective inhibitors of dagl-alpha will provide valuable insights in the role of 2-ag in endocannabinoid signaling processes and are potential therapeutics for the treatment of obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. here, we describe the development of a natural substrate-based fluorescence assay for dagl-alpha, using a coupled enzyme approach. the continuous setup of our assay allows monitoring of dagl-alpha activity in real-time and in a 96-well plate format. this constitutes a major improvement to the currently available radiometric and lc/ms-based methods, which can be executed only in low-throughput formats. in addition, our assay circumvents the use of radioactive material. we demonstrate that our assay can be used to screen inhibitors of dagl-alpha activity, using 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as the physiologically relevant natural substrate of dagl-alpha. furthermore, our method can be employed to measure dagl activity and inhibition in the mouse brain membrane proteome. consequently, our assay should serve as a valuable tool for rapid hit validation and lead optimization of dagl-alpha inhibitors.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective/background: matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) have already been identified as key players in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa). however, the current data remain inconclusive. in this study, the expression of mmps at mrna and protein levels were investigated in relation to the degradation of collagen i and collagen iii. methods: tissue samples were obtained from 40 patients with aaa undergoing open aortic repair, and from five healthy controls during kidney transplantation. expression of mmps 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp)1, and timp2 were measured at the mrna level using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. at the protein level, mmps, collagen i, and collagen iii, and their degradation products carboxy-terminal collagen cross-links (ctx)-i and ctx-iii, were quantified via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. in addition, immunohistochemistry and gelatine zymography were performed. results: in aaa, significantly enhanced mrna expression was observed for mmps 3, 9, and 12 compared with controls (p <= .001). mmps 3, 9, and 12 correlated significantly with macrophages (p = .007, p = .018, and p = .015, respectively), and synthetic smooth muscle cells with mmps 1, 2, and 9 (p = .020, p = .018, and p = .027, respectively). at the protein level, mmps 8, 9, and 12 were significantly elevated in aaa (p = .006, p = .0004, and p < .001, respectively). no significant correlation between mrna and protein was observed for any mmp. aaa contained significantly reduced intact collagen i (twofold; p = .002), whereas collagen iii was increased (4.6 fold; p < .001). regarding degraded collagen i and iii relative to intact collagens, observations were inverse (1.4 fold increase for ctx-1 [p < .001]; fivefold decrease for ctx-iii [p = .004]). mmps 8, 9, and 12 correlated with collagen i (p = .019, p < .001, and p = 0.003, respectively), collagen iii (p = .015, p < .001, and p < .001, respectively), and degraded collagen i (p = .012, p = .049, and p = .001, respectively). conclusion: no significant relationship was found between mrna and protein and mmp levels. mmps 9 and 12 were overexpressed in aaa at the mrna and protein level, and mmp-8 at the protein level. mmp-2 was detected in synthetic smcs. collagen i and iii showed inverse behaviour in aaa. in particular, mmps 8, 9, and;12 appear to be associated with collagen i, collagen iii, and their degradation products.

polymerase_chain_reaction	differential gene expression profile was studied in dimocarpus longan lour. in response to treatments of simulated acid rain with ph 2.5, 3.5, and a control (ph 5.6) using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (ddrt-pcr). results showed that mrna differential display conditions were optimized to find an expressed sequence tag (est) related with acid rain stress. the potential encoding products had 80% similarity with a transcription initiation factor iif of gossypium raimondii and 81% similarity with a protein product of theobroma cacao. this fragment is the transcription factor activated by second messenger substances in longan leaves after signal perception of acid rain.
immunology	antithymocyte globulin (atg) is often included in the conditioning regimen to prevent graft vs. host disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (hsc) transplantation. however, because atg contains antibodies targeting a wide range of antigens on human cells, its potential off-target effects remain a concern. here, we explored this question in humanized mice that permit the analysis of human cell depletion in tissues. we showed that atg binds to almost all lineages of human hematopoietic cells including hscs, and accordingly it is capable of depleting almost all human hematopoietic cells. interestingly, the efficacy of atg was highly variable depending on the tissue of residence, with human cells in bone marrow significantly less susceptible than those in the blood and spleen. recovery of multilineage human lymphohematopoietic reconstitution in humanized mice that received atg 3 weeks after hsc transplantation indicates that atg had a minimal effect on human hscs that have settled in bone marrow niches. however, efficient human hsc depletion and engraftment failure were seen in mice receiving atg at the time of transplantation. our data indicate that the efficacy of atg is tissue-dependent, and suggest a potential risk of impairing donor hematopoietic engraftment when atg is used in preparative conditioning regimens.cellular & molecular immunology (2017) published online 26 october 2015
northern_blotting	we investigated the expression pattern of zinc finger protein gene in rice (oryza sativa l.) under various abiotic stresses. this gene contains an open reading frame encoding a zinc-finger protein of 171 amino acids and is induced by various stresses, namely salinity, drought, and cold. phylogenetic analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences of oszfp cdna revealed a significant sequence similarity to the zinc finger protein from diverse families of plant species. southern blot analysis of rice genomic dna suggested that oszfp is encoded by a multiple-copy gene. the steady-state levels of oszfp transcripts were found to increase in response to salinity, drought, and cold stresses. a rice zinc-finger protein gene, oszfp, encoding the cys2/his2-type zinc-finger transcription factor was isolated from rice using rt-pcr. the expression profiling indicated that oszfp was constitutively expressed in leaves and roots. the northern blotting showed that oszfp was strongly induced by high salinity and drought, but only slightly regulated by low temperature (4 degrees c). these results suggested that the oszfp may play an important role in rice responses to salinity, drought, and cold as a transcription factor.
molecular_biology	a simple and high sensitive cholesterol amperometric biosensor, which is based on in situ electropolymerization of multi-walled carbon nanotube-polyaniline (mwcnt-pani) nanocomposite and electrodeposition of platinum nanoparticle (nano-pt) films onto the glassy carbon electrode surface for cholesterol oxidase immobilization, was constructed in this study. the preparation process of the modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and chronoamperometry. because of the synergistic electrocatalytic activity between mwcnt-pani nanocomposites and nano-pt, the cholesterol biosensor exhibited an excellent performance with a linear range of 2.0-510.0 mu m, a detection limit of 0.8 mu m (signal-to-noise ratio = 3), a high sensitivity of 109.9 mu a mm(-1), and a short response time within 5 sec. moreover, the reproducibility, stability, and selectivity of the biosensor were also investigated.

polymerase_chain_reaction	tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (tnfaip8), a transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b-inducible, antiapoptotic and oncogenic molecule, is associated with prognosis of several human malignancies. however, the relationship between tnfaip8 and the prognosis of the invasive ductal carcinoma (idc) of the breast remains unclear. tnfaip8 expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and western blot analysis in 20 fresh idc tissues and immunohistochemical analysis in 351 paraffin embedded idc tissues. real-time pcr and western blot analysis demonstrated that both tnfaip8 messenger rna and protein were up-regulated in idc tissues compared with the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. immunohistochemistry revealed that tnfaip8 expression was significantly correlated with some clinicopathological factors, including axillary lymph node metastasis (p = .001), advanced tnm stage (p < .001), high histologic grade (p < .001), molecular subtype (p < .001), and postoperative recurrence (p < .001). univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that tnfaip8 overexpression was strongly associated with axillary lymph node metastasis (odds ratio, 1.818; 95% confidence interval, 1.167-2.832; p = .008). moreover, kaplan-meier analysis indicated that idc patients with high tnfaip8 expression had a shorter survival time than did those with low tnfaip8 expression, and multivariate analysis indicated that tnfaip8 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in idc (p = .041 and p = .020, respectively). therefore, tnfaip8 overexpression may contribute to tumor progression, and it may be a novel prognostic biomarker for the patients with idc.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: abnormal expression of some cd44 molecules in tumor tissues can induce the degradation of the extracellular matrix, and is closely associated with axillary lymph node metastasis, angiogenesis, cancer progression, and drug resistance. patients and methods: we measured and confirmed the expression of cd44st and mmp2 mrnas and proteins in the cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients with either adenocarcinoma (n = 72) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 53) using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, and immunohistochemical analysis. results: cd44st and mmp2 expression were closely associated with the histopathological classification, lymph node metastasis, and tnm stage of the tumors, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). the median overall survival (os) for the high cd44st expression group was 30.52 months (95% confidence interval (cl) 24.02-36.15); for the low expression group it was 43.23 months (95% cl 31.81-52.02) (p = 0.020). the median os for the high mmp-2 expression group was 30.53 months (95% cl 26.69-33.31); for the low expression group it was 40.06 months (95% cl 33.55-46.45) (p = 0.022). conclusion: the rates of cd44st and mmp2 expression were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, were closely associated with lymph node metastasis and tnm stage, and affected patients' prognoses.

southern_blotting	to develop a more efficient genetic transformation system for cryptomeria japonica (japanese cedar), the present study evaluated the effects of culture support during co-cultivation and the use of beta-lactam antibiotics (meropenem and carbenicillin) to eliminate agrobacterium on the transformation efficiency. the co-cultivation of embryogenic tissues and bacterium on filter paper wicks prevented the excess growth of agrobacterium compared with that observed on solid medium, leading to an increased number of gene-transferred cells. meropenem successfully eliminated the bacterium at low concentrations (10 mg l(-1)) and had no phytotoxic effect. the transformed tissues were screened based on kanamycin resistance and green fluorescent protein (gfp) fluorescence, and the integration of the transgene into the plantlet genome was confirmed by southern blotting. we successfully generated a mean of 105.3 +/- 9.02 independent transgenic lines per gram of embryogenic tissues using a combination of filter paper wicks and meropenem. the transformation efficiency of the improved method was approximately 30-fold higher than that observed using the conventional method.
human_metabolism	estimating the nature and extent of human cancer risks due to arsenic (as) in drinking water is currently of great concern, since millions of persons worldwide are exposed to arsenic, primarily through natural enrichment of drinking water drawn from deep wells. humans metabolize and eliminate as through oxidative methylation and subsequent urinary excretion. while there is debate as to the role of methylation in activation/detoxification, variations in arsenic metabolism may affect individual risks of toxicity and carcinogenesis. using data from three populations, from mexico, china, and chile, we have analyzed the distribution in urine of total arsenic and arsenic species (inorganic arsenic (inas), monomethyl arsenic (mma), and dimethyl arsenic (dma)). data were analyzed in terms of the concentration of each species and by evaluating mma:dma and (mma + dma):inas ratios. in all persons most urinary as was present as dma. male:female differences were discernible in both high- and low-exposure groups from all three populations, but the gender differences varied by populations. the data also indicated bimodal distributions in the ratios of dma to inas and to mma. while the gene or genes responsible for arsenic methylation are still unknown, the results of our studies among the ethnic groups in this study are consistent with the presence of functional genetic polymorphisms in arsenic methylation leading to measurable differences in toxicity. this analysis highlights the need for continuing research on the health effects of as in humans using molecular epidemiologic methods.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: micrornas are endogenously expressed, small non-coding rnas that modulate gene expression by targeting specific mrnas, resulting in translational repression or mrna degradation. although mir-584-5p has been reported to play a vital role in various malignancies, its role and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of mir-584-5p in gastric cancer (gc) remain to be clarified. in this study, we investigated the role of mir-584-5p in gc. methods: the expression of mir-584-5p and its specific target gene were determined in human gc specimens and cell lines by microrna real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) and western blot. the effects of mir-584-5p depletion or ectopic expression on gc proliferation were evaluated in vitro using cck-8 proliferation assays, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (edu) incorporation, colony formation assays and cell-cycle assays and the in vivo effects were investigated using a mouse tumorigenicity model. cell apoptosis was evaluated by in vitro flow cytometric analysis, cell viability assays and in vivo tunel assays. luciferase reporter assays were employed to identify interactions between mir-584-5p and its specific target gene. results: a series of in vitro and in vivo gain-and loss-of-function assays revealed that mir-584-5p inhibited gc cell proliferation, while apoptosis was induced. luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis revealed wwp1 to be a direct target of mir-584-5p. the effects of mir-584-5p-mimic were rescued by wwp1 overexpression. in contrast, the effects of the mir-584-5p-inhibitor were impaired by wwp1-shrna. furthermore, mir-584-5p expression levels correlated negatively with wwp1 protein expression in gc tissues and gc cell lines. a series of investigations indicated that mir-584-5p promoted senescence and activated the tgf beta signaling pathway by downregulation of wwp1. conclusion: taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of mir-584-5p contributes to tumor progression by downregulation of wwp1, thus, highlighting the potential of mir-584-5p as a therapeutic target for human gc.
molecular_biology	this review summarizes biogenesis, composition, intracellular transport, and possible functions of trichocysts. trichocyst release by paramecium is the fastest dense core-secretory vesicle exocytosis known. this is enabled by the crystalline nature of the trichocyst ""body"" whose matrix proteins (tmp), upon contact with extracellular ca2+, undergo explosive recrystallization that propagates cooperatively throughout the organelle. membrane fusion during stimulated trichocyst exocytosis involves ca2+ mobilization from alveolar sacs and tightly coupled store-operated ca2+-influx, initiated by activation of ryanodine receptor-like ca2+-release channels. particularly, aminoethyldextran perfectly mimics a physiological function of trichocysts, i.e. defense against predators, by vigorous, local trichocyst discharge. the tmp 's contained in the main ""body"" of a trichocyst are arranged in a defined pattern, resulting in crossstriation, whose period expands upon expulsion. the second part of a trichocyst, the ""tip"", contains secretory lectins which diffuse upon discharge. repulsion from predators may not be the only function of trichocysts. we consider ciliary reversal accompanying stimulated trichocyst exocytosis (also in mutants devoid of depolarization-activated ca2+ channels) a second, automatically superimposed defense mechanism. a third defensive mechanism may be effectuated by the secretory lectins of the trichocyst tip; they may inhibit toxicyst exocytosis in dileptus by crosslinking surface proteins (an effect mimicked in paramecium by antibodies against cell surface components). some of the proteins, body and tip, are glycosylated as visualized by binding of exogenous lectins. this reflects the biogenetic pathway, from the endoplasmic reticulum via the golgi apparatus, which is also supported by details from molecular biology. there are fragile links connecting the matrix of a trichocyst with its membrane; these may signal the filling state, full or empty, before and after tmp release upon exocytosis, respectively. this is supported by experimentally produced "" frustrated exocytosis"", i.e. membrane fusion without contents release, followed by membrane resealing and entry in a new cycle of reattachment for stimulated exocytosis. there are some more puzzles to be solved: considering the absence of any detectable ca2+ and of acidity in the organelle, what causes the striking effects of silencing the genes of some specific ca2+-release channels and of subunits of the h+-atpase? what determines the inherent polarity of a trichocyst? what precisely causes the inability of trichocyst mutants to dock at the cell membrane? many details now call for further experimental work to unravel more secrets about these fascinating organelles.
northern_blotting	background: hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) was initially discovered as a mitogen for hepatocytes, but it is also known to be related to carcinogenesis in many other organs. however, the role of hgf in lung carcinogenesis is not fully-understood. in this study, we investigated the role of hgf in lung carcinogenesis using hgf transgenic mice. materials and methods: to elucidate the role of hgf in lung carcino genesis, 5 mu g/g body weight diethylnitrosamine (den) were administered intraperitoneally to hgf transgenic (tg) mice and wild-type (wt) mice at 15 days of age. the incidence and number of lung tumors, the expression of hgf and of its receptor (c-met) were compared between hgf tg and wt mice. results: hgf overexpression accelerated den-induced lung carcinogenesis. seventy-six percent of tg mice (versus 50% of wt mice) developed malignant lung tumors by 48 weeks. the incidence of lung tumors was significantly higher in the tg mice in comparison with wt mice (p<0.05). furthermore, the mean diameter and number of tumors in each mouse were significantly higher in the tg mice compared to the wt mice (p<0.01). the northern blotting analyses revealed that there was overexpression of the hgf trans gene in the lung tumors of tg mice in comparison with the surrounding non-tumorous lesions. the western blotting analyses of the tumor lesions revealed increased phosphorylation of c-met. conclusion: our results suggest that hgf promotes lung carcino genesis through the autocrine activation of the hgf/c-met signaling pathway. the hgf/c-met signaling pathway appears to have vital roles in lung carcinogenesis.
molecular_biology	a novel approach for stem cell generation is the attempt to induce conversion of the adult somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells so called induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) by introducing specific transcription factors. ipscs have two essential cell characteristics, they are pluripotent and posses long term cell-renewal capacity. additionally, ipscs can be derived from patient-specific somatic cells, thus bypassing ethical and immunological issues. the aim of our study was to reprogram long-term cryopreserved human neonatal fibroblasts by new method using lipid nano-particle technology (lipofectamine 3000 reagent transfection system) in combination with epi 5 reprogramming vectors. obtained ipscs were characterized by several sophisticated methods of molecular biology and microscopy. distinct colonies of ipscs started to appear by day 20 after reprogramming. the presence of ipscs colonies was proved by alkaline phosphatase (ap) live staining. after manual picking the colonies and their subsequent passaging, they did not lose ability to form embryoid bodies, they were positive for ap, tra-1-60, and ssea-5. moreover, obtained ipscs expressed pluripotency markers oct4, sox2 and nanog, and the expression levels of chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic markers were significantly higher in comparison to control (p < 0.05). in summary, we have demonstrated that long-term cryopreserved human neonatal fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into ipscs and after further analysis concerns on their biological safety they may be used as patient-specific cells in regenerative medicine.
enzymology	htra2, a complex trimeric pyramidal mitochondrial serine protease that regulates critical biological functions and diseases, including apoptosis and cancer, is a promising therapeutic target. it promotes apoptosis through multiple pathways, complex mechanisms of which are still elusive. the existing model of activation that emphasizes relative intramolecular movements between c-terminal pdz and protease domains (pdz-protease collapse in inactive and resting states) has not been able to unambiguously demonstrate dynamics of its actions. using structure-guided design, molecular biology and protein biochemistry, we obtained various combinations of htra2 domains and mutants. conformational changes and stability were characterized using molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic tools while functional enzymology delineated their roles in regulating enzyme catalysis. quantitative forster resonance energy transfer showed lesser intramolecular pdz-protease distance in trimeric htra2 compared to its inactive monomeric counterpart (approximate to 21 and approximate to 22.3 angstrom, respectively, at 37 degrees c). our findings highlight importance of n-terminal region, oligomerization, and intricate intermolecular pdz-protease interaction in proper active-site formation, enzyme-substrate complex stabilization, and hence htra2 functions. these observations redefine the existing activation model and showcase a unique example of how precise interdomain coordination, plasticity, and intermolecular contacts lead to distinct functional properties and hence provide new insights into htra2 structure, function, and dynamics.
enzymology	s-adenosyl methionine (sam) is a universal biological cofactor that is found in all branches of life where it plays a critical role in the transfer of methyl groups to various biomolecules, including dna, proteins and small-molecule secondary metabolites. the methylation process thus has important implications in various disease processes and applications in industrial chemical processing. this methyl transfer is catalysed by sam-dependent methyltransferases (mtases), which are by far the largest groups of sam-dependent enzymes. a significant amount is now known regarding the structural biology and enzymology of these enzymes, and, consequently, there is now significant scope for the development of new mtases and sam analogues for applications from biomolecular imaging to biocatalytic industrial processes. this review will focus on current efforts in the manipulation of class i and v sam-dependent mtases and the use of synthetic sam analogues, which together offer the best prospects for rational redesign towards biotechnological applications. firstly, metabolic engineering of organisms incorporating small-molecule mtases is discussed; this can be applied in a variety of areas from the industrial bioprocessing of flavourants and antibiotics to frontier research in biofuel production and bioremediation. secondly, the application of mtases in combination with sam analogues is reviewed; this allows the tagging of proteins and oligonucleotides with moieties other than the methyl group. such tagging allows the isolation of the tagged biomolecule and aids its visualisation by a range of analytical methods. the review then summarises the potential advantages of mtase-mediated chemistry and offers some future perspectives on downstream applications.

polymerase_chain_reaction	small leucine-rich proteoglycans are components of extracellular matrix that regulates neoplastic transformation. among small leucine rich proteoglycans, decorin, biglycan and lumican are most commonly implicated markers, and their expression is well studied in various malignancies. in this novel study, we have collectively evaluated expression of these three molecules in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. thirty patients of confirmed untreated bladder cancer, 30 healthy controls for blood and 30 controls for adjacent non-tumour tissue were enrolled. blood was collected from all subjects and tumour/adjacent normal tissue was obtained from the patients. circulatory levels were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, relative messenger rna expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western-blotting. circulatory levels of biglycan (p = 0.0038) and lumican (p < 0.0001) were significantly elevated, and that of decorin (p < 0.0001) was significantly reduced in patients as compared with controls. protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western-blotting showed elevated expression of lumican and biglycan and lower expression of decorin in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. quantitative polymerase chain reaction for messenger rna expression from tissue specimens revealed significantly higher expression of biglycan (p = 0.0008) and lumican (p = 0.01) and lower expression of decorin (p < 0.0001) in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. out of all molecules receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the 0.207 ng/ml cut-off of serum lumican provided optimum sensitivity (90.0%) and specificity (90.0%). significant alteration of matrix small leucine-rich proteoglycans in urothelial carcinoma of bladder was observed. higher expression of lumican in bladder cancer patients with the cut-off value of highest optimum sensitivity and specificity shows its importance as a potential non-invasive marker for early detection of ubc following further validation in large patient cohort.
immunology	chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a hematological cancer, characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)], producing the bcr-abl oncogene. tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) represent the standard of care for cml patients and exert a dual mode of action: direct oncokinase inhibition and restoration of effector-mediated immune surveillance, which is rendered dysfunctional in cml patients at diagnosis, prior to tki therapy. tkis such as imatinib, and more potent second-generation nilotinib and dasatinib induce a high rate of deep molecular response (dmr, bcr-abl1 <= 0.01%) in cml patients. as a result, the more recent goal of therapy in cml treatment is to induce a durable dmr as a prelude to successful treatment-free remission (tfr), which occurs in approximately half of all cml patients who cease tki therapy. the lack of overt relapse in such patients has been attributed to immunological control of cml. in this review, we discuss an immunological timeline to successful tfr, focusing on the immunology of cml during tki treatment; an initial period of immune suppression, limiting antitumor immune effector responses in newly diagnosed cml patients, linked to an expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory t cells and aberrant expression of immune checkpoint signaling pathways, including programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1. commencement of tki treatment is associated with immune system re-activation and restoration of effector-mediated [natural killer (nk) cell and t cell] immune surveillance in cml patients, albeit with differing frequencies in concert with differing levels of molecular response achieved on tki. dmr is associated with maximal restoration of immune recovery in cml patients on tki. current data suggest a net balance between both the effector and suppressor arms of the immune system, at a minimum involving mature, cytotoxic cd56d""n nk cells may be important in mediating tfr success. however, a major goal remains in cml to identify the most effective pathways to target to maximize an advantageous immune response and promote tfr success.
polymerase_chain_reaction	mild therapeutic hypothermia is a candidate for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (tbi). however, the role of mild hypothermia in neuronal sprouting after tbi remains obscure. we used a fluid percussion injury (fpi) model to assess the effect of mild hypothermia on pericontusion neuronal sprouting after tbi in rats. male sprague-dawley rats underwent fpi or sham surgery, followed by mild hypothermia treatment (33 degrees c) or normothermia treatment (37 degrees c) for 3 h. all the rats were euthanized at 7 days after fpi. neuronal sprouting that was confirmed by an increase in growth associated protein-43 (gap-43) expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence and western blot assays. the expression levels of several intrinsic and extrinsic sprouting-associated genes such as neurite outgrowth inhibitor a (nogoa), phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (socs3) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). our results revealed that mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression level of gap-43 and dramatically suppressed the expression level of interleukin-6 (il-6) and socs3 at 7 days after fpi in the ipsilateral cortex compared with that of the normothermia tbi group. these data suggest that post-traumatic mild hypothermia promotes pericontusion neuronal sprouting after tbi. moreover, the mechanism of hypothermia-induced neuronal sprouting might be partially associated with decreased levels of socs3.
enzymology	enzymology tends to focus on highly specific effects of substrates, allosteric modifiers, and products occurring at low concentrations, because these are most informative about the enzyme 's catalytic mechanism. we hypothesized that at relatively high in vivo concentrations, important molecular monitors of the state of living cells, such as atp, affect multiple enzymes of the former and that these interactions have gone unnoticed in enzymology. we test this hypothesis in terms of the effect that atp, adp, and amp might have on the major free-energy delivering pathway of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. assaying cell-free extracts, we collected a comprehensive set of quantitative kinetic data concerning the enzymes of the glycolytic and the ethanol fermentation pathways. we determined systematically the extent to which the enzyme activities depend on the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides. we found that the effects of the adenine nucleotides on enzymes catalysing reactions in which they are not directly involved as substrate or product, are substantial. this includes effects on the michaelis-menten constants, adding new perspective on these, 100 years after their introduction.

molecular_biology	type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (prrs) virus (prrsv) was first isolated in korea in 1994. the commercial prrs modified live vaccine (ingelvac (r) prrs mlv, boehringer ingelheim vetmedica inc., st. joseph, missouri, usa) based on type 2 prrsv, was first licensed for use in 3- to 18-week-old pigs in korea in 1996. the objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of this 20 year old commercial prrs modified live vaccine (mlv) against two recent prrsv isolates. two genetically distant type 2 prrsv strains (snuvr150004 for lineage 1 and snuvr150324 for lineage 5), isolated in 2015, were used as challenge virus. regardless of the challenge virus, vaccination of pigs effectively reduced the level of viremia, the lung lesions, and of the prrsv antigen within the lung lesions. the induction of virus specific interferon-gamma secreting cells by the prrs vaccine produced a protective immune response, leading to the reduction of prrsv viremia. there were no significant differences in efficacy against the two recently isolated viruses by the prrs mlv based on virological results, immunological responses, and pathological outcomes. this study demonstrates that the prrs mlv used in this study is still effective against recently isolated heterologous type 2 prrsv strains even after 20 years of use in over 35 million pigs (c) 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
southern_blotting	the life cycle of seaweed laminaria japonica involves a generation alternation between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophte. the expression of foreign genes in sporophte has been proved. in this research, the recombinant expression in gametophyte was investigated by particle bombardment with the rt-pa gene encoding the recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (reteplase), which is a thrombolytic agent for acute myocardial infarction (ami). transgenic gametophytes were selected by their resistance to herbicide phosphiothricin (ppt), and proliferated in an established bubble column photo-bioreactor. according to the results from quantitative elisa, southern blotting, and fibrin agarose plate assay (fapa) for bioactivity, it was showed that the rt-pa gene had been integrated into the genome of gametophytes of l. japonica, and the expression product showed the expected bioactivity, implying the proper post-transcript modification in haploid gametophyte.
polymerase_chain_reaction	human bone marrow stromal cells (hbmscs) may contribute to the growth of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki)-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml). however, there are certain differences in biology between cml and philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ph+ all). little is known about the role and mechanism of hbmscs on the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all. the current study co-cultured hbmscs with the tki-resistant sup-b15. next, the proliferation of sup-b15 was detected using a cell counting kit-8. additionally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of the associated genes and proteins. the present study explores the role and mechanism of hbmscs on the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all. the current study showed that hbmscs promoted the proliferation of tki-resistant ph+ all. this was shown by the increase in cells in the s+ g2-m phase of the cell cycle. it was also found that the expression of cyclins a, c, d1 and e was increased. apoptosis was inhibited through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes [b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) and bcl-extra large] and downregulation of apoptotic genes (bcl-xs, bcl-2-associated x protein, and caspases 3, 7 and 9). expression of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr)-abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (abl) gene, wnt5a, and wnt signaling pathway-associated genes (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, beta-catenin, e-cadherin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and transcription factors (c-myc, ephrin type-b2, fibroblast growth factor 20 and matrix metalloproteinase 7) was also increased. furthermore, the expression of drug resistance genes (low-density lipoprotein receptor, multidrug resistanceasso-ciated protein and multi-drug resistance gene) was increased and the expression of anti-oncogenes (death-associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory factor-1) was decreased. it was concluded that hbmscs promote the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all by these aforementioned mechanisms. therefore, targeting hbmscs may be a promising approach for preventing the growth of tki-resistant ph+ all.
enzymology	macrolide-pipecolate natural products, such as rapamycin (1) and fk-506 (2), are renowned modulators of fk506-binding proteins (fkbps). the nocardiopsins, from nocardiopsis sp. cmb-m0232, are the newest members of this structural class. here, the biosynthetic pathway for nocardiopsins a-d (4-7) is revealed by cloning, sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses of the nsn gene cluster. in vitro evaluation of recombinant nsnl revealed that this lysine cyclodeaminase catalyzes the conversion of l-lysine into the l-pipecolic acid incorporated into 4 and 5. bioinformatic analyses supported the conjecture that a linear nocardiopsin precursor is equipped with the hydroxy group required for macrolide closure in a previously unobserved manner by employing a p450 epoxidase (nsnf) and limonene epoxide hydrolase homologue (nsng). the nsn cluster also encodes candidates for tetrahydrofuran group biosynthesis. the nocardiopsin pathway provides opportunities for engineering of fkbp-binding metabolites and for probing new enzymology in nature 's polyketide tailoring arsenal.
immunology	compelling evidences point out a crucial role for extracellular nucleotides such as adenosine triphosphate (atp) during inflammatory conditions. once released into the extracellular space, atp modulates migration, maturation and function of various inflammatory cells via activating of purinergic receptors of the p2y- and p2x- family. p2rx4 is an atp-guided ion channel expressed on structural cells such as alveolar epithelial and smooth muscle cells as well as inflammatory cells including macrophages, dendritic cells (dcs) and t cells. p2rx4 has been shown to interact with p2rx7 and promote nlrp3 inflammasome activation. although p2rx7 has already been implicated in allergic asthma, the role of p2rx4 in airway inflammation has not been elucidated yet. therefore, we used a selective pharmacological antagonist and genetic ablation to investigate the role of p2rx4 in an ovalbumin (ova) driven model of allergen-induced airway inflammation (aai). both, p2rx4 antagonist 5-bdbd treatment and p2rx4 deficiency resulted in an alleviated broncho alveolar lavage fluid eosinophilia, peribronchial inflammation, th2 cytokine production and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. furthermore, p2rx4-deficient bone marrow derived dcs (bmdcs) showed a reduced il-1 beta production in response to atp accompanied by a decreased p2rx7 expression and attenuated th2 priming capacity compared to wild type (wt) bmdcs in vitro. moreover, mice adoptively transferred with p2rx4-deficient bmdcs exhibit a diminished aai in vivo. in conclusion our data suggests that p2rx4-signaling contributes to aai pathogenesis by regulating dc mediated th2 cell priming via modulating il-1 beta secretion and selective p2rx4-antagonists might be a new therapeutic option for allergic asthma.
human_metabolism	background: the amounts of vitamin a that are metabolically derived from specific carotene-containing foods are largely unknown. objective: we sought to develop an improved method for estimating the metabolic vitamin a potential of provitamin a carotenoids by using [h-2(4)]retinyl acetate (d(4)-ra) as an extrinsic reference standard. design: healthy subjects consumed a standardized test meal containing 6 mg beta -carotene as either raw carrot or spinach, either 20 or 1 g added fat, and 6.0 mu mol d(4)-ra. concentrations of unlabeled (d(0)) retinyl esters (re), labeled (d(4)) re, and carotenoids in the plasma triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein fraction (d<1.006 kg/l) were determined in serial blood samples with hplc and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. baseline-corrected areas under the curve for d(0)-re, d(4)-re, and carotenoids were calculated, and the masses of absorbed do-retinol and carotenes were estimated assuming 80% absorption of the d(4)-ra reference dose. results: in trials with ample (20 g) fat (n=6), 74% of the 6 mg beta -carotene ingested was taken up as beta -carotene plus re with 0.3 +/-0.1 mg as retinol. test meals without carotenes yielded no beta -carotene or d(0)-re response and there was no effect of treatment (either fat amount or vegetable, n=6) on the mean d(4)-re area under the curve. the lower-than-expected vitamin a yields were attributed to poor intestinal uptake rather than to low conversion of beta -carotene to re. conclusion: the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein and d(4)-ra method, which controls for variation in chylomicron kinetics in vivo and re recovery during analysis, is useful for obtaining quantitative estimates of the vitamin a potential of single meals.
southern_blotting	arginine decarboxylase (adc), one of the enzymes responsible for putrescine (put) biosynthesis, has been shown to be implicated in stress response. in the current paper attempts were made to clone and characterize a gene encoding adc from peach (prunus persica (l) batsch, 'akatsuki'). rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) gave rise to a full-length adc cdna (ppadc) with a complete open reading frame of 2178 bp, encoding a 725 amino acid polypeptide. homology search and sequence multi-alignment demonstrated that the deduced ppadc protein sequence shared a high identity with adcs from other plants, including several highly conservative motifs and amino acids. southern blotting indicated that ppadc existed in peach genome as a single gene. expression levels of ppadc in different tissues of peach (p. persica 'akatsuki') were spatially and developmentally regulated. treatment of peach shoots from 'mochizuki' with exogenous 5 mm put, an indirect product of adc, remarkably induced accumulation of ppadc mrna. transcripts of ppadc in peach leaves from 'mochizuki' were quickly induced, either transiently or continuously, in response to dehydration, high salinity (200 mm nacl), low temperature (4 degrees c) and heavy metal (150 mu m cdcl(2)), but repressed by high temperature 37 degrees c) during a 2-day treatment, which changed in an opposite direction when the stresses were otherwise removed with the exception of cdcl(2) treatment. in addition, steady-state of ppadc mrna could be also transiently up-regulated by abscisic acid (aba) in 'mochizuki' leaves. all of these, taken together, suggest that ppadc is a stress-responsive gene and can be considered as a potential target that is genetically manipulated so as to create novel germplasms with enhanced stress tolerance in the future.

immunology	while an understanding of the structure and function of a generically described immune system is essential in contemporary biomedicine, it is clear that a one-size-fits-all approach applied across multiple species is fraught with contradictions and inconsistencies. nevertheless, the breakthroughs achieved in immunology following the application of observations in murine systems to that of man have been pivotal in the advancement of biology and human medicine. however, as additional species have been used to further address biologic and safety assessment questions relative to the structure and function of the immune system, it has become clear that there are differences across species, gender, age and strain that must be considered. the meaningfulness of these differences must be determined on a case-by-case basis. this review article attempts to collect, consolidate and discuss some of these species differences thereby aiding in the accurate placement of new observations in a proper immunobiological and immunopathological perspective.
genetics	backgroundseveral reports found a relationship between increased serum lead levels and the risk for essential tremor (et), especially in carriers of the minor allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs1800435 in the aminolevulinate dehydratase (alad) gene, which is involved in the synthesis of haem groups. our group reported decreased risk for et in carriers of the minor alleles of the rs2071746 and rs1051308 snps in the haem-oxygenases 1 and 2 (hmox1 and hmox2), respectively, involved in haem metabolism. we analysed whether alad rs1800435 alone and their interactions with the four common snps in the hmox1 and hmox2 genes are associated with the risk for et. materials and methodswe analysed the genotype and allele variants frequencies of alad rs1800435 in 202 patients with familial et and 218 healthy controls using a taqman method. we also analysed the role of the interaction between alad rs1800435 and the hmox1 rs2071746, hmox1 rs2071747, hmox2 rs2270363 and hmox2 rs1051308 with the risk of developing et. resultsthe frequencies of genotype and allelic variants of alad rs1800435 did not differ significantly between patients with et and controls, and were not influenced by gender. subjects carrying the alad rs1800435cc genotype (wild-type) and the hmox2 rs1051308gg genotype or the hmox2 rs1051308g allele had significantly decreased risk for et. conclusionsthese results suggest that the alad rs1800435 snp is not related with the risk for et, but its interaction with the hmox2 rs1051308 snp could be weakly associated with the risk for this disease.
molecular_biology	lesch-nyhan syndrome (lns) is an x-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism caused by a mutation in xq26.2-q26.3 (omim 308000.0004). the presence of the diagnostic triad, i.e. signs of self-injurious behavior (sib) and results of pedigree analysis and novel molecular biology & genetic testing, confirms the diagnosis of lns. with a level of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (hprt1) enzyme activity < 2%, patients develop neurological, neurocognitive, and neuromotor symptoms along with sib. described here is a case of 4-year-old boy who was diagnosed with lns. the boy displayed sib, i.e. biting of the lips and fingers, and he had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis caused by lns.
cell_biology	in the past decade mass spectrometry-based proteomics has greatly contributed to shaping our knowledge about saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria, from the initial identification of novel essential components in purified protein complexes, to the actual characterization of the mitochondrial proteome, the specific analysis of mitochondrial subcompartment proteomes, and the study of regulatory mechanisms that govern mitochondrial homeostasis. here, we provide an overview of relevant mitochondrial proteome studies and furthermore discuss future possibilities how proteomics will further improve our existing understanding of mitochondria. although mitochondria were the first organelles that have been intensively studied using proteomics, indeed the recent progress and development of more powerful and sensitive methods, instrumentation and data analysis strategies indicate that we are only beginning to exploit the full potential of mitochondrial proteomics and its possibilities to decipher cell biology. beside mere (quantitative) inventory under different conditions, this will for instance include studying the role of multiple post-translational modifications in mitochondrial homeostasis as well as the system-wide mapping of protein-protein complexes and protein-lipid interactions.

immunology	background: correct diagnosis of cefazolin hypersensitivity is not straightforward, mainly because of the absence of in vitro tests and uncertainties concerning the optimal cefazolin concentration for skin testing. cross-reactivity studies suggest cefazolin hypersensitivity to be a selective hypersensitivity. objective: the first objective was to confirm that the application of a higher than 2 mg/ml test concentration could increase skin test sensitivity. a second part aimed at investigating the cross-reactivity between cefazolin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. methods: a total of 66 patients referred to our clinic after experiencing perioperative anaphylaxis, and exposed to cefazolin, underwent skin testing with cefazolin up to 20 mg/ml. patients exhibiting a positive skin test with cefazolin had a panel of skin tests with other beta-lactams and, if indicated, graded drug challenges to study cross-reactivity. results: increasing skin test concentration from the recommended 2 mg/ml to 20 mg/ml identified an additional 7 of 19 (27%) patients, who would otherwise have displayed negative skin testing. the concentration was proven nonirritating in 30 cefazolin-exposed control individuals in whom an alternative culprit for perioperative anaphylaxis was identified. graded challenge testing, after negative skin testing, displayed that all patients tolerated alternative beta-lactam antibiotics (ie, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems). of them, 11 individuals also tolerated an alternative cephalosporin, suggesting that cefazolin hypersensitivity (generally) is a selective allergy. conclusions: increasing cefazolin concentration for skin tests up to 20 mg/ml benefits the sensitivity of diagnosis. furthermore, our data confirm that cefazolin hypersensitivity seems to be a selective allergy with good tolerance to other b-lactam antibiotics.

northern_blotting	analysis of microarray data obtained by comparing gene expression between 2-week-old infant and 7-week-old mature sd rat testes revealed novel targets involved in tumor suppression. reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting indicated that tusc3 gene expression was upregulated in the normal maturing testis and prostate and other organs such as the cerebrum and ovary. tumor suppressor candidate 3 protein expression was detected in these same organs at a size of about 40 kda, in accord with the predicted molecular size. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that mrna and protein localization were prevalent in the testis spermatocytes and interstitial cells such as the leydig cells, as well as prostate epithelial cells. these data suggest that tusc3 is deeply involved in spermatogenesis in the testis, inducing sperm differentiation and maturation, and plays a role in normal prostate development and tumor suppression.
cell_biology	this mini-review highlights the photophysical properties of fluorescent molecular logic gates responsive to acids and oxidants, particularly those developed in our laboratory the past few years. the review pays tribute to earlier developments that lay the foundation for this emerging class of molecules. the logic gates incorporate design concepts based on photoinduced electron transfer from the cross-fertilization of the fluorophore-spacer-receptor and fluorophore-spacer-electron-donor formats. the molecular logic gates explored in detail consist of anthracene and/or naphthalimide fluorophores, while the receptor and electron-donor are typically alkyl amines and ferrocene, respectively. this emerging class of molecule has numerous probable uses, most notably, in corrosion science, geochemistry, molecular cell biology and biomedical diagnostics.
cell_biology	the tongue is an elaborate complex of heterogeneous tissues with taste organs of diverse embryonic origins. the lingual taste organs are papillae, composed of an epithelium that includes specialized taste buds, the basal lamina, and a lamina propria core with matrix molecules, fibroblasts, nerves, and vessels. because taste organs are dynamic in cell biology and sensory function, homeostasis requires tight regulation in specific compartments or niches. recently, the hedgehog (hh) pathway has emerged as an essential regulator that maintains lingual taste papillae, taste bud and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and neurophysiological function. activating or suppressing hh signaling, with genetic models or pharmacological agents used in cancer treatments, disrupts taste papilla and taste bud integrity and can eliminate responses from taste nerves to chemical stimuli but not to touch or temperature. understanding hh regulation of taste organ homeostasis contributes knowledge about the basic biology underlying taste disruptions in patients treated with hh pathway inhibitors.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: to evaluate the trends in usage of dengue virus diagnostics in pakistan. methods: this retrospective study was conducted at the aga khan university hospital, karachi, and comprised data for specimens tested for dengue virus from january 2012 to december 2015. test for dengue virus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, dengue virus antigen by immunochromatic assay and for human immunoglobulin m against dengue virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were reviewed. spss 17 was used for data analysis. results: overall, 33,577 specimens tested for dengue virus. of them, 11,995 (35.7%) were positive. among them, 1,039(8.66%) were reported in 2012; 5,791(48.28%) in 2013; 1,027(8.56%) in 2014; and 4,138(34.49%) in 2015. in 2012, 966(93%) of the positive samples were diagnosed by immunoglobulin m-based method and 73(7%) by nonstructural protein-1 antigen. in 2013, 4,401(76%) samples were tested positive by immunoglobulinm, 1,332(23%) by antigen and 58(1%) by polymerase chain reaction. the trend continued in 2014, but in 2015, 2,111(51%) of all dengue positive tests were determined by antigen testing, 1,969(47.6%) by immunoglobulin m and 58(1.4%) by polymerase chain reaction. conclusion: there was a shift in usage of direct virus identification for rapid diagnosis of dengue virus compared with host immunoglobulin m testing.
enzymology	among all rnas, trna exhibits the largest number and the widest variety of post-transcriptional modifications. modifications within the anticodon stem loop, mainly at the wobble position and purine-37, collectively contribute to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing, maintain the translational reading frame, facilitate the engagement of the ribosomal decoding site and enable translocation of trna from the a-site to the p-site of the ribosome. modifications at the wobble uridine (u34) of trnas reading two degenerate codons ending in purine are complex and result from the activity of two multi-enzyme pathways, the iscs-mnma and mnmeg pathways, which independently work on positions 2 and 5 of the u34 pyrimidine ring, respectively, and from a third pathway, controlled by trml (yibk), that modifies the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose. mnmeg is the only common pathway to all the mentioned trnas, and involves the gtp- and fad-dependent activity of the mnmeg complex and, in some cases, the activity of the bifunctional enzyme mnmc. the escherichia coli mnmeg complex catalyzes the incorporation of an aminomethyl group into the c5 atom of u34 using methylene-tetrahydrofolate and glycine or ammonium as donors. the reaction requires gtp hydrolysis, probably to assemble the active site of the enzyme or to carry out substrate recognition. inactivation of the evolutionarily conserved mnmeg pathway produces a pleiotropic phenotype in bacteria and mitochondrial dysfunction in human cell lines. while the iscs-mnma pathway and the mnma-mediated thiouridylation reaction are relatively well understood, we have limited information on the reactions mediated by the mnmeg, mnmc and trml enzymes and on the precise role of proteins mnme and mnmg in the mnmeg complex activity. this review summarizes the present state of knowledge on these pathways and what we still need to know, with special emphasis on the mnmeg pathway.

northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are a class of non-protein-coding small rnas. considering the conservation of many mirna genes in different plant genomes, the identification of mirnas from non-model organisms is both practicable and instrumental in addressing mirna-guided gene regulation. citrus is an important staple fruit tree, and publicly available expressed sequence tag (est) database for citrus are increasing. however, until now, little has been known about mirna in citrus. in this study, 27 known mirnas from arabidopsis were searched against citrus est databases for mirna precursors, of which 13 searched precursor sequences could form fold-back structures similar with those of arabidopsis. the ubiquitous expression of those 13 citrus micrornas and other 13 potential citrus mirnas could be detected in citrus leaf, young shoot, flower, fruit and root by northern blotting, and some of them showed differential expression in different tissues. based on the fact that mirnas exhibit perfect or nearly perfect complementarity with their target sequences, a total of 41 potential targets were identified for 15 citrus mirnas. the majority of the targets are transcription factors that play important roles in citrus development, including leaf, shoot, and root development. additionally, some other target genes appear to play roles in diverse physiological processes. four target genes have been experimentally verified by detection of the mirna-mediated mrna cleavage in poncirus trifoliate. overall, this study in the identification and characterization of mirnas in citrus can initiate further study on citrus mirna regulation mechanisms, and it can help us to know more about the important roles of mirnas in citrus.
immunology	mycobacterium tuberculosis produces dideoxymy-cobactin- 838 (ddm-838), a lipopeptide that potently activates t cells upon binding to the mhc-like antigen-presenting molecule cd1a. m. tuberculosis produces ddm-838 in only trace amounts and a previous solid-phase synthesis provided sub-milligram quantities. we describe a high-yielding solution-phase synthesis of ddm-838 that features a mitsunobu substitution that avoids yield-limiting epimerization at lysine during esterification, and amidation conditions that prevent double-bond isomerization of the z-c20:1 acyl chain, and provides material with equivalent antigenicity to natural ddm-838. isomers of ddm-838 that varied in stereochemistry at the central lysine and the c20:1 acyl chain were compared for their ability to be recognised by cd1a-restricted t cell receptors (tcrs). these tcrs, derived from unrelated human donors, exhibited a similar spectrum of reactivity towards the panel of ddm-838 isomers, highlighting the exquisite sensitivity of lipopeptide-reactive t cells for the natural ddm stereochemistry.
human_metabolism	quercetin, a polyphenol with potential health effects, is absorbed by humans and measurement in plasma can be used as a biomarker for intake. however, the chemical nature of the quercetin in blood is still not known, although one possibility is that glucosides are found in an unchanged form from the original food. we propose that the existence of quercetin glucosides in plasma is unlikely, since the metabolic beta -glucosidase capacity of the small intestine and of the liver is too great for quercetin glucosides to escape deglycosylation. we critically examine the limited number of studies which purport to detect quercetin glycosides in blood and the current evidence for the absorption of these compounds from the gastrointestinal tract. we emphasise the need for comprehensive identification of circulating compounds, since polyphenol glucuronides, the expected metabolites in plasma, have almost identical chromatographic properties to the glucosides at acid ph. studies on the nature of quercetin metabolites in plasma are urgently needed so that the proposed biological activities of quercetin can be re-assessed and that a suitable biomarker of exposure can be established.
human_metabolism	the present work describes the electrochemical reduction of the azo dye sudan iii in methanol/0.01 mol l(-1) bu4nbf4 at applied potential of -1.2v, which promotes 98% discoloration of the commercial sample. the reduction products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, after optimized conditions for 20 aromatic amines with carcinogenic potentiality. the harmful compounds such as: aniline, benzidine, o-toluidine, 2,6-dimethylaniline, 4,4'-oxydianiline, 4,4'-metileno-bis-2-methylaniline and 4-aminobiphenyl are formed after azo bond cleavage. the electrochemical reduction is compared with chemical reduction by using sodium thiosulfate. our findings illustrates that commercial sudan iii under reductive condition can forms a number of products, which some are known active genotoxins. the technique could be used to mimic important redox reactions in human metabolism or environment, highlighting the possible formation of by-products more toxic than the original dyes.
human_metabolism	scope: flavanol-rich foods are known to exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. the biological effects depend on bioavailability of flavanols which may be influenced by food matrix and dose ingested. we compared the bioavailability and dose-response of epicatechin from whole apple and an epicatechin-rich extract, and the effects on plasma and urinary nitric oxide (no) metabolites. methods and results: in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, subjects consumed drinks containing 70 and 140 mg epicatechin from an apple extract and an apple puree containing 70 mg epicatechin. blood and urine samples were collected for 24 h post ingestion. maximum plasma concentration, auc((0-24 h)), absorption and urinary excretion were all significantly higher after ingestion of both epicatechin drinks compared with apple puree (p < 0.05). time to maximum plasma concentration was significantly later for the puree compared with the drinks (p2-fold higher after ingestion of the 140 mg epicatechin drink compared to the 70 mg epicatechin drink (p < 0.05). excretion of no metabolites was higher for all test products compared with placebo, which was significant for the high dose drink (p = 0.016). conclusions: oral bioavailability of apple epicatechin increases at higher doses, is reduced by whole apple matrix and has the potential to increase no bioavailability.
molecular_biology	advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) has long been a diagnosis with few treatment options and poor outcomes. however, recent discoveries about the molecular biology of nsclc are changing the way it is treated. driver mutations that cause uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation have been discovered in some types of nsclc. this has led to the discovery of therapies that can target a specific driver mutation in advanced nsclc and halt cancer progression. this article reviews standard treatment of nsclc and explores the targetable mutations of nsclc, available targeted treatments, treatment obstacles, and the future of targeted therapy in nsclc.
molecular_biology	background-circulating levels of chemerin are significantly higher in hypertensive patients and positively correlate with blood pressure. chemerin activates chemokine-like receptor 1 (cmklr1 or chemr23) and is proposed to activate the ""orphan"" g protein-coupled receptor 1 (gpr1), which has been linked with hypertension. our aim was to localize chemerin. cmklr1, and gpr1 in the human vasculature and determine whether 1 or both of these receptors mediate vasoconstriction. methods and results-using immunohistochemistry and molecular biology in conduit arteries and veins and resistance vessels, we localized chemerin to endothelium, smooth muscle, and adventitia and found that cmklr1 and gpr1 were widely expressed in smooth muscle. c9 (chemerin149-157) contracted human saphenous vein (pd(2)=7.30 +/- 0.31) and resistance arteries (pd(2)=7.05 +/- 0.54) and increased blood pressure in rats by 9.1 +/- 1.0 mm hg at 200 nmol. crucially, these in vitro and in vivo vascular actions were blocked by ccx832, which we confirmed to be highly selective for cmklr1 over gpr1. c9 inhibited camp accumulation in human aortic smooth muscle cells and preconstricted rat aorta, consistent with the observed vasoconstrictor action. downstream signaling was explored further and, compared to chemerin. c9 showed a bias factor=approximate to 5000 for the gi protein pathway, suggesting that cmklr1 exhibits biased agonism. conclusions-our data suggest that chemerin acts at cmklr1, but not gpr1, to increase blood pressure. chemerin has an established detrimental role in metabolic syndrome, and these direct vascular actions may contribute to hypertension, an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. this study provides proof of principle for the therapeutic potential of selective cmklr1 antagonists.
immunology	in this study, we attempted to explore the effect and possible mechanism of andrographolide on ova-induced asthma. ova challenge induced significant airway inflammatory cell recruitment and lung histological alterations, which were ameliorated by andrographolide. the protein levels of cytokines in bron-choalveolar fluid (balf) and serum were reduced by andrographolide administration as well as the mrna levels in lung tissue. mechanically, andrographolide markedly hampered the activation of nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b) and nlrp3 inflammasome both in vivo and vitro thus decreased levels of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. finally, we confirmed that ros scavenging was responsible for andrographolide 's inactivation of nf-kappa b and nlrp3 inflammasome signaling. our study here revealed the effect and possible mechanism of andrographolide on asthma, which may represent a new therapeutic approach for treating this disease.
northern_blotting	some of the main concerns with in vivo application of naked small interfering rna are rapid degradation and urinary excretion resulting in a short plasma half-life. in this study we investigated how conjugation of polyethylene glycol ( peg) with variable chain length affects sirna pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. the peg chains were conjugated to chemically stabilized sirna at the 5 ' terminal end of the passenger strand using click chemistry. the sirna conjugate remained functionally active and showed significantly prolonged circulation in the blood stream after intravenous injection. sirna conjugated with 20kda peg (peg20k-sirna) was most persistent, approximately 50% peg20k-sirna remained ih post-injection, while the uncoupled sirna was rapidly removed >90% at 15min. in vivo fluorescent imaging of the living animal showed increased concentration of sirna in peripheral tissue and delayed urine excretion when coupled to peg 20k. biodistribution studies by northern blotting revealed equal distribution of conjugated sirna in liver, kidney, spleen and lung without significant degradation 24 h post-injection. our study demonstrates that peg conjugated sirna can be applied as a delivery system to improve sirna bioavailability in vivo and may potentially increase the efficiency of sirna in therapeutic applications.
human_metabolism	sixteen novel derivatives of 1,1,1-tris (salicylaldiminomethyl)ethane have been synthesized for the purpose of encapsulating tc-99m(iv) ions and generating new tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals. two methods for the preparation of the tc-99g(iv) analog complexes are presented; one utilizes sncl2 reduction on (tco4-)-tc-99g and the other a direct substitution route starting with [(tccl6)-tc-99g](2-). free ligands (h(3)l) are characterized by melting points, h-1 nmr, c-13 nmr, mass spectroscopy, tlc, and/or elemental analyses. [(99g)tcl](+) complexes are characterized by fab-ms, uv-vis, ir and/or cv. an x-ray structural analysis was performed on a crystal of [m(6,6'-[[2-[[((4-methoxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene)-amino]methyl]-2-methyl-1,3-propanediyl]bis(nitrilomethylidyne)]-bis-3-methoxyphenol)] tetraphenylborate, where m represents a 1/3 isomorphous mixture of tc-99g/sn as determined by sem. the metal coordination site is 6-coordinate, composed of n3o3 donor atoms, and intermediate between octahedral and trigonal prismatic geometry. the [(99m)tcl](+) complexes were prepared in a stannous environment; equivalence of the tc-99m and tc-99g complexes is demonstrated by hplc techniques. the [snl](+) complex was prepared for comparison purposes. an unusual ligand oxidation occurs for one series of ligands in which in situ amine -->imine conversion is observed during the complexation reaction in reducing media. guinea pig, rat, dog, and human metabolism studies are reported for selected [(99m)tcl](+) complexes, the myocardial uptake of which approaches 2% of the injected dose.
molecular_biology	thermal tetrachloroethene (pce) remediation by steam injection in a sandy aquifer led to the release of dissolved organic carbon (doc) from aquifer sediments resulting in more reduced redox conditions, accelerated pce biodegradation, and changes in microbial populations. these changes were documented by comparing data collected prior to the remediation event and eight years later. based on the premise that dual c-cl isotope slopes reflect ongoing degradation pathways, the slopes associated with pce and tce suggest the predominance of biotic reductive dechlorination near the source area. pce was the predominant chlorinated ethene near the source area prior to thermal treatment. after thermal treatment, cdce became predominant. the biotic contribution to these changes was supported by the presence of dehalococcoides sp. dna (dhc) and dhc targeted rrna close to the source area. in contrast, dual c-ci isotope analysis together with the almost absent vc c-13 depletion in comparison to cdce c-13 depletion suggested that cdce was subject to abiotic degradation due to the presence of pyrite, possible surface-bound iron (ii) or reduced iron sulphides in the downgradient part of the plume. this interpretation is supported by the relative lack of dhc in the downgradient part of the plume. the results of this study show that thermal remediation can enhance the biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes, and that this effect can be traced to the mobilisation of doc due to steam injection. this, in turn, results in more reduced redox conditions which favor active reductive dechlorination and/or may lead to a series of redox reactions which may consecutively trigger biotically induced abiotic degradation. finally, this study illustrates the valuable complementary application of compound-specific isotopic analysis combined with molecular biology tools to evaluate which biogeochemical processes are taking place in an aquifer contaminated with chlorinated ethenes.

molecular_biology	background: wound healing is often impaired in diabetic animals and humans. matrix metalloproteases act as proinflammatory agents in physiological wound healing pathways by stimulating cytokines including the interleukins, il6, il1a and il1b, and the tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor beta1. botanicals are traditionally used to assist healing of different types of wounds, because they produce fewer side effects. our specific aim here was to develop a plant-based recipe supporting effective wound healing in diabetic animals. methods: plant materials from adiantum capillus-veneris, commiphora molmol, aloe vera, and henna were collected for this study, and oven-dried at 60 degrees c. the dried leaves and resins were then crumbled into a powder and mixed in equal parts with vaseline as a preservative. this mixture was used as an ointment on wounds induced in 60 diabetic and non-diabetic rats that were divided into 6 subgroups receiving agent or control treatments. necrotic tissue surrounding the wound was periodically removed during wound healing. rna was extracted from the healing region of the wound at days 7, 14 and 21 for cdna synthesis to monitor changes in tgfb1, mmp3, mmp9, il6 and tnf alpha expression using real-time pcr. results: the expression of the mmp3, the tnf alpha, and the tgfb1 genes from wound tissue were significantly different (p0.05) of the mmp9 gene expression in diabetic and non-diabetic rats treated only with vaseline after 7, 14, and 21 days. but, the expression of the mmp9 gene decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in diabetic rats after 14 days in comparison to non-diabetic rats, when the herbal mixture was added to vaseline. conclusions: our study presents an herbal treatment that alters the gene expression signature at wounds induced in the rat model for type i diabetes in a manner consistent with accelerated healing, and demonstrates that this herbal treatment might be effective to treat wounds in diabetic patients.
immunology	background: although discovery research has identified the importance of dozens of pro-and anti-inflammatory immune mediators in the pathogenesis, maintenance, exacerbation and resolution of inflammatory diseases, most human cohort studies have incorporated few or no immunological intermediate phenotypes in their analyses. significant hindrances have been (1) the limited panel of biomarkers known to be readily detected in healthy human populations and (2) the stability, hence utility, of such biomarkers to repeated analysis. methods: the frequency and stability of 14 plasma biomarkers linked to in vivo immune regulation of allergic and autoimmune inflammatory disorders was determined in 140 healthy pediatric and adult participants. the impact of initial and multiple subsequent freeze/thaw cycles on pro-inflammatory (ccl2, cxcl10, il-18, tnf alpha, il-6), anti-inflammatory (il-10, stnf-rii, il-1ra), acute phase proteins (crp, ptx3) and other biomarkers (sst2, il-1racp) was subsequently quantified. results: multiple biomarkers capable of providing an innate immune signature of inflammation were readily detected directly ex vivo in healthy individuals. these biomarker levels were unaffected when comparing paired data sets from freshly obtained, never frozen plasma or serum and matched aliquots despite extensive freeze/thaw cycles. neither age nor sex affected stability. similarly, no quantitative differences were found following repetitive analysis of inflammatory biomarkers in culture samples obtained following in vitro stimulation with tlr and rlr ligands. conclusions: a broad panel of in vivo and ex vivo cytokine, chemokine and acute phase protein biomarkers that have been linked to human chronic inflammatory disorders are readily detected in vivo and remain stable for analysis despite multiple freeze thaw cycles. these data provide the foundation and confidence for large scale analyses of panels of inflammatory biomarkers to provide better understanding of immunological mechanisms underlying health versus disease.
human_metabolism	introduction: background to metabolomics metabolomics is the comprehensive study of the metabolome, the repertoire of biochemicals (or small molecules) present in cells, tissues, and body fluids. the study of metabolism at the global or ""-omics"" level is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to have a profound impact upon medical practice. at the center of metabolomics, is the concept that a person 's metabolic state provides a close representation of that individual 's overall health status. this metabolic state reflects what has been encoded by the genome, and modified by diet, environmental factors, and the gut microbiome. the metabolic profile provides a quantifiable readout of biochemical state from normal physiology to diverse pathophysiologies in a manner that is often not obvious from gene expression analyses. today, clinicians capture only a very small part of the information contained in the metabolome, as they routinely measure only a narrow set of blood chemistry analytes to assess health and disease states. examples include measuring glucose to monitor diabetes, measuring cholesterol and high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein ratio to assess cardiovascular health, bun and creatinine for renal disorders, and measuring a panel of metabolites to diagnose potential inborn errors of metabolism in neonates. objectives of white paper-expected treatment outcomes and metabolomics enabling tool for precision medicine we anticipate that the narrow range of chemical analyses in current use by the medical community today will be replaced in the future by analyses that reveal a far more comprehensive metabolic signature. this signature is expected to describe global biochemical aberrations that reflect patterns of variance in states of wellness, more accurately describe specific diseases and their progression, and greatly aid in differential diagnosis. such future metabolic signatures will: (1) provide predictive, prognostic, diagnostic, and surrogate markers of diverse disease states; (2) inform on underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases; (3) allow for sub-classification of diseases, and stratification of patients based on metabolic pathways impacted; (4) reveal biomarkers for drug response phenotypes, providing an effective means to predict variation in a subject 's response to treatment (pharmacometabolomics); (5) define a metabotype for each specific genotype, offering a functional read-out for genetic variants: (6) provide a means to monitor response and recurrence of diseases, such as cancers: (7) describe the molecular landscape in human performance applications and extreme environments. importantly, sophisticated metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools have recently been developed that make it possible to measure thousands of metabolites in blood, other body fluids, and tissues. such tools also enable more robust analysis of response to treatment. new insights have been gained about mechanisms of diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and a range of pathologies. a series of ground breaking studies supported by national institute of health (nih) through the pharmacometabolomics research network and its partnership with the pharmacogenomics research network illustrate how a patient 's metabotype at baseline, prior to treatment, during treatment, and post-treatment, can inform about treatment outcomes and variations in responsiveness to drugs (e.g., statins, antidepressants, antihypertensives and antiplatelet therapies). these studies along with several others also exemplify how metabolomics data can complement and inform genetic data in defining ethnic, sex, and gender basis for variation in responses to treatment, which illustrates how pharmacometabolomics and pharmacogenomics are complementary and powerful tools for precision medicine. conclusions: key scientific concepts and recommendations for precision medicine our metabolomics community believes that inclusion of metabolomics data in precision medicine initiatives is timely and will provide an extremely valuable layer of data that compliments and informs other data obtained by these important initiatives. our metabolomics society, through its ""precision medicine and pharmacometabolomics task group"", with input from our metabolomics community at large, has developed this white paper where we discuss the value and approaches for including metabolomics data in large precision medicine initiatives. this white paper offers recommendations for the selection of state of-the-art metabolomics platforms and approaches that offer the widest biochemical coverage, considers critical sample collection and preservation, as well as standardization of measurements, among other important topics. we anticipate that our metabolomics community will have representation in large precision medicine initiatives to provide input with regard to sample acquisition/preservation, selection of optimal omics technologies, and key issues regarding data collection, interpretation, and dissemination. we strongly recommend the collection and biobanking of samples for precisionmedicine initiatives that will take into consideration needs for large-scale metabolic phenotyping studies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	whipple 's disease is a rare infectious disease that can be fatal if left untreated. the disease is caused by infection with tropheryma whipplei, a bacterium that may be more common than was initially assumed. most patients present with nonspecific symptoms, and as routine cultivation of the bacterium is not feasible, it is difficult to diagnose this infection. on the other hand, due to the generic symptoms, infection with this bacterium is actually quite often in the differential diagnosis. the gold standard for diagnosis used to be periodic acid-schiff (pas) staining of duodenal biopsy specimens, but pas staining has a poor specificity and sensitivity. the development of molecular techniques has resulted in more convenient methods for detecting t. whipplei infections, and this has greatly improved the diagnosis of this often missed infection. in addition, the molecular detection of t. whipplei has resulted in an increase in knowledge about its pathogenicity, and this review gives an overview of the new insights in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of tropheryma whipplei infections.
human_metabolism	the contribution of gordonibacter to the different abilities, both qualitative and quantitative, of individuals to transform dietary ellagic acid into anti-inflammatory urolithins was investigated. a specific and suitable q-pcr system was developed for the detection and quantification of gordonibacter. ellagic acid metabolism in the gut and faecal microbiota of healthy individuals, who consumed walnuts (n = 20) or a pomegranate extract (n = 49), were studied. urolithin-a was positively correlated to gordonibacter in faeces, whereas excretion of isourolithin-a and/or urolithin-b was inversely correlated to both. the relationship between gordonibacter and urolithin-a found in vivo was also confirmed in vitro. this suggests that the beneficial effects attributed to the consumption of foods containing ellagic acid could be mediated by the individuals' gordonibacter levels. the development of prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotic aimed at increasing gordonibacter and related species could improve the individual 's ability to produce the anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and anticancer metabolite urolithin-a.

northern_blotting	gene expression is regulated at several levels in plants, and one of the most recently discovered regulatory layers involve short rnas. short rnas are produced through several pathways and target either mrnas or genomic dna. different classes of short rnas have slightly different sizes and detection of their accumulation is an important step in validating and studying non-coding short rnas. northern blotting is routinely used to detect short rnas because it gives information about both the amount and size of the analysed short rnas. choice of the right rna extraction protocol is crucial when short rnas are being studied, because several routinely used commercial rna extraction kits do not yield any short rnas. this chapter describes optimised rna extraction methods, which give good yields of short rnas, and separation, transfer and hybridisation protocols to study the accumulation of short rnas.
cell_biology	objective: the objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on the resorption activity of osteoclast cell cultures. design: raw 264.7 cells were cultured and seeded over plates that were pre-coated with a synthetic carbonate apatite, and marked with fluoresceinamine-labeled sodium chondroitin polysulfate. plates were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the treatment assigned to each one of them: no rankl (no rank-l addition and no ultrasound application), no lipus (addition of rank-l and no ultrasound application), lipus 10 (addition of rank-l and 10 min of ultrasound application per day), and lipus 20 (addition of rank-l and 20 min of ultrasound application per day). the ultrasound device produced 1.5 mhz pulses with a repetition rate of 1 khz and intensity of 30 mw/cm(2). the experiment extended for one week and afterwards, resorption activity was evaluated according to the fluorescence intensity analysis and pit resorption measurements (number of pits and mean area). results: our experiment consistently demonstrated that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound application enhanced osteoclasts resorptive activity. in addition, it was demonstrated that when daily ultrasound application lasted longer (20 min) the resorption was the highest. results obtained from both evaluation methods were reasonably coherent. conclusions: low-intensity pulsed ultrasound increases osteoclast resorptive activity in the absence of osteoblasts. this effect seems to be influenced by ultrasound treatment time. future research might be directed to investigate osteoclast response to different ultrasound application protocols (frequencies and intensities) and potential cellular mechanisms.

polymerase_chain_reaction	long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) have emerged recently as important factors in regulating fundamental biological processes. alterations in the expression and function of lncrnas have been observed to promote tumor formation, progression and metastasis. although downregulation of the expression levels of let lncrna in several tumors has been reported, its role in gastric cancer remains unknown. the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and function of let in gastric cancer development. the expression levels of let in 37 pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr). in addition, let expression in gastric cancer cell lines was analyzed by rt-qpcr assay analysis. furthermore, the impact of let on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit-8, wound scratch and elisa assays, respectively. the results demonstrated that the expression level of let was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines (sgc-7901 and mgc-803) compared with normal tissues and a normal human gastric epithelial cell line (ges-1). restoration of let expression using a synthesized recombinant overexpression vector transfected into sgc-7901 and mgc-803 cells, significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. the present study is the first to demonstrate that let may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. the results indicate that let may be a promising biomarker and/or a therapeutic target for gastric cancer.
northern_blotting	conditionally transformed human myocardial cell lines would be a valuable resource for studying human cardiac cell biology. we generated clonal human fetal cardiocyte cell lines by transfection of fetal ventricular cardiac cell clones with a plasmid containing a replication-defective mutant of the temperature-sensitive sv40 strain tsa58. multiple resulting cell lines showed similar features, namely: (1) t antigen (tag) expression at both permissive (34 degrees c) and restrictive (40.5 degrees c) temperatures; (2) extended growth capacity in comparison with parental wild type, when grown at the permissive temperature; (3) both temperature-dependent and serum-responsive growth, and; (4) an incompletely differentiated fetal phenotype which was similar at both permissive and restrictive temperatures and in the presence and absence of serum. the transformed myocyte phenotype was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry, western and northern blotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). cell lines expressed skeletal alpha-actin, atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), and keratins, but no sarcomeric myosin heavy chain or desmin. immunoreactive sarcomeric actin was expressed predominantly as a truncated protein of approximately 38 kd. the phenotype of the transformed cells differs from that of the wild-type parental cells as well as from those reported by others who have used tag to immortalize rodent or human ventricular myocytes. our cell lines should provide a useful tool for study of the molecular mechanisms regulating growth and differentiation in human cardiac muscle cells.
immunology	background studies of children with food allergy typically only include the mother and have not investigated the relationship between the amount of allergen needed to elicit a clinical reaction (threshold) and health-related quality of life (hrql). our aims were (i) to compare self-reported and parent-reported hrql in different age groups, (ii) to evaluate the impact of severity of allergic reaction and threshold on hrql, and (iii) to investigate factors associated with patient-reported and parent-reported hrql. methods age-appropriate food allergy quality of life questionnaires (faqlq) were completed by 73 children, 49 adolescents and 29 adults with peanut, hazelnut or egg allergy. parents (197 mothers, 120 fathers) assessed their child 's hrql using the faqlq-parent form. clinical data and threshold values were obtained from a hospital database. significant factors for hrql were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression. results female patients reported greater impact of food allergy on hrql than males did. egg and hazelnut thresholds did not affect hrql, but lower peanut threshold was associated with worse hrql. both parents scored their child 's hrql better than the child 's own assessment, but whereas mother-reported hrql was significantly affected by limitations in the child 's social life, father-reported hrql was affected by limitations in the family 's social life. severity of allergic reaction did not contribute significantly to hrql. conclusion the risk of accidental allergen ingestion and limitations in social life are associated with worse hrql. fathers provide a unique perspective and should have a greater opportunity to contribute to food allergy research.
southern_blotting	tristetraprolin (ttp) is a ccch tandem zinc finger protein that can bind to and destabilize certain mrnas containing au-rich element (are) binding sites. in this study, a novel porcine cdna has been isolated by expressed sequence tag assembly and subsequently confirmed by rt-pcr analysis, and designated porcine ttp (pottp). the open reading frame of the pottp cdna is 981 bp, encoding 326 amino acids. the pottp gene is approximately 2.5 kb in size and contains a single intron. southern blotting analysis demonstrated that it is a single copy gene. real-time quantitative pcr analysis revealed that the pottp gene is constitutively expressed in all detected tissues, and with the highest mrna level in lymphoid tissues spleen and thymus. recombinant his6-tagged pottp protein and its two zinc finger mutants (c146g and h127i) were efficiently expressed and purified from escherichia coli bl21 (de3), respectively. in vitro, rna-electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed a direct interaction between pottp protein and porcine tnf-alpha (potnf-alpha) mrna are probe; this interaction was eliminated when using either two zinc finger mutants of pottp. consistently, mutations within the are region prevented the binding interaction between recombinant pottp protein and potnf-alpha mrna are probe. these results indicate that pottp is an are-binding protein that might regulate the turnover of certain mrnas in vivo.
human_metabolism	investigations utilizing recombinant human xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes as well as human hepatocytes have revealed a number of interactions not only between different environmental chemicals (ecs) but also between ecs and endogenous metabolites. organophosphorus insecticides (ops) are potent inhibitors of the human metabolism of carbaryl, carbofuran, deet and fipronil, as well as the jet fuel components, nonane and naphthalene. ops are potent irreversible inhibitors of testosterone metabolism by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 and of estradiol metabolism by cyp3a4 and cyp1a2. all of these cyp inhibitions are believed to be due to the release of reactive sulfur during cyp-catalyzed oxidative desulfuration. it has also been shown that the esterase(s) responsible for the initial step in permethrin metabolism in human liver is inhibited by both chlorpyrifos oxon and carbaryl. a number of pesticides, including chlorpyrifos, fipronil and permethrin, and the repellent, deet, have been shown to be inducers of cyp isoforms in human hepatocytes, with fipronil being the most potent. several agrochemicals, including fipronil and the pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin, show toxicity toward human hepatocytes with fipronil being the most potent in this regard. endosulfan-alpha, which has shown promise as a model substrate for phenotyping cyp3a4 and cyp2b6 in human liver microsomes, is also an inducer of cyp2b6, acting through the pxr receptor.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: the properties of self-renewal and division in spermatogonial stem cells (sscs) support spermatogenesis. there is a number of reported methods for in vitro ssc culture systems. the development of a culture system that effectively supports isolation and self-renewal of germline stem cells (gscs) is of tremendous benefit for clinical trials, experimental research, and as potential treatment for male infertility. the current study aims to consider the cultivation and behavior of gscs in a non-adherent culture system. materials and methods: in this experimental study, we cultured testicular cells from neonatal mice in agarose coated plates in the presence of dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium (dmem) medium (ctrl group), 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs)+dmem (10% group), and growth factor (g group) that contained 2% fbs, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf), epidermal growth factor (egf), and fibroblast growth factor (fgf). mouse spermatogonial stem-like colonies were isolated approximately 3 weeks after digestion of the testis tissue. after passages 2-3, the identity of the mouse spermatogonial stem-like cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and flow cytometry against the germ cell markers alpha 6, beta 1, c-kit, thy-1, c-ret, plzf, and oct4. the statistical significance between mean values in different groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance (anova). results: we observed spermatogonial stem-like colonies in the g and 10% groups, but not the ctrl group. immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and rt-pcr confirmed expressions of germ cell markers in these cells. in the spermatogonial stem-like cells, we observed a significant expression (p<0.05) of germ cell markers in the g and 10% groups versus the testis cells (t). their proliferative and apoptotic activities were examined by ki67 and pi/annexin v-fitc. alkaline phosphatase assay showed that mouse spermatogonial stem-like colonies were partially positive. conclusion: a non-adherent culture system could provide a favorable method for in vitro short-term culture of spermatogonial stem-like cell colonies.
northern_blotting	colorectal carcinoma (crc) is a malignant solid tumor arising from the large intestine and is associated with an increasing incidence and poor prognosis. further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying crc may contribute to the development of novel effective therapeutic strategies. micrornas (mirs), including mir-155, have been reported to be associated with the etiology and biology of crc; however, the molecular mechanisms by which mir-155 affect crc remain to be fully elucidated. the present study used a multidisciplinary approach, involving reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, northern blotting, mtt assay, cell cycle progression analysis, immunoblotting, and animal experiments, to determine the possible targets of mir-155 in crc cells. mir-155 was found to be overexpressed in crc tissue samples, compared with paired normal colon tissue samples. in addition, the inhibition of mir-155 induced a deceleration in crc cell proliferation and inactivation of the wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. mir-155 suppression also reduced the growth of crc xenografts in an animal model. hmg-box transcription factor 1 (hbp1) was identified as a novel target of mir-155, which mediated its effect on crc via the wnt/-catenin pathway. furthermore, patients with crc exhibiting higher serum levels of mir-155 exhibited reduced survival rates. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that mir-155 may contribute to the progression and growth of crc by enhancing the wnt/-catenin pathway in an hbp1-associated mechanism. therefore, mir-155 may be considered a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of crc.
human_metabolism	background. the question whether even-chain fatty acids can be converted into glucose has a long-standing tradition in biochemistry. since the glyoxylate shunt is absent from mammals, the question has been considered to be solved. it is of particular relevance for understanding the metabolic state of natives of the arctic regions due to the very high fat content of their traditional diet only containing negligible amounts of carbohydrates. methods & results. using an in silico approach, we discovered several hitherto unknown routes in human metabolism that allow the conversion of even-chain fatty acids into carbohydrates in humans. these pathways proceed via ketogenesis over the intermediate of acetone and produce the gluconeogenic precursor pyruvate. while these pathways can make a contribution to glucose production during times of limited carbohydrate supply, we found that their capacity might be limited due to a high demand in reducing equivalents in acetone degradation. considering the traditional diet of natives of the arctic regions, the detected pathways are not only important in order to improve carbohydrate supply, but moreover reduce the amount of protein that needs to be used for gluconeogenesis. conclusion. in summary, our study sheds new light on our understanding of the metabolic state of natives from the arctic regions on their traditional diet. moreover, they provide an avenue for new analyses that can reveal how humans have adapted metabolically to a practically carbohydrate-free diet.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: many micrornas (mirnas) have recently been shown to demonstrate critical roles in differentiation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs). methods and results: in this study, a certain amount of mirna expression in vsmcs was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and it was found that microrna-30e (mir-30e) was expressed more strongly than other common vascular well-expressed mirnas in vitro. subsequently, both a gain and loss of function study was performed in vitro and in vivo. it was found that mir-30e in vsmcs was strongly downregulated concomitantly with stimulation, and mir-30e inhibited vsmcs proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. furthermore, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2i (ube2i) was identified as the target gene of endogenous mir-30e by luciferase reporter assay, and it was confirmed that overexpression of mir-30e significantly reduced ube2i and inhibited the phenotypic switch of vsmcs. knockdown of ube2i had an influence over the proliferation and migration of cultured vsmcs, as same as the mir-30e mimic did. overexpression of mir-30e induced the apoptosis of vsmcs and deregulated the protein expression of ikba, which is crucial for the nf.b signal pathway. conclusions: the results of this study indicated that mir-30e in vsmcs exerted an anti-atherosclerosis effect via inhibiting proliferation and migration, and promoting apoptosis of vsmcs. more specifically, it was demonstrated that mir-30e exhibited these effects on vsmcs partially through targeting ube2i and downregulating the i kappa ba/nf kappa b signaling pathway.
molecular_biology	aims in cystic and solid pancreatic lesions, kras mutational status refines the diagnosis of uncertain endoscopic ultrasound (eus) aspirates. this test should have a fast turnaround time and ideally be performed at the centre where the patient is diagnosed. the idylla kras mutation test enables standardisation even in units without molecular expertise. methods the idylla test was designed for use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) sections. however, we directly pipetted 3 mu l (corresponding to 1/10th of a dna preparation from the aspirate sample) in the cartridge, which was automatically run as if an ffpe sample had been inserted. the performance was compared with sanger sequencing, allele specific locked nucleic acid pcr (aslnaqpcr), and 454 next generation sequencing (454-ngs) in light of clinicopathological end points. results idylla yielded valid results in 49/52 (94.2%) cases, in 2h. a total of 18/49 cases showed mutation either in kras exon 2 (14/18) or in exon 3 (4/18). idylla kras test had 100% specificity and a sensitivity (55.1%) higher than sanger sequencing (41.3%) and identical to aslnaqpcr (55.1%). when the low-abundant mutant allele (<5%) cases were excluded from the analysis, the idylla kras mutation test clinical sensitivity increased to 61.9% approaching that of 454-ngs (66.6%). conclusions this is the first study that applied the novel idylla kras test to the clinical setting of pancreatic cancer. in particular, this system can be easily implemented in the routine assessment of pancreatic eus-fine-needle aspiration-derived dna samples to quickly provide information on kras mutational status to supplement cytological evaluation.
enzymology	objective recent studies suggest that the e-selectin ligands expressed on human leukocytes may differ from those in other species, particularly mice. to elaborate on this, we evaluated the impact of glycosphingolipids expressed on human myeloid cells in regulating e-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. approach and results a series of modified human cell lines and primary neutrophils were created by targeting udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase using either lentivirus-delivered shrna or crispr-cas9-based genome editing. enzymology and mass spectrometry confirm that the modified cells had reduced or abolished glucosylceramide biosynthesis. glycomics profiling showed that udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase disruption also increased prevalence of bisecting n-glycans and reduced overall sialoglycan expression on leukocyte n- and o-glycans. microfluidics-based flow chamber studies demonstrated that both the udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase knockouts and knockdowns display approximate to 60% reduction in leukocyte rolling and firm adhesion on e-selectin bearing stimulated endothelial cells, without altering cell adhesion to p-selectin. consistent with the concept that the glycosphingolipids support slow rolling and the transition to firm arrest, inhibiting udp-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase activity resulted in frequent leukocyte detachment events, skipping motion, and reduced diapedesis across the endothelium. cells bearing truncated o- and n-glycans also sustained cell rolling on e-selectin, although their ability to be recruited from free fluid flow was diminished. conclusions glycosphingolipids likely contribute to human myeloid cell adhesion to e-selectin under fluid shear, particularly the transition of rolling cells to firm arrest.
human_metabolism	the kinetic equivalency of propylene glycol monomethyl ether (pgme), derived from propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (pgmea), as well as the parent compound (pgme) following intravenous administration to fischer 344 rats was evaluated. in addition, in vitro hydrolysis rates of pgmea in blood and liver tissue from rats and humans were determined. the blood kinetics were determined following iv administration to rats of pgme and pgmea of low [10 and 14.7 mg/kg body weight (bw)] or high (100 and 147 mg/kg) equimolar dosages of pgme and pgmea, respectively. the blood time courses of pgme elimination for both dosages of both compounds were identical. half-lives of pgmea elimination following iv administration of 14.7 or 147 mg pgmea/kg bw were calculated to be 1.6 and 2.3 min, respectively. rat and human in vitro hydrolysis rates of pgmea were determined by incubation of 5 or 50 mug pgmea/ml in whole blood or liver homogenate. the rate of loss of pgmea was more rapid in rat blood than in human blood, with hydrolysis half-lives of 36 and 34 min in human blood and 16 and 15 min in rat blood for the 5 and 50 mug/ml concentrations of pgmea, respectively. in contrast the rate of loss of pgmea in human and rat liver homogenate incubations was similar, 27-30 min and 34 min, respectively. these data demonstrate the rapid hydrolysis of pgmea in vivo to its parent glycol ether, pgme and that, once hydrolyzed, the kinetics for pgme derived from pgmea are identical to that for pgme. this study supports the use of the toxicological database on pgme as a surrogate for pgmea.
northern_blotting	an h+-ppase gene, tsvp from thellungiella halophila, was transferred into two cotton (gossypium hirsutum) varieties (lumianyan19 and lumianyan 21) and southern and northern blotting analysis showed the foreign gene was integrated into the cotton genome and expressed. the measurement of isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles demonstrated that the transgenic plants had higher v-h+-ppase activity compared with wild-type plants (wt). overexpressing tsvp in cotton improved shoot and root growth, and transgenic plants were much more resistant to osmotic/drought stress than the wt. under drought stress conditions, transgenic plants had higher chlorophyll content, improved photosynthesis, higher relative water content of leaves and less cell membrane damage than wt. we ascribe these properties to improved root development and the lower solute potential resulting from higher solute content such as soluble sugars and free amino acids in the transgenic plants. in this study, the average seed cotton yields of transgenic plants from lumianyan 19 and lumianyan 21 were significantly increased compared with those of wt after exposing to drought stress for 21 days at flowering stage. the average seed cotton yields were 51 and 40% higher than in their wt counterparts, respectively. this study benefits efforts to improve cotton yields in arid and semiarid regions.
immunology	previous research has found patients with the fc gamma riiib na1 variant having increased risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) resistance in kawasaki disease (kd). our previous studies revealed that elevated fc gamma riia expression correlated with the susceptibility of kd patients. we conducted this research to determine whether and how fc gamma receptors affect the susceptibility, ivig treatment response, and coronary artery lesions (cal) of kd patients. the activating fc gamma riia and inhibitory fc gamma riib methylation levels of seven patients with kd and four control subjects were examined using humanmethylation27 beadchip. we enrolled a total of 44 kd patients and 10 control subjects with fevers. we performed real-time rt-pcr to determine the fc.riia and fc.riib expression levels, as well as a luciferase assay of fc gamma riia. we found a considerable increase in methylation of both fc gamma riia and fc gamma riib in kd patients undergoing ivig treatment. promoter methylation of fc gamma riia inhibited reporter activity in k562 cells using luciferase assay. the fc gamma riib mrna expression levels were not found to increase susceptibility, cal formation, or ivig resistance. fc gamma riia mrna expression levels were significantly higher in ivig-resistant patients than in those that responded to ivig during the pre-treatment period. furthermore, the fc gamma riia/ iib mrna expression ratio was considerably higher in kd patients with cal than in those without cal. fc gamma riia and fc gamma riib both demonstrated increased methylation levels in kd patients that underwent ivig treatment. fc gamma riia expression influenced the ivig treatment response of kd patients. the fc gamma riia/ iib mrna expression ratio was greater in kd patients with cal formation.
genetics	nanoscale biosensors, owing to their high-sensitivity and extremely low limits-of-detection, have enabled the realization of highly complex and sophisticated miniaturized platforms for several important healthcare applications, the most predominant one being disease diagnosis. in particular, nanomaterial facilitated electrochemical detection of dna hybridization has had an exceptional impact on fields such as genetics and cancerous mutation detection here we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical platform using electrospun semi-conducting manganese (iii) oxide (mn2o3) nanofibers for dna hybridization detection. the proposed platform coalesces the inherent advantages of metal-oxide nanofibers and electrochemical transduction techniques, resulting in label-free zeptomolar detection of dna hybridization. as proof of concept, we demonstrate zeptomolar detection of dengue consensus primer (limit of detection: 120x10(-21) m) both in control as well as spiked serum samples. our reported detection limit is superior in comparison with previously reported electrochemical dna hybridization sensors for dengue virus detection, spanning both labeled and label-free transductions. this ultra-sensitivity, we believe, is a result of synthesizing a low bandgap electrospun metal-oxide nanomaterial corresponding to a specific oxidation state of manganese. this methodology can be extended for detection of any hybridization of interest by simply adapting an appropriate functionalization protocol and thus is very generic in nature.
polymerase_chain_reaction	gibel carp carassius auratus gibelio (bloch), a commercially important freshwater-cultured fish in china, is threatened by myxosporeans, particularly thelohanellus wuhanensis, myxobolus honghuensis, m. wulii and m. turpisrotundus. here, we developed a multiplex pcr assay for simultaneous detection of these 4 myxosporeans. the specific primers for each species were designed based on the 28s rdna gene of t. wuhanensis, the its-5.8s rdna of m. honghuensis and m. wulii, and the 18s rdna gene of m. turpisrotundus. specificity testing confirmed that the 4 primer sets have no cross-reactivity with other related myxosporean species tested. detection limits of the multiplex pcr assay were 0.2, 0.3, 3.1 and 3.8 spores for t. wuhanensis, m. honghuensis, m. wulii and m. turpisrotundus, respectively. following screening of 104 field samples, the analytical sensitivity of the present multiplex pcr assay was found to be similar to the sensitivity obtained by the singleplex pcr assays and was higher than that of microscopic examination. moreover, kappa analysis showed a strong agreement between the results of the singleplex and multiplex pcr assays, indicating that the developed multiplex pcr assay was an efficient approach for the diagnosis of the 4 myxosporeans infecting gibel carp.
human_metabolism	the metabolism of a variety of anabolic steroids frequently misused for doping purposes has been investigated in the last years. this research mainly focused on main and long-term metabolites suitable for detection, but detailed clearance mechanisms have rarely been elucidated. recent studies on metandienone focused on the identification of 17 beta-hydroxymethyl-17 alpha-methyl-18-norandrosta-1,4,13-trien-3-one (20 beta oh-normd) as long-term metabolite, however, the metabolic pathway of its generation remained unclear. metandienone and its wagner-meerwein rearrangement product 17,17-dimethyl-18-norandrosta-1,4,13- trien-3-one (normd) were hydroxylated by different human cytochrome p450 enzymes (cyps). some of their hydroxylation products were chemically synthesized and characterized by mass spectrometry to allow for their trace detection in urine samples. following oral administration of metandienone or normd in one human volunteer each the post administration urines were checked for the presence of those hydroxylated metabolites using gc-ms/ms analysis. the human mitochondrial steroid hydroxylating enzymes cyp11b1 and cyp11b2 were capable to metabolize metandienone leading to the formation of 11 beta-hydroxymetandienone and 18-hydroxymetandienone. following wagner-meerwein rearrangement, the resulting products could be assigned to 20 beta oh-normd and 11 beta oh-normd. the contribution of cyp11b1 and cyp11b2 in human metabolism of metandienone was confirmed by analysis of post-administration samples of metandienone and normd. combined with the results from a previous study, enzymatic pathways were identified that involve cyp21 and cyp3a4 in the hydroxylation of normd, while cyp21, cyp3a4 and cyp11b2 take part in 20 beta oh-normd generation from md. the current study represents a valuable contribution to the elucidation of clearance mechanisms of anabolic steroids and also indicates that mainly non-liver cyps seem to be involved in these processes (c) 2012 elsevier ireland ltd. all rights reserved.
genetics	this paper details the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system (ats)-an e-learning system that detects and responds to the emotional states of the learner. research into the development of ats is an active and relatively new field, with many studies demonstrating promising results. however, there is often no practical way to apply these findings in real-world settings. the ats described in this paper utilizes a generic affective application model to infer and appropriately respond to the learner 's affective state. this approach brings several advantages, notably the potential direct support for re-use and retrospective addition of affect sensing functionality into existing e-learning software. skin conductivity and heart rate variability measurements were used to infer affective activation and valence. the evaluation involved an experiment in which the effectiveness of the fully functional ats was compared with that of a nonaffective version, and was conducted with 40 adult participants. the evaluation of the effectiveness of this tutoring system showed that measurable improvements in perceived learning may be obtained with a modest level of software development.
cell_biology	new developments in stem cell biology offer alternatives for the reconstruction of critical-sized bone defects. one of these developments is the use of induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells. these stem cells are similar to embryonic stem (es) cells, but can be generated from adult somatic cells and therefore do not raise ethical concerns. proper characterization of ips-derived osteoblasts is important for future development of safe clinical applications of these cells. for this reason, we differentiated mouse es and ips cells toward osteoblasts using osteogenic medium and compared their functionality. immunocytochemical analysis showed significant expression of bone markers (osteocalcin and collagen type i) in osteoblasts differentiated from es and ips cells on days 7 and 30. an in vitro mineralization assay confirmed the functionality of osteogenically differentiated es and ips cells. gene expression arrays focusing on osteogenic differentiation were performed in order to compare the gene expression pattern in both differentiated and undifferentiated es cells and ips cells. we observed a significant upregulation of osteogenesis-related genes such as runx2, osteopontin, collagen type i, tnfsf11, csf1, and alkaline phosphatase upon osteogenic differentiation of the es and ips cells. we further validated the expression of key osteogenic genes runx2, osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen type i, and osterix in both differentiated and undifferentiated es and ips cells by means of quantified real-time polymerase chain reaction. we conclude that es and ips cells are similar in their osteogenic differentiation capacities, as well as in their gene expression patterns.
cell_biology	while therapies targeting the co-inhibitory or immune checkpoint receptors pd-1 and ctla-4 have shown remarkable success in many cancers, not all patients benefit from these therapies. this has catalyzed enormous interest in the targeting of other immune checkpoint receptors. in this regard, tigit and cd96 have recently entered the limelight as novel immune checkpoint receptor targets. tigit and cd96 together with the co-stimulatory receptor cd226 form a pathway that is analogous to the cd28/ctla-4 pathway, in which shared ligands and differential receptor: ligand affinities fine-tune the immune response. although the roles of tigit and cd96 as immune checkpoint receptors in t cell and natural killer cell biology are just beginning to be uncovered, accumulating data support the targeting of these receptors for improving anti-tumor immune responses. a clear understanding of the immune cell populations regulated by tigit and cd96 is key to the design of immunotherapies that target these receptors in combination with other existing immune checkpoint blockade therapies.
enzymology	thermophilic enzymes tend to be less catalytically-active at lower temperatures relative to their mesophilic counterparts, despite having very similar crystal structures. an often cited hypothesis for this general observation is that thermostable enzymes have evolved a more rigid tertiary structure in order to cope with their more extreme, natural environment, but they are also less flexible at lower temperatures, leading to their lower catalytic activity under mesophilic conditions. an alternative hypothesis, however, is that complementary thermophilic-mesophilic enzyme pairs simply operate through different evolutionary-optimized catalytic mechanisms. in this communication, we present evidence that while the steps of the catalytic mechanisms for mesophilic and thermophilic indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (igps) enzymes are fundamentally similar, the identity of the rate-determining step changes as a function of temperature. our findings indicate that while product release is rate-determining at 25 degrees c for thermophilic igps, near its adaptive temperature (75 degrees c), a proton transfer event, involving a general acid, becomes rate-determining. the rate-determining steps for thermophilic and mesophilic igps enzymes are also different at their respective, adaptive temperatures with the mesophilic igps-catalyzed reaction being rate-limited before irreversible co2 release, and the thermophilic igps-catalyzed reaction being rate limited afterwards.

genetics	lake tanganyika has undergone substantial climate-driven lake level fluctuations that have repeatedly changed the distribution and extent of habitat for endemic fishes. here we consider whether patterns of population genetic structure and phenotypic divergence within the cichlid fish telmatochromis temporalis have been affected by changing lake levels. the species has a large-bodied rock-living ecomorph and a small-bodied shell-living ecomorph, and both are found in close proximity in littoral habitats. using mtdna sequences we found that geographically distant (>50 km) populations within the southern lake region diverged approximately 130,000-230,000 years ago, suggesting that the regional genetic structure persisted through a low stand of over 400 m similar to 106,000 years ago that ended with a rise to present levels similar to 100,000 years ago. we also found signatures of large population expansions since this rise across the study region, suggesting that the populations positively responded to new habitat as lake levels rose to present levels. finally, we found that geographically adjacent (< 10 km) ecomorphs exhibit both significant genetic differentiation and signatures of gene flow after the lake level rise. the results suggest that local ecomorph divergence progressed with gene flow after the last major rise in lake level similar to 100,000, potentially facilitated by new ecological opportunities.
polymerase_chain_reaction	fk506 binding protein (fbbp) 14 belongs to the family of fkbps. altered expression of fkbps are observed in several malignancies. the present study aimed to explore the expression and biological function of fkbp14 in gastric cancer. fkbp14 expression levels in 40 gastric cancer samples and matched control samples were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. cell proliferation was evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay. a cell adhesion and a transwell assay were performed to detect cell adhesion and invasion. protein expression was determined using western blot analysis. it was found that fkbp14 expression in gastric cancer tissues was elevated compared with normal tissues. silencing of fkbp14 expression in the gastric cancer mkn-45 and ags cell lines, which have a higher expression level of fkbp14 compared with four other gastric cancer cell lines, significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, adhesion and invasion. in addition, the protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (emt) markers beta-catenin, snail1 and twist were repressed in gastric cancer cells with fkbp14 silenced. in conclusion, fkbp14 may act as an oncogene by suppressing cellular proliferation, adhesion and invasion and emt in gastric carcinogenesis. fkbp14 may be a diagnosis marker and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.
human_metabolism	uric acid is the primary end product from purine derivatives in human metabolism. excessive production of uric acid may lead to gout, hyperuricemia and kidney disorder: different analytical methods for uric acid such as colorimetry, commercial enzyme electrode and commercially available uric acid kit are used widely. the main purpose of this research was to develop,a screen printed electrode based uric acid biosensor using gelatin immobilized uricase enzyme extracted from comamonas sp. btua. the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of uric acid in presence of oxygen, producing allantoin and hydrogen peroxide. the linearity of the standard curve in the concentration ranges from 5.94 x 10(-6) to 4.75 x 10(-4) molar was satisfactory and could be used for the quantitative determination of uric acid in human serum samples. the limit of detection (lod) was 2.26 mu m and sensitivity was evaluated as 3.31 na mu m-1 of uric acid. one modified electrode could be used for six measurements with 95%. accuracy up to 25 days. the developed biosensor was easy to use, inexpensive, sensitive and reliable.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the management of helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection treatment differs from the common treatment protocol for other infectious diseases. because culture-or molecular-guided approaches face several practical issues, such as the invasive procedures required to obtain gastric biopsy specimens and the lack of availability of routine laboratory testing in some places, h. pylori treatment includes the administration of two or three empirically selected antibiotics combined with a proton pump inhibitor rather than evidence-based eradication treatment. the efficacy of empirical therapy is decreasing, mostly due to increasing multiple resistance. multiresistance to levofloxacin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole, which are commonly used in empirical treatments, appears to have increased in many countries. mutations play a primary role in the antimicrobial resistance of h. pylori, but many different mechanisms can be involved in the development of antibiotic resistance. determining and understanding these possible mechanisms might allow the development of new methods for the detection of h. pylori and the determination of antimicrobial resistance. a treatment based on the detection of antimicrobial resistance is usually more effective than empirical treatment. nevertheless, such an approach before treatment is still not recommended in the maastricht guidelines due to the difficulty associated with the routine application of available culture-or molecular-based susceptibility tests, which are usually administered in cases of treatment failure. the management of first and rescue treatments requires further research due to the steadily increase in antimicrobial resistance.
southern_blotting	more than 1000 different mutations in the ldl receptor gene (ldlr) result in familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). the present study adds to the landscape of molecular heterogeneity of fh in bulgaria the frequency and molecular characteristics of large ldlr rearrangements. the study was done on genomic dna in a group of 32 unrelated patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (plasma total cholesterol level >8.50 mmol/l) by southern blotting analysis. three carriers of large ldlr rearrangements (frequency 0.09 +/- 0.04), and two novel mutations were found - a large inversion involving exons 4, 5 and 6, and a deletion about 4.0 kb of a fragment located between exons 4 and 8 of the ldlr.
southern_blotting	an intronic ggggcc hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (c9orf72) gene was considered as the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and frontotemporal dementia in caucasian populations. using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction analysis and southern blotting methods, we assessed the frequency and size of hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a cohort of 918 sporadic als (sals) patients and 632 control individuals of han chinese origin. we identified 8 (0.87%) of the sals patients and none of control individuals as carriers of c9orf72 expansions with 700-3500 repeats. a comprehensive neuropsychological battery was conducted on 4 expansion-positive als patients, where 3 patients were found to have cognitive impairment. all expansion-positive patients were genotyped for the previously reported 20 single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) risk haplotypes on chromosome 9p21. among them, 13 snp risk haplotypes were shared in all expansion carriers, suggesting a common founder from european ancestry. further meta-analysis demonstrated that the intermediate expansion size with 24-30 repeats, rare in both patients and controls, were significantly associated with the risk for als. to our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a proportion of chinese sals patients carrying this pathologic expansion of up to similar to 3500 repeats and to completely elaborate the 20-snp risk haplotypes in chinese expansion-positive patients, providing indispensable evidence for the origin, geographical range, and population prevalence of the c9orf72-associated als.

molecular_biology	the presence of pesticide residues in food is a public health problem. exposure to these substances in daily life could have serious effects on the intestine-the first organ to come into contact with food contaminants. the present study investigated the impact of a low dose (1 mg/day in oil) of the pesticide chlorpyrifos (cpf) on the community structure, diversity and metabolic response of the human gut microbiota using the shime (r) model (six reactors, representing the different parts of the gastrointestinal tract). the last three reactors (representing the colon) were inoculated with a mixture of feces from human adults. three time points were studied: immediately before the first dose of cpf, and then after 15 and 30 days of cpf-oil administration. by using conventional bacterial culture and molecular biology methods, we showed that cpf in oil can affect the gut microbiota. it had the greatest effects on counts of culturable bacteria (with an increase in enterobacteria, bacteroides spp. and clostridia counts, and a decrease in bifidobacterial counts) and fermentative activity, which were colon-segment-dependent. our results suggest that: (i) cpf in oil treatment affects the gut microbiota (although there was some discordance between the culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses); (ii) the changes are ""shime (r)-compartment"" specific; and (iii) the changes are associated with minor alterations in the production of short-chain fatty acids and lactate.
enzymology	calcineurin is the only ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. the roles of the cytosolic calcineurin have been well researched; however, the roles of the serum calcineurin remain unknown. here, we report that the recombinant human calcineurin b subunit (cnb) can bind to rabbit platelets and show an antiplatelet aggregation activity. furthermore, cnb exerts an anticoagulant effect by prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time and reducing the plasma fibrinogen concentration in a dose-dependent manner. we further reveal that the functional domain associated with the anticoagulant activity of cnb is located in the c-terminus. hemolysis test and intravenous stimulation study show that the recombinant cnb does not cause obvious hemolysis and is safe for intravenous injection. these results reveal a new function of calcineurin b subunit. they also give an explanation for the roles of calcineurin b subunit in serum and point to a possible implication in antithrombotic therapy.

immunology	leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by mycobacterium leprae. according to official reports from 121 countries across five who regions, there were 213 899 newly diagnosed cases in 2014. although leprosy affects the skin and peripheral nerves, it can present across a spectrum of clinical and histopathological forms that are strongly influenced by the immune response of the infected individuals. these forms comprise the extremes of tuberculoid leprosy (tt), with a m. leprae-specific th1, but also a th17, response that limits m. leprae multiplication, through to lepromatous leprosy (ll), with m. leprae-specific th2 and t regulatory responses that do not control m. leprae replication but rather allow bacterial dissemination. the interpolar borderline clinical forms present with similar, but less extreme, immune biases. acute inflammatory episodes, known as leprosy reactions, are complications that may occur before, during or after treatment, and cause further neurological damages that can cause irreversible chronic disabilities. this review discusses the innate and adaptive immune responses, and their interactions, that are known to affect pathogenesis and influence the clinical outcome of leprosy.
immunology	corneal immunoimaging and neuroimaging approaches facilitate in vivo analyses of the cornea, including high-resolution imaging of corneal immune cells and nerves. this approach facilitates the analyses of underlying immune and nerve alterations not detected by clinical slit-lamp examination alone. in this review, we describe recent work performed in our translational ocular immunology center with a focus on ""bench-to-bedside"" and ""bedside-to-bench"" research. the ability to visualize dendritiform immune cells (dcs) in patients with laser in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm), recently discovered in the central murine cornea, has allowed us to demonstrate their utility as a potential surrogate biomarker for inflammatory ocular surface diseases. this biomarker for inflammation allows the measurement of therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs and its utility as an endpoint in clinical trials with high interobserver agreement. ivcm image analyses from our studies has demonstrated a significant increase in dc density and size in ocular disease, a positive correlation between dc density and clinical signs and symptoms of disease and pro-inflammatory tear cytokines, and a strong negative correlation between dc density and subbasal nerve density. in conjunction with preclinical research investigating the inflammatory state in a partial or fully denervated cornea, our results indicated that corneal nerves are directly involved in the regulation of homeostasis and immune privilege in the cornea.
polymerase_chain_reaction	mutations in the connection and rnase h c-terminal reverse transcriptase (rt) domains of hiv-1 have been shown to impact drug resistance to rt inhibitors. however, their impact in the context of non-b subtypes has been poorly assessed. this study aimed to characterize resistance-related mutations in the c-terminal portions of rt in treatment-failing patients from southern brazil, a region with endemic hiv-1 subtype c (hiv-1c). viral rna was isolated and reverse transcribed from 280 infected subjects, and genomic regions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, dna sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. two novel mutations, m357r and e529d, were evidenced in brazilian hiv-1c strains from treatment-failing patients. in global viral isolates of subjects on treatment, m357r was selected in hiv-1c and crf01_ae and e529d was selected in hiv-1 subtype b (hiv-1b). while most c-terminal rt mutations described for hiv-1b also occur in hiv-1c, this work pinpointed novel mutations that display subtype-specific predominance or occurrence.
polymerase_chain_reaction	interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (ifitm) family proteins are antivirus factors. in the present study, we examined the expression pattern of chicken ifitm10 using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. in adult chickens, ifitm10 levels were markedly lower than those of ifitm3, which exhibits antivirus activity. on the other hand, ifitm10 was expressed in levels similar to those of ifitm3 in embryonic organs. primordial germ cells in 2.5-d embryos expressed high levels of ifitm10, which gradually decreased with time. the interferon- stimulation of embryonic fibroblast cells did not enhance the expression of ifitm10. the forced expression of ifitm10 slightly inhibited the infectivity of the vsv-g-pseudotyped lentiviral vector. furthermore, cell fusion was inhibited by ifitm10 when hela cells transfected with the vsv-g expression vector were treated with low ph buffer. although it remains unclear whether ifitm10 inhibits viral infections under physiological conditions, these results suggest that chicken ifitm10 exhibits antivirus activity.
genetics	human body and head lice are highly related haematophagous ectoparasites but only the body louse has been shown to transmit bartonella quintana, the causative agent of trench fever. the mechanisms by which body lice became a vector for b. quintana, however, are poorly understood. following oral challenge, green fluorescent protein-expressing b. quintana proliferated over 9 days postchallenge with the number of bacteria being significantly higher in whole body vs. head lice. the numbers of b. quintana detected in faeces from infected lice, however, were approximately the same in both lice. nevertheless, the viability of b. quintana was significantly higher in body louse faeces. comparison of immune responses in alimentary tract tissues revealed that basal transcription levels of peptidoglycan recognition protein and defensins were lower in body lice and the transcription of defensin 1 was up-regulated by oral challenge with wild-type b. quintana in head but not in body lice. in addition, the level of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generated by epithelial cells was significantly lower in body lice. although speculative at this time, the reduced immune response is consistent with the higher vector competence seen in body vs. head lice in terms of b. quintana infection.
northern_blotting	bone morphogenetic protein-2 (bmp-2) participates significantly in vascular development and pathophysiological processes. angiotensin ii (angii) has been demonstrated to be critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. however, the effects of angii on bmp-2 expression and of probucol on the angii-induced bmp-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) are unknown. the aim of our study was to investigate these effects. huvecs were cultured and stimulated with various agents. the total superoxide dismutase (sod) activity and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (mda) and bmp-2 were measured by standard methods. northern blotting was used to detect the expression of bmp-2 mrna. the activation of nf-kappa b in the huvecs was also determined. the angii treatment significantly increased bmp-2 expression levels and activated nf-kappa b. these effects were suppressed by treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc) or probucol. furthermore, the increased levels of mda in the conditioned medium and the decrease in the total sod activity caused by the angii treatment were reversed by treatment with probucol or pdtc. probucol downregulated the angii-nduced bmp-2 expression. these effects of probucol may be mediated by the inhibition of nf-kappa b activation.
immunology	determining individual health status is of great importance for a better understanding of life history trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and maintenance. however, existing immunological methods are invasive and therefore not suitable for investigating health status in wild populations. thus, there is an urgent need for non-invasive methods to assess the immune status of animals. neopterin is involved in the cell-mediated pathway of the immune response (th1-type), secreted during the activation of monocytes and macrophages. we investigated if urinary neopterin could serve as a biomarker of health status in bonobos and chimpanzees. first, we performed a chemical validation of a commercial neopterin enzyme immune assay (eia) for bonobo and chimpanzee urine. we then examined if urinary neopterin levels in bonobos increase during the acute period of respiratory infections. we found that neopterin levels can be reliably measured in urine of the two species with a commercial eia. stability experiments revealed considerable changes in urinary neopterin levels in relation to multiple freezethaw cycles and extended exposure to room temperature. exposure to sunlight led to a degradation of urinary neopterin, whereas sample storage up to two years did not affect urinary neopterin levels. there was no detectable diurnal variation in neopterin levels, and levels remained very stable across several days in healthy individuals. while urinary neopterin levels were independent of sex, nonadult individuals had higher urinary neopterin levels than adults. most importantly, there was a significant increase in urinary neopterin levels during a period of respiratory infection. our results demonstrate that regular urine sample collection would allow for the monitoring of individual health status and disease progression with minimal disturbance of the subjects. in combination with behavioral, life history, and endocrinological parameters, the method can be used to investigate questions related to immunocompetence handicaps or life history trade-offs.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has been recognized as a promising sewage treatment approach. considering the susceptibility, it is meaningful to study the behaviors of anammox bacteria under the unfavorable conditions. here, we found that anammox bacteria more probably tended to aggregation by the regulation of c-di-gmp against the unfavorable environmental stresses (low temperature, aerobic condition and low ph). further using multiple protein sequence alignment, we systematically examined the functionality of thirteen genes encoding putative c-di-gmp metabolic enzymes in anammox organism candidatus jettenia caeni, revealing most of the predicted enzymes were predicted to be active. particularly, ectopic expression of jcaa, a gene encoding a protein with both ggdef domain and eal domain, suggested that it encoded a functional enzyme capable of both synthesizing and degrading c-di-gmp, which was clearly confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was simulated by the means of three-dimensional homology modeling and molecular docking. the identification of cdi-gmp turnover and its role in granulation for anammox organism provides a new perspective for regulation of its aggregation capability and further promotion of anammox performance in the application of wastewater treatment process.

molecular_biology	introduction: at present, treatment of diabetic kidney disease (dkd) is still mainly based on drugs acting on glycemic and blood pressure control, as there is no validated therapy able to halt the progression of renal failure. because of the high incidence of dkd, due to the increase of diabetes mellitus in general population, new therapeutic strategies are needed.areas covered: we analysed ongoing and already completed clinical trials, from clinicaltrials.gov and pubmed, dealing with new therapies for dkd.expert opinion: among the drugs currently being explored, the most promising molecules are those that interfere with glucose-dependent pathways, in particular polyol, protein kinase, hexosamine and ages metabolic pathways, and impaired renal vascular regulation. one of the recent goals achieved by molecular biology is the development of monoclonal antibodies able to interfere with extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. other interesting therapies are under investigation and further studies with a greater number of patients will establish a better approach for diabetic nephropathy.
enzymology	pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) expresses a secreted lipoxygenase (lox), which oxygenates free arachidonic acid predominantly to 15s-h(p)ete. the enzyme is capable of binding phospholipids at its active site and physically interacts with model membranes. however, its membrane oxygenase activity has not been quantified. to address this question, we overexpressed pa-lox as intracellular his-tag fusion protein in escherichia coli, purified it to electrophoretic homogeneity and compared its biomembrane oxygenase activity with that of rabbit alox15. we found that both enzymes were capable of oxygenating mitochondrial membranes to specific oxygenation products and 13s-h(p)ode and 15s-h(p)ete esterified to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were identified as major oxygenation products. when normalized to similar linoleic acid oxygenase activity, the rabbit enzyme exhibited a much more effective mitochondrial membrane oxygenase activity. in contrast, during long-term incubations (24 h) with red blood cells pa-lox induced significant (50%) hemolysis whereas rabbit alox15 was more or less ineffective. these data indicate the principle capability of pa-lox of oxygenating membrane bound phospholipids which is likely to alter the barrier function of the biomembranes. although the membrane oxygenase activity was lower than the fatty acid oxygenase activity of pa-lox red blood cell membrane oxygenation might be of biological relevance for p. aeruginosa septicemia.

molecular_biology	telomerase activation is critical in many cancers including central nervous system (cns) tumors. imetelstat is an oligonucleotide that binds to the template region of the rna component of telomerase, inhibiting its enzymatic activity. we conducted an investigator-sponsored molecular biology (mb) and phase ii study to estimate inhibition of tumor telomerase activity and sustained responses by imetelstat in children with recurrent cns malignancies. in the mb study, patients with recurrent medulloblastoma, high-grade glioma (hgg) or ependymoma undergoing resection received one dose of imetelstat as a 2-h intravenous infusion at 285 mg/m(2), 12-24 h before surgery. telomerase activity was evaluated in fresh tumor from surgery. post-surgery and in the phase ii study, patients received imetelstat iv (days 1 and 8 q21-days) at 285 mg/m(2). imetelstat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed. of two evaluable patients on the mb trial, intratumoral telomerase activity was inhibited by 95 % compared to baseline archival tissue in one patient and was inevaluable in one patient. forty-two patients (40 evaluable for toxicity) were enrolled: 9 medulloblastomas, 18 hgg, 4 ependymomas, 9 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. most common grade 3/4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia (32.5 %), lymphopenia (17.5 %), neutropenia (12.5 %), alt (7.5 %) and ast (5 %) elevation. two patients died of intratumoral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia leading to premature study closure. no objective responses were observed. telomerase inhibition was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) for at least 8 days. imetelstat demonstrated intratumoral and pbmc target inhibition; the regimen proved too toxic in children with recurrent cns tumors.
northern_blotting	background: micrornas (mirnas) are small noncoding rnas whose function as modulators of gene expression is crucial for the proper control of cell growth. although many micrornas were found to express in central nervous system (cns), the role of the regulatory networks in which they are involved and their function in the pathological process of nerve cells are only just emerging. in the present study, the possible mechanisms by which one neuronal mirnas, mir-125b, affected the growth of nervous cells were investigated using in vitro cell line model. methods: the expression pattern of mir-125b in atra-treated human glioma cell lines was detected by northern blotting and in situ localization. the effect of mir-125b on the proliferation and apoptosis of human glioma cells was analyzed by mts assay, tunel and flow cytometry analysis. in addition, the identification of target gene of mir-125b was studied by dual-luciferase activity assay and immunoblot analysis. results: we found differential expression of mir-125b in 1.0 mu m all-trans-retinoic acid (atra)-treated human glioma cell lines. up-regulation of mir-125b partially restored cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in u343 cells treated by atra. down-regulation of mir125b decreased human glioma cells proliferation and enhanced the sensitivity of human glioma cells to atra-induced apoptosis. in addition, we found an inverse relationship between the expression of mir125b and the cell apoptosis-related protein bcl-2 modifying factor (bmf), and mir-125b can interact with 3'-untranslated region (utr) of bmf. conclusion: these findings indicate that overexpression of mir125b promotes human glioma cell proliferation and inhibits atra-induced cell apoptosis and low expression of mir-125b sensitizes cells to atra-induced apoptosis. bmf may play an important role in the process of mir-125b influencing cell apoptosis. copyright (c) 2009 s. karger ag, basel
human_metabolism	the change in serum metabolic response from fasting state to postprandial state provides novel insights into the impact of a single meal on human metabolism. therefore, this study explored changes in serum metabolite profile after a single meal. nineteen healthy postmenopausal women with normal glucose tolerance participated in the study. they received a meal consisting of refined wheat bread (50 g carbohydrates, 9 g protein, 4.2 g fat and 2.7 g dietary fibre), 40 g cucumber and 300 ml noncaloric orange drink. blood samples were collected at fasting and five postprandial time points. metabolic profile was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance and targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. changes over time were assessed with multivariate models and anova, with baseline as control. the metabolomic analyses demonstrated alterations in phospholipids, amino acids and their breakdown products, glycolytic products, acylcarnitines and ketone bodies after a single meal. more specifically, phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and citrate displayed an overall declining pattern, while leucine, isoleucine, methionine and succinate increased initially but declined thereafter. a sharp decline in acylcarnitines and ketone bodies and increase in glycolytic products postprandially suggest a switch in the body 's energy source from beta-oxidation to glycolysis. moreover, individuals with relatively high postprandial insulin responses generated a higher postprandial leucine responses compared to participants with lower insulin responses. the study demonstrated complex changes from catabolic to anabolic metabolism after a meal and indicated that the extent of postprandial responses is different between individuals with high and low insulin response.
enzymology	rapidly multiplying cancer cells synthesize greater amounts of cholesterol to build their membranes. cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) are currently in clinical trials for anti-cancer chemotherapy. however, given at higher doses, statins cause serious side effects by inhibiting the formation of other biologically important molecules derived from mevalonate. sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (cyp51), which acts 10 steps downstream, is potentially a more specific drug target because this portion of the pathway is fully committed to cholesterol production. however, screening a variety of commercial and experimental inhibitors of microbial cyp51 orthologs revealed that most of them (including all clinical antifungals) weakly inhibit human cyp51 activity, even if they display high apparent spectral binding affinity. only one relatively potent compound, (r)-n-(1-(3,4'-difluorobiphenyl-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)-4-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzamide (vfv), was identified. vfv has been further tested in cellular experiments and found to decrease proliferation of different cancer cell types.(jlr) the crystal structures of human cyp51-vfv complexes (2.0 and 2.5 angstrom) both display a 2:1 inhibitor/enzyme stoichiometry, provide molecular insights regarding a broader substrate profile, faster catalysis, and weaker susceptibility of human cyp51 to inhibition, and outline directions for the development of more potent inhibitors.-hargrove, t. y., l. friggeri, z. wawrzak, s. sivakumaran, e. m. yazlovitskaya, s. w. hiebert, f. p. guengerich, m. r. waterman, and g. i. lepesheva. human sterol 14 alpha-demethylase as a target for anticancer chemotherapy:towards structure-aided drug design.
polymerase_chain_reaction	mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (mo) is main responsible for pleuropneumonia in sheep. the disease is spreading in the world, and has caused great suffering and losses to the sheep husbandry. current methodologies for detecting and identifying mo are somehow time consuming, complicated, expensive. herein, a powerful biosensing platform for effective mo detection has been explored based on manganese dioxide (mno2) microsphere absorbing cy5 labeled single strand dna (cy5-ssdna) probe, in which different base number of the complementary of mo conserved sequence was employed. the results demonstrated that the fluorescence enhancement exhibited a good linear relationship with mo plasmid added over a concentration range of 10(2)-10(6) copies/mu l, with the detection limit of 1.042 copies/mu l. this biosensing platform has been finally employed as the feasible probe for mo plasmid and detection with good reproducibility and stability, which exhibited a good performance to discriminate perfect complementary target mo and the base mismatched dna sequence, illustrated that using mno2 microsphere absorbing cy5-ssdna probe as biosensor can detect mo in simple, rapid, economical, selective and sensitive way, and showed significantly potential in more extensive biochemical application.

human_metabolism	manganese is an essential nutrient for human metabolism; however, few studies have been conducted to establish the dietary recommended intake (dri) for manganese. the purpose of this study is to provide data that can inform the manganese intake level and address the ri by analyzing the manganese intake of 513 young korean adults and evaluating the blood levels and estimated manganese balance of 51 selected subjects. the average age of the total subjects was 22.6 years for men and 21.6 years for women. the average daily energy intake was 1,758.50 kcal for men and 1,578.5 kcal for women. in addition, the daily manganese intake was 3,772.7 mu g for men and 3,444.2 mu g for women. the manganese intake of all subjects was lower than the tolerable upper intake. the manganese intake, excretion through urine and feces, retention amount, and retention rate of the selected subjects were 2,922.8 mu g, 2,612.2 mu g, 331.1 mu g, and 6.7%, respectively, with no significant difference between men and women except urinary excretion (0.34 mu g for men vs. 0.18 mu g for women, p < 0.05). the manganese intake was positively related with the intakes of food, energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate. also, the manganese retention amount was positively related with the intakes of energy, protein, and fat. these results show that both food intake and energy intake are important factors for manganese intake and retention.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objectives to determine the effects of dental implant surface chemistry and energy on macrophage activation invitro. materials and methods disks made from two clinically used implant materials (titanium [ti], titanium zirconium alloy [tizr]) were produced with two different surface treatments (sandblast/acid-etch [sla], hydrophilic-sla [modsla]). surface roughness, energy, and chemistry were characterized. primary murine macrophages were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old male c57bl/6 mice and cultured on test surfaces (ti sla, tizr sla, ti modsla, tizr modsla) or control tissue culture polystyrene. mrna was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction after 24h of culture. pro- (il-1, il-6, and tnf-) and anti-inflammatory (il-4, il-10) protein levels were measured by elisa after 1 or 3days of culture. results quantitatively, microroughness was similar on all surfaces. qualitatively, nanostructures were present on modsla surfaces that were denser on ti than on tizr. modsla surfaces were determined hydrophilic (high-energy surface) while sla surfaces were hydrophobic (low-energy surface). cells on high-energy surfaces had higher levels of mrna from anti-inflammatory markers characteristic of m2 activation compared to cells on low-energy surfaces. this effect was enhanced on the tizr surfaces when compared to cells on ti sla and ti modsla. macrophages cultured on tizr sla and modsla surfaces released more anti-inflammatory cytokines. conclusions the combination of high-energy and altered surface chemistry present on tizr modsla was able to influence macrophages to produce the greatest anti-inflammatory microenvironment and reduce extended pro-inflammatory factor release.
cell_biology	epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) is associated with metastasis formation as well as with generation and maintenance of cancer stem cells. in this way, emt contributes to tumor invasion, heterogeneity and chemoresistance. morphological and functional changes involved in these processes require robust reprogramming of gene expression, which is only partially accomplished at the transcriptional level. alternative splicing is another essential layer of gene expression regulation that expands the cell proteome. this step in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression tightly controls cell identity between epithelial and mesenchymal states and during stem cell differentiation. importantly, dysregulation of splicing factor function and cancer-specific splicing isoform expression frequently occurs in human tumors, suggesting the importance of alternative splicing regulation for cancer biology. in this review, we briefly discuss the role of emt programs in development, stem cell differentiation and cancer progression. next, we focus on selected examples of key factors involved in emt and stem cell differentiation that are regulated post-transcriptionally through alternative splicing mechanisms. lastly, we describe relevant oncogenic splice-variants that directly orchestrate cancer stem cell biology and tumor emt, which may be envisioned as novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
immunology	the skin can serve as an interstitial na+ reservoir. local tissue na+ accumulation increases with age, inflammation and infection. this increased local na+ availability favors pro-inflammatory immune cell function and dampens their anti-inflammatory capacity. in this review, we summarize available data on how nacl affects various immune cells. we particularly focus on how salt promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage and t cell function and simultaneously curtails their regulatory and anti-inflammatory potential. overall, these findings demonstrate that local na+ availability is a promising novel regulator of immunity. hence, the modulation of tissue na+ levels bears broad therapeutic potential: increasing local na+ availability may help in treating infections, while lowering tissue na+ levels may be used to treat, for example, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.
immunology	phagocytes display marked heterogeneity in their capacity to induce and control acute inflammation. this has a significant impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial immune responses at different tissue sites as well as their predisposition for inflammation-associated pathology. imaging flow cytometry provides novel opportunities for characterization of these phagocyte populations through high spatial resolution, statistical robustness, and a broad range of quantitative morphometric cell analysis tools. this study highlights an integrative approach that brings together new tools in imaging flow cytometry with conventional methodologies for characterization of phagocyte responses during acute inflammation. we focus on a comparative avian in vivo challenge model to showcase the added depth gained through these novel quantitative multiparametric approaches even in the absence of antibody-based cellular markers. our characterization of acute inflammation in this model shows significant conservation of phagocytic capacity among avian phagocytes compared to other animal models. however, it also highlights evolutionary divergence with regards to phagocyte inflammation control mechanisms based on the internalization of apoptotic cells.

polymerase_chain_reaction	accurate identification of plant pathogens is crucial towards developing sustainable control strategies to ensure sustainable economic agricultural production. the aim of this study was to detect and characterize potato virus y (pvy) isolates infecting potato (solanum tuberosum l.) in the msinga district in the province of kwazulu-natal, south africa. potato leaf samples exhibiting virus-like symptoms were collected from four different areas in the district. initial detection of pvy in the leaf samples was done using triple antibody sandwich elisa. pvy-positive samples were further tested using antibodies specific to pvy serotypes o and n. nicotiana tabacum cv samsun plants were individually mechanically inoculated with all 32 pvy-elisa positive samples. symptoms on inoculated tobacco plants were monitored over a 4-week period. they consisted of vein clearing, faint mosaic patterns, and the veinal necrosis, symptoms characteristic of pvyn, pvy(n)wilga and pvyntn strains. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using primers specific to the coat protein gene of pvy, was performed as a confirmation test on total rna of four randomly selected pvy-elisa positive samples, each sample representing each of the four areas surveyed. strains pvyn and pvyo were identified. the second part of the study aimed to analyse the full genome sequences of the pvy isolates a4, kd2, mod1 and snep3, in order to understand the evolution of the virus in msinga. to achieve this, total rna, extracted from tobacco leaves (n. tabacum cv samsun) that had been inoculated with the selected four pvy isolates, was used as a template for next generation sequencing (ngs). ngs was run on illumina hiseq using paired-end chemistry 125 x 125bp reads. de novo assembly of the generated reads was performed. the resulting contigs were subjected to blast on the genbank database in order to identify pvy genomes. the pvy isolates were aligned with closely related non-recombinant pvy sequences comprising of the following strains: pvyn, pvyo, pvyntn, and pvyc. recombination events were assessed using rdp4 software. phylogenetic results revealed that pvy isolate snep3 belonged to the pvyntn strain while isolate pvymod1 to the pvy n wilga strain group. recombination analyses confirmed the occurrence of pvy recombinant strains in the msinga district. the widespread presence of pvy and occurrence of recombinant strains in msinga has serious implications on the management of pvy diseases by small-scale farmers growing potato for a livelihood.

northern_blotting	we have characterized the expression of micrornas and selected microrna precursors within several synaptic fractions of adult mouse forebrain, including synaptoneurosomes, synaptosomes and isolated post-synaptic densities (psds), using methods of microrna microarray, real time qrt-pcr, northern blotting and immunopurification using anti-psd95 antibody. the majority of brain micrornas (especially micrornas known to be expressed in pyramidal neurons) are detectably expressed in synaptic fractions, and a subset of micrornas is significantly enriched in synaptic fractions relative to total forebrain homogenate. microrna precursors are also detectable in synaptic fractions at levels that are comparable to whole tissue. whereas mature micrornas are predominantly associated with soluble components of the synaptic fractions, microrna precursors are predominantly associated with psds. for seven micrornas examined, there was a significant correlation between the relative synaptic enrichment of the precursor and the relative synaptic enrichment of the corresponding mature microrna. these findings support the proposal that micrornas are formed, at least in part, via processing of microrna precursors locally within dendritic spines. dicer is expressed in psds but is enzymatically inactive until conditions that activate calpain cause its liberation; thus, we propose that synaptic stimulation may lead to local processing of microrna precursors in proximity to the synapse.
genetics	congenital atrial septal defect (asd) and progressive atriventricular block (avb) are the two most common phenotypes linked to nk2 homeobox 5 (nkx2.5) mutations in animals and humans. however, the prevalence and spectrum of nkx2.5 mutation in patients with asd and avb remain to be elucidated. in the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the nkx2.5 gene, which encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor essential for development of the heart, were sequenced in a cohort of 62 unrelated patients with asd and avb, and subsequently in a mutation carrier 's available family members. as controls, 300 unrelated, ethnically-matched healthy individuals were recruited, who were also genotyped for nkx2.5. the functional consequence of the mutant nkx2.5 was evaluated in contrast to its wild-type counterpart using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. as a result, a novel heterozygous nkx2.5 mutation, p.q181x, was identified in an index patient with asd and avb, with a prevalence of similar to 1.61%. genetic analysis of the proband 's pedigree revealed that the mutation co-segregated with asd and avb with complete penetrance. the nonsense mutation, which eliminated partial homeobox and the carboxyl terminus, was absent in the 600 control chromosomes. functional evaluation showed that the nkx2.5 mutant had no transcriptional activity. furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic activation between nkx2.5 and gata binding protein 4, another cardiac core transcription factor associated with asd. the results of the present study expand the spectrum of nkx2.5 mutations linked to asd and avb, and indicated that nkx2.5 loss-of-function mutations are an uncommon cause of asd and avb in humans.
immunology	the pacific white shrimp litopenaeusvannamei is a euryhaline species with optimal salinity of 20-25 practical salinity unit (psu) for growth and survival, but has been cultured in inland water with salinity <5psu worldwide. in the past decade, much research progress has been made on the physiological and nutritional requirements of white shrimp at low salinity. this study reviews the recent findings in the aspects of growth, survival, energy metabolism, stress resistance and immunity of white shrimp at low salinity and synthesizes recent research outcomes in nutritional requirements in an attempt to improve the shrimp performance in aquaculture at low salinity. the white shrimp at low salinity usually show slow growth, low immunity, high susceptibility to pathogens and high energy demand. the diet containing 30-36% protein, 15-20% carbohydrate and supplementations of potassium, sodium, vitamin e and c, free amino acids (gly-cine, alanine, proline and taurine), antioxidants and probiotics can improve shrimp growth and immunity at low salinity. the white shrimp has demonstrated the ability to synthesize dha and epa from lna at low ambient salinity, but further studies are needed to further confirm this finding. future research should focus on the understanding of physiological mechanism and adaptation associated with salinity change and nutritional manipulation. the specific dietary requirements of essential fatty acids, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals and the nutrition-mediated immune response also warrant further study on shrimp at low salinity.
cell_biology	purpose of reviewcharcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt) is one of the commonest inherited neuromuscular diseases with a population prevalence of 1 in 2500. this review will cover recent advances in the genetics and pathomechanisms of cmt and how these are leading to the development of rational therapies.recent findingspathomechanistic and therapeutic target advances in cmt include the identification of the erbb receptor signalling pathway as a therapeutic target in cmt1a and pharmacological modification of the unfolded protein response in cmt1b. in cmt2d, due to mutations in glycyl-trna synthetase, vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated stimulation of the nrp1 receptor has been identified as a therapeutic target. preclinical advances have been accompanied by the publication of large natural history cohorts and the identification of a sensitive biomarker of disease (muscle mri) that is able to detect disease progression in cmt1a over 1 year.summaryadvances in next-generation sequencing technology, cell biology and animal models of cmt are paving the way for rational treatments. the combination of robust natural history data and the identification of sensitive biomarkers mean that we are now entering an exciting therapeutic era in the field of the genetic neuropathies.
molecular_biology	the pathways and mechanisms that regulate pulmonary surfactant synthesis, processing, secretion and catabolism have been extensively characterised using classical biochemical and analytical approaches. these have constructed a model, largely in experimental animals, for surfactant phospholipid metabolism in the alveolar epithelial cell whereby phospholipid synthesised on the endoplasmic reticulum is selectively transported to lamellar body storage vesicles, where it is subsequently processed before secretion into the alveolus. surfactant phospholipid is a complex mixture of individual molecular species defined by the combination of esterified fatty acid groups and a comprehensive description of surfactant phospholipid metabolism requires consideration of the interactions between such molecular species. however, until recently, lipid analytical techniques have not kept pace with the considerable advances in understanding of the enzymology and molecular biology of surfactant metabolism. refinements in electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (esi-ms) can now provide very sensitive platforms for the rapid characterisation of surfactant phospholipid composition in molecular detail. the combination of esi-ms and administration of phospholipid substrates labelled with stable isotopes extends this analytical approach to the quantification of synthesis and turnover of individual molecular species of surfactant phospholipid. as this methodology does not involve radioactivity, it is ideally suited to application in clinical studies. this review will provide an overview of the metabolic processes that regulate the molecular specificity of surfactant phosphatidylcholine together with examples of how the application of stable isotope technologies in vivo has, for the first time, begun to explore regulation of the molecular specificity of surfactant synthesis in human subjects.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) is an important issue to improve the prognosis. hox transcript antisense rna (hotair), a long noncoding rna (lncrna) expressed from the hoxc locus, has been recently revealed as an oncogenic regulator in escc. this study aimed to investigate whether serum hotair is involved in the diagnosis of escc. methods: in this study, we detected serum hotair expression in 50 patients with escc (including 42 tumor resection and 8 without surgery) and 20 healthy volunteers to investigate the role of serum hotair in escc using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) method. results: clinical data indicated that serum hotair were correlated with tnm stage. the expression level of serum hotair (0.189 +/- 0.010) was significantly higher in escc patients compared with that of healthy controls (0.055 +/- 0.008, p < 0.01). the roc curve analysis yielded an area under the roc curve (auc) value of 0.793 (95% ci: 0. 692 to 0.895, p < 0.01). also, the serum hotair expression level decreased obviously in postoperative samples (one month after the surgery) compared to preoperative specimens. moreover, there was a significant correlation between serum hotair expression and the expression of hotair in escc tissue according to pearson correlation analysis. conclusions: our study, for the first time, demonstrated that serum hotair might serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of escc.
cell_biology	background. glioblastomas (gbms) are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors. these tumors are resistant to therapeutic interventions and invariably recur after surgical resection. the multifunctional protein transglutaminase 2 (tg2) has been shown to promote cell survival in a number of different tumors. there is also evidence that tg2 may be a pro-survival factor in gbms. however, the roles that tg2 plays in facilitating gbm survival and proliferation have not yet been clearly delineated. methods. the functions of tg2 are often cell-and context-specific. therefore, in this study we examined the ability of tg2 to facilitate gbm proliferation using colony formation assays and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (edu) incorporation in several different gbm cell lines as well as neurospheres derived from patient tumors representing the 3 major subtypes of gbm tumors (mesenchymal, proneural, and classical) and maintained in the absence of serum. tg2 knockdown or selective tg2 inhibitors were used to modulate tg2 expression and activity. results. we show that tg2 plays differential roles in the proliferative process depending on the cell type. in most, but not all, gbm models tg2 plays a crucial role in the proliferative process, and some but not all tg2 inhibitors were highly effective at reducing proliferation in a large subset of the gbm models. conclusion. our results show that tg2 plays an important-but notoriously context-specific-role in gbm cell biology. nonetheless, as future studies unravel the genetic "" fingerprints"" that make tg2 inhibitors effective, this information could be exploited to develop tg2 inhibitors into personalized gbm therapies.
molecular_biology	his-asn-his (hnh) proteins are a very common family of small nucleic acid-binding proteins that are generally associated with endonuclease activity and are found in all kingdoms of life. although hnh endonucleases from mesophiles have been widely investigated, the biochemical functions of hnh endonucleases from thermophilic bacteriophages remain unknown. here, we characterized the biochemical properties of a thermostable hnh endonuclease from deep-sea thermophilic bacteriophage gve2. the recombinant gve2 hnh endonuclease exhibited non-specific cleavage activity at high temperature. the optimal temperature of the gve2 hnh endonuclease for cleaving dna was 60-65 a degrees c, and the enzyme retained its dna cleavage activity even after heating at 100 a degrees c for 30 min, suggesting the enzyme is a thermostable endonuclease. the gve2 hnh endonuclease cleaved dna over a wide ph spectrum, ranging from 5.5 to 9.0, and the optimal ph for the enzyme activity was 8.0-9.0. furthermore, the gve2 hnh endonuclease activity was dependent on a divalent metal ion. while the enzyme is inactive in the presence of cu2+, the gve2 hnh endonuclease displayed cleavage activity of varied efficiency with mn2+, mg2+, ca2+, fe2+, co2+, zn2+, and ni2+. the gve2 hnh endonuclease activity was inhibited by nacl. this study provides the basis for determining the role of this endonuclease in life cycle of the bacteriophage gve2 and suggests the potential application of the enzyme in molecular biology and biotechnology.

molecular_biology	geometric and electrostatic modeling is an essential component in computational biophysics and molecular biology. commonly used geometric representations admit geometric singularities such as cusps, tips and self-intersecting facets that lead to computational instabilities in the molecular modeling. the present work explores the use of flexibility and rigidity index (fri), which has a proved superiority in protein b-factor prediction, for biomolecular geometric representation and associated electrostatic analysis. fri rigidity surfaces are free of geometric singularities. we proposed a rigidity based poisson -boltzmann equation for biomolecular electrostatic analysis. our approaches to surface and electrostatic modeling are validated by a set of 21 proteins. our results are compared with those of established methods. finally, being smooth and analytically differentiable, fri rigidity functions offer excellent curvature analysis, which characterizes concave and convex regions on protein surfaces. polarized curvatures constructed by using the product of minimum curvature and electrostatic potential is shown to predict potential protein-ligand binding sites.

cell_biology	mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase1 (gdh1) (e.c. 1.4.1.3) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia while reducing nad+ and/or nadp+ to nadh and/or nadph. it links amino acid with carbohydrate metabolism, contributing to krebs cycle anaplerosis, energy production, ammonia handling and redox homeostasis. although gdh1 was one of the first major metabolic enzymes to be studied decades ago, its role in cell biology is still incompletely understood. there is however growing interest in a novel gdh2 isoenzyme that emerged via duplication in primates and underwent rapid evolutionary selection concomitant with prefrontal human cortex expansion. also, the anaplerotic function of gdh1 and gdh2 is currently under sharp focus as this relates to the biology of glial tumors and other neoplasias. here we used antibodies specific for human gdh1 (hgdh1) and human gdh2 (hgdh2) to study the expression of these isoenzymes in human tissues. results revealed that both hgdh1 and hgdh2 are expressed in human brain, kidney, testis and steroidogenic organs. however, distinct hgdh1 and hgdh2 expression patterns emerged. thus, while the sertoli cells of human testis were strongly positive for hgdh2, they were negative for hgdh1. conversely, hgdh1 showed very high levels of expression in human liver, but hepatocytes were virtually devoid of hgdh2. in human adrenals, both hgdhs were densely expressed in steroid-producing cells, with hgdh2 expression pattern matching that of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system involved in steroid synthesis. similarly in human ovaries and placenta, both hgdh1 and hgdh2 were densely expressed in estrogen producing cells. in addition, hgdh1, being a housekeeping enzyme, was also expressed in cells that lack endocrine function. regarding human brain, study of cortical sections using immunofluorescence (if) with confocal microscopy revealed that hgdh1 and hgdh2 were both expressed in the cytoplasm of gray and white matter astrocytes within coarse structures resembling mitochondria. additionally, hgdh1 localized to the nuclear membrane of a subpopulation of astrocytes and of the vast majority of oligodendrocytes and their precursors. remarkably, hgdh2-specific staining was detected in human cortical neurons, with different expression patterns having emerged. one pattern, observed in large cortical neurons (some with pyramidal morphology), was a hgdh2-specific labeling of cytoplasmic structures resembling mitochondria. these were distributed either in the cell body-axon or on the cell surface in close proximity to astrocytic end-feet that encircle glutamatergic synapses. another pattern was observed in small cortical neurons with round dense nuclei in which the hgdh2-specific staining was found in the nuclear membrane. a detailed description of these observations and their functional implications, suggesting that the gdh flux is used by different cells to serve some of their unique functions, is presented below.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose. the impact of an antimicrobial stewardship initiative on time to first antibiotic dose and clinical outcomes in bacteremic patients was, evaluated. methods. a single-center, retrospective study was conducted for adult inpatients who received antibiotics before and after implementation of a rapid administration of antimicrobials by an infectious diseases specialist (raids) protocol. patients admitted to an inpatient service from june to october 2011 (pre-raids protocol) and from december 2011 to february 2012 (post-raids protocol) were eligible for inclusion if (1) they were age 18 years or older, (2) their infection occurred two or more days after hospital admission, and (3) they had a blood culture growing an organism other than common skin contaminants (i.e., coagulase-negative staphylococci, bacillus species). the primary outcome was the time to the first antibiotic dose (tfad), defined as the time that elapsed from a positive blood culture result to administration of the first empirical antimicrobial dose. results. a total of 111 bacteremic patients were included in the analysis. implementation of the raids protocol led to significantly faster antibiotic order entry, verification, and administration of empirical antibiotics in patients with bacteremia. the median tfad was approximately 8 hours faster in the post-raids group than in the pre-raids group (9:09 hr:min versus 1:23 hr:min, p < 0.001). patients in the post-raids group had a significant reduction in infection-related mortality (p = 0.047), though all cause 30-day mortality was similar. conclusion. early notification of an infectious diseases pharmacist about positive blood cultures using the raids protocol led to increased appropriateness of empirical drug selection and a dramatic reduction in the administration of antibiotics and was associated with decreased infection related mortality.
immunology	introduction: regulatory t cells (treg) play an important role in suppressing anti- immunity and their depletion has been linked to improved outcomes. to better understand the role of treg in limiting the efficacy of anti-cancer immunity, we used a diphtheria toxin (dtx) transgenic mouse model to specifically target and deplete treg. methods: tumor bearing balb/c foxp3.dtr transgenic mice were subjected to different treatment protocols, with or without treg depletion and tumor growth and survival monitored. results: dtx specifically depleted treg in a transient, dose-dependent manner. treg depletion correlated with delayed tumor growth, increased effector t cell (teff) activation, and enhanced survival in a range of solid tumors. tumor regression was dependent on teffs as depletion of both cd4 and cd8 t cells completely abrogated any survival benefit. severe morbidity following treg depletion was only observed, when consecutive doses of dtx were given during peak cd8 t cell activation, demonstrating that treg can be depleted on multiple occasions, but only when cd8 t cell activation has returned to base line levels. finally, we show that even minimal treg depletion is sufficient to significantly improve the efficacy of tumor-peptide vaccination. conclusions: balb/c.foxp3.dtr mice are an ideal model to investigate the full therapeutic potential of treg depletion to boost anti-tumor immunity. dtx-mediated treg depletion is transient, dose-dependent, and leads to strong anti-tumor immunity and complete tumor regression at high doses, while enhancing the efficacy of tumor-specific vaccination at low doses. together this data highlight the importance of treg manipulation as a useful strategy for enhancing current and future cancer immunotherapies.
genetics	background: drug-induced qt interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. the contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline qt interval to drug-induced qt prolongation and arrhythmias is not known. methods: we tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to qt interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple qt-prolonging drugs. genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 qt-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched qt and plasma drug concentration measurements. subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. the outcome was the correlation between a genetic qt score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject 's drug-induced increase in heart rate-corrected qt (qtc) versus drug concentration. results: the genetic qt score was correlated with drug-induced qtc prolongation. among white subjects, genetic qt score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (r=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.81; p=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (r=0.48; 95% confidence interval, -0.03 to 0.79; p=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (r=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.80; p=0.03). furthermore, the genetic qt score was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (r(2)=12%, p=1x10(-7)). conclusions: we demonstrate that a genetic qt score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced qt prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes. these findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies. replication of these findings in larger samples is needed to more precisely estimate variance explained and to establish the individual variants that drive these effects.
human_metabolism	predictions of human pesticide metabolism which are needed for the interpretation of biological monitoring data are frequently made from animal studies. consequently, assumptions have to be made about the relationship between absorbed dose and metabolite excretion. the results from two human volunteer studies highlight the problems associated with extrapolating from animal studies in this way. the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin shows markedly different metabolite patterns when administered orally or dermally in man. following dermal dosing the ratio of trans/cis cyclopropane acids is approximately 1:1, compared to 2:1 after oral administration. the ratio of total cyclopropane acids to phenoxybenzoic acids also differs depending on the route (dermal 1:4, oral 1:0.8). a knowledge of human metabolism by these two routes enables a much more meaningful interpretation of biological monitoring measurements. the herbicide molinate forms a mercapturate conjugate as a major urinary metabolite in the rat (35%). in volunteers at low dose levels this metabolite is present at insignificant levels (< 1%) and 4-hydroxymolinatc is a much more abundant metabolite (39%). this shows that extrapolation between species can be very misleading. it is concluded that the benefits of using human volunteers for metabolism studies at low doses far outweigh the minimal risks involved. as a basis for biological monitoring such studies can lead to a greatly improved risk assessment for pesticides in use.
northern_blotting	background. lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) is a lipid mediator with multiple biological activities that may affect the progression of various cancers. malignant ascites contains high levels of lpa as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf). although lpa receptors are widely expressed in normal as well as cancer cells, little is known about the effect of lpa on host cells. therefore, we evaluated the effect of lpa specifically on peritoneal mesothelial cells (pmc), and assessed another aspect of lpa in tumor biology mediated through the host cells. materials and methods. the effect of lpa on the production of vegf was evaluated by elisa and northern blotting. next, we quantified human- and mouse-vegf separately in ascitic fluid of nude mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a human gastric cancer, mkn45, and thus evaluated the ratio of host-derived vegf in malignant ascites. results. addition of 10 to 80 mu m lpa enhanced vegf production by pmc through gene activation. the effect was strongly inhibited by pre-treatment with ptx or ki16425, indicating that the effect was mainly dependent on the lpa1 signal. of the vegf in ascitic fluid at 3 weeks after tumor inoculation, 12.8% was derived from mouse cells. at 6 weeks, however, the ratio of host-derived vegf was reduced to 5.0%, suggesting that the ratio of host-derived vegf may be higher in the earlier phase. conclusion. because tumor growth is often associated with an increase of lpa concentration in ascites, stimulation of vegf production in pmc might have an important role in the growth of cancer cells disseminated in the peritoneal cavity.

enzymology	background knowing the physiological ranges of certain hematological and biochemical parameters is necessary for understanding the alterations caused by pathogenic agents and establishing differences between states of health and disease. hematological evaluations and clinical chemistry were performed on livers and kidneys from owl monkeys with different sexes and age ranges. methods forty-one healthy owl monkeys were evaluated (26 males and 15 females) in three different age groups (ag1 = 3 months to 1 year old; ag2 = 2-6 years old; ag3 = over 7 years old). the animals received physical exams, abdominal ultrasounds, and clinical laboratory tests. results and conclusions significant differences were observed in hematocrit and hemoglobin values between males and females. the levels of alkaline phosphatase in the tissues were significantly influenced by age. there was also a sex influence on blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. the results show that some hematological and clinical chemistry parameters in owl monkeys may be influenced by sex and age.
enzymology	1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (dxp) synthase catalyzes the formation of dxp from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (grap) in a thiamin diphosphate-dependent manner, and is the first step in the essential pathway to isoprenoids in human pathogens. understanding the mechanism of this unique enzyme is critical for developing new anti-infective agents that selectively target isoprenoid biosynthesis. the present study used mutagenesis and a combination of protein fluorescence, cd and kinetics experiments to investigate the roles of arg420, arg478 and tyr392 in substrate binding and catalysis. the results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism, and predict that arg420 and arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate, grap. d-glyceraldehyde, an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl group predicted to interact with arg420 and arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation of the predecarboxylation intermediate c2 alpha-lactylthiamin diphosphate (lthdp) on dxp synthase, indicating that this binding interaction is not absolutely required, and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation. unexpectedly, tyr392 contributes to grap affinity, and is not required for lthdp formation or its grap-promoted decarboxylation. time-resolved cd spectroscopy and nmr experiments indicate that lthdp is significantly stabilized on r420a and y392f variants as compared with wild-type dxp synthase in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions do not appear to affect the rate of grap-promoted lthdp decarboxylation in the presence of high levels of grap, and lthdp formation remains the rate-limiting step. these results suggest a role of these residues in promoting grap binding, which in turn facilitates decarboxylation, and also highlight interesting differences between dxp synthase and other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes.
northern_blotting	the virion host shutoff protein (vhs), encoded by the gene ul41, has rnase activity and is the key regulator of the early host shutoff response induced by type 1 herpes simplex virus. despite low amino acid similarity, the vhs protein of the swine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (prv), also exhibits rnase activity. however, the mechanism underlying the action of vhs remains undefined. here, we report that the rna degradation profile of prv vhs is similar, but not identical, to that of type 1 herpes simplex virus vhs. notably, the presence of a cap structure enhances both the degradation rate and the preferential targeting of the vhs protein towards the 3-end of the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (ires). furthermore, type 1 herpes simplex virus vhs produces a simple degradation pattern, but prv vhs gives rise to multiple intermediates. the results of northern blotting using probes recognizing various regions of the rna substrate found that prv vhs also cleaves downstream of the ires region and this vhs protein overall shows 5 to 3 rnase activity. moreover, addition of the translation initiation factors eif4h and eif4b significantly increased the rnase activity of recombinant prv vhs against capped rna. nonetheless, these proteins did not fully reconstitute the ires-directed targeting pattern observed for vhs translated in a rabbit reticular lysate system. the interaction between prv vhs and eif4h/eif4b implies that the translation initiation machinery within the cell is able to stimulate the nuclease activity of prv vhs. however, this process remains inefficient in terms of the ires-targeting pattern.
cell_biology	endocytosis is a key process in the internalization of extracellular materials and plasma membrane proteins, such as receptors and transporters, thereby controlling many aspects of cell signaling and cellular homeostasis. endocytosis in plants has an essential role not only for basic cellular functions but also for growth and development, nutrient delivery, toxin avoidance, and pathogen defense. the precise mechanisms of endocytosis in plants remain quite elusive. the lack of direct visualization and examination of single events of endocytosis has greatly hampered our ability to precisely monitor the cell surface lifetime and the recruitment profile of proteins driving endocytosis or endocytosed cargos in plants. here, we discuss the necessity to systematically implement total internal reflection fluorescence microcopy (tirf) in the plant cell biology community and present reliable protocols for high spatial and temporal imaging of endocytosis in plants using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a test case, since it represents the major route for internalization of cell-surface proteins in plants. we developed a robust method to directly visualize cell surface proteins using tirf microscopy combined to a high throughput, automated and unbiased analysis pipeline to determine the temporal recruitment profile of proteins to single sites of endocytosis, using the departure of clathrin as a physiological reference for scission. using this 'departure assay', we assessed the recruitment of two different ap-2 subunits, alpha and mu, to the sites of endocytosis and found that ap2a1 was recruited in concert with clathrin, while ap2m was not. this validated approach therefore offers a powerful solution to better characterize the plant endocytic machinery and the dynamics of one 's favorite cargo protein.
immunology	introduction: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) gene -308g/a polymorphism (rs1800629) are associated with psoriasis in several populations worldwide. presently, there is no literature on the status of this polymorphism in the south indian population. aim: to determine the profile of tnf alpha -308g/a polymorphism among psoriatic patients. materials and methods: this case-control study involved 74 patients with psoriasis vulgaris (psv) and 74 age and gender matched healthy individuals. patients were recruited from the department of dermatology of r. l. jalappa hospital and research center, tamaka, kolar, karnataka, india, from march 2014 to march 2016. tnf alpha -308g/a polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) method. results: the frequency of tnf alpha -308a allele 7.4% among psoriatic and 8.8% among non-psoriatic individuals. the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.82). conclusion: our results indicate that tnf alpha gene -308g/a polymorphism is not a significant marker for the risk of developing psv among south indian (karnataka) psoriatic patients.
molecular_biology	aim: little is known about molecular biology of brain metastasis (bm) from colorectal cancer and its concordance with matched primary tumors. materials & methods: we identified 56 consecutive colorectal cancer patients who underwent neurosurgical resection of bm. tumor samples were tested for kras, nras, braf and pik3ca. the molecular profile of the brain lesion was compared with the corresponding primary tumor. results: the molecular profile concordance rate was 95.1%. median survival after neurosurgery was 5.5 months (95% ci: 4.7-6.3); median overall survival was 24.0 months (95% ci: 15.6-32.4). conclusion: in this cohort, we report a high frequency of kras mutations and a very high concordance rate between the molecular status of bm and that of matched primary tumors.
southern_blotting	telomere length analysis has been greatly simplified by the quantitative flow cytometry technique fish-flow. in this method, a fluorescein-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the telomere terminal repeat sequence is hybridized to the telomere sequence and the resulting fluorescence measured by flow cytometry. this technique has supplanted the traditional laborious southern blot telomere length measurement techniques in many laboratories, and allows single cell analysis of telomere length in high-throughput sample formats. nevertheless, the harsh conditions required for telomere probe annealing (82 degrees c) has made it difficult to successfully combine this technique with simultaneous immunolabeling. most traditional organic fluorescent probes (i.e. fluorescein, phycoerythrin, etc.) have limited thermal stability and do not survive the high temperature annealing process, despite efforts to covalently crosslink the antigen-antibody-fluorophore complex. this loss of probe fluorescence has made it difficult to measure fish-flow in complex lymphocyte populations, and has generally forced investigators to use fluorescent-activated cell sorting to pre-separate their populations, a laborious technique that requires prohibitively large numbers of cells. in this study, we have substituted quantum dots (nanoparticles) for traditional fluorophores in fish-flow. quantum dots were demonstrated to possess much greater thermal stability than traditional low molecular weight and phycobiliprotein fluorophores. quantum dot antibody conjugates directed against monocyte and t cell antigens were found to retain most of their fluorescence following the high temperature annealing step, allowing simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement. since quantum dots have very narrow emission bandwidths, we were able to analyze multiple quantum dot antibody conjugates (qdot 605, 655 and 705) simultaneously with fish-flow measurement to assess the age-associated decline in telomere length in both human monocytes and t cell subsets. with quantum dot immunolabeling, the mean decrease rate in telomere length for cd4+ cells was calculated at 41.8 bp/year, very close to previously reported values using traditional flow-fish and southern blotting. this modification to the traditional flow-fish technique should therefore allow simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement, permitting complex cell subset-specific analysis in small numbers of cells without the requirement for prior cell sorting. published by elsevier b.v.
northern_blotting	the present study was designed to compare the expression pattern of dlx3 in four different mineralized tissues because of: 1-its role in skeleton patterning, 2-its expression in dental epithelium and mesenchyme during morphogenesis, 3-the membranous and endochondral bone and tooth phenotype of tricho-dento-osseous syndrome related to dlx3 gene mutation and 4-recently emerging knowledge on dlx family members in the bone field. ameloblasts, odontoblasts, osteoblasts and chondrocytes were analyzed ill vitro and in vivo. dlx3 transcripts were detected by rt-pcr in established model systems (microdissected dental epithelium and mesenchyme; primary cultures of rat chondrocytes), as recently performed in osteoblasts in vitro. a human 414-bp dlx3 probe was generated. a 4.5-kb human dlx3 sense rna was identified in maxillo-facial samples by northern blotting. immunolabeling and in situ hybridization were performed in mice from theiler stage e 14.5 until birth. in teeth, although dlx3 was still expressed in differentiated ameloblasts, it was down regulated during odontoblast polarization. during endochondral bone formation, dlx3 protein was detected in chondrocytes and was most strongly expressed in the prehypertrophic cartilage zone and in differentiating and differentiated osteoblasts of inetaphyseal periosteum. in vitro, real-time pcr studies supported this upregulation in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, closely correlated with ihh variations. in membranous bone, dlx3 was present in preosteoblasts, osteoblasts and osteoid-osteocytes. the present data on dlx3 and recently published functional studies show that this transcription factor may be instrumental during growth in the control of matrix deposition and biomineralization in the entire skeleton.

genetics	heritable predisposition is an important cause of cancer in children and adolescents. although a large number of cancer predisposition genes and their associated syndromes and malignancies have already been described, it appears likely that there are more pediatric cancer patients in whom heritable cancer predisposition syndromes have yet to be recognized. in a consensus meeting in the beginning of 2016, we convened experts in human genetics and pediatric hematology/oncology to review the available data, to categorize the large amount of information, and to develop recommendations regarding when a cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected in a young oncology patient. this review summarizes the current knowledge of cancer predisposition syndromes in pediatric oncology and provides essential information on clinical situations in which a childhood cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected.
human_metabolism	simple voltammetric determination of thiodiglycolic acid (tdga) offers the possibility to follow individual deviations in metabolism of thiocompounds and one-carbon (1c) and two-carbon (2c) units, which take part in endogenous synthesis of creatine (cr). in three groups of young men the levels of tdga in urine were followed after application of cr given as food supplement in 5 g daily doses. in the first group (7 men) it was found that the level of tdga increased independently of the day time of application of cr. in the second group (9 men) the level of tdga increased within an interval of 3-8.5 h after cr application and then dropped during 2 h to the normal level (20 mg l-1). in the third group (11 men), in 4 days' study the effects of cr were compared in alternation to vitamin b-12. vitamin b-12 was given in the evening of the 1st and 3rd day and cr in the morning of the 3rd and 4th day. cr increased the excretion of tdga in all men, while b-12 only in four men independently of cr application.

enzymology	the camp-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase a, pm-a) plays a key role in the control of eukaryotic cellular activity. the enzymology of pk-a in the free-living nematode, caenorhabditis elegans is deceptively simple. single genes encode the catalytic (c) subunit (kin-1), the regulatory (r) subunit (kin-2) and an a-kinase anchor protein (akap) (aka-1); nonetheless, pk-a is able to facilitate a comprehensive array of camp-mediated processes in this model multicellular organism. we have previously demonstrated that, in c. elegans, as many as 12 different isoforms of the c-subunit arise as a consequence of alternative splicing strategies. here, we report the occurrence of transcripts encoding novel isoforms of the pm-a r-subunit in c. elegans. in place of exons 1 and 2, these transcripts include coding sequences from novel b or q exons directly linked to exon 3, thereby generating isoforms with novel n-termini. r-subunits containing an exon b-encoded n-terminal polypeptide sequence were detected in extracts prepared from mixed populations of c elegans. of note is the observation that r-subunit isoforms containing exon b- or exon q-encoded polypeptide sequences lack the dimerisation/docking domains conventionally seen in r-subunits. this means that they are unlikely to participate in the formation of tetrameric pm-a holoenzymes and, additionally, they are unlikely to interact with akap(s). it is therefore possible that, in c. elegans, in addition to tetrameric (r2c2) pm-a holoenzymes, there is also a sub-population of dimeric (rc) pm-a enzymes that are not tethered by akaps. furthermore, inspection of the n-terminal sequence encoded by exon b suggests that this isoform is a likely target for n-myristoylation. although unusual, a number of similarly n-myristoylatable r-subunits, from a range of different species, are present in the databases, suggesting that this may be a more generally observed feature of r-subunit structure. the occurrence of r-subunit isoforms, without dimerisation/docking domains (with or without n-myristoylatable n-termini) in other species would suggest that the control of pm-a activity may be more complex than hitherto thought.

molecular_biology	background hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein, in addition to its structural role to form the nucleocapsid assembly, plays a critical role in hcv pathogenesis by interfering in several cellular processes, including microrna and mrna homeostasis. the c-terminal truncated hcv core protein (c124) is intrinsically unstructured in solution and is able to interact with unspecific nucleic acids, in the micromolar range, and to assemble into nucleocapsid-like particles (nlps) in vitro. the specificity and propensity of c124 to the assembly and its implications on hcv pathogenesis are not well understood. methods spectroscopic techniques, transmission electron microscopy and calorimetry were used to better understand the propensity of c124 to fold or to multimerize into nlps when subjected to different conditions or in the presence of unspecific nucleic acids of equivalent size to cellular micrornas. results the structural analysis indicated that c124 has low propensity to self-folding. on the other hand, for the first time, we show that c124, in the absence of nucleic acids, multimerizes into empty nlps when subjected to a ph close to its isoelectric point (ph ? 12), indicating that assembly is mainly driven by charge neutralization. isothermal calorimetry data showed that the assembly of nlps promoted by nucleic acids is enthalpy driven. additionally, data obtained from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy show that c124, in nanomolar range, was able to interact and to sequester a large number of short unspecific nucleic acids into nlps. discussion together, our data showed that the charge neutralization is the major factor for the nucleocapsid-like particles assembly from c-terminal truncated hcv core protein. this finding suggests that hcv core protein may physically interact with unspecific cellular polyanions, which may correspond to micrornas and mrnas in a host cell infected by hcv, triggering their confinement into infectious particles.
molecular_biology	current treatments for acute or degenerative chondral and osteochondral lesions are in need of improvement, as these types of injuries lead to disability and worsen the quality of life in a high percentage of patients. the aim of this study was to develop a new bi-layered scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration through a ""biomimetic"" and ""bioinspired"" approach. for chondral regeneration, the scaffold was realized with an organic compound (type i collagen), while for the regeneration of the subchondral layer, bioactive magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (mg/ha) crystals were co-precipitated with the organic component of the scaffold. the entire scaffold structure was stabilized with a cross-linking agent, highly reactive bis-epoxyde (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether - bddge 1 wt%). the developed scaffold was then characterized for its physico-chemical characteristics. its structure and adhesion strength between the integrated layers were investigated. at the same time, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to examine the ability of chondral and bone scaffold layers to separately support adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. moreover, an in vivo study with nude mice, transplanted with osteochondral scaffolds plain or engineered with undifferentiated hmscs, was also set up with 4 and 8-week time points. the results showed that chondral and bone scaffold layers represented biocompatible scaffolds able to sustain hmscs attachment and proliferation. moreover, the association of scaffold stimuli and differentiation medium, induced hmscs chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ecm). the ectopic implantation of the engineered osteochondral scaffolds indicated that hmscs were able to colonize the osteochondral scaffold in depth. the scaffold appeared permissive to tissue growth and penetration, ensuring the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, as also suggested by the presence of a neo-angiogenesis process, especially at 4 weeks. moreover, the in vivo results further confirmed the great potential of the scaffold in tissue engineering, as it was able to support the initial formation of new bone and chondral tissue, confirming the importance of combined and innovative strategies to improve the available therapeutic strategies for chondral and osteochondral regeneration.

northern_blotting	we constructed a ssh (suppression subtractive hybridization) library based on two populations (rs-c and rs-p) of radopholus similis from different host plants and exhibiting differences in pathogenicity on musa paradisiaca and anthurium andraeanum plants. in order to screen the clones with significant expression differences from the ssh library, a total of 2,400 clones was randomly selected and reverse northern blotting was performed on them. out of the 2,400 clones, 89 clones showed significant expression differences. out of sequencing these 89 clones, distinct sequences from 87 clones were obtained. aligning the 87 distinct sequences against the non-redundant nucleotide database (nr) in ncbi, we found that five sequences were highly conserved with rs-eng-1b. two of five sequences with lengths of 467 base pairs (bp) (gw395922) and 742 bp (gw395923) were further employed to perform 5' race-pcr and 3' race-pcr, respectively. subsequently, the complete length of rs-eng-1b (eu414839) was obtained (1,427 bp). our qpcr result showed that expression of rs-eng-1b in the population rs-c with high pathogenicity on host plants was approximately 2.7 times as much as the expression of rs-eng-1b in the population rs-p with low pathogenicity on host plants. furthermore, the gene rs-eng-1b from the rs-c population also showed expression differences amongst four different development stages. the order of rs-eng-1b relative expression abundance from high to low was females, juveniles, males, and eggs. we further used rnai to test whether rs-eng-1b of rs-c population was responsible for pathogenicity which was the first rnai work about rs-eng-1b. the rnai results showed that rs-eng-1b expression had a positive correlation to pathogenicity of the population. the longer the rnai treatment, the less pathogenic the nematode population was. non-endogenous gfp dsrna had no significant influence on the expression of rs-eng-1b and pathogenicity of r. similis rs-c population. in conclusion, all our evidence indicated rs-eng-1b might be a crucial pathogenicity-related gene in r. similis.
human_metabolism	to obtain quantitative information on human metabolism of selenium, we have performed selenium speciation analysis by hplc/lcpms on samples of human urine from one volunteer over a 48-hour period after ingestion of selenium (1.0 mg) as sodium selenite, l-selenomethionine, or dl-selenomethionine. the three separate experiments were performed in duplicate. normal background urine from the volunteer contained total selenium concentrations of 8-30 mu g se/l (n=22) but, depending on the chromatographic conditions, only about 30-70% could be quantified by hplc/icpms. the major species in background urine were two selenosugars, namely methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-d-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 1) and its deacylated analog methyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-l-seleno-beta-d-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 3). selenium was rapidly excreted after ingestion of the selenium compounds: the peak concentrations (similar to 250-400 mu g se/l, normalized concentrations) were recorded within 5-9 hours, and concentrations had returned to close to background levels within 48 hours, by which time 25-40% of the ingested selenium, depending on the species ingested, had been accounted for in the urine. in all experiments, the major metabolite was selenosugar 1, constituting either similar to 80% of the total selenium excreted over the first 24 hours after ingestion of selenite or l-selenomethionine or similar to 65% after ingestion of dl-selenomethionine. selenite was not present at significant levels (< 1 mu g se/l) in any of the samples; selenomethionine was present in only trace amounts (similar to 1 mu g/l, equivalent to less than 0.5% of the total se) following ingestion of l-selenomethionine, but it constituted about 20% of the excreted selenium (first 24 hours) after ingestion of dl-selenomethionine, presumably because the d form was not efficiently metabolized. trimethylselenonium ion, a commonly reported urine metabolite, could not be detected (<1 mu g/l) in the urine samples after ingestion of selenite or selenomethionine. cytotoxicity studies on selenosugar 1 and its glucosamine isomer (selenosugar 2, methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-d-glucosopyranoside) were per-formed with hepg2 cells derived from human hepatocarcinoma, and these showed that both compounds had low toxicity (about 1000-fold less toxic than sodium selenite). the results support earlier studies showing that selenosugar i is the major urinary metabolite after increased selenium intake, and they suggest that previously accepted pathways for human metabolism of selenium involving trimethylselenonium ion as the excretionary end product may need to be re-evaluated.
enzymology	since adrian brown and victor henri 's work, the simplest enzyme kinetics model, which contains only three rate constants k(1), k(2) and k(-1) in 1902, has been thoroughly explored in many directions. by using the michaelis-menten equation, k-m and k(2) can be measured quickly. all the three rate constants can be derived by temperature jump method or transient state kinetics, but both methods need more complicated techniques and equipments. in our previous paper (li et al. in j math chem 46: 290-301, 2009), we gave a method to measure all the rate constants which does not require any additional equipment other than those needed for measuring k-m and k(2). here, we propose a new one which needs no additional equipment either. this method is based on a study of inflection points of integral curves. numerical results show that the new one is much better than the previous one in two aspects: near the end of the reaction, the new one gives more accurate estimation; during the quasi-steady state of the reaction, it also gives good estimations while the previous one can not. hence, this method not only advances the estimation accuracy, but also has more choices for measuring.
northern_blotting	fragile x syndrome (fxs) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation disease. this is caused due to expansion of cgg triplet in 5'-untranslated region of fragile x mental retardation 1 (fmr-1) gene. in most of the cases, abnormally large size of the cgg repeat (>200) undergoes hypermethylation, which in turn silences the fmr-1 gene causing thereby complete lack of its protein product called fragile x mental retardation protein (fmrp). lack of fmrp due to gene silencing or production of faulty protein due to point mutation in kh2 domain of fmrp alters the translational process in neurons and leads to expression of mental retardation phenotype on the patients. the fmrp is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues; however, it is predominantly expressed in neurons and testis. it possesses heterogeneity and is found in many isoforms due to alternative splicing of the fmr-1 transcript. based on our data from the western-, slot-, northern blotting and immunohistochemical studies, we report here the down regulation of fmr-1 gene and fmrp in mice brain in age-dependent manner. the present finding is important in respect to fmrp-dependent various brain functions i.e., learning, memory, cognition etc. that decrease with advancing age.
northern_blotting	our previous studies demonstrated that sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (sglt-1) was induced in the remnant ileum of total colectomized rats via the action of factors other than hyperaldosteronism. the aim of the present study was to clarify whether fecal stream is required for the enhancement of sglt-1-mediated sodium transport. twenty-seven pairs of ileal tissues were obtained from the proximal and distal side, respectively, of loop ileostomy after total proctocolectomy. mucosae were mounted in an ussing chamber to evaluate glucose-coupled sodium transport. levels of sglt-1 mrna in proximal and distal mucosae were compared by northern blotting. villous height and crypt depth were measured to test for correlations between mucosal structure and sglt-1-mediated sodium transport or mrna expression levels. both glucose-coupled sodium transport and expression of sglt-i mrna were significantly lower in distal mucosae relative to proximal mucosae. in distal mucosae, villous height, but not crypt depth, was significantly lower than in proximal mucosae, demonstrating a positive correlation between villous height and sglt-1 function and expression. comparative studies of proximal and distal mucosae demonstrated that in addition to hormonal changes, fecal stream is required for full induction of the sodium transport system (which includes sglt-1-mediated transport) in the remnant ileum following total proctocolectomy.
cell_biology	this survey paper contains a brief analysis of publications included in the current issue of the scientific journal cytology and genetics dedicated to its 50th anniversary. these papers reflect scientific achievements of their authors in the field of genetics and cell biology and underline the potential of these two biological disciplines, forming the double helix of the journal.
polymerase_chain_reaction	in this study, a specific and sensitive method for simultaneous detection of human astrovirus, human rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus and enteric adenovirus associated with acute enteritis was developed, based on the specific dual priming oligonucleotide (dpo) system and the sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. the dpo system-based multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) combined with hplc assay was more sensitive than agarose gel electrophoresis analysis and real-time sybr green pcr assay, and showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 96%-100%. the high sensitivity and specificity of the assay indicates its great potential to be a useful tool for the accurate diagnosis of enteric virus infections.

cell_biology	oxygen plays a key role in stem cell biology as a signaling molecule and as an indicator of cell energy metabolism. quantification of cellular oxygen kinetics, i.e. the determination of specific oxygen uptake rates (sours), is routinely used to understand metabolic shifts. however current methods to determine sour in adherent cell cultures rely on cell sampling, which impacts on cellular phenotype. we present real-time monitoring of cell growth from phase contrast microscopy images, and of respiration using optical sensors for dissolved oxygen. time-course data for bulk and peri-cellular oxygen concentrations obtained for chinese hamster ovary (cho) and mouse embryonic stem cell (mescs) cultures successfully demonstrated this non-invasive and label-free approach. additionally, we confirmed non-invasive detection of cellular responses to rapidly changing culture conditions by exposing the cells to mitochondrial inhibiting and uncoupling agents. for the cho and mescs, sour values between 8 and 60 amol cell(-1) s(-1), and 5 and 35 amol cell(-1) s(-1) were obtained, respectively. these values compare favorably with literature data. the capability to monitor oxygen tensions, cell growth, and sour, of adherent stem cell cultures, non-invasively and in real time, will be of significant benefit for future studies in stem cell biology and stem cell-based therapies.
molecular_biology	purpose of review atp-citrate lyase (acly) has re-emerged as a drug target for ldl cholesterol (ldl-c) lowering. we review acly as a therapeutic strategy, its genetics, its molecular and cellular biology, and also its inhibition. recent findings acly is a critical enzyme linking glucose catabolism to lipogenesis by providing acetyl-coa from mitochondrial citrate for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. human genetic variants have been associated with enhanced growth and survival of several cancers, and with attenuated plasma triglyceride responses to dietary fish oil. in mice, liver-specific acly deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia, whereas adipose tissue-specific acly deletion has no phenotype, supporting therapeutic inhibition of acly. a lipid-regulating compound, bempedoic acid, was discovered to potently inhibit acly, and in animal models, it prevents dyslipidemia and attenuates atherosclerosis. phase 2 clinical trials revealed that bempedoic acid effectively lowers ldl-c as monotherapy, combined with ezetimibe, added to statin therapy and in statin-intolerant hypercholesterolemic patients. summary the efficacy of bempedoic acid as an ldl-c-lowering agent has validated acly inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. positive results of phase 3 patient studies, together with long-term cardiovascular disease outcome trials, are required to establish acly as a major new target in cardiovascular medicine.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background the time of progression towards aids can vary greatly among seropositive patients, and may be associated with host genetic variation. the nr1i2 (pxr) gene, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates the transcription immune pathway genes and can therefore be targets of viral replication mechanisms influencing time of progression to aids. objective to verify the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) rs3814057, rs6785049, rs7643645, and rs2461817 in the nr1i2 (pxr) gene with progression to aids in hiv-1 infected patients. methods blood samples were obtained from 96 hiv-1 positive individuals following informed consent. dna was isolated and genotyped through real time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the presence of snps in the nr1i2. questionnaires on socio-demographic features and behaviors were answered and time of progression to aids was estimated based on medical chart analysis. findings patients with the gg genotype for rs7643645 were shown to be related with a more rapid disease progression when compared to ga and aa genotypes. this result was maintained by the multivariate cox regression considering sex, ethnicity, and presence of hla-b*57, hla-b*27, and ccr5del32 polymorphisms. main conclusions recent studies reported the expression of the nuclear receptors in t-lymphocytes, suggesting their possible role in the immune response. in addition, nuclear receptors have been shown to inhibit the hiv replication, although no such mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated to date. this is the first time an association between nr1i2 polymorphism and time of progression to aids is reported and supports an apparent relationship between the gene in the immune response and identifies another genetic factor influencing aids progression.
enzymology	the addition of two electrons and two protons to the c-17=c-18 bond in protochlorophyllide is catalyzed by a light-dependent enzyme relying on nadph as electron donor, and by a light-independent enzyme bearing a (cys)(3)asp-ligated [ 4fe-4s] cluster which is reduced by cytoplasmic electron donors in an atp-dependent manner and then functions as electron donor to protochlorophyllide. the precise sequence of events occurring at the c-17=c-18 bond has not, however, been determined experimentally in the dark-operating enzyme. in this paper, we present the computational investigation of the reaction mechanism of this enzyme at the b3lyp/6-311+ g(d, p)//b3lyp/6-31g(d) level of theory. the reaction mechanism begins with single-electron reduction of the substrate by the (cys) 3asp-ligated [ 4fe-4s], yielding a negatively-charged intermediate. depending on the rate of fe-s cluster re-reduction, the reaction either proceeds through double protonation of the single-electron-reduced substrate, or by alternating proton/electron transfer. the computed reaction barriers suggest that fe-s cluster re-reduction should be the rate-limiting stage of the process. poisson-boltzmann computations on the full enzyme-substrate complex, followed by monte carlo simulations of redox and protonation titrations revealed a hitherto unsuspected ph-dependence of the reaction potential of the fe-s cluster. furthermore, the computed distributions of protonation states of the his, asp and glu residues were used in conjuntion with single-point oniom computations to obtain, for the first time, the influence of all protonation states of an enzyme on the reaction it catalyzes. despite exaggerating the ease of reduction of the substrate, these computations confirmed the broad features of the reaction mechanism obtained with the medium-sized models, and afforded valuable insights on the influence of the titratable amino acids on each reaction step. additional comparisons of the energetic features of the reaction intermediates with those of common biochemical redox intermediates suggest a surprisingly simple explanation for the mechanistic differences between the dark-catalyzed and light-dependent enzyme reaction mechanisms.
immunology	background: anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria were proposed at the second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis. these criteria were 97% sensitive and 82% specific when retrospectively validated. objective: to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases/food allergy and anaphylaxis network (niaid/faan) criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ed). methods: we conducted a prospective observational study of patients seen in our institution 's ed from april 2010 to march 2013. patients seeking care for an allergic reaction and possible anaphylaxis were enrolled. patients and providers completed questionnaires regarding onset, trigger, and signs and symptoms. records were reviewed independently and blindly by 2 board-certified allergist-immunologists, and their final diagnosis (anaphylaxis vs no anaphylaxis) was used as the reference standard. two-by-two tables were built, and test characteristics were calculated. results: among the 174 enrolled patients, 91 (52%) met the niaid/faan criteria for anaphylaxis. the allergist-immunologists diagnosed 61 cases of anaphylaxis (35%), of which 58 (95%) also satisfied the niaid/faan criteria. the interrater agreement between allergist-immunologists was substantial (k = 0.7). test characteristics (95% cis) of the niaid/faan criteria were as follows: sensitivity, 95.1% (85.4%-98.7%); specificity, 70.8% (61.4%-78.8%); positive predictive value, 63.7% (52.9%-73.4%); negative predictive value, 96.4% (89.1%-99.1%); positive likelihood ratio, 3.26; and negative likelihood ratio, 0.07. conclusions: prospectively, the niaid/faan criteria continued to be highly sensitive (95%) but had lower specificity (71%) than on retrospective assessment. these criteria are likely to be useful for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the ed.

human_metabolism	food security is the main concern of government due to malnutrition worldwide. the aim of this study was to assess macronutrients and amino acids in five species of grasshoppers, consumed in rural and urban communities. samples were captured in different agro climatic environment conditions, wherever vegetation grows, and the macronutrients were raw, analyzed in dry basis by the aoac methods and amino acids by cation exchange chromatography. the obtained data showed a high protein content, ranging from 70% to 75%; lipids 4% to 6%; minerals 3% to 5%; fiber 6% to 8% and soluble carbohydrates 6% to 18%, including essential amino acids that play an important role in human metabolism, with tryptophan as limiting factor. the different species of the studied grasshoppers are high in proteins, essential macromolecules for human life that decrease protein-energy malnutrition; the excess of amino acids after releasing the amino group will provide energy, as well as soluble carbohydrates. they also have minerals that are needed to prevent anemia, and fiber, non-digestible carbohydrates essential in a healthy diet. in conclusion, the daily consumption of 5 or 6 grasshoppers is a good source of nutrients that will provide optimal health to population.
polymerase_chain_reaction	currently in china, the schistosomiasis control program has shifted its focus from transmission control to the elimination of the disease. effective forecast and surveillance systems of schistiosomiasis are of great importance for issuing timely and early warnings on risk of infection, and therefore implementing preventive measures to avoid infection. there is great demand in more sensitive and specific methods to improve the surveillance system for early detection of s. japonicum infection in sentinel mice. in this study, we reported a sensitive nested-pcr assay targeting a 303-bp fragment from highly repetitive retrotransposon sjchgcsi9 to detect the s. japonicum dna in sera of experimental mice. meanwhile, detection efficacy of the nested-pcr was compared with two conventional methods for field monitoring schistosomiasis such as elisa and iha. the nested-pcr assay could detect the specific dna at 3-day post infection in sera of mice with 5 cercariae infection, while for elisa and iha, both show negative results even after 2 weeks post-infection in mice with 20 cercariae infection. our results demonstrated the dna based assay was more sensitive to make early diagnosis of s. japonicum infection in sentinel mice models, which will improve the early-warning ability of schistosomiasis surveillance system.

molecular_biology	metagenomics is a robust, interdisciplinary approach for studying microbial community composition, function, and dynamics. it typically involves a core of molecular biology, microbiology, ecology, statistics, and computational biology. exciting outcomes anticipated from these studies include unraveling of complex interactions that characterize the ecological milieu of microbial communities. diverse habitats from which metagenomes have been reported include human guts, caterpillar guts, thermal vents in oceans, ore deposits, polar caps, and even soils that adhere to plant roots. knowledge generated from metagenomic projects has tremendous potential to benefit human health, agriculture, and ecosystem functions. this article provides a brief history of technical advances in metagenomics, including dna sequencing methods, and some case studies. a specific example is provided of microbial metagenomes found at the roots of native grass species (family poaceae) that can grow on degraded lands undergoing revegetation.
human_metabolism	lipids are a diverse class of metabolites that play several key roles in the maintenance of human health. lipidomics, which focuses on the global study of molecular lipids in cells, tissues, and biofluids, has been advancing rapidly over the past decade. recent developments in ms and computational methods enable the lipid analysis with high throughput, resolution, sensitivity, and ability for structural identification of several hundreds of lipids. in nutrition research, lipidomics can be effectively used to elucidate the interactions between diet, nutrients, and human metabolism. lipidomics can also be applied to optimize the effects of food processing on the dietary value, and in the evaluation of food-related health effects.
polymerase_chain_reaction	backgroundpatterns of influenza molecular viral shedding following influenza infection have been well established; predictors of viral shedding however remain uncertain. objectiveswe sought to determine factors associated with peak molecular viral load, duration of shedding, and viral area under the curve (auc) in children and adult hutterite colony members with laboratory-confirmed influenza. methodsa cohort study was conducted in hutterite colonies in alberta, canada. flocked nasal swabs were collected during three influenza seasons (2007-2008 to 2009-2010) from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with influenza. samples were tested by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza a and influenza b, and the viral load was determined for influenza a-positive samples. resultsfor seasonal h1n1, younger age was associated with a larger auc, female sex was associated with decreased peak viral load and reduced viral shedding duration, while the presence of comorbidity was associated with increased peak viral load. for h3n2, younger age was associated with increased peak viral load and increased auc. for pandemic h1n1, younger age was associated with increased peak viral load and increased viral auc, female sex was associated with reduced peak viral load, while inapparent infection was associated with reduced peak viral load, reduced viral shedding duration, and reduced viral auc. conclusionspatterns of molecular viral shedding vary by age, sex, comorbidity, and the presence of symptoms. predictor variables vary by influenza a subtype.
southern_blotting	glutathione s-transferases (gsts) are ubiquitous enzymes in animals and plants, and they are multifunctional proteins encoded by a large gene family. gsts are involved in response to the oxidative stress including drought, salt, heavy metals, and so on. under oxidative stress, the excessive reactive oxygen species (ros) induce an increase in gst levels, and then the gsts metabolize the toxic products of lipid peroxidation, damaged dna and other molecules. previously, a full-length cdna of a novel zeta gst gene, ppgst, was characterized from fruit of pyrus pyrifolia nakai cv. huobali. in the present study, a constitutive plant expression vector of ppgst was constructed and transferred into tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l. cv xanthi) to verify the function of ppgst. as a result, the ppgst gene was successfully integrated into the genome of the transgenic tobacco lines and expressed as expected in the transformants through southern blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) analysis. growth of t1 generation plants of ppgst transgenic lines and wt under non-stressful conditions was similar, however, the transgenic tobacco lines showed relatively normal growth under drought, nacl, and cadmium (cd) stresses. furthermore, the t1 transgenic tobacco lines showed significantly slower superoxide anion production rate than the wt under abiotic stress. simultaneously, the mda content of each t1 transgenic tobacco plant was only slightly increased and significantly lower than that of the wt under drought, salt and cd stress. together with the gst activity of the transgenic tobacco lines, which was significantly increased under stressful conditions, as compared with that in wt, overexpression of ppgst in tobacco enhanced the tolerance of transgenic tobacco lines to oxidative damage caused by drought, nacl, and cd stresses.
cell_biology	the accuracy of water models derived from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations by means on an improved force-matching scheme is assessed for various thermodynamic, transport, and structural properties. it is found that although the resulting force-matched water models are typically less accurate than fully empirical force fields in predicting thermodynamic properties, they are nevertheless much more accurate than generally appreciated in reproducing the structure of liquid water and in fact superseding most of the commonly used empirical water models. this development demonstrates the feasibility to routinely parametrize computationally efficient yet predictive potential energy functions based on accurate ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for a large variety of different systems.

immunology	introduction: primary sjogren 's syndrome (pss) is one of the autoimmune diseases characterized by polyclonal autoantibody production. the human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (mdm2) is an important negative regulator of p53. our previous study indicated that autoantibody to mdm2 can be detected in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. the purpose of this study is to study anti-mdm2 autoantibody in pss patients. methods: anti-mdm2 autoantibody in sera from 100 pss patients and 74 normal controls was investigated by elisa. positive samples were further confirmed by western blotting. expression of mdm2 in labial gland tissue from pss patients and normal controls was checked by immunohistochemistry. the difference in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between anti-mdm2 positive and anti-mdm2 negative pss patients was analyzed. results: the presence of anti-mdm2 autoantibody in pss patients was 21.0%, significantly higher than normal controls (5.40%). mdm2 was overexpressed in labial gland from pss patients. pss patients with positive anti-mdm2 were characterized by longer disease duration and more lymphocytes focal gathering in labial gland. prevalence of anemia, thrombocytopenia and anti-ssb was significantly higher in pss patients with anti-mdm2 autoantibody. titer of anit-mdm2 was negatively associated with hemoglobin level, platelet count, complement 3 level and complement 4 level, positively associated with european sjogren 's syndrome disease activity index (essdai) and level of igg. conclusions: anti-mdm2 autoantibody may be used as a potential serological biomarker in pss disease activity evaluation. study on the role of anti-mdm2 or mdm2 in pss may help us know the pathogenesis mechanism of pss better.
cell_biology	background: recent works have suggested a possible link between interleukin (il)-33 and b-cell biology. we aimed to study the possible association between serum il-33 detection and response to rituximab (rtx) in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients in different cohorts with an accurate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). methods: serum il-33, rheumatoid factor (rf), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-ccp), and high serum immunoglobulin (ig) g levels were assessed in 111 ra patients receiving a first course of 2 g rtx (cohort 1) in an observational study and in 74 ra patients treated with the same schedule in routine care (cohort 2). univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with a european league against rheumatism (eular) response at 24 weeks. results: at week 24, 84/111 (76%) and 54/74 (73%) patients reached eular response in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. serum il-33 was detectable in only 33.5% of the patients. in the combined cohorts, the presence of rf or anti-ccp (odds ratio (or) 3.27, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.13-9.46; p = 0.03), high serum igg (or 2.32, 95% ci 1.01-5.33; p = 0.048), and detectable serum il-33 (or 2.40, 95% ci 1.01-5.72; p = 0.047) were all associated with rtx response in multivariate analysis. the combination of these three factors increased the likelihood of response to rtx. when serum il-33 detection was added to seropositivity and serum igg level, 100% of the patients with the three risk factors (corresponding to 9% of the population) responded to rtx (or versus patients with none of the three risk factors 29.61, 95% ci 1.30-674.79; p = 0.034). conclusion: detectable serum il-33 may predict clinical response to rtx independently of, and synergistically with, auto-antibodies and serum igg level.
immunology	in the treatment of hemophilia a, the 20%-30% risk of developing of anti-factor viii (fviii) antibodies, or inhibitors, is the dominant concern among healthcare providers. immune tolerance induction remains the only effective method of eradicating inhibitors in approximately 75% of patients, but is accompanied by significant emotional and economical burden. while certain risk factors, such as the type of fviii mutation, offer some insight, there remains no strategy to confidently predict the development of an inhibitor. moreover, even if such a predictive tool existed, there is currently no proven protocol for tolerance induction of a previously untreated patient. in recent years, the growing body of knowledge concerning the fundamental immunology of inhibitors has shed light on potential therapeutic interventions. in this review, we highlight these new findings and their influences on translational medicine.
cell_biology	numerous studies have examined the role of micrornas (mirnas) in cell homeostasis and cardiovascular disease and have markedly improved our understanding of rna biology in general and the potential role of mirnas in atherosclerosis. in atherosclerosis, several mirnas, such as mir-33a,b, mir-92a, mir-126 and others, have been identified that are relevant mediators of pathological processes, including regulation of cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis, lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol efflux, but also immune responses, endothelial cell biology and vascular function. further understanding of the specific roles of mirnas in the distinct cell types involved in atherosclerosis initiation, progression and resolution may reveal new intervention strategies for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

southern_blotting	lepidopteran larvae are the most injurious pests of chinese cabbage production. we attempted the development of transgenic chinese cabbage expressing the potato proteinase inhibitor ii gene (pinii) and bioassayed the pest-repelling ability of these transgenic plants. cotyledons with petioles from aseptic seedlings were used as explants for agrobacterium-mediated in vitro transformation. agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 contained the binary vector pbbbasta-pinii-bar comprising pial and bar genes. plants showing vigorous ppt resistance were obtained by a series concentration selection for ppt resistance and subsequent regeneration of leaf explants dissected from the putative chimera. transgenic plants were confirmed by pcr and genomic southern blotting, which showed that the bar and pinii genes were integrated into the plant genome. double haploid homozygous transgenic plants were obtained by microspore culture. the pinii expression was detected using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) and detection of pinii protein content in the transgenic homozygous lines. insect-feeding trials using the larvae of cabbage worm (pieris rapae) and the larvae of the diamondback moth (plutella xylostella) showed higher larval mortality, stunted larval development, and lower pupal weights, pupation rates, and eclosion rates in most of the transgenic lines in comparison with the corresponding values in the non-transformed wild-type line.
immunology	the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of nucleotide transition (g/a) in position -2518 of the mcp-1 gene related to the susceptibility of developing ra. two hundred twenty-three consecutive ra patients according to 2010 acr/eular criteria were included; 120 healthy subjects were used as controls. mcp-1 -2518 a/g polymorphism (ag + gg) was present in 162 (72.6 %) ra patients and in 63 (52.5 %) healthy subjects [or 2.44 (ic95% 1.53-3.88, p = 0.0002)]; associations for heterozygotes and homozygotes were or 1.92 (ic95% 1.19-3.15, p = 0.001) and or 5.19 (ic95% 2.34-11.51, p = 0.001), respectively. in argentine patients, mcp-1 gene polymorphism confers susceptibility for developing ra.
cell_biology	glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk-3) is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in an array of critical cellular processes. gsk-3 was first characterized as an enzyme that phosphorylated and inactivated glycogen synthase. however, subsequent studies have revealed that this moon-lighting protein is involved in numerous signaling pathways that regulate not only metabolism but also have roles in: apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell renewal, differentiation, embiyogenesis, migration, regulation of gene transcription, stem cell biology and survival. in this review, we will discuss the roles that gsk-3 plays in various diseases as well as how this pivotal kinase interacts with multiple signaling pathways such as: pi3k/pten/akt/mtor, ras/raf/mek/erk, wnt/beta-catenin, hedgehog, notch and tp53. mutations that occur in these and other pathways can alter the effects that natural gsk-3 activity has on regulating these signaling circuits that can lead to cancer as well as other diseases. the novel roles that micrornas play in regulation of the effects of gsk-3 will also be evaluated. targeting gsk-3 and these other pathways may improve therapy and overcome therapeutic resistance.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate two different types of implant-abutment connections: screwed connection and cemented connection, analyzing peri-implant bacteria microflora as well as other clinical parameters. patients and methods: twenty implants were selected, inserted in 20 patients, 10 with a screwed implant-abutment connection (group 1) and 10 with a cemented implant-abutment connection (group 2). the peri-implant microflora was collected, after at least 360 days from the prosthetic rehabilitation, using paper points inserted in peri-implant sulcus for 30 s. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) real-time analyzed the presence of 9 bacteria periodontal-pathogens and candida albicans. results: our findings showed that bacteria colonized all groups analyzed, the average bacterial count was 3.7 e + 08 (+/- 1.19) in group 1, compared to 2.1 e + 08 (+/- 0.16) in group 2; no statistically significant differences were observed (p >0.0.5). in group 1, however, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for 5 bacteria, indicating a high-risk of peri-implantitis. also in group 2, results showed a microflora composed by all bacteria analyzed but, in this case, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for only 1 bacterium, indicating a lower risk of peri-implantitis. moreover, clinical parameters (ppd >3 mm and m sbi >0) confirmed a greater risk of peri-implantitis in group 1 compared to group 2 (p < 0.05). conclusions: we concluded that, also after only 360 days, implants with screwed connection showed a higher risk of peri-implantitis that implants with cemented connection.
southern_blotting	analyzing the basic mechanism of dna double-strand breaks (dsb) formation during meiosis is important for understanding sexual reproduction and genetic diversity. the location and amount of meiotic dsbs can be examined by using a common molecular biological technique called southern blotting, but only a subset of the total dsbs can be observed; only dsb fragments still carrying the region recognized by a southern blot probe are detected. with the assumption that dsb formation follows a nonhomogeneous poisson process, we propose two estimators of the total number of dsbs on a chromosome: (1) an estimator based on the nelson-aalen estimator, and (2) an estimator based on a record value process. further, we compared their asymptotic accuracy.
immunology	significance: in the last years, metabolic reprogramming, fluctuations in bioenergetic fuels, and modulation of oxidative stress became new key hallmarks of tumor development. in cancer, elevated glucose uptake and high glycolytic rate, as a source of adenosine triphosphate, constitute a growth advantage for tumors. this represents the universally known warburg effect, which gave rise to one major clinical application for detecting cancer cells using glucose analogs: the positron emission tomography scan imaging. recent advances: glucose utilization and carbon sources in tumors are much more heterogeneous than initially thought. indeed, new studies emerged and revealed a dual capacity of tumor cells for glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) metabolism. oxphos metabolism, which relies predominantly on mitochondrial respiration, exhibits fine-tuned regulation of respiratory chain complexes and enhanced antioxidant response or detoxification capacity. critical issues: oxphos-dependent cancer cells use alternative oxidizable substrates, such as glutamine and fatty acids. the diversity of carbon substrates fueling neoplastic cells is indicative of metabolic heterogeneity, even within tumors sharing the same clinical diagnosis. metabolic switch supports cancer cell stemness and their bioenergy-consuming functions, such as proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. moreover, reactive oxygen species-induced mitochondrial metabolism and nutrient availability are important for interaction with tumor microenvironment components. carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and immune cells participate in the metabolic interplay with neoplastic cells. they collectively adapt in a dynamic manner to the metabolic needs of cancer cells, thus participating in tumorigenesis and resistance to treatments. future directions: characterizing the reciprocal metabolic interplay between stromal, immune, and neoplastic cells will provide a better understanding of treatment resistance.
molecular_biology	craniofacial bone defects are challenging problems for maxillofacial surgeons over the years. with the development of cell and molecular biology, gene therapy is a breaking new technology with the aim of regenerating tissues by acting as a delivery system for therapeutic genes in the craniofacial region rather than treating genetic disorders. a systematic review was conducted summarizing the articles reporting gene therapy in maxillofacial surgery to answer the question: was gene therapy successfully applied to regenerate bone in the maxillofacial region? electronic searching of online databases was performed in addition to hand searching of the references of included articles. nolanguage or time restrictions were enforced. meta-analysis was done to assess significant bone formation after delivery of gene material in the surgically induced maxillofacial defects. the search identified 2081 articles, of which 57 were included with 1726 animals. bone morphogenetic proteins were commonly used proteins for gene therapy. viral vectors were the universally used vectors. sprague-dawley rats were the frequently used animal model in experimental studies. the quality of the articles ranged from excellent to average. meta-analysis results performed on 21 articles showed that defects favored bone formation by gene therapy. funnel plot showed symmetry with the absence of publication bias. gene therapy is on the top list of innovative strategies that developed in the last 10 years with the hope of developing a simple chair-side protocol in the near future, combining improvement of gene delivery as well as knowledge of the molecular basis of oral and maxillofacial structures.
molecular_biology	in recent years, the disposal of former industrial sites has widely become a key subject of interest in terms of remediation in order to promote their different use for the community. the use of biological processes, such as phytoremediation, has been worldwide discussed with varying success. in this study, we applied an integrated phytoremediation system (ips), which represents a cost-effective system, environmentally friendly, socially accepted for the removal of the risks associated with the contamination of heavy metal (as, cd, pb and zn) of unsaturated soils. the combination of suitable agronomic soil management and biostimulation of plant growth by inoculation of rhizosphere microbes allowed to increase biomass production of selected plant species (acacia saligna and eucalyptus camaldulensis) in very stressful conditions and, consequently, promote the phytoremediation of contaminants. the experimental study in situ revealed a significant positive aptitude of selected plant species to keep ptes (potential toxic elements) in their root system, with a restricted translocation to the aboveground parts. the ""plant-fungi-bacteria"" system in rhizosphere level showed, also, strong ability to remove the bioavailable fraction of contaminants with a considerable reduction of the risks associated to the contamination. this study reveals that the application of an integrated phytoremediation system (ips) permits to reach the soil remediation in few years with economically, socially and environmentally sustainable costs.

southern_blotting	to investigate the function and evolutionary origin of the soxe subgroup, we amplified the genomic dna of misgurnus anguillicaudatus using a pair of degenerate primers. using race, we obtained two versions of sox8 (masox8a and masox8b) from m. anguillicaudatus. the overall sequence identity of the deduced amino acids from the two genes was 54.38%, with only one amino acid change in the high-mobility group domain. southern blotting and evidence from the phylogenetic tree provided further proof for the existence of two sox8 genes at the genomic level. this is the first evidence of two distinct sox8 genes in cypriniformes. semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative pcr assays showed the expression trend of the genes was opposite in early embryonic development, and both were expressed ubiquitously in several adult tissues. the similar expression patterns indicated that masox8a and masox8b have possible overlapping functions.
immunology	objectives. to perform a state of the art about immunological features in renal transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs and their mechanisms of action and immunologically high risk transplantations such as abo and hla-incompatible transplantation. material and methods. an exhaustive systematic review of the scientific literature was performed in the medline database and embase using different associations of the following keywords (mesh): ""allogenic response; allograft; immunosuppression; abo incompatible transplantation; donor specific antibodies; hla incompatible; desensitization; kidney transplantation"". publications obtained were selected based on methodology, language, date of publication (last 10 years) and relevance. prospective and retrospective studies, in english or french, review articles; meta analysis and guidelines were selected and analyzed. this search found 4717 articles. after reading titles and abstracts, 141 were included in the text, based on their relevance. results. the considerable step in comprehension and knowledge allogeneic response this last few years allowed a better used of immunosuppression and the discover of news immunosuppressive drugs. in the first part of this article, the allogeneic response will be described. the different classes of immunosuppressive drugs will be presented and the actual management of immunosuppression will be discussed. eventually, the modalities and results of immunologically high-risk transplantations such as abo and hla incompatible transplantations will be reported. conclusions. the knowledge and the control of allogeneic response to allogeneic graft allowed the development of renal transplantation.

genetics	there are common aspects and mechanisms between different types of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (nmosds), and autoimmune encephalitis (ae) as well as paraneoplastic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system. to our present knowledge, depending on the disease, t and b cells as well as antibodies contribute to various aspects of the pathogenesis. possibly the events leading to the breaking of tolerance between the different diseases are of great similarity and so far, only partially understood. beside endogenous factors (genetics, genomics, epigenetics, malignancy) also exogenous factors (vitamin d, sun light exposure, smoking, gut microbiome, viral infections) contribute to susceptibility in such diseases. what differs between these disorders are the target molecules of the immune attack. for t cells, these target molecules are presented on major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules as mhc-bound ligands. b cells have an important role by amplifying the immune response of t cells by capturing antigen with their surface immunoglobulin and presenting it to t cells. antibodies secreted by plasma cells that have differentiated from b cells are highly structure specific and can have important effector functions leading to functional impairment or/and lesion evolvement. in ms, the target molecules are mainly myelin-and neuron/axon-derived proteins; in nmosd, mainly aquaporin-4 expressed on astrocytes; and in ae, various proteins that are expressed by neurons and axons.
molecular_biology	rapid and progressive advances in molecular biology techniques and the advent of next generation sequencing (ngs) have opened new possibilities for analyses also in the identification of entomological matrixes. insects and other arthropods are widespread in nature and those found at a crime scene can provide a useful contribution to forensic investigations. entomological evidence is used by experts to define the postmortem interval (pmi), which is essentially based on morphological recognition of the insect and an estimation of its insect life cycle stage. however, molecular genotyping methods can also provide an important support for forensic entomological investigations when the identification of species or human genetic material is required. this case study concerns a collection of insects found in the house of a woman who died from unknown causes. initially the insects were identified morphologically as belonging to the pediculidae family, and then, human dna was extracted and analyzed from their gastrointestinal tract. the application of the latest generation forensic dna assays, such as the quantifiler (r) trio dna quantification kit and the hid-ion ampliseq (tm) identity panel (applied biosystems (r)), individuated the presence of human dna in the samples and determined the genetic profile.

polymerase_chain_reaction	effective and sensitive methods for the molecular detection of echinococcus multilocularis in faecal samples of final hosts are crucial for the prevention and control of human alveolar echinococcosis and for studies on the epidemiology of the parasite. little is known about the suitability of commercial test kits for isolating dna of e. multilocularis from fox faeces and the performance of standard polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocols in relation to the quality of dna extracted by these kits. we compared four different kits: zr faecal dna miniprep (tm) (zymo research), fastdna (r) spin kit for soil (mp biomedicals), qiaamp (r) fast dna stool mini kit (qiagen) and nucleospin (r) soil kit (macherey-nagel) for the extraction of dna from e. multilocularis eggs present in faeces of foxes. negative faecal samples were spiked with 600, 300, 150, 75, 37, 18, 9, 5 or 2 e. multilocularis eggs, and each egg concentration was tested 10 times with each of the dna extraction kits. each extracted dna sample was amplified using three pcr protocols: i. conventional pcr (cpcr, platinum (r) taq, invitrogen), ii. qpcr with the iq (tm) supermix (bio-rad) and iii. qpcr with the quantitect (r) multiplex -master mix (qiagen). the highest analytical sensitivities for molecular detection of e. multilocularis eggs in spiked fox faeces were observed when combining either the qiaamp (r) fast dna stool mini kit or the zr faecal dna miniprep (tm) kit with the qpcr using the quantitect (r) multiplex -master mix (sensitivities 97% and 94%, respectively). combinations including the remaining test kits (nucleospin (r) soil kit and fastdna (r) spin kit for soil) showed a markedly lower analytical sensitivity for pcr examinations. the results of the present study indicate that it is of utmost importance to select suitable dna extraction kits in combination with robust pcr methods or reagents to achieve acceptable analytical sensitivity in the molecular detection of e. multilocularis eggs in fox faecal samples.

immunology	1. host-parasitoid systems are characterized by a continuous development of new defence strategies in hosts and counter-defence mechanisms in parasitoids. this co-evolutionary arms race makes host-parasitoid systems excellent for understanding trade-offs in host use caused by evolutionary changes in host immune responses and parasitoid virulence. however, knowledge obtained from natural host-parasitoid systems on such trade-offs is still limited. 2. in this study, the aim was to examine trade-offs in parasitoid virulence in asecodes parviclava (hymenoptera: eulophidae) when attacking three closely related beetles: galerucella pusilla, galerucella calmariensis and galerucella tenella (coleoptera: chrysomelidae). a second aim was to examine whether geographic variation in parasitoid infectivity or host immune response could explain differences in parasitism rate between northern and southern sites. 3. more specifically, we wanted to examine whether the capacity to infect host larvae differed depending on the previous host species of the parasitoids and if such differences were connected to differences in the induction of host immune systems. this was achieved by combining controlled parasitism experiments with cytological studies of infected larvae. 4. our results reveal that parasitism success in a. parviclava differs both depending on previous and current host species, with a higher virulence when attacking larvae of the same species as the previous host. virulence was in general high for parasitoids from g. pusilla and low for parasitoids from g. calmariensis. at the same time, g. pusilla larvae had the strongest immune response and g. calmariensis the weakest. these observations were linked to changes in the larval hemocyte composition, showing changes in cell types important for the encapsulation process in individuals infected by more or less virulent parasitoids. 5. these findings suggest ongoing evolution in parasitoid virulence and host immune response, making the system a strong candidate for further studies on host race formation and speciation.
human_metabolism	early diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism is commonly performed through biofluid metabolomics, which detects specific metabolic biomarkers whose concentration is altered due to genomic mutations. the identification of new biomarkers is of major importance to biomedical research and is usually performed through data mining of metabolomic data. after the recent publication of the genome-scale network model of human metabolism, we present a novel computational approach for systematically predicting metabolic biomarkers in stochiometric metabolic models. applying the method to predict biomarkers for disruptions of red-blood cell metabolism demonstrates a marked correlation with altered metabolic concentrations inferred through kinetic model simulations. applying the method to the genome-scale human model reveals a set of 233 metabolites whose concentration is predicted to be either elevated or reduced as a result of 176 possible dysfunctional enzymes. the method 's predictions are shown to significantly correlate with known disease biomarkers and to predict many novel potential biomarkers. using this method to prioritize metabolite measurement experiments to identify new biomarkers can provide an order of a 10-fold increase in biomarker detection performance. molecular systems biology 28 april 2009; doi:10.1038/msb.2009.22
genetics	objective. owing to the rapid increase in clinical need, we aimed to implement and review the performance of a mainstreaming model of germline brca1/2 genetic testing in eligible women with high grade non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer via a genetic counselor embedded in the gynecology oncology clinic. methods. the model implemented involved a specialized referral form, weekly genetics-lead multidisciplinary review of referrals, and pre-and post-test genetic counseling provided by an embedded genetic counselor during chemotherapy chair time. performance and outcomes were retrospectively audited over the following two consecutive one year periods, including survey data on medical specialist comfort with mainstreaming and the model. results. sixty-four women underwent mainstreamed brca1/2 testing over the two year post-implementation period with a rate of detection of brca1/2 pathogenic variants of 17%. the referral rate for eligible women significantly increased to over 90% (p90% of patients receiving results during first line chemotherapy. genetic counseling time decreased from 120 to 54 min. cancer specialists were comfortable with the model. conclusions. the mainstreaming model proved effective, increasing uptake of genetic testing in eligible patients to over 90%; it was efficient for patients, genetic counselors and cancer specialists and acceptable to cancer specialists. it facilitated co -location of genetic and oncology service delivery but separation of clinical responsibility for genetic testing to a specialist genetics service, ensuring accurate and robust patient -centred care.

human_metabolism	this study was conducted to determine the secretion rate and composition of lipoproteins secreted by hepg2 cells as influenced by the type of fatty acid present in the incubation medium. cells were preincubated for 24 h with palmitic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic or conjugated linoleic acid (cla), and the lipoproteins secreted during a subsequent incubation period of 24 h were collected for analysis. the secretion rate of apolipoprotein b-100 (apob) was significantly greater in hepg2 cells preincubated with elaidic acid compared with those preincubated with palmitic or oleic acid; apob secretion was greater in cells preincubated with cla compared with those preincubated with linoleic acid. the lipid composition of secreted lipoproteins was also influenced by fatty acid treatment, resulting in significantly smaller lipoprotein particles secreted by cells preincubated with elaidic acid and cla compared with those secreted by cells treated with oleic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. our results are relevant to human metabolism for the following reasons: (1) the size of plasma low-density lipoproteins (ldls) is determined, at least in part, by the composition of apob-containing lipoproteins secreted by the liver; (2) small plasma ldl particles are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease; and (3) specific dietary fatty acids can affect the composition and size of plasma ldls, thereby imparting a relative atherogenicity to plasma ldls independent of ldl cholesterol concentration. the present study therefore suggests that elaidic acid and cla promote the hepatic secretion of small apob-containing lipoproteins, which could lead to an increased production of small plasma ldl particles.

polymerase_chain_reaction	long-term peritoneal dialysis (pd) leads to ultrafiltration failure (uff). peritoneal mesothelial cells, which form the innermost monolayer of the peritoneal cavity, have been shown to regulate various responses, including inflammation, in uff. the present study was designed to investigate the effect of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (ppar-gamma) agonist, rosiglitazone, on peritoneal dialysis solution (pds)-induced injuries in rat peritoneal mesothelial cells (rpmcs). rpmcs were cultured for different durations and with different concentrations of pds. the gene expression levels of aquaporin-1 (aqp-1) and zonula occluden-1 (zo-1) were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. the protein levels of aqp-1, zo-1 and ppar-gamma were measured using western blot analysis. interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were detected using elisa. the rpmcs were damaged by stimulation with 4.25% pds for 72 h. the expression levels of aqp-1 and zo-1 were increased, and the secretion of il-6 and il-8 were decreased by rosiglitazone. the use of the ppar-gamma inhibitor, gw-9662, completely prevented the effects of rosiglitazone. these results indicated that pds exposure stimulated an inflammatory response in the rpmcs. the ppar-gamma activator, rosiglitazone, appeared to relieve the injury by inhibiting inflammation, and regulating the expression of aqp-1 and zo-1, however further investigations are required to elucidate the potential underlying mechanism.
cell_biology	objective: the study aims to assess the frequency of cytological abnormalities in adolescents and young women, to establish the optimum age to start screening. methods: a retrospective study of cervical cytology results were obtained from the data center at the santa casa hospital of sao paulo between january 2006 and december 2014, adopting the bethesda nomenclature system. the cytology exams were divided into 3 groups: group 1-adolescents (10-19 years old); group 2-young women (20-24 years old); and group 3-adults, comprising the remaining cytology exams. the frequency of cytological abnormalities in the 3 groups was compared using version 3.4.3 of the epi info software programand the chi-square statistical test (p < .05). results: a total of 177,075 satisfactory cytology exams were included in the study. the cytological abnormalities detected in the adolescent group were predominantly low-grade lesions (97.4%); in the young women group, low-grade lesions represented 89.12%, and in the adult group, 76.33%. a significantly greater proportion of high-grade lesions were noted in the adult group, accounting for approximately 24% of all abnormalities detected; in the young women group, it was approximately 11%, and in the adolescent group, it was 2.6%. conclusions: the natural history of hpv infection shows it is transient in young women, with most cases regressing within 2 years of presentation. our data confirm that screening of adolescents is not recommended because serious cytological abnormalities and cancer are rare in this group.
human_metabolism	human metabolism of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( dehp) is complex and yields mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( mehp) and numerous oxidative metabolites. the oxidative metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (meohp), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mehhp), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mecpp) and mono(2-carboxymethylhexyl) phthalate (mcmhp), have been considered to be better biomarkers for dehp exposure assessment than mehp because urinary levels of these metabolites are generally higher than mehp, and their measurements are not subject to contamination. the urinary levels of the above metabolites, and of three other recently identified dehp oxidative metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (mecprp), mono-2-(1-oxoethylhexyl) phthalate (moehp), and mono(2-ethyl-4-carboxybutyl) phthalate (mecbp), were measured in 129 adults. mecpp, mcmhp and mehhp were present in all the samples analysed. mehp and the other oxidative metabolites were detected less frequently: meohp (99%), mecbp (88%), mecprp (84%), mehp (83%) and moehp (77%). the levels of all dehp metabolites were highly correlated (pb/0.0001) with each other, confirming a common parent. the v and omega-1 oxidative metabolites ( mecpp, mcmhp, mehhp and meohp) comprised 87.1% of all metabolites measured, and thus are most likely the best biomarkers for dehp exposure assessment. the percentage of the unglucuronidated free form excreted in urine was higher for the ester linkage carboxylated dehp metabolites compared with alcoholic and ketonic dehp metabolites. the percentage of the unglucuronidated free form excreted in urine was higher for the dehp metabolites with a carboxylated ester side-chain compared with alcoholic and ketonic metabolites. further, differences were found between the dehp metabolite profile between this adult population and that of six neonates exposed to high doses of dehp through extensive medical treatment. in the neonates, mehp represented 0.6% and mecpp 65.5% of the eight dehp metabolites measured compared to 6.6% ( mehp) and 31.8% ( mecpp) in the adults. whether the observed differences reflect differences in route/duration of the exposure, age and/or health status of the individuals is presently unknown.
molecular_biology	transcriptional enhancers are dna regulatory elements that are bound by transcription factors and act to positively regulate the expression of nearby or distally located target genes. enhancers have many features that have been discovered using genomic analyses. recent studies have shown that active enhancers recruit rna polymerase ii (pol ii) and are transcribed, producing enhancer rnas (ernas). gro-seq, a method for identifying the location and orientation of all actively transcribing rna polymerases across the genome, is a powerful approach for monitoring nascent enhancer transcription. furthermore, the unique pattern of enhancer transcription can be used to identify enhancers in the absence of any information about the underlying transcription factors. here, we describe the computational approaches required to identify and analyze active enhancers using gro-seq data, including data pre-processing, alignment, and transcript calling. in addition, we describe protocols and computational pipelines for mining gro-seq data to identify active enhancers, as well as known transcription factor binding sites that are transcribed. furthermore, we discuss approaches for integrating gro-seq-based enhancer data with other genomic data, including target gene expression and function. finally, we describe molecular biology assays that can be used to confirm and explore further the function of enhancers that have been identified using genomic assays. together, these approaches should allow the user to identify and explore the features and biological functions of new cell type-specific enhancers.
cell_biology	skeletal muscles are composed of myofibers, the biggest cells in the mammalian body and one of the few syncytia. how the complex and evolutionarily conserved structures that compose it are assembled remains under investigation. their size and physiological features often constrain manipulation and imaging applications. the culture of immortalized cell lines is widely used, but it can only replicate the early steps of differentiation. here, we describe a protocol that enables easy genetic manipulation of myofibers originating from primary mouse myoblasts. after one week of differentiation, the myofibers display contractility, aligned sarcomeres and triads, as well as peripheral nuclei. the entire differentiation process can be followed by live imaging or immunofluorescence. this system combines the advantages of the existing ex vivo and in vitro protocols. the possibility of easy and efficient transfection as well as the ease of access to all differentiation stages broadens the potential applications. myofibers can subsequently be used not only to address relevant developmental and cell biology questions, but also to reproduce muscle disease phenotypes for clinical applications.
immunology	it has recently become apparent that it is possible to characterize productively recombined, t-cell receptor (tcr) gene segments in tumor exome files, which presumably include representations of the dna of other cells in the microenvironment. similar characterizations have been done for tcr recombinations in tumor specimen rnaseq files. while exome files have been used to characterize immunoglobulin gene segment recombinations for tumors closely related to b-cells, immunoglobulin recombinations have yet to be characterized for putative microenvironment cells for solid tumors. here we report a novel scripted algorithm that detects productive and unproductive immunoglobulin recombinations in both b-cell related tumor exome files and in solid tumor exome files, with the most important result being the relatively high level b-cell infiltrate in breast cancer. this analysis has the potential of streamlining and dramatically augmenting the knowledge base regarding b-cell infiltrates into solid tumors; and leading to antibody reagents directed against tumor antigens and tissue resident, infectious pathogens.
cell_biology	background: human natural killer (nk) cell activity is regulated by a family of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kirs) that bind human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i. combinations of kir and hla genotypes are associated with disease, including susceptibility to viral infection and disorders of pregnancy. kir2dl1 binds hla-c alleles of group c2 (lys(80)). kir2dl2 and kir2dl3 bind hla-c alleles of group c1 (asn(80)). however, this model cannot explain hla-c allelic effects in disease or the impact of hla-bound peptides. the goal of this study was to determine the extent to which the endogenous hla-c peptide repertoire can influence the specific binding of inhibitory kir to hla-c allotypes. results: the impact of hla-c bound peptide on inhibitory kir binding was investigated taking advantage of the fact that hla-c*05:01 (hla-c group 2,c2) and hla-c*08:02 (hla-c group 1, c1) have identical sequences apart from the key kir specificity determining epitope at residues 77 and 80. endogenous peptides were eluted from hlac*05:01 and used to test the peptide dependence of kir2dl1 and kir2dl2/3 binding to hla-c*05:01 and hla-c*08:02 and subsequent impact on nk cell function. specific binding of kir2dl1 to the c2 allotype occurred with the majority of peptides tested. in contrast, kir2dl2/3 binding to the c1 allotype occurred with only a subset of peptides. cross-reactive binding of kir2dl2/3 with the c2 allotype was restricted to even fewer peptides. unexpectedly, two peptides promoted binding of the c2 allotype-specific kir2dl1 to the c1 allotype. we showed that presentation of endogenous peptides or hiv gag peptides by hla-c can promote kir cross- reactive binding. conclusion: kir2dl2/3 binding to c1 is more peptide selective than that of kir2dl1 binding to c2, providing an explanation for kir2dl3-c1 interactions appearing weaker than kir2dl1-c2. in addition, cross-reactive binding of kir is characterized by even higher peptide selectivity. we demonstrate a hierarchy of functional peptide selectivity of kir-hla-c interactions with relevance to nk cell biology and human disease associations. this selective peptide sequence-driven binding of kir provides a potential mechanism for pathogen as well as self-peptide to modulate nk cell activation through altering levels of inhibition.
genetics	the european winter moth, operophtera brumata, is a non-native pest in the northeastern usa causing defoliation of forest trees and crops such as apples and blueberries. this species is known to hybridize with o. bruceata, the bruce spanworm, a native species across north america, although it is not known if there are hybrid generations beyond f1. to study winter moth population genetics and hybridization with bruce spanworm, we developed two sets of genetic markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and microsatellites, using genomic approaches. both types of markers were validated using samples from the two species and their hybrids. we identified 1216 snps and 24 variable microsatellite loci. from them we developed a subset of 95 species-diagnostic snps and ten microsatellite loci that could be used for hybrid identification. we further validated the ten microsatellite loci by screening field collected samples of both species and putative hybrids. in addition to confirming the presence of f1 hybrids reported in previous studies, we found evidence for multi-generation asymmetric hybridization, as suggested by the occurrence of hybrid backcrosses with the winter month, but not with the bruce spanworm. laboratory crosses between winter moth females and bruce spanworm males resulted in a higher proportion of viable eggs than the reciprocal cross, supporting this pattern. we discuss the possible roles of population demographics, sex chromosome genetic incompatibility, and bacterial symbionts as causes of this asymmetrical hybridization and the utility of the developed markers for future studies.
northern_blotting	in the present study, we have investigated the effect of (i) et-i (endothelin-1) and its precursor, big et-1, on mmp (matrix metal loproteinase)-2 and mmp-9 synthesis and activity in osteosarcoma tissue, and (ii) et-i receptor antagonists on cell invasion. using western blotting, zymography, rt-pcr (reverse transcription-pcr), immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and northern blotting, we have shown that et-i and et-i receptors (eta and etb) were expressed in these cells. additionally, we have demonstrated that et-i markedly induced the synthesis and activity of mmp-2, which was significantly increased when compared with mmp-9. furthermore, inhibition of nf-kappa b (nuclear factor kappa b) activation blocked mmp-2 production and activity, indicating the involvement of nf-kappa b, a ubiquitous transcription factor playing a central role in the differentiation, proliferation and malignant transformation. since et-i acts as an autocrine mediator through gelatinase induction and because inhibition of eta receptor is beneficial for reducing both basal and et-i-induced osteosarcoma cell invasion, targeting this receptor could be an attractive therapeutic alternative for the successful treatment of osteosarcoma.
genetics	systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, which affects multiple organs, including joints, skin, kidneys, heart, hematopoietic system, and nerve system. while the etiopathogenesis of sle still remains unclear, genetic susceptibilities and aberrant epigenetic modifications are believed to be involved. for precision therapy, it is necessary to assess accurately and objectively organ involvements and disease activity, which is difficult by current clinical laboratory tests. biomarkers, which are a biologic, genetic, epigenetic or a chemical characteristic and conveniently detectable, serve as measures of disease diagnosis, activity, prognosis, and manifestation prediction, thereby providing instruction for individualized therapy. in addition, biomarkers differ according to different manifestations, since the disease activity index and treatments vary significantly. for example, unlike other non-renal sle, lupus nephritis requires significant immunosuppressive drugs. over the past decades, the research on biomarkers in lupus has been strengthened and numerous promising biomarkers have been identified at levels of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. in this review, we summarize the conventional and novel biomarkers in the tissue-specific manner, and discuss their roles in specific organ diagnosis, future manifestation prediction, disease activity assessment and their correlation with histology results. by doing so, it aims to shed a light on individualized treatment.

polymerase_chain_reaction	strains of pseudomonas that produce antimicrobial metabolites and control soilborne plant diseases have often been isolated from soils defined as disease-suppressive, i.e., soils, in which specific plant pathogens are present, but plants show no or reduced disease symptoms. moreover, it is assumed that pseudomonads producing antimicrobial compounds such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (dapg) or phenazines (phz) contribute to the specific disease resistance of suppressive soils. however, pseudomonads producing antimicrobial metabolites are also present in soils that are conducive to disease. currently, it is still unknown whether and to which extent the abundance of antimicrobials-producing pseudomonads is related to the general disease resistance of common agricultural soils. moreover, virtually nothing is known about the conditions under which pseudomonads express antimicrobial genes in agricultural field soils. we present here results of the first side-by-side comparison of 10 representative swiss agricultural soils with a cereal-oriented cropping history for (i) the resistance against two soilborne pathogens, (ii) the abundance of pseudomonas bacteria harboring genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antimicrobials dapg, phz, and pyrrolnitrin on roots of wheat, and (iii) the ability to support the expression of these genes on the roots. our study revealed that the level of soil disease resistance strongly depends on the type of pathogen, e.g., soils that are highly resistant to gaeumannomyces tritici often are highly susceptible to pythium ultimum and vice versa. there was no significant correlation between the disease resistance of the soils, the abundance of pseudomonas bacteria carrying dapg, phz, and pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic genes, and the ability of the soils to support the expression of the antimicrobial genes. correlation analyses indicated that certain soil factors such as silt, clay, and some macro-and micronutrients influence both the abundance and the expression of the antimicrobial genes. taken together, the results of this study suggests that pseudomonads producing dapg, phz, or pyrrolnitrin are present and abundant in swiss agricultural soils and that the soils support the expression of the respective biosynthetic genes in these bacteria to various degrees. the precise role that these pseudomonads play in the general disease resistance of the investigated agricultural soils remains elusive.
northern_blotting	intergeneric hybridization is an important strategy to introgress alien genes into common wheat for its improvement. but presence of cross ability barrier mechanism regulated by kr1 gene played a major destructive role for hybridization than other reported genes. in order to know the underlying molecular mechanism and to dissect out this barrier, a new annealing system, acp (anneling control primer) system was used in chromosome 5b (containing kr1 gene) specific recombinant inbred line (ril) population. two differentially expressed fragments for kr1 gene was identified, cloned and sequenced. further the expression was confirmed by northern blotting analysis. sequence analysis of the resulted clones revealed classes of putative genes, including stress responsive and signal transduction.
southern_blotting	mutants of shewanella oneidensis mr-1 that adapted to an electrode-respiring condition were selected from a random transposon-insertion mutant library to obtain active current-generating mutants and identify relevant cellular components. the mutants were selected in the presence of an electrode (poised at +0.2 v vs. an ag/agcl reference electrode) as the sole electron acceptor, and they were isolated on agar plates. transposon-insertion sites in the isolated mutants were identified by inverse pcr coupled to sequence analyses. southern blotting using a transposon probe was also performed to detect mutants that grew abundantly on the electrode. these analyses revealed that in many isolated mutants transposons were inserted in genes relevant to the synthesis of cell-surface structures, including so_3350 (pilus synthesis), so_3171 (polysaccharide synthesis), so_3174 (polysaccharide synthesis), and so_0165 (general secretion pathway). in microbial fuel cells, some of these (the so_3350 and so_4704 mutants) generated higher electrical outputs than wild-type mr-1, while the others generated lower outputs. the results suggest that cell-surface structures have a large influence on microbial current generation.
human_metabolism	objectives: adiponectin is a novel plasma protein produced exclusively in adipocytes. despite early data, its relationship with obesity and diabetes has been recently questioned. since plasma lipids influence diabetes and obesity, of concern is whether any associations between plasma lipids and adiponectin exist. design and methods: the aim of this study was to measure adiponectin levels and to investigate their associations with plasma cholesterol fractions and triglycerides in 73 obese non-diabetic subjects (44 women and 29 men), and 43 obese diabetic subjects (28 women and 15 men), aged 52.7 +/- 11.2 and 53.1 +/- 11 years, respectively, and matched for age, sex and bmi. the who definitions of obesity and diabetes were used. adiponectin was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: no correlations between adiponectin and total and ldl cholesterol levels were shown (for the whole cohort: r=0.0130; p=0.8899, and r=0.0807; p=0.3958, respectively). a positive correlation between hdl cholesterol levels and adiponectin occured predominantly in obese women without diabetes (r=0.4531; p=0.0023), resulting in an overall statistical trend in the whole cohort (r=0.2243; p=0.0164). a negative correlation between serum adiponectin and triglycerides was found (r=-0.3413; p=0.0002). conclusion: adiponectin correlated only with tg and partially with hdl but not with ldl and total cholesterol in the study group of obese diabetic and obese non diabetic subjects. in view of these results we suggest that the role of adiponectin in human metabolism is unclear and merits further investigation.
molecular_biology	high-temperature requirement a (htra; degp) from escherichia coli, an important element of the extracytoplasmic protein quality-control system, is a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of serine proteases. the characteristic feature of this protein is its allosteric mode of activation. the regulatory loops, l3, l2, l1 and ld, play a crucial role in the transmission of the allosteric signal. yet, the role of ld has not been fully elucidated. therefore, we undertook a study to explain the role of the individual ld residues in inducing and maintaining the proteolytic activity of htra. we investigated the influence of amino acid substitutions located within the ld loop on the kinetics of a model substrate cleavage as well as on the dynamics of the oligomeric structure of htra. we found that the mutations that were expected to disturb the loop 's structure and/or interactions with the remaining regulatory loops severely diminished the proteolytic activity of htra. the opposite effect, that is, increased activity, was observed for g174s substitution, which was predicted to strengthen the interactions mediated by ld. htrag174s protein had an equilibrium shifted toward the active enzyme and formed preferentially high-order oligomeric forms.
northern_blotting	the species brassica rapa includes various vegetable crops. production of these vegetable crops is usually impaired by heat stress. some micrornas (mirnas) in arabidopsis have been considered to mediate gene silencing in plant response to abiotic stress. however, it remains unknown whether or what mirnas play a role in heat resistance of b. rapa. to identify genomewide conserved and novel mirnas that are responsive to heat stress in b. rapa, we defined temperature thresholds of non-heading chinese cabbage (b. rapa ssp. chinensis) and constructed small rna libraries from the seedlings that had been exposed to high temperature (46 degrees c) for 1 h. by deep sequencing and data analysis, we selected a series of conserved and novel mirnas that responded to heat stress. in total, chinese cabbage shares at least 35 conserved mirna families with arabidopsis thaliana. among them, five mirna families were responsive to heat stress. northern hybridization and real-time pcr showed that the conserved mirnas bra-mir398a and bra-mir398b were heat-inhibitive and guided heat response of their target gene, braccsd1; and bra-mir156h and bra-mir156g were heat-induced and its putative target bracspl2 was down-regulated. according to the criteria of mirna and mirna* that form a duplex, 21 novel mirnas belonging to 19 mirna families were predicted. of these, four were identified to be heat-responsive by northern blotting and/or expression analysis of the putative targets. the two novel mirnas bra-mir1885b.3 and bra-mir5718 negatively regulated their putative target genes. 5'-rapid amplification of cdna ends pcr indicated that three novel mirnas cleaved the transcripts of their target genes where their precursors may have evolved from. these results broaden our perspective on the important role of mirna in plant responses to heat.
polymerase_chain_reaction	testicular maturation arrest is characterized by interruption of germ cell development and differentiation. genetic factors play important role in the causation of human disease, including male infertility. the objective was to study copy number variations in testicular maturation arrest using single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) microarray technique. conventional cytogenetics, targeted fluorescence insitu hybridization (fish) and sequence-tagged site (sts) polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were used to confirm some of the snp microarray findings. snp microarray on 68 cases of testicular maturation arrest detected copy number variations (cnvs) mostly on sex chromosomes involving pseudoautosomal regions (par) 1, 2 and 3 as well as azoospermic factors (azfs) besides three cases of chromosomal abnormalities (two klinefelter syndromes and one case of dicentric y). the azf deletion was observed in 14 (20.6%) cases and the azfc gain was observed in 6 (8.8%) cases. par 1 and 2 cnvs was observed in 5 (7.3%) cases. par 3 cnvs was detected in 19 cases and 2 controls. the tspy2 gene gain (within par 3 cnvs) was observed in 16 cases and 1 control. cnv containing autosomal genes possibly associated with male infertility in this study was spata31a2-a5 (9p12) in five cases. in this study, snp microarray identified possible underlying aetiology in 55.9% (38/68) cases besides identifying minimal critical region of azfc deletion as 0.51mb (y:24356128-24873665) involving tty5, rbmy2fp, rbmy1f, rbmy1j, tty6 and pry genes. snp microarray seems superior, sensitive, specific as well as cost-effective method and has potential to be the first tier investigations to explore underlying genomic factors of testicular maturation arrest. the present study is an attempt to find out probable genomic factors with idiopathic testicular maturation arrest.
immunology	background: severe bronchiolitis (ie, bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission) is thought to markedly increase asthma risk, with 30%-50% developing asthma by age 5 years. to date, studies of this association are small, and most are from outside the united states. objective: the objective of this study was to investigate the association between severe bronchiolitis and risk of asthma in a us birth cohort. methods: we studied a cohort nested within the massachusetts general hospital obstetric maternal study (moms), a prospective cohort of pregnant women enrolled during 1998-2006. children of mothers enrolled in moms were included in the analysis if they received care within our health system (n = 3653). diagnoses and medications were extracted from the children 's electronic health records; we also examined pregnancy and perinatal risk factors collected for the underlying pregnancy study. results: the birth cohort was 52% male, 49% white, and 105 infants (2.9%) had severe bronchiolitis. overall, 421 children (11.5%) developed asthma by age 5 years. among the children with severe bronchiolitis, 27.6% developed asthma by age 5 years. in multivariable logistic regression adjusting for 12 risk factors, severe bronchiolitis remained a strong risk factor for developing asthma by age 5 years (odds ratio 2.57; 95% confidence interval 1.61-4.09). conclusions: in a large boston birth cohort, the frequency of severe bronchiolitis and childhood asthma was similar to published data. among children with severe bronchiolitis, the risk of developing asthma was lower than prior studies but still high (27.6%). this difference may be due to different study designs, populations, and outcome definitions studied.

immunology	interleukin-9 is a cytokine classically related to type 2 immune responses whose cellular identity has been recently reevaluated to identify a new specialized t helper subset called th9 and an innate source referred as innate lymphoid cell type 2. over the past years, il-9 has been associated with allergic responses, tumor immunology, and autoimmunity; however, in this review, we will specifically focus on the role of il-9 and th9 cells in the context of parasitic infections. we will summarize and discuss all the evidence relating il-9 expression and function in parasitic infections with a particular emphasis in helminth infections, an important health issue in developing countries; we will also provide a general description and classification of parasites, the immune response and cellular compartments activated in this context, and its implications and future directions towards a complete understanding of this interesting new t helper subset and its potential therapeutic use.
molecular_biology	background: contamination is a well-known but often neglected problem in molecular biology. here, we investigated the prevalence of cross-contamination among 446 samples from 116 distinct species of animals, which were processed in the same laboratory and subjected to subcontracted transcriptome sequencing. results: using cytochrome oxidase 1 as a barcode, we identified a minimum of 782 events of between-species contamination, with approximately 80% of our samples being affected. an analysis of laboratory metadata revealed a strong effect of the sequencing center: nearly all the detected events of between-species contamination involved species that were sent the same day to the same company. we introduce new methods to address the amount of within-species, between-individual contamination, and to correct for this problem when calling genotypes from base read counts. conclusions: we report evidence for pervasive within-species contamination in this data set, and show that classical population genomic statistics, such as synonymous diversity, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, inbreeding coefficient fit, and tajima 's d, are sensitive to this problem to various extents. control analyses suggest that our published results are probably robust to the problem of contamination. recommendations on how to prevent or avoid contamination in large-scale population genomics/molecular ecology are provided based on this analysis.
southern_blotting	we report a case of the extremely rare condition epstein-barr virus (ebv)-positive t-cell lymphoproliferative disease (lpd) which occurred after umbilical cord blood transplantation. a 25-year-old japanese man underwent cord blood transplantation from a male human leukocyte antigen 4/6-matched donor due to acute myeloid leukemia with trisomy 8. bone marrow examination on day 30 showed chimerism with at least 90% donor cells and complete hematological response. chronic symptoms of graft-versus host disease appeared only on the skin and were successfully treated with cyclosporine alone. three years later, however, the patient experienced repeated cold-like symptoms and was hospitalized with liver dysfunction. a high fever developed and was followed by significant edema of the right side of the face. the ebv dna copy number in whole peripheral blood was 2x10(4)/ml. liver biopsy showed invasion of ebv-infected cd8-positive t cells. southern blotting analysis of the whole peripheral blood showed that the t-cell receptor c beta 1 rearrangement was positive. on the basis of these results, ebv-positive t-cell lpd was diagnosed and treated with prednisolone, cyclosporine, and etoposide, followed by cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. however, the patient died of cardiac function failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage, all of unidentified cause. most cases of ebv-related lpd after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation consist of ebv-positive b-cell lpd, and, to our knowledge, de novo ebv-positive t-cell lpd subsequent to transplantation has not been previously reported.
enzymology	in enzyme kinetics, the quasi-steady-state assumption (qssa) has been proposed for over 80 years, which plays a very important role in simplifying systems of equations derived from chemical reactions with enzymes. five years ago, we proved that the qssa is always true in the simplest model with the second elementary reaction irreversible, and called them as quasi-steady-state laws. thus, all conclusions based on qssa have a solid foundation in irreversible case. however, the chemical reactions are not always so simple in many life processes. the second elementary reaction should be reversible in general, and the irreversible case is actually only an approximation. so it is more important and interesting to study the reversible case, and it has already attracted enzymologists for a long time. the basic assumption, i.e. qssa in this general case has appeared in 1930. we proved this lasting over 80 years assumption in this paper.
enzymology	we report a microfluidic droplet-based approach enabling the measurement of chemical reactions of individual enzyme molecules and its application to a single-molecule-counting immunoassay. a microfluidic device is used to generate and manipulate <10 fl droplets at rates of up to 1.3 x 10(6) per second, about 2 orders of magnitude faster than has previously been reported. the femtodroplets produced with this device can be used to encapsulate single biomolecular complexes tagged with a reporter enzyme; their small volume enables the fluorescent product of a single enzyme molecule to be detected within 10 min of on-chip incubation. our prototype system is validated by detection of a biomarker for prostate cancer in buffer, down to a concentration of 46 fm. this work demonstrates a highly flexible and sensitive diagnostic platform that exploits extremely high-speed generation of monodisperse femtoliter droplets for the counting of individual analyte molecules.
enzymology	plants utilized for agricultural productions interact with insects, fungi, and bacteria under the field conditions, affecting thereby their productivity. since chitin and its derivatives play important roles in the interactions between these organisms, chitin-related enzymes are effective tools or drug targets for controlling the interactions. thus, the molecular biology, protein chemistry, and enzymology of the chitin-related enzymes have been intensively studied by many investigators. identifications and classifications of the genes encoding chitin synthetases, chitinases, chitosanases, and chitin deacetylases in these organisms were conducted, and their physiological functions were defined by knockdown, knockout, or overexpression of the corresponding genes. recombinant enzyme productions and mutation studies are also being conducted to understand their structure and function. all of these studies have opened the way to efficiently utilize these enzyme tools for enhancing the agricultural productions.
molecular_biology	measuring cell proliferation can be performed by a number of different methods, each with varying levels of sensitivity, reproducibility and compatibility with high-throughput formatting. this protocol describes the use of three different methods for measuring cell proliferation in vitro including conventional hemocytometer counting chamber, a luminescence-based assay that utilizes the change in the metabolic activity of viable cells as a measure of the relative number of cells, and a multi-mode cell imager that measures cell number using a counting algorithm. each method presents its own advantages and disadvantages for the measurement of cell proliferation, including time, cost and high-throughput compatibility. this protocol demonstrates that each method could accurately measure cell proliferation over time, and was sensitive to detect growth at differing cellular densities. additionally, measurement of cell proliferation using a cell imager was able to provide further information such as morphology, confluence and allowed for a continual monitoring of cell proliferation over time. in conclusion, each method is capable of measuring cell proliferation, but the chosen method is user-dependent.
polymerase_chain_reaction	multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and pcr protocols were developed and subsequently evaluated for its effectiveness in detecting simultaneously single and mixed infections in sheep and goats. specific primers for three dna viruses and three rna viruses, including foot and mouth disease virus (fmdv), bluetongue virus (btv), peste des petits ruminants virus (pprv), sheeppox virus (sppv), goatpox virus (gtpv) and orf virus (orfv) were used for testing procedure. a single nucleic acid extraction protocol was adopted for the simultaneous extraction of both rna and dna viruses. the multiplex pcr consisted with two-step procedure which included reverse transcription of rna virus and multiplex pcr of viral cdna and dna. the multiplex pcr assay was shown to be sensitive because it could detect at least 100 pg of viral genomic dna or rna from a mixture of six viruses in a reaction. the assay was also highly specific in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens. thirty seven clinical samples collected from sheep and goats were detected among forty three samples tested by both uniplex and multiplex pcr, showing highly identification. as results of the sensitivity and specificity, the multiplex pcr is a useful approach for clinical diagnosis of mixed infections of dna and rna viruses in sheep and goats with a reaction.

northern_blotting	antimicrobial peptides are important components of the host innate immune responses by exerting broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against pathogenic microbes. the first mollusk big defensin (designated aibd) cdna was cloned from bay scallop argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (est) and rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) techniques. the scallop aibd consisted of 531 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence aataaa and a poly(a) tail, encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids. the high similarity of aibd deduced amino acid sequence with big defensin from tachypleus tridentatus and branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese indicated that aibd should be a member of big defensin family. the expression of aibd in various tissues was measured by using northern blotting analysis. mrna transcripts of aibd could be detected in haemocytes of unchallenged scallops. the temporal expression of aibd in haemolymph after vibrio anguilarum challenge was recorded by quantitative real time pcr. the relative expression level of aibd in haemolymph was up-regulated evenly in the first 8 h, followed by a drastic increase, and increased 131.1-fold at 32 h post-injection. these results indicated that aibd could be induced by bacterial challenge, and it should participate in the immune responses of a. irradians. biological activity assay revealed that recombinant aibd could inhibit the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and also showed strong fungicidal activity towards the expression host. recombinant expression of aibd made it possible to further characterize its functions involved in immune responses, and also provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in aquaculture.

polymerase_chain_reaction	alterations in mitochondrial respiration contribute to the development and progression of cancer via abnormal biogenesis, including generation of reactive oxygen species. ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (uqcrh) consists of the cytochrome bc1 complex serving respiration in mitochondria. in the present study, we analyzed uqcrh abnormalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and its association with clinical outcomes of patients. uqcrh expression in hcc was determined via semiquantitative and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of 96 surgically resected hcc tissues positive for hepatitis b virus surface antigen. uqcrh was frequently overexpressed in hcc tissues (46.8%, based on 2.1-fold cutoff). uqcrh overexpression was observed in hccs with larger tumor size, poorer differentiation, or vascular invasion. kaplan-meier analysis revealed significantly shorter overall (p=0.005) and recurrence-free survival (p=0.027) in patients with tumors overexpressing uqcrh. the prognostic impact of uqcrh was significant in subgroups of patients divided according to the -fetoprotein (afp) level. the patient subgroup with higher afp levels (20ng/ml) exhibited significant differences in 5-year overall (18.5% vs. 67.9%) and recurrence-free survival rates (11.1% vs. 46.4%) between groups with and without uqcrh overexpression. in contrast, no marked survival differences were observed between subgroups with lower afp levels (<20ng/ml). multivariate analysis defined uqcrh as an independent poor prognostic factor. conclusively, our results indicate that uqcrh overexpression is correlated with poor outcomes of hcc patients. furthermore, in patients grouped as high risk based on elevated afp, lack of uqcrh overexpression could be a useful indicator for clinical treatment.
molecular_biology	crispr-cas are self-/nonself-discriminating systems found in prokaryotic cells. they represent a remarkable example of molecular memory that is hereditarily transmitted. their discovery can be considered as one of the first fruits of the systematic exploration of prokaryotic genomes. although this genomic feature was serendipitously discovered in molecular biology studies, it was the availability of multiple complete genomes that shed light about their role as a genetic immune system. here we tell the story of how this discovery originated and was slowly and painstakingly advanced to the point of understating the biological role of what initially was just an odd genomic feature.
human_metabolism	the anthropogenic heat emissions generated by human activities in london are analysed in detail for 20052008 and considered in context of long-term past and future trends (19702025). emissions from buildings, road traffic and human metabolism are finely resolved in space (30 min) and time (200 x 200 m2). software to compute and visualize the results is provided. the annual mean anthropogenic heat flux for greater london is 10.9 w m-2 for 20052008, with the highest peaks in the central activities zone (caz) associated with extensive service industry activities. towards the outskirts of the city, emissions from the domestic sector and road traffic dominate. anthropogenic heat is mostly emitted as sensible heat, with a latent heat fraction of 7.3% and a heat-to-wastewater fraction of 12%; the implications related to the use of evaporative cooling towers are briefly addressed. projections indicate a further increase of heat emissions within the caz in the next two decades related to further intensification of activities within this area. copyright (c) 2011 royal meteorological society
cell_biology	backgroundmass cytometry measures 36 or more markers per cell and is an appealing platform for comprehensive phenotyping of cells in human tissue and tumor biopsies. while tissue disaggregation and fluorescence cytometry protocols were pioneered decades ago, it is not known whether established protocols will be effective for mass cytometry and maintain cancer and stromal cell diversity. methodstissue preparation techniques were systematically compared for gliomas and melanomas, patient derived xenografts of small cell lung cancer, and tonsil tissue as a control. enzymes assessed included dnase, hyqtase, tryple, collagenase (col) ii, col iv, col v, and col xi. fluorescence and mass cytometry were used to track cell subset abundance following different enzyme combinations and treatment times. resultsmechanical disaggregation paired with enzymatic dissociation by col ii, col iv, col v, or col xi plus dnase for 1h produced the highest yield of viable cells per gram of tissue. longer dissociation times led to increasing cell death and disproportionate loss of cell subsets. key markers for establishing cell identity included cd45, cd3, cd4, cd8, cd19, cd64, hla-dr, cd11c, cd56, cd44, gfap, s100b, sox2, nestin, vimentin, cytokeratin, and cd31. mass and fluorescence cytometry identified comparable frequencies of cancer cell subsets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in glioma (r=0.97), and tonsil (r=0.98). conclusionsthis investigation establishes standard procedures for preparing viable single cell suspensions that preserve the cellular diversity of human tissue microenvironments.

immunology	subunit vaccines for prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection based on glycoprotein b (gb) and pp65 are in clinical trials, but it is unclear whether simultaneous vaccination with both antigens enhances protection. we undertook evaluation of a novel bivalent vaccine based on nonreplicating lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rlcmv) vectors expressing a cytoplasmic tail-deleted gb [gb(dct)] and full-length pp65 from human cmv in mice. immunization with the gb(dct) vector alone elicited a comparable gb-binding antibody response and a superior neutralizing response to that elicited by adjuvanted subunit gb. immunization with the pp65 vector alone elicited robust t cell responses. comparable immunogenicity of the combined gb(dct) and pp65 vectors with the individual monovalent formulations was demonstrated. to demonstrate proof of principle for a bivalent rlcmv-based hcmv vaccine, the congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (gpcmv) infection model was used to compare rlcmv vectors encoding homologs of pp65 (gp83) and gb(dct), alone and in combination versus freund 's adjuvanted recombinant gb. both vectors elicited significant immune responses, and no loss of gb immunogenicity was noted with the bivalent formulation. combined vaccination with rlcmv-vectored gpcmv gb(dct) and pp65 (gp83) conferred better protection against maternal viremia than subunit or either monovalent rlcmv vaccine. the bivalent vaccine also was significantly more effective in reducing pup mortality than the monovalent vaccines. in summary, bivalent vaccines with rlcmv vectors expressing gb and pp65 elicited potent humoral and cellular responses and conferred protection in the gpcmv model. further clinical trials of lcmv-vectored hcmv vaccines are warranted.
northern_blotting	micrornas (mirnas) are small, endogenous rnas that regulate gene expression in both plants and animals. a large number of mirnas has been identified from various animals and model plant species such as arabidopsis thaliana and rice (oryza sativa); however, characteristics of wheat (triticum aestivum) mirnas are poorly understood. here, computational identification of mirnas from wheat est sequences was preformed by using the in-house program genomicsvm, a prediction model for mirnas. this study resulted in the discovery of 79 mirna candidates. nine out of 22 mirna representatives randomly selected from the 79 candidates were experimentally validated with northern blotting, indicating that prediction accuracy is about 40%. for the 9 validated mirnas, 59 wheat ests were predicted as their putative targets.
human_metabolism	background age-related maculopathy (arm) or degeneration (armd) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. despite several studies on the morphology of armd, the aetiology is unknown and factor(s) contributing to the pathogenesis remain to be characterised. more recent studies have demonstrated that cholesterol esters and lipids are present within bruch 's membrane deposits and drusen, and dietary fat intake is associated with armd. the product of ob gene, leptin, is a recently discovered peptide participating in human metabolism. there is a direct relationship between serum leptin and diet, and lipoprotein metabolism, but the role of leptin in the course of armd has not previously been investigated. purpose this cross-sectional case-control study investigated whether serum leptin level was associated with armd as a new possible risk factor and to assess its relationship with disease severity. methods a total of 32 patients with arm or armd (17 men, 15 women) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects without armd (11 men, nine women) from a similar ethnic background were enrolled in this multicentre study. body mass index (bmi) (weight (kg)/height (m(2))) was calculated for each group. the presence of maculopathy was assessed on the basis of colour fundus photographs using an international classification system. patients were classified as early-arm (n = 16) or late-armd (n = 16) using clinical examination and grading of photographs. serum leptin levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. the mann-whitney u test or chi(2) test was used for statistics as indicated, and p<0.05 was considered to be significant. results the age, sex ratio, and bmi between groups were comparable. patients with maculopathy had significantly (p<0.001) lower leptin levels (mean +/- sd, 6.01 +/- 2.55 ng/ ml) than control subjects (13.21+/- 2.27 ng/ml). in addition, late-armd patients had significantly lower leptin levels (3.81 +/- 0.58 ng/ ml) than early-arm patients (8.21 +/- 1.68 ng/ml, p<0.001) or control subjects (p<0.001). conclusion leptin seems to be a possible newly associated factor in the course of arm and may be involved in the lipid composition of the macular lesions, especially in late-armd.
immunology	background: reactions to rituximab occur frequently, with up to 77% of patients developing a reaction during initial exposure. the safety of rechallenging patients after a reaction is not clear and standard guidelines are lacking. objective: to better understand clinical decision making surrounding rituximab reactions and subsequent rechallenge. methods: we performed a 5-year retrospective review of all rituximab reactions at a large academic outpatient infusion center. patients' demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and management of reactions were reviewed. reaction severity was classified using standard criteria. results: between june 2006 and january 2011, 67 patients (mean age, 58 +/- 13 years, 54% men) with at least 1 rituximab reaction were identified. most reactions occurred during the first exposure to rituximab (63%). most reactions (n = 59 [88%]) were grade 1 or 2. fifty-one patients (n = 51 [88%]) were rechallenged with rituximab on the same day as the initial reaction. most patients with a grade 1 reaction tolerated rechallenge. conversely, all 4 patients with a grade 3 reaction had a reaction during rechallenge. the outcome of same-day rechallenge after an initial grade 2 reaction was varied; most patients (26 of 31 [84%]) tolerated same-day challenge, but 5 patients had a reaction (all grade 1-2 severity). conclusions: consistent with previous data, our observations suggest that patients who experience grade 1 reactions to rituximab can be safely rechallenged the same day. a grade 3 or 4 reaction should prompt referral to an allergy specialist for risk assessment before additional rituximab administration. further research is needed to understand the optimal management of patients with grade 2 reactions.

immunology	objective: phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes is decreased in healthy pregnancy and further decreased in preeclampsia. the cause of the declined function is unknown. decreased phagocyte function can lead to the higher infection rate in healthy pregnancy and may also be responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections and high trophoblast concentration in preeclampsia. the aim of this study is to examine the phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes. methods: monocytes and neutrophil granulocytes were separated from the peripheral circulation of six nonpregnant patients and incubated in plasma samples from six healthy pregnant, six preeclamptic pregnant, and six nonpregnant patients. the cells were marked and evaluated for the phagocytosis index with immunofluorescent microscope after phagocyting the zymosan molecules. results: phagocyte function of neutrophils as well as monocytes from nonpregnant patients were decreased significantly when the cells were incubated in plasma samples from healthy pregnant patients, and further decreased when incubated in plasma samples from preeclamptic pregnant women. conclusion: the decreased phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and that of monocytes in healthy pregnancy and the further decreased phagocyte function in preeclampsia is caused by factor(s) in the maternal circulation.
northern_blotting	organophosphorus ester-induced delayed neurotoxicity (opidn) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia progressing to paralysis with a concomitant central and peripheral distal axonapathy. diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (dfp) produces opidn in the chicken, which results in mild ataxia in 714 days and severe paralysis as the disease progresses with a single dose. white leghorn layer hens were treated with dfp (1.7 mg/kg, sc) after prophylactic treatment with atropine (i mg/kg, sc) in normal saline and eserine ( i mg/kg, so in dimethyl sulfoxide. control groups were treated with vehicle propylene glycol (0.1 ml/kg, sc), atropine in normal saline and eserine in dimethyl sulfoxide. the hens were sacrificed at different time points such as 2, 4, and 8 h, as well as 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days, and the tissues from cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum brainstem and spinal cord were quickly dissected and frozen for protein (western) and mrna (northern) studies. subcellular fractionation, sds-page and immunoblotting of the nuclear and supernatant fractions using standard protocols from spinal cord and cerebrum showed differential expression of protein levels of pka, creb and phosphorylated creb (p-creb). there was an increase in pka level in spinal cord nuclear fraction after 4 h ( 130 +/- 5%) and 8 h (133 +/- 6%), while cerebrum nuclear fraction showed decrease (77 5%) at 4 h and remained at the same level at 8 h. no change was seen in either spinal cord or cerebrum soluble fraction at any time points. there was an increase in creb level in the spinal cord supernatant (133 +/- 3%) after 5 days, while nuclear and supernatant fraction of the cerebrum did not show any alterations at any time point. p-creb was induced in the spinal cord nuclear fraction at i day (150 3%) and 5 days (173 +/- 7%) of treatment, in contrast to the decreased levels p-creb (72 +/- 4%) at 10 days in cerebrum nuclear fraction. supernatant fraction of spinal cord and cerebrum did not show any changes in pcreb at time points studied. similarly another set of animals were treated with dfp and perfused using standard protocols and immunohistochemistry for p-creb in the brain and spinal cord confirmed the overall protein expression pattern identified by western analysis. expression of beta-tubulin subtypes (1, 2, 3, and 4), studied by northern blotting showed complex and differential pattern, while immunohistochemistry of the anti-beta-tubulin for the entire period of opidn developmental stages showed early induction and persistence even in the disintegrating axonal and non-neuronal structures of the cns. these data thus strongly suggest that early cytoskeletal damage at molecular level mediated by pka/p-creb pathways leads to the culmination of gross (microscopically observable) level cytoskeletal changes in various components of central nervous system (cns), consistent with our earlier findings. thus, the differential protein expression of pka, creb. p-creb and beta-tubulin subtypes appear to contribute to the initiation, progression and development of opidn, probably by recruiting other molecular pathways specific to various components of nervous system.

enzymology	bacillus and related genera in the bacillales within the firmicutes harbor a variety of secondary metabolite gene clusters encoding polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases responsible for remarkable diverse number of polyketides (pks) and lipopeptides (lps). these compounds may be utilized for medical and agricultural applications. here, we summarize the knowledge on structural diversity and underlying gene clusters of lps and pks in the bacillales. moreover, we evaluate by using published prediction tools the potential metabolic capacity of these bacteria to produce type i pks or lps. the huge sequence repository of bacterial genomes and metagenomes provides the basis for such genome-mining to reveal the potential for novel structurally diverse secondary metabolites. the otherwise cumbersome task to isolate often unstable pks and deduce their structure can be streamlined. using web based prediction tools, we identified here several novel clusters of pks and lps from genomes deposited in the database. our analysis suggests that a substantial fraction of predicted lps and type i pks are uncharacterized, and their functions remain to be studied. known and predicted lps and pks occurred in the majority of the plant associated genera, predominantly in bacillus and paenibacillus. surprisingly, many genera from other environments contain no or few of such compounds indicating the role of these secondary metabolites in plant-associated niches.

enzymology	lipopolysaccharide (lps), which constitutes the lipid portion of the outer leaflet of gram-negative bacteria, is essential for growth. it is also responsible for the variety of biological effects associated with gram-negative sepsis. recent advances have elucidated the exact chemical structure of this highly complex macromolecule and much of the enzymology involved in its biosynthesis. enzymes involved in lps biogenesis are optimal targets for the development of novel therapeutics since they are sufficiently conserved among diverse, clinically-relevant bacteria and no analogue counterpart is present in humans. during the last thirty years a number of inhibitors of lps biosynthesis have been developed: some of these compounds have antibacterial properties, while others show excellent in vitro activity and are undergoing further investigation. the main focus of this review will be the biology of lps in bacteria summarizing the knowledge about structure and enzymatic catalysis, as well as chemical efforts towards the synthesis of inhibitors of the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of kdo, toward the minimal conserve structure kdo(2)-lipa. in addition, very recent advances in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of lps transport to the cell surface, as a new target to develop novel antibacterials, will be reported. future directions and perspectives will also be outlined.
immunology	introduction: the goal of replantation after dental avulsion is to maintain the tooth in its socket. presence of vital periodontal ligament cells on the root surface of the replanted tooth and the immunologic status of the patient are factors that protect against root resorption. it is known that dental constituents play an active role in root resorption by inducing specific and non-specific immune responses; however, little information exists regarding the influence of the acquired immune response on replantation. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 5-year outcome of replantation in non-atopic and atopic patients. methods: clinical and radiographic examinations were performed in 62 replanted teeth during a 5-year period. the evaluation of atopy was based on the patients' personal and family histories and skin prick test results. the x-2 and the z tests were used to assess the association between atopy and the outcome of the replanted teeth (p < .05). results: there were significant differences between the 1-year and 5-year outcomes of the replanted teeth (p < .05) and atopic and non-atopic patients who had their teeth extracted because of inflammatory or replacement root resorption after 5 years (p < .05). conclusions: being atopic may offer the advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of replacement resorption, whereas being non-atopic may create an advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of inflammatory root resorption during the first 5 years after trauma.
immunology	immunization against human platelet alloantigens (hpas) is associated with a number of clinical complications. the detection and identification of clinically relevant platelet antibodies are important for the diagnosis and management of patients affected with immune-mediated thrombocytopenias. human platelet alloantigen frequencies and the characteristics of antiplatelet antibodies vary widely between ethnic groups. since 2008, the importance of platelet immunology in the field of transfusion medicine has gained greater recognition by clinical laboratories in china. laboratories in china have established and improved methods for platelet antibody detection and hpa genotyping techniques, which are used for the diagnosis of alloimmune platelet disorders in clinic and research environments. research has revealed the frequencies of hpa alleles in different chinese ethnic groups and compared the differences in hpa gene frequencies between the chinese han and other ethnic groups of the world. production of anti-cd36 isoantibodies is an important risk factor for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in the chinese population. advances in research and clinical application of platelet immunology have significantly improved the clinical diagnosis, treatment including transfusion support, and prevention of alloimmune platelet disorders in the chinese population.(c)2017 published by elsevier inc.
cell_biology	a fundamental question in cell biology, under investigation for over six decades, is the structural organization of mitochondrial cristae. long known to harbor electron transport chain proteins, crista membrane integrity is key to establishment of the proton gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation. visualization of cristae morphology by electron microscopy/tomography has provided evidence that cristae are tube-like extensions of the mitochondria] inner membrane (im) that project into the matrix space. reconciling ultrastructural data with the lipid composition of the im provides support for a continuously curved cylindrical bilayer capped by a dome-shaped tip. strain imposed by the degree of curvature is relieved by an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in monolayer leaflets that comprise cristae membranes. the signature mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin (similar to 18% of im phospholipid mass), and phosphatidylethanolamine (34%) segregate to the negatively curved monolayer leaflet facing the crista lumen while the opposing, positively curved, matrix-facing monolayer leaflet contains predominantly phosphatidylcholine. associated with cristae are numerous proteins that function in distinctive ways to establish and/or maintain their lipid repertoire and structural integrity. by combining unique lipid components with a set of protein modulators, crista membranes adopt and maintain their characteristic morphological and functional properties. once established, cristae ultrastructure has a direct impact on oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, fusion/fission as well as diseases of compromised energy metabolism.

polymerase_chain_reaction	radiation treatment remains one of the major modalities in the treatment of lung cancer. although the majority of patients initially respond to treatment with radiation, resistance inevitably develops and leads to treatment failure. therefore, the identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of radiation resistance may facilitate the development of novel approaches for overcoming resistance, and enhance the efficacy of treatment with radiation in lung and other types of cancer. in the present study we established three radiation-resistant sub-cell lines derived from the radiation-sensitive lung cancer cell line hcc827. using a polymerase chain reaction microrna (mirna) array, multiple mirnas were identified to be markedly downregulated in radiation-resistant cells, including mirna (mir)-124, mir-191 and mir-205. it was observed that overexpression of mir-124 sensitized the resistant cells to treatment with radiation and that thioredoxin reductase 1 (txnrd1) is a novel target of mir-124. furthermore, it was demonstrated that knockdown of txnrd1 using small interfering rna increased the basal level of reactive oxygen species and sensitized the cells to radiation treatment. the results of the present study demonstrated that multiple mirnas are downregulated in radiation-resistant lung cancer cells and that downregulation of mir-124 mediates radiation resistance through the targeting of txnrd1 mrna expression. the present study revealed a novel molecular mechanism of mirna-mediated radiation resistance and identified mir-124-regulated txnrd1 as a novel therapeutic target for overcoming radiation resistance in the treatment of lung cancer.

polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: recent studies have demonstrated that netrin-1 plays a vital role in bone metabolism. previous studies have shown that osteoblasts produce netrin-1 which affects osteoclast differentiation. however, the role of netrin-1 in osteoblast differentiation is not well understood. in this study, we explored the roles of netrin-1 in osteoblasts. materials and methods: quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qpcr), rna interference for netrin receptors, the generation of netrin-1 plasmid, transfection of plasmids, and cell proliferation assay were performed. results: during osteoblast differentiation by ascorbic acid, netrin-1 expression was significantly decreased. gene expression related with osteoblast differentiation was down-regulated by netrin-1 treatment. we also found that osteoblast differentiation by bone morphogenetic protein-4 (bmp-4) was inhibited in the presence of recombinant netrin-1. forced expression of both bmp-4 and netrin-1 significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase expression. on the other hand, unc5b, neogenin, and a2b which belong to netrin receptors were expressed by osteoblasts. moreover, alkaline phosphatase expression was significantly decreased by knockdown for the combination of two receptors among these receptors. conclusion: netrin-1 is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation.
northern_blotting	laminin (lm) alpha 4 chain, a constituent of lm-411 and lm-421, is mainly localized to mesenchyme-derived tissues, and is suggested to have a role in formation and function of endothelium, transmigration of inflammatory cells through endothelium, and invasion of certain tumors. in this study, we evaluated the distribution of alpha 4 chain lms in 33 conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinomas (rccs) (31 primary tumors, two metastases), two papillary rccs, and two oncocytomas by immunohistochemistry. in all tumors, immunoreactivity for lm alpha 4 chain was found in vasculature and stroma. basement membranes were detected around tumor cell islets in 34/37 tumors. they showed immunoreactivity for lm alpha 4 chain in 28/34 cases. northern blotting, inhibition of protein secretion with monensin, and immunoprecipitation combined with western blotting showed that caki-2, achn, and caki-1 renal carcinoma cell lines produce alpha 4 chain lms. in cell adhesion assay, recombinant human lm-411 did not promote adhesion of renal carcinoma cells but inhibited adhesion to fibronectin (fn). in cell migration assay, the cells migrated more on lm-411 than on fn. the results suggest that alpha 4 chain lms have a de- adhesive function and could thus play a role in detachment, migration and invasion of renal carcinoma cells in vivo.
enzymology	background: proteins that 'read' the histone code are central elements in epigenetic control and bromodomains, which bind acetyl-lysine motifs, are increasingly recognized as potential mediators of disease states. notably, the first bet bromodomain-based therapies have entered clinical trials and there is a broad interest in dissecting the therapeutic relevance of other bromodomain-containing proteins in human disease. typically, drug development is facilitated and expedited by high-throughput screening, where assays need to be sensitive, robust, cost-effective and scalable. however, for bromodomains, which lack catalytic activity that otherwise can be monitored (using classical enzymology), the development of cell-based, drug-target engagement assays has been challenging. consequently, cell biochemical assays have lagged behind compared to other protein families (e.g., histone deacetylases and methyltransferases). results: here, we present a suite of novel chromatin and histone-binding assays using alphalisa, in situ cell extraction and fluorescence-based, high-content imaging. first, using trim24 as an example, the homogenous, bead-based alphascreen technology was modified from a biochemical peptide-competition assay to measure binding of the trim24 bromodomain to endogenous histone h3 in cells (alphalisa). second, a target agnostic, high-throughput imaging platform was developed to quantify the ability of chemical probes to dissociate endogenous proteins from chromatin/nuclear structures. while overall nuclear morphology is maintained, the procedure extracts soluble, non-chromatin-bound proteins from cells with drug-target displacement visualized by immunofluorescence (if) or microscopy of fluorescent proteins. pharmacological evaluation of these assays cross-validated their utility, sensitivity and robustness. finally, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we dissect domain contribution of trim24, brd4, atad2 and smarca2 to chromatin binding illustrating the versatility/utility of the in situ cell extraction platform. conclusions: in summary, we have developed two novel complementary and cell-based drug-target engagement assays, expanding the repertoire of pharmacodynamic assays for bromodomain tool compound development. these assays have been validated through a successful trim24 bromodomain inhibitor program, where a micromolar lead molecule (iacs-6558) was optimized using cell-based assays to yield the first single-digit nanomolar trim24 inhibitor (iacs-9571). altogether, the assay platforms described herein are poised to accelerate the discovery and development of novel chemical probes to deliver on the promise of epigenetic-based therapies.
genetics	in cms (cytoplasmic male sterility)-based hybrid rye (secale cereale l.) breeding, effective pollen-fertility restoration is an essential prerequisite for achieving maximum grain yield on the one hand and for minimizing ergot (claviceps purpurea) infestation on the other. restorer genes for the cms-inducing 'pampa' cytoplasm derived from landraces collected in iran and argentina are used by breeders for achieving this goal. here, restorer genes from four germplasm sources ('altevogt 14160', 'iran iii', 'trenelense' and 'pico gentario') were analysed by producing three-way cross hybrids between an elite cms single cross and pollinators with and without a given restorer gene. materials were evaluated on large drilled plots for restorer index (ri), grain yield, plant height and other traits in six environments. in experiment 1, a restorer gene from 'altevogt 14160' was used. seven pairs of marker-selected carrier and non-carrier backcross lines served as pollinators. in experiment 2, the pollinators were 17 backcross line pairs from the other three germplasm sources. these lines were grouped as high (ri >67%) and low restorers (ri < 30%), respectively, using testcrosses with a highly diagnostic cms tester. hybrids carrying an exotic restorer gene suffered from a significant grain yield reduction by 4.4% and 9.4% and were 9.3 and 4.8cm taller in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. thousand-kernel weight was reduced, whereas quality traits were only slightly affected. for all traits, significant genetic variance existed among the testcrosses to the presence vs. absence of a given exotic restorer gene. this offers a chance for the breeder to reduce or ultimately overcome the presently observed performance reductions brought about by exotic restorer genes.
immunology	the development of methods for the detection of aflatoxin bi (afb(1)) in foods is a very important practice for ensuring food quality and safety. most tests of afb(1) are still conducted with conventional methods (i.e. antibody-based elisa tests, high performance liquid chromatography hplc); however biosensor methods are being developed to date as screening tools for 'field analysis. compared to immunology/elisa-like tests or chromatography methods, biosensors are able to provide rapid, sensitive, robust and cost effective quantitative methods for on-site testing. in this work we propose a cellular biosensor based on vero cells, membrane engineered with anti-afb1 antibody as the biological recognition element reacting with afbi molecules on gold nanoparticle/screen printed electrodes (spes) (three electrode system). in order to culture the cells on the spes surfaces the working electrodes were coated with poly l-lysine to facilitate cell adhesion. the spes were connected to a potentiostat device through a transducer and chronoamperometric (ca) and cyclic voltammetric (cv) measurements were performed. quantitative results obtained using the cellular biosensor method for afb(1) were compared to those obtained using the hplc method in pistachio samples spiked with afb(1). the method displayed good sensitivity (r(2) = 0.87) and detection limit (0.5 ng/ml).

genetics	as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) begins to replicate within hosts, immune responses are elicited against it. escape mutations in viral epitopes immunogenic peptide parts presented on the surface of infected cells allow hiv to partially evade these responses, and thus rapidly go to fixation. the faster they go to fixation, i.e., the higher their escape rate, the larger the selective pressure exerted by the immune system is assumed to be. this relation underpins the rationale for using escapes to assess the strength of immune responses. however, escape rate estimates are often obtained by employing an aggregation procedure, where several mutations that affect the same epitope are aggregated into a single, composite epitope mutation. the aggregation procedure thus rests upon the assumption that all within-epitope mutations have indistinguishable effects on immune recognition. in this study, we investigate how violation of this assumption affects escape rate estimates. to this end, we extend a previously developed simulation model of hiv that accounts for mutation, selection, and recombination to include different distributions of fitness effects (dfes) and inter mutational genomic distances. we use this discrete time wright fisher based model to simulate early within-host evolution of hiv for dfes and apply standard estimation methods to infer the escape rates. we then compare true with estimated escape rate values. we also compare escape rate values obtained by applying the aggregation procedure with values estimated without use of that procedure. we find that across the dfes analyzed, the aggregation procedure alters the detectability of escape mutations: large-effect mutations are overrepresented while small-effect mutations are concealed. the effect of the aggregation procedure is similar to extracting the largest-effect mutation appearing within an epitope. furthermore, the more pronounced the over-exponential decay of the dfes, the more severely true escape rates are underestimated. we conclude that the aggregation procedure has two main consequences. on the one hand, it leads to a misrepresentation of the dfe of fixed mutations. on the other hand, it conceals within-epitope interactions that may generate irregularities in mutation frequency trajectories that are thus left unexplained.
molecular_biology	in the early 1980 's, the dispute on the existence of a multiplicity of receptors for neurotransmitter was at its height. several subtypes of serotonin (5-ht) receptors were proposed on the basis of radioligand binding assays. in order to provide further support to the existence of these receptors we performed quantitative autoradiographic mapping of the binding of several ligands for the 5-ht1 receptor labeling the subtypes 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b and 5-ht1c, and characterized pharmacologically these different receptors. the results demonstrated differential localization of the subtypes of 5-ht1 receptors indicating that they were expressed by different cell populations, probably neurons, in the brain and further supporting their reality. shortly afterwards, the cloning of the genes coding for these 5-ht receptors, and many others, ended the dispute by demonstrating that they were different proteins. the advent of molecular biology provided new methodologies for the study of the chemical and molecular anatomy of 5-ht receptors in brain, by visualizing cells expressing their mrna by in situ hybridization and showed that the family of mammalian 5-ht receptors has 14 members, a figure much larger than ever suspected at that time. this article is part of a special issue entitled si:50th anniversary issue.

southern_blotting	t alpha i (thymosin alpha i), an immune booster, plays an important role in the maturation, differentiation and function of t-cells. it can also activate the production of cytokines in dendritic cells. tal is one of two thymosin proteins that have potential future clinical applications. in order to express t alpha i protein in plants, we designed and synthesized the t alpha i gene according to the plant codon usage bias and created a novel 4 x t alpha i concatemer (four copies of the t alpha i gene arranged end-to-end in tandem, designated 4 x t alpha i). subsequently, a plant binary expression vector, pg-prd 12-4 x t alpha i, was constructed and introduced into tomato via agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. through selection, 54 regenerated tomato plants resistant to kanamycin were obtained, and four transgenic tomato plants were further confirmed by pcr and southern blotting. rt-pcr (reverse transcription-pcr) analysis showed that the 4 x t alpha i gene was transcribed specifically in tomato [solanum lycopersicum (formerly lycopersicon esculentum)] fruits. elisa analysis showed that the content of the 4 x tot i protein reached a maximum of 6.098 mu g/g fresh weight in mature tomato fruit. western-blot analysis further confirmed the expression of 4 x t alpha i protein in transgenic tomato fruits. the mtt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide] assay showed the 4 x t alpha i protein derived from transgenic tomatoes exhibited bioactivity that can stimulate the proliferation of mice splenic lymphocytes in vitro, and the specific activity of t alpha i protein from the artificial system was higher than that from the synthetic escherichia coli system. this study is the first to report successful expression of bioactive t alpha i in plants, and also it will provide the basis for furl ther development of the plant system to produce t alpha i.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: obesity is genetically heterogeneous and highly heritable, although polymorphisms explain the phenotype in only a small proportion of obese children. we investigated the presence of copy number variations (cnvs) in ""classical"" genes known to be associated with (monogenic) early-onset obesity in children. methods: in 194 obese caucasian children selected for early-onset and severe obesity from our obesity cohort we screened for deletions and/or duplications by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification reaction (mlpa). as we found one mlpa probe to interfere with a polymorphism in sim1 we investigated its association with obesity and other phenotypic traits in our extended cohort of 2305 children. results: in the selected subset of most severely obese children, we did not find cnv with mlpa in pomc, lep, lepr, mc4r, mc3r or mc2r genes. however, one sim1 probe located at exon 9 gave signals suggestive for sim1 insufficiency in 52 patients. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis identified this as a false positive result due to interference with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs3734354/rs3734355. we, therefore, investigated for associations of this polymorphism with obesity and metabolic traits in our extended cohort. we found rs3734354/rs3734355 to be associated with body mass index-standard deviation score (bmi-sds) (p = 0.003), but not with parameters of insulin metabolism, blood pressure or food intake. conclusions: in our modest sample of severely obese children, we were unable to find cnvs in well-established monogenic obesity genes. nevertheless, we found an association of rs3734354 in sim1 with obesity of earlyonset type in children, although not with obesity-related traits.
polymerase_chain_reaction	1. several eel species have undergone extensive declines at both local and global level. the aim of this study was to identify the reasons for the collapse of the european eel (anguilla anguilla) stock in an important area for biodiversity conservation (comacchio lagoon, italy), in order to support the development of eel conservation plans. 2. the records of silver eel catches from comacchio describe the total migratory population and cover the period 1781- 2013. the data are accompanied by information related to habitat loss and other local factors. the role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated, while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture, climateoceanographic changes, habitat loss, pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species a. anguilla, anguilla japonica and anguilla rostrata. 3. the records from comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. however, the current population collapse, which started in the 1970s, could not be explained by local factors. 4. the literature on global factors suggests that the three eel species are under combined threat from various factors. the correlations between european aquaculture production data compared with the comacchio yields and published data from other european eel and glass eel fisheries were found to be highly significant. aquaculture, which depends entirely on wild- caught glass eels, seems to play a key role in the decline of natural stocks. 5. conservative estimates using fao data showed that the current numbers of glass eels needed to support aquaculture production in europe and asia exceeds 2 x 109 specimens. this requirement, largely supplied by a. anguilla glass eels, can explain the decline of eel populations since the glass eel trade has been expanded at an international level. copyright # 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
human_metabolism	development in the rapidly growing urban areas can influence local climate. this micro-climate change may affect the surrounding environment, including schools. however, the study of comfort in teaching and learning environment is very limited, especially for schools. thermal comfort is defined as ""that condition of mind, which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment"" (iso standard 7730 in 1994). thermal comfort is affected by heat, convection heat, radiation and absorption of heat loss (evaporative heat loss) and retained the heat produced by the human metabolism can be removed. this will maintain thermal equilibrium with the environment. any gains or losses outside this range, the heat will cause discomfort. many studies conducted shows thermal comfort can influence occupants in it. several studies have shown lately that the international comfort standards for buildings and the related predictions models report a warmer sensation than the occupants report in the case of naturally ventilated buildings in warm climates. this paper exposes some aspects of the debate in the field of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings located in warm and humid climates. this paper reports on the findings of a preliminary survey conducted to identify and investigate the students' perceptions towards classroom thermal comfort and the schools' surrounding using the teaching and learning classroom thermal comfort inventory (tltci) instrument. the results show that the surveyed students have high level of awareness regarding the climate change and also they find that their teaching and learning classroom thermal comfort is at a comfortable level.

immunology	bacterial biofilms frequently form on fungal surfaces and can be involved in numerous bacterial-fungal interaction processes, such as metabolic cooperation, competition, or predation. the study of biofilms is important in many biological fields, including environmental science, food production, and medicine. however, few studies have focused on such bacterial biofilms, partially due to the difficulty of investigating them. most of the methods for qualitative and quantitative biofilm analyses described in the literature are only suitable for biofilms forming on abiotic surfaces or on homogeneous and thin biotic surfaces, such as a monolayer of epithelial cells. while laser scanning confocal microscopy (lscm) is often used to analyze in situ and in vivo biofilms, this technology becomes very challenging when applied to bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae, due to the thickness and the three dimensions of the hyphal networks. to overcome this shortcoming, we developed a protocol combining microscopy with a method to limit the accumulation of hyphal layers in fungal colonies. using this method, we were able to investigate the development of bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae at multiple scales using both lscm and scanning electron microscopy (sem). this report describes the protocol, including microorganism cultures, bacterial biofilm formation conditions, biofilm staining, and lscm and sem visualizations.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the newly discovered citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type 2 (cilv-c2) is one of the causal virus of citrus leprosis disease complex; which leads to substantial loss of citrus production in the states of meta and casanare of colombia. specific and sensitive detection methods are needed to monitor the dissemination of cilv-c2 in colombia, and to prevent introduction of cilv-c2 to other citrus growing countries. toward this end, putative coat protein gene (cpg) of cilv-c2 was amplified from cilv-c2 infected citrus tissues. the cpg was cloned, expressed and purified a recombinant coat protein of 31 kda which used to generate monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera. four monoclonal antibodies and two polyclonal antisera were selected as being specific following western blotting. the monoclonal antibody mab e5 and polyclonal antiserum pab uf715 were selected testing with an extract of cilv-c2 infected leaves using triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (tas-elisa). in addition, an immunocapture rt-pcr was standardized using mab e5 for specific and sensitive detection of cilv-c2. the standardized tas-elisa and ic-rt-pcr were able to detect cilv-c2 in the extracts of symptomatic citrus leprosis tissues up to the dilutions of 1:160 and 1:2580, respectively. result demonstrated that cilv-c2 is present in citrus orchards in meta and casanare citrus growing areas of colombia. tas-elisa could be used for routine detection of cilv-c2, epidemiological studies, and for border inspections for quarantine purposes. ic-rt-pcr could be valuable for cilv-c2 validation and viral genome analysis.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background: colorectal cancer (crc) is one of the most common cancers. as in other cancer locations, the involvement of human papillomaviruses (hpv) has been suggested but remains highly debated with wide differences among reported prevalence of hpv infection in crcs. aim: to determine the actual prevalence of high risk hpv16 and 18 in a large case-control study. methods: crc specimens were used for analysis of both tumor and distant healthy tissue. as a nonmalignant control group, samples from sigmoid diverticulosis resections were studied. detection of hpv16 and hpv18 dna was performed using a real time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). ten percent of tumor samples were also randomly subjected to a complete hpv genotyping using the inno-lipa technique. results: 467 samples were analyzed: 217 tumor samples from 210 crcs, 210 distant healthy tissue samples, and 40 sigmoid samples. hpv18 dna was never amplified and hpv16 was amplified only three times in tumor tissues with viral loads under or at the limit of quantification. new extraction from the same tumor blocks for these samples revealed no hpv with qpcr and inno-lipa assays. conclusion: with adequate procedures and reliable techniques, no hpv was detected in the largest case-control study so far, bringing more evidence on the absence of involvement of hpv in crcs.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background context: degenerative disc disease (ddd) remains without an effective therapy and presents a costly burden to society. purpose: based upon prior reports concerning the effects of notochordal cell-conditioned medium (nccm) on disc cells, we performed a proof of principle study to determine whether nccm could reduce cytotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in human disc nucleus pulposus (np) cells. study design/ setting: this is an ""in vitro"" fundamental or basic science study. methods: nucleus pulpous cells derived from 15 patients undergoing spinal surgery were treated with interleukin (il)-1 beta and fas ligand or etoposide in the presence of nccm. we determined proor antiapoptotic events using activated caspase assays and determined genomic regulation of apoptosis using polymerase chain reaction arrays validated usingwestern blotting methods. we interrogated cellular apoptotic regulation using jc-1 dye and flow cytometry and performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to evaluate np inflammatory cytokine secretion. results: notochordal cell-conditioned medium inhibits cytotoxic stress-induced caspase-9 and -3/7 activities and maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential in human npcells, thereby suppressing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. gene expression analysis revealed the x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein as a key player responsible for evading etoposide-induced apoptosis in the presence ofnccm, and we verified these data using western blotting. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results revealed distinct differences in il-6 and il-8 secretions by np cells in response to etoposide in the presence of nccm. conclusions: here we demonstrate for the first time that nccm reduces cytotoxic stressinduced apoptosis in human np cells. soluble factors present in nccm could be harnessed for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of ddd.

enzymology	a cell is a highly organized, dynamic, and intricate biological entity orchestrated by a myriad of proteins and their self-assemblies. because a protein 's actions depend on its coordination in both space and time, our curiosity about protein functions has extended from the test tube into the intracellular space of the cell. accordingly, modern technological developments and advances in enzymology have been geared towards analyzing protein functions within intact single cells. we discuss here how fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been employed to identify subcellular locations of proteins, detect reversible protein-protein interactions, and measure protein activity and kinetics in living cells. considering that fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been only recently recognized as a primary technique in enzymology, its potentials and outcomes in studying intracellular protein functions are projected to be immensely useful and enlightening. we anticipate that this review would inspire many investigators to study their proteins of interest beyond the conventional boundary of specific disciplines. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

human_metabolism	ascorbic acid (aa), dopamine (da), uric acid(ua) and tryptophan(trp) are considered as crucial small biomolecules for physiological processes in human metabolism. abnormal levels of these species will lead to the occurrence of some diseases and disorders. in this paper, polyethyleneimine (pei) covalent functionalized graphene(pei-g) was used to modify glassy carbon electrode and applied for the simultaneous and sensitive determination of the four molecules. the pei-g nanocomposite was characterized by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(ftir), ultraviolet-visible (uv-vis), x-ray powder diffraction(xrd) and transmission electron microscopy(tem). the electrochemical behaviors of aa, da, ua and trp on pei-g modified electrode were studied in detail. and the optimal experimental conditions for the simultaneous determination of aa, da, ua and trp were explored. the results showed that the oxidation peaks of the four species could be well separated and the peak to peak separations were 298 mv (aa-da), 130 mv (da-ua) and 350 mv(ua-trp), respectively. the linear response ranges for the simultaneous detection of aa, da, ua and trp were 50-5800 mu mol/l, 30-2570 mu mol/l, 0.05-400 mu mol/l and 6-1000 mu mol/l, with the detection limits of 16.67 mu mol/l, 10 mu mol/l, 0.017 mu mol/l and 2 mu mol/l, respectively. the proposed method provides a promising strategy for the simultaneous detection of these species in practical application.
human_metabolism	obesity is associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance, which is a crucial step in the development of type 2 diabetes. among the mechanisms by which obesity may lead to insulin resistance, lipotoxicity is one of the hypotheses being explored; others include inflammation or the oxidative stress hypotheses. this review focuses on the role of diacylglycerols (dag), a family of lipid metabolites implicated in the pathogenesis of lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. while recent studies report contradictory results in humans with regard to the importance of dag-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, other current literature highlight a potential role for dag as signalling molecules. this review will discuss possible hypotheses explaining these contradictory results and the need to explore further the role of dag in human metabolism.
southern_blotting	the obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite eimeria tenella, one of seven species of eimeria that infect chickens, elicits protective cell-mediated immunity against challenge infection. for this reason, recombinant e tenella parasites could be utilised as an effective vaccine vehicle for expressing foreign antigens and inducing immunity against heterologous intracellular microbes. a stable line of e. tenella expressing foreign genes is a prerequisite, and in this work an in vivo stable transfection system has been developed for this parasite using restriction enzyme-mediated integration (remi). two transgenic populations of e. tenella have been obtained that express yfp-yfp constitutively throughout the parasite life cycle. southern blotting and plasmid rescue analyses show that the introduced exogenous dna was integrated at random into the parasite genome. although the life cycle of the transgenic populations was delayed by at least 12 h and the output of oocysts was reduced 4-fold relative to the parental bj strain of e. tenella, the transgenic parasites were sufficiently immunogenic to protect chickens against challenge with either transgenic or parental parasites. these results are encouraging for the development of transgenic e. tenella as a vaccine vector and for more detailed investigation of the biology of i he genus eimeria.

northern_blotting	the discovery and characterization of micrornas (mirnas) and other families of short rnas has led to a rapid expansion of research directed at elucidating their expression patterns and regulatory functions. here, we describe a convenient, sensitive, and straightforward method to detect and quantitate specific mirna levels in unfractionated total rna samples. the method, based on splinted ligation, does not require specialized equipment or any amplification step, and is significantly faster and more sensitive than northern blotting. we demonstrate that the method can be used to detect various classes of small regulatory rnas from different organisms.
genetics	biliary adenofibroma is a rare primary hepatic neoplasm, recognized in the world health organization classification, although only 14 cases have been reported to date. this series includes extended follow-up from 2 of the early case reports and 4 novel cases. clinical history and histology were reviewed in all 6 cases. tumor dna was analyzed for point mutations by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and copy number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization. the patients included 4 females and 2 males presenting between 46 and 83 years of age, with tumors ranging from 7 to 16 cm in diameter. the tumors had similar morphology, with tubules and cysts lined mainly by bland to mildly atypical cuboidal epithelium embedded in fibrous stroma. multiplex polymerase chain reaction did not identify mutations in 4 tumors tested. three tumors tested by array comparative genomic hybridization showed chromosomal copy number alterations, including 1 with amplifications of ccnd1 and erbb2. three patients underwent resection with no recurrence at 21, 20, and 3 years of follow-up. one patient is alive after 14 months with no resection. two patients with margin-positive resections had local recurrence at 1 and 6 years after surgery. no patient had distant metastasis. the distinct morphology and multiple clonal cytogenetic alterations in biliary adenofibromas indicate that the lesions are neoplastic. amplifications of ccnd1 and erbb2 are not typical of benign neoplasms, and suggest that these tumors may have the ability to behave aggressively. however, the clinical outcomes in these patients suggest the neoplasms are only slowly progressive.
southern_blotting	background: human endogenous retroviruses (hervs) are suspected to play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis (ms). this suspicion has in part been based on increased expression of viral rna or proteins or antibodies targeting retroviral products in ms patients. recently, our group provided genetic evidence for association between the endogenous retrovirus herv-fc1 and ms, suggesting that herv-fc1 plays a role in this multifactorial disease. we have found increased expression of herv-fc1 in ms patients suffering from recent attack, but the underlying mechanism for association is still unknown. findings: evidence from animal models indicates that erv implication in the pathogenesis of diseases can be a result of extra copies of the virus in the germ line. therefore, we investigated the genome of 81 individuals, 74 patients with ms and 7 healthy controls, by means of southern blotting, for presence of extra herv-fc1 copies. the known insertion at the xq21.33 position was readily detectable, but no additional insertions in other genomic contexts could be identified in any studied individuals. this substantiates our previous copy-number pcr findings of a 2:1 ratio of herv-fc1 dna between women and men, as expected from the x-chromosome location; there was no difference between patient and control individuals. conclusions: no additional germ line copies of herv-fc1 could be identified, precluding such copies to underlie the association between this provirus and multiples sclerosis.
southern_blotting	objectives: the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) per-1 initially disseminated among pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in turkey. despite reports from other european countries, such strains have not been detected in greece until now. we describe the first bla(per-1)-positive p. aeruginosa isolates from greece and their genetic environment. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, 287 consecutive non-duplicate p. aeruginosa isolates with reduced susceptibility or resistance to ceftazidime (mic >8 mg/l) were screened for esbl production with a modified boronic acid-based double-disc synergy test. phenotypically esbl-positive isolates were subjected to agar dilution, pfge and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). broad-spectrum bla genes were identified by pcr and sequencing. plasmid analysis and conjugation experiments were performed. the location of the bla(per-1) gene was detected by southern blotting and its genetic environment was characterized using inverse pcr. results: five isolates were phenotypically positive for esbl production, exhibited resistance to cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and meropenem, and carried the bla(per-1) gene. mlst showed that they belonged to sequence type (st) 235, which belongs to the international clonal complex 11. four isolates had the same pfge pattern. southern blotting revealed the chromosomal location of the bla(per-1) gene. analysis of the bla(per-1) flanking regions showed identity to transposon tn1213 downstream and 1406 bp upstream of blaper-1. further upstream, an orfa gene and ispa12 were identified; both were truncated by the insertion of is6100. conclusions: this study confirmed the presence of per-1-producing p. aeruginosa strains in greece. the chromosomal location of bla(per-1), as part of a truncated transposon, suggests clonal expansion rather than horizontal gene transfer.
northern_blotting	frmd7 mutations are associated with x-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus (icn); however, the underlying mechanisms whereby mutations of frmd7 lead to icn remain unclear. in a previous study, the first frmd7 splice variant (frmd7-s) was cloned and identified, and frmd7-s was hypothesized to play a significant role in neuronal differentiation and development. the present study investigated a novel multiple exon-skipping mrna splice variant of frmd7, termed frmd7_sv2, which was detected in nt2 cells using northern blotting. the mrna expression levels of frmd7_sv2 in the developing human fetal brain were examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (pcr), while the expression levels in nt2 cells treated with retinoid acid (ra) or bone morphogenetic protein-2 were investigated using quantitative pcr. the results revealed that the expression of frmd7_sv2 was spatially and temporally restricted in human fetal brain development, and was upregulated upon ra-induced neuronal differentiation of the nt2 cells. these results indicated that as a novel splice variant of frmd7, frmd7_sv2 may play a role in neuronal development.
immunology	aim: this study aimed to evaluate the benefits of arnica montana on post-operative blood loss and seroma production in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy by administering arnica montana 1000 korsakovian dilution (1000 k). materials and methods: from 2012 to 2014, 53 women were randomly assigned to a. montana or placebo and were followed up for 5 days. the main end point was the reduction in blood and serum volumes collected in drainages. secondary end points were duration of drainage, a self-evaluation of pain, and the presence of bruising or hematomas. results: the per-protocol analysis revealed a lower mean volume of blood and serum collected in drainages with a. montana (-94.40 ml; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 22.48-211.28; p = 0.11). a regression model including treatment, volume collected in the drainage on the day of surgery, and patient weight showed a statistically significant difference in favor of a. montana (-106.28 ml; 95% ci: 9.45-203.11; p = 0.03). volumes collected on the day of surgery and the following days were significantly lower with a. montana at days 2 (p = 0.033) and 3 (p = 0.0223). secondary end points have not revealed significant differences. conclusions: a. montana 1000 k could reduce post-operative blood and seroma collection in women undergoing unilateral total mastectomy. larger studies are needed with different dilutions of a. montana to further validate these data.
immunology	alpha-glucans are present in virtually all domains of life, and these glucose chains linked by alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-linked branches form the most important storage carbohydrates in cells. it is likely for this reason that alpha-glucans are not generally considered as bioactive molecules as beta-glucans are. nevertheless, it is known that depending on their source, many alpha-glucans play important roles as modulators of immune response. recent efforts have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms through which alpha-glucans exert their immunostimulant effects; however, the main challenge is the accurate identification of the receptors of immune cells involved in their recognition. here, we review the adjuvant properties reported for some polysaccharides and ultimately focus on alpha-glucans and how their structural characteristics, such as molecular weight, solubility and derivatization, influence their immunostimulatory properties. as a final point, we discuss the potential and associated challenges of using these polysaccharides as adjuvants, particularly in mucosal vaccination.

southern_blotting	a 79-year-old female diagnosed with t cell/histiocyte-rich large b cell lymphoma in complete remission after six cycles of rituximab-combined chemotherapy developed severe anemia, reticulocytopenia, and bone marrow erythroid hypoplasia. she was diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia (prca) accompanied by coombs-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia evidenced by a lack of glycophorin-a-positive cells in the bone marrow, haptoglobin under the detection level, and a high titer of rbc-bound igg. anti-erythropoietin receptor (epor) antibody was detected in the serum, and oligoclonal alpha/beta and gamma/delta t cells were also detected in her peripheral blood by southern blotting analysis. parvovirus b19 dna was not detected by pcr. although the treatment with rituximab had limited efficacy (specifically, only for hemolysis), subsequent cyclosporine therapy led to prompt recovery of erythropoiesis with the disappearance of anti-epor antibody and oligoclonal t cells. this is the first case report of anti-epor antibody-associated prca in a patient with malignant lymphoma treated successfully with cyclosporine.
molecular_biology	cardiac allograft vasculopathy (cav) is a transplant pathology, limiting graft survival after heart transplantation. cav arteries are surrounded by ectopic lymphoid structures (els) containing b cells and plasma cells. the aim of this study was to characterize the antigenic targets of antibodies produced in els. coronary arteries and surrounding epicardial tissue from 56 transplant recipients were collected during autopsy. immunofluorescence was used to identify antibody-producing plasma cells. immunoglobulin levels in tissue lysates were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and analyzed for donor-specific hla antibodies by luminex assay. cytokine and receptor expression levels were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. plasma cells in els were polyclonal and produced igg and/or igm antibodies. in epicardial tissue, igg (p < 0.05) and igm levels were higher in transplant patients with larger els than smaller els. in 4 of 21 (19%) patients with els, donor-specific hla type ii antibodies were detected locally. cytokine and receptor expression (cxcr3, interferon and tgf-) was higher in large els in the epicardial tissue than in other vessel wall layers, suggesting active recruitment and proliferation of t and b lymphocytes. els exhibited active plasma cells producing locally manufactured antibodies that, in some cases, were directed against the donor hla, potentially mediating rejection with major consequences for the graft. ectopic lymphoid structures surrounding coronary arteries with allograft vasculopathy contain high levels of antibodies directed, in part, toward donor hla class ii.
immunology	mounting evidence has shown that naturally occurring cd8+cd122+ t cells are regulatory t cells (tregs) that suppress both autoimmunity and alloimmunity. we have previously shown that cd8+cd122+pd-1+ tregs not only suppress allograft rejection, but also are more potent in suppression than conventional cd4+cd25+ tregs. however, the mechanisms underlying their suppression of alloimmunity are not well understood. in an adoptive t-cell transfer model of mice lacking lymphocytes, we found that suppression of skin allograft rejection by cd8+cd122+pd-1+ tregs was mostly dependent on their expression of fas ligand as either lacking fas ligand or blocking it with antibodies largely abolished their suppression of allograft rejection mediated by transferred t cells. their suppression was also mostly reversed when effector t cells lacked fas receptor. indeed, these fasl+tregs induced t cell apoptosis in vitro in a fas/fasl-dependent manner. however, their suppression of t cell proliferation in vitro was dependent on il-10, but not fasl expression. furthermore, adoptive transfer of cd8+cd122+pd-1+ tregs significantly extended allograft survival even in wild-type mice if tregs lacked fas receptor or if recipients received recombinant il-15, as these two measures synergistically expanded adoptively-transferred tregs in recipients. thus, this study may have important implications for treg therapies in clinical transplantation.
immunology	introduction: the recent approval of adalimumab (trade name humira, abbvie inc.) by the fda for the treatment of noninfectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis marks the first on label' non-corticosteroid drug available to ophthalmologists. immunomodulatory (imt) and biologic agents have long been shown to be effective in inducing remission of chronic uveitis but have remained as orphan drugs due to lack of financial incentive and perceived need. areas covered: here we provide detail into the background and use of adalimumab for uveitic patients. topics include pharmacology, therapeutic indications and usage, dosage, drug safety, physician monitoring, side effects and adverse events. expert opinion: we see the approval of adalimumab for uveitis as an important milestone improving upon the accepted standards of care for patients with this severe, sight threatening disease. we implore medical professionals to consider the use of imt and biologic treatments for patients with recurrent non-infectious uveitis, referring to ocular immunology and uveitis specialists when necessary.
southern_blotting	the feasibility of cyclo-(d-trp-tyr) peptide nanotubes (pnts) as oral gene delivery carriers was investigated in nude mice with eight 40 mu g doses of pcmv-lacz in 2 days at 3 h intervals. the association between dna and pnts, the dnase i stability of pnts-associated dna, and in vitro permeability of dna were estimated. the results showed that the cyclo-(d-trp-tyr) pnts self-associated at concentrations above 0.01 mg/ml. plasmid dna associated with pnts with a binding constant of 3.2 x 10(8)m(-1) calculated by a fluorescence quenching assay. pnts were able to protect dna from dnase i, acid, and bile digestion for 50 min, 60 min, and 180 min, respectively. the in vitro duodenal apparent permeability coefficient of pcmv-lacz calculated from a steady state flux was increased from 49.2 +/- 21.6 x 10(-10) cm/s of naked dna to 395.6 +/- 142.2 x 10(-10) cm/s of pcmv-lacz/pnt formulation. the permeation of pcmv-lacz formulated with pnts was found in an energy-dependent process. furthermore, beta-galatosidase (beta-gal) activity in tissues was quantitatively assessed using chlorophenol red-beta-d-galactopyranoside (cprg) and was significantly increased by 41% in the kidneys at 48 h and by 49, 63, and 46% in the stomach, duodenum, and liver, respectively, at 72 h after the first dose of oral delivery of pcmv-lacz/pnt formulation. the organs with beta-gal activity were confirmed for the presence of pcmv-lacz dna with southern blotting analysis and intracellular tracing the tm-rhodamine-labeled dna and the presence of mrna by reverse transcription-real time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr). another plasmid (pcmv-hrluc) encoding renilla reniformis luciferase was used to confirm the results. an increased hrluc mrna and luciferase in stomach, duodenum, liver, and kidney were detected by rt-qpcr, ex vivo bioluminescence imaging, luciferase activity quantification, and immunostaining, respectively.
cell_biology	with advances in dna sequencing technology, it is increasingly common and tractable to informatically look for genes of interest in the genomic databases of parasitic organisms and infer cellular states. assignment of a putative gene function based on homology to functionally characterized genes in other organisms, though powerful, relies on the implicit assumption of functional homology, i.e. that orthology indicates conserved function. eukaryotes reveal a dazzling array of cellular features and structural organization, suggesting a concomitant diversity in their underlying molecular machinery. significantly, examples of novel functions for pre-existing or new paralogues are not uncommon. do these examples undermine the basic assumption of functional homology, especially in parasitic protists, which are often highly derived? here we examine the extent to which functional homology exists between organisms spanning the eukaryotic lineage. by comparing membrane trafficking proteins between parasitic protists and traditional model organisms, where direct functional evidence is available, we find that function is indeed largely conserved between orthologues, albeit with significant adaptation arising from the unique biological features within each lineage.

genetics	objective: the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is assumed to involve interactions between genetically determined vulnerability factors and significant environmental features. here, we aim to investigate how the personality trait harm avoidance and the experience of childhood adversities contribute to ocd. method: a total of 169 patients with ocd, 157 healthy comparison subjects, and 57 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with ocd participated in the study. harm avoidance was assessed using the temperament and character inventory, and the severity of childhood adversities was measured with the childhood trauma questionnaire. results: both patients with ocd and relatives showed elevated levels of harm avoidance compared to controls. furthermore, patients exhibited significantly higher scores than relatives. this linear pattern was observed throughout all subscales of harm avoidance, and remained stable after controlling for the severity of depressive and obsessivecompulsive symptoms. with regard to childhood adversities, patients with ocd reported higher levels than relatives and controls. conclusion: our results provide further evidence for a diathesis-stress model of ocd. while patients and unaffected relatives share elevated levels of harm avoidance, supporting the role of harm avoidance as an endophenotype of ocd, a heightened severity of childhood adversity was only observed in patients. the assumed biological underpinnings of these findings are discussed.
genetics	the care and prevention of congenital disorders (cds) is an emerging but unprioritised health need in south africa (sa). inadequate empirical data and underreporting conceal the true burden of cds while medical genetic services to confront the problem have regressed. positive epidemiological transition in the country now demands these services are improved to significantly further reduce child mortality. current sector capacity in sa is inadequate and required personnel targets will not be reached quickly enough to meet the growing health need even if relevant posts are designated. historically, genetic-trained nurses played a defined role in primary healthcare (phc) by recognising and diagnosing common cds and counselling patients and their families, while referring complex matters to the limited tertiary medical genetic services available. policy changes to redress past inequalities and other healthcare priorities resulted in genetic services being incorporated into phc, with few genetic nurses retaining their genetic services role. while the medium- to long-term aim for sa would be to develop medical genetic services with appropriate capacity at all levels of healthcare, there is an urgent short-term need to provide basic medical genetic services in phc. central to achieving this is the upgrading and re-implementation of the previously successful medical genetics education programme (mgep). this post-graduate distance learning, education programme is implemented with the congenital disorders course book, a distance education tool promoting independent, home-based learning. together, these tools offer an approach to swiftly build up a nursing work-force with improved knowledge and skills in medical genetics.
cell_biology	aim to assess the rate of matrix gla-protein carboxylation in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and to decipher its association with subclinical atherosclerosis. methods patients with suspected sibo who presented with a low risk for cardiovascular disease and showed no evidence of atherosclerotic plaques were included in the study. a glucose breath test was performed in order to confirm the diagnosis of sibo and vascular assessment was carried out by ultrasound examination. plasma levels of the inactive form of mgp (dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein) were quantified by elisa and vitamin k2 intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. results thirty-nine patients were included in the study. sibo was confirmed in 12/39 (30.8%) patients who also presented with a higher concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein (9.5 mu g/l vs 4.2 mu g/l; p = 0.004). arterial stiffness was elevated in the sibo group (pulse-wave velocity 10.25 m/s vs 7.68 m/s; p = 0.002) and this phenomenon was observed to correlate linearly with the levels of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein (beta = 0.220, r-2 = 0.366, p = 0.03). carotid intima-media thickness and arterial calcifications were not observed to be significantly elevated as compared to controls. conclusion sibo is associated with reduced matrix gla-protein activation as well as arterial stiffening. both these observations are regarded as important indicators of subclinical atherosclerosis. hence, screening for sibo, intestinal decontamination and supplementation with vitamin k2 has the potential to be incorporated into clinical practice as additional preventive measures.
immunology	invertebrate immune priming is a growing field in immunology. this phenomenon refers to the ability of invertebrates to generate a more vigorous immune response to a second encounter with a specific pathogen and can occur within and across generations. although the precise mechanism has not been elucidated, it has been suggested that methylation of dna is a cornerstone for this phenomenon. here, using a novel method of analytical chemistry (a reversed-phase liquid chromatography procedure) and the beetle tenebrio molitor as a model system, we did not find evidence to support this hypothesis taking into account the percentage of methylated cytosine entities in dna (5mdc) within or across generations. however, we found a lower percentage of methylated cytosine entities in rna (5mc) within but not across generations in immune priming experiments with adults against the bacteria micrococcus lysodeikticus and larvae against the fungus metarhizium anisopliae. to our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a role of differential methylation on rna during immune priming within generations.
immunology	the lungs are constantly exposed to the external environment, which in addition to harmless particles, also contains pathogens, allergens, and toxins. in order to maintain tolerance or to induce an immune response, the immune system must appropriately handle inhaled antigens. lung dendritic cells (dcs) are essential in maintaining a delicate balance to initiate immunity when required without causing collateral damage to the lungs due to an exaggerated inflammatory response. while there is a detailed understanding of the phenotype and function of immune cells such as dcs in human blood, the knowledge of these cells in less accessible tissues, such as the lungs, is much more limited, since studies of human lung tissue samples, especially from healthy individuals, are scarce. this work presents a strategy to generate detailed spatial and phenotypic characterization of lung tissue resident dcs in healthy humans that undergo a bronchoscopy for the sampling of endobronchial biopsies. several small biopsies can be collected from each individual and can be subsequently embedded for ultrafine sectioning or enzymatically digested for advanced flow cytometric analysis. the outlined protocols have been optimized to yield maximum information from small tissue samples that, under steady-state conditions, contain only a low frequency of dcs. while the present work focuses on dcs, the methods described can directly be expanded to include other (immune) cells of interest found in mucosal lung tissue. furthermore, the protocols are also directly applicable to samples obtained from patients suffering from pulmonary diseases where bronchoscopy is part of establishing the diagnosis, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), sarcoidosis, or lung cancer.
enzymology	complex carbohydrates are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. as major components of the plant cell wall they constitute both a rich renewable carbon source for biotechnological transformation into fuels, chemicals and materials, and also form an important energy source as part of a healthy human diet. in both contexts, there has been significant, sustained interest in understanding how microbes transform these substrates. classical perspectives of microbial polysaccharide degradation are currently being augmented by recent advances in the discovery of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (lpmos) and polysaccharide utilization loci (puls). fundamental discoveries in carbohydrate enzymology are both advancing biological understanding, as well as informing applications in industrial biomass conversion and modulation of the human gut microbiota to mediate health benefits.
northern_blotting	the dogfish ortholog of aquaporin 4 (aqp4) was amplified from cdna using degenerate pcr followed by cloning and sequencing. the complete coding region was then obtained using 5' and 3' race techniques. alignment of the sequence with aqp4 amino acid sequences from other species showed that dogfish aqp4 has high levels (up to 65.3%) of homology with higher vertebrate sequences but lower levels of homology to agnathan (38.2%) or teleost (57.5%) fish sequences. northern blotting indicated that the dogfish mrna was approximately 3.2 kb and was highly expressed in the rectal gland (a shark fluid secretory organ). semi-quantitative pcr further indicates that aqp4 is ubiquitous, being expressed in all tissues measured but at low levels in certain tissues, where the level in liver >gill >intestine. manipulation of the external environmental salinity of groups of dogfish showed that when fish were acclimated in stages to 120% seawater (sw) or 75% sw, there was no change in aqp4 mrna expression in either rectal gland, kidney, or esophagus/cardiac stomach. whereas quantitative pcr experiments using the rna samples from the same experiment, showed a significant 63.1% lower abundance of gill aqp4 mrna expression in 120% sw-acclimated dogfish. the function of dogfish aqp4 was also determined by measuring the effect of the aqp4 expression in xenopus laevis oocytes. dogfish aqp4 expressing-oocytes, exhibited significantly increased osmotic water permeability (p-f) compared to controls, and this was invariant with ph. permeability was not significantly reduced by treatment of oocytes with mercury chloride, as is also the case with aqp4 in other species. similarly aqp4 expressing-oocytes did not exhibit enhanced urea or glycerol permeability, which is also consistent with the water-selective property of aqp4 in other species.
southern_blotting	to generate transgenic lily plants with no selectable marker and improved tolerance to abiotic stress, two vectors were co-transformed into the lilium oriental hybrid sorbonne by particle bombardment. the pksb vector included the cre/loxp-mediated site-specific cdna excision system under control of the inducible promoter rd29a, and the pbpc-p5cs-f129a vector carried the p5cs gene, which we hypothesized would improve resistance to drought and salt stresses in transgenic lily plantlets. the presence of the two genes was simultaneously detected by pcr and southern blotting in two resistant plantlets. the co-transformation rate was 0.16%. subsequently, inducer expression was tested under varying conditions to optimize the deletion of marker gene. results from molecular detection assays revealed that maintaining bases of bulblet scales at 4 degrees c for 12 h resulted in an increase in the excision rate, reaching 60%. expression of p5cs improved resistance to salt stress in transgenic lily plantlets. these results demonstrated the feasibility of using the cre/loxp-based marker elimination system to generate marker-free transgenic plantlets with improved stress tolerance.
human_metabolism	introduction: sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (sglt2) inhibitors inhibit glucose re-absorption in the proximal renal tubules. these drugs also affect many anthropometric and metabolic parameters with various mechanisms of action.areas covered: we present the available evidence regarding these effects. sglt2 inhibitors can decrease body weight mainly due to a reduction of total fat mass. sglt2 inhibitors can decrease blood pressure levels and serum uric acid levels and may also reduce the degree of diabetes-related albuminuria. these effects may have contributed in the beneficial cardiovascular effects seen in the empa-reg outcome trial. on the other hand, the sglt2 inhibition-induced natriuresis and osmotic diuresis could lead to a decrease of extracellular volume. a small increase in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been observed with sglt2 inhibitors. a small increase in serum phosphate concentration has been reported with these drugs due to increased phosphate reabsorption, which combined with an increase in serum parathormone may adversely affect bone homeostasis. in rare cases, sglt2 inhibitors administration may be followed by euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.expert opinion: sglt2 inhibitors improve many aspects of human metabolism and may be beneficial in diabetic patients if certain precautions are followed by clinicians during the administration of these drugs.
genetics	the intense focus on studying human height has done more than any other genetic analysis to advance our understanding of the heritability of highly complex phenotypes. here, we describe in detail the properties of a previously unexplored trait in drosophila melanogaster that shares many salient properties with human height. the total length of the pupal case varies between 2.8 and 3.9mm among natural variants, and we report that it is among the most heritable traits reported in this species. we have developed a simple semiautomatic phenotyping system with which a single operator can reliably score >5000 individuals in a day. the precision of the automated system is 0.042mm (+/- 0.030sd). all phenotyped individuals are available to be mated in subsequent generations or uniquely archived for future molecular work. we report both broad sense and narrow sense heritability estimates for two biologically distinct data sets. narrow sense heritability (h(2)) ranged from 0.44 to 0.50, and broad sense heritability (h-2) ranged from 0.58 to 0.61. we present results for mapping the trait in 195 recombinant inbred lines, which suggests that there are no loci with >10% effect size in this panel. we propose that pupal size genetics in drosophila could represent a model complex trait amenable to deep genetic dissection using the automated system described.
genetics	cardiac development in vertebrates is a finely tuned process regulated by a set of conserved signaling pathways. perturbations of these processes are often associated with congenital cardiac malformations. platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (pdgfr alpha) is a highly conserved tyrosine kinase receptor, which is essential for development and organogenesis. disruption of pdgfr alpha function in murine models is embryonic lethal due to severe cardiovascular defects, suggesting a role in cardiac development, thus necessitating the use of alternative models to explore its precise function. in this study, we generated a zebrafish pdgfra mutant line by gene trapping, in which the pdgfra protein is truncated and fused with mrfp (pdgfra-mrfp). our results demonstrate that pdgfra mutants have defects in cardiac morphology as a result of abnormal fusion of myocardial precursors. expression analysis of the developing heart at later stages suggested that pdgfra-mrfp is expressed in the endocardium. further examination of the endocardium in pdgfra mutants revealed defective endocardial migration to the midline, where cardiac fusion eventually occurs. together, our data suggests that pdgfra is required for proper medial migration of both endocardial and myocardial precursors, an essential step required for cardiac assembly and development.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose. the purpose of this study was to determine the endogenous regulation pattern of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (timp-2) in the tree shrew sclera during myopia development and investigate the capacity of exogenous timp-2 to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp-2) in vitro and both scleral collagen degradation and myopia development in vivo. methods. timp-2 expression in the sclera during myopia development was assessed using polymerase chain reaction. in vitro timp-2 inhibition of mmp-2 was investigated using a gelatinase activity plate assay and zymography. tree shrews were injected with a collagen precursor before undergoing monocular form deprivation and concurrent daily subconjunctival injections of either timp-2 or vehicle to the form-deprived eye. in vivo ocular biometry changes were monitored, and scleral tissue was collected after 12 days and assayed for collagen degradation. results. the development of myopia was associated with a mean reduction in timp-2 mrna expression after 5 days of form deprivation (p < 0.01). both activation and activity of mmp-2 were inhibited by timp-2 with an ic50 of 10 to 20 and 2 nm, respectively. in vivo exogenous addition of timp-2 significantly reduced myopia development (p < 0.01), due to reduced vitreous chamber elongation (p < 0.01). in vivo timp-2 treatment also significantly inhibited posterior scleral collagen degradation relative to vehicle-treated eyes (p < 0.01), with levels similar to those in control eyes. conclusions. myopia development in mammals is associated with reduced expression of timp-2, which contributes to increased degradative activity in the sclera. it follows that replenishment of this timp-2 significantly reduced the rate of both scleral collagen degradation and myopia development.
polymerase_chain_reaction	nervous necrosis virus (nnv), one of the most prevalent fish pathogens, has caused fatal disease of viral nervous necrosis (vnn) in many marine and freshwater fishes, and resulted in heavy economic losses in aquaculture industry worldwide. however, the morecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of nnv remain elusive. in this study, the expression profiles of microrna (mirna) were investigated in grouper fin (gf-1) cells infected with red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (rgnnv) via deep sequencing technique. the results showed that a total of 220 mirnas were identified by aligning the small rna sequences with the mirna database of zebrafish, and 18 novel mirnas were predicted using mirdeep2 software. compared with the non-infected groups, 51 and 16 differentially expressed mirnas (de-mirnas) were identified in the samples infected with rgnnv at 3 and 24 h, respectively. six demirnas were randomly selected to validate their expressions using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr), the results showed that their expression profiles were consistent with those obtained by deep sequencing. the target genes of the de-mirnas covered a wide range of functions, such as regulation of transcription, oxidation-reduction process, proteolysis, regulation of apoptotic process, and immune response. in addition, the effects of four de-mirnas including mir-1, mir-30b, mir-150, and mir-184 on rgnnv replication were evaluated, and the results showed that over-expression of each of the four mirnas promoted the replication of rgnnv. these data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of rgnnv infection, and will benefit for the development of effective strategies to control rgnnv infection.

polymerase_chain_reaction	backgroundthe incidence of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial (ntm) infection has increased in recent decades because of widespread use of immunosuppressive therapy and better detection methods. the histopathology of cutaneous ntm infection is not pathognomic and the organisms are slow and difficult to culture, making diagnosis challenging. methodswe reviewed the clinical and histopathological features of 13 cases of cutaneous ntm infection, and performed panmycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) on the paraffin blocks. resultsthe immunocompetent patients presented with localized lesions on the extremities, whereas the immunocompromised patients presented with disseminated cutaneous lesions. the histopathology in immunocompetent patients was characterized by pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia, intraepithelial abscesses, transepidermal elimination and dermal granulomatous inflammation accompanied by necrosis and suppuration. the immunocompromised patients showed suppurative inflammation with little granuloma formation and numerous acid-fast bacilli. paraffin block pcr was positive in 4 of 13 cases (31%), whereas culture was positive in 11 of 13 cases (85%). conclusionthe aforementioned histological features should help in diagnosing cutaneous ntm infection when combined with clinical and microbiological correlation. in our study, we did not find paraffin block pcr to be superior to conventional culture in detecting cutaneous ntm infection.
molecular_biology	the significant contribution of microbial corrosion to material degradation in industrial environments has been widely investigated, especially in recent years. however, the process remains largely underestimated and, more than ever today, its control is proved to be difficult. indeed, some recent environmental issues and regulatory led to the reduction of the biocides and anticorrosive treatments, often without an appropriate revision of procedures and without a careful monitoring, thus affecting the effectiveness of the treatments. a multitude of bacterial species lives within the ""corrosive"" biofilm, where organisms interacts in synergistically or competitive way adapting themselves to external agents, even in extreme conditions. combining modern electrochemical techniques and molecular biology it is possible today to monitor the biocorrosion risk and to highlight the complexity of the phenomenon. the relevant involvement of specific bacterial strains, including the sulphate reducers and other bacteria of the sulfur cycle, as well as the role of enzymes of the oxidative metabolism has been confirmed by these techniques. these enzymes can be expressed by a vast number of microorganisms, both aerobic and anaerobic, as function of environmental conditions.
enzymology	phospholipase d (pld) is a useful enzyme for its transphosphatidylation activity, which enables the enzymatic synthesis of various phospholipids (pls). many reports exist on plo-mediated synthesis of natural and tailor-made pls with functional head groups, from easily available lecithin or phosphatidylcholine. early studies on plo-mediated synthesis mainly employed enzymes of plant origin, which were later supplanted by ones from microorganisms, especially actinomycetes. many plds are members of the pld superfamily, having one or two copies of a signature sequence, hxkxxxxd or hkd motif, in the primary structures. plo superfamily members share a common core structure, and thereby, a common catalytic mechanism. the catalysis proceeds via two-step reaction with the formation of phosphatidyl-enzyme intermediate. both of the two catalytic his residues are critical in the reaction course, where one acts as a nucleophile, while the other functions as a general acid/base. pld is being engineered to improve its activity and stability, alter head group specificity and further identify catalytically important residues. since the knowledge on pld enzymology is constantly expanding, this review focuses on recent advances in the field, regarding pld-catalyzed synthesis of bioactive pls, deeper understanding of substrate recognition and binding mechanism, altering substrate specificity, and improving thermostability. we introduced some of our recent results in combination with existing facts to further deepen the story on the nature of this useful enzyme.

enzymology	in this article, we discuss methods of soil enzymatic analysis (pedo-enzymes) used in all specialized laboratories in recent years to determine the potential of various biochemical processes to asess and track soil fertility. initially, general biochemical methods were used for this purpose such as the methods of rogers (1942) for measuring phosphatase activity; kuprevici (1951) for assesing urease activity and the method of hofmann and seegerer (1951) for quantifying sucrase activity; these methods relied on introducing a specific enzyme substrate in the mixture such as: beta-glycerophosphate, urea or sucrose and determining quantitative enzyme products such as phosphate ions, glucose or ammonium ions, respectively. in biochemistry, results of enzyme tests are expressed in international units of enzyme found in the sample of analyzed material. from the agricultural point of view, such measurement of naturally-occuring enzyme substrates are not useful, with pedo-enzymology being more focused on assessing at what level the hydrolase processes unfold, thus providing nutrients for plants. consequently, stefanic. (1971), stefanic et al. (1965; 1998), irimescu and stefanic (1998) and stefanic and gheorghita (2008) recommended new methods of analysis for determining the level of total phosphatasic activity and total amidasic activity as markers of soil fertility status.
cell_biology	lipids are a crucial and diverse class of biomolecules. their structural heterogeneity in plants is staggering, and many aspects of plant life are manifested and mediated by lipids. recent advances in metabolomic and lipidomic technologies and analysis have immensely increased our knowledge of the plant lipidome, its biosynthesis, regulation, adaptation, remodeling, functions, roles, and interactions. here we review the recent literature and trends in lipidomics, and discuss specific issues pertaining to lipidomic research in plants, and how lipidomics has helped elucidate key issues in plant cell biology, immunity, response to stress, evolution, crop enhancement-to name but a few.

immunology	dendritic cells (dcs) recognize foreign structures of different pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, via a variety of pattern recognition receptors (prrs) expressed on their cell surface and thereby activate and regulate immunity. the major function of dcs is the induction of adaptive immunity in the lymph nodes by presenting antigens via mhc i and mhc ii molecules to naive t lymphocytes. therefore, dcs have to migrate from the periphery to the lymph nodes after the recognition of pathogens at the sites of infection. for in vitro experiments or dc vaccination strategies, monocyte-derived dcs are routinely used. these cells show similarities in physiology, morphology, and function to conventional myeloid dendritic cells. they are generated by interleukin 4 (il-4) and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) stimulation of monocytes isolated from healthy donors. here, we demonstrate how monocytes are isolated and stimulated from anti-coagulated human blood after peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) enrichment by density gradient centrifugation. human monocytes are differentiated into immature dcs and are ready for experimental procedures in a non-clinical setting after 5 days of incubation.
molecular_biology	regulation of eukaryotic transcription in vivo occurs at distinct stages. previous research has identified many active or repressive transcription factors (tfs) and core transcription components and studied their functions in vitro and in vivo. nonetheless, how individual tfs act in concert to regulate mrna gene expression in a single cell remains poorly understood. direct observation of tf assembly and disassembly and various biochemical reactions during transcription of a single-copy gene in vivo is the ideal approach to study this problem. research in this area requires developing novel techniques for single-cell transcription imaging and integrating imaging studies into understanding the molecular biology of transcription. in the past decade, advanced cell imaging has enabled unprecedented capabilities to visualize individual tf molecules, to track single transcription sites, and to detect individual mrna in fixed and living cells. these studies have raised several novel insights on transcriptional regulation such as the ""hit-and-run"" model and transcription bursting that could not be obtained by in vitro biochemistry analysis. at this point, the key question is how to achieve deeper understandings or discover novel mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation by imaging transcription in single cells. meanwhile, further technical advancements are likely required for visualizing distinct kinetic steps of transcription on a single-copy gene in vivo. this review article summarizes recent progress in the field and describes the challenges and opportunities ahead.

immunology	a growing body of evidence indicates that lysozyme plays a significant role as an indicator for many diseases and a drug for treatment of infections, ulcers and to study the spatial conformation, enzyme kinetics, and molecular immunology. therefore, highly sensitive determination of lysozyme is necessary and vital in a wide variety of fields. in this work, we put forward a simple but effective strategy for colorimetric visualization of lysozyme based on iodide-responsive cu@au nanoparticles (cu@au nps) as well as the iodide-catalyzed h2o2-tmb (3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine) reaction system. colorimetric detection is applied because of its simplicity, fast response for analysis, high detection limit, low costs and practicality. in our strategy, iodide is applied for the reason that it can induce an obvious color change of the cu@au nanoparticles solution from gray to red, along with the change of morphologies of the cu@au nanoparticles from irregular to spherical. consequently, this phenomenon results in colorimetric signal variation of the iodide-catalytic h2o2-tmb system. what 's more, by quite simple biomolecule modification on the cu@au nanoparticles surface, an all-purpose colorimetric platform is established for the accurate detection of lysozyme, which could lead to the change of cu@au np concentration through molecular recognition. the results show that modified cu-au nps successfully achieved a simple, selective, visualized, and ultrasensitive detection of lysozyme with a linear range from 10(-7) to 10(-3) m and a detection limit of 60 nm.
northern_blotting	an improved method for southern dna and northem rna blotting using the mupide (r)-2 mini-gel system is described. we get sharp and clear bands in southern and northern blotting after only 30 min short gel electrophoresis instead of the several hours large gel electrophoresis of conventional methods. the high electrical voltage with a pulse-like current of the mupid (r)-2 mini-gel system also allows reduction of the amount of formaldehyde, a harmful reagent, from the gel running buffer in rna blotting. this minor modification of dna and rna blotting technique enables us to perform the complete experimental procedure more quickly economically in less space, than conventional southern and northern blotting, as well as using an extremely small amount of formaldehyde in rna blotting.

immunology	major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic t cells. during an adaptive immune response, mhc molecules are regulated by several mechanisms including lipopolysaccharide (lps) and interferon gamma (ifn-g). however, it is unclear whether the serine protease cathepsin g (catg), which is generally secreted by neutrophils at the site of inflammation, might regulate mhc i molecules. we identified catg, and to a higher extend catg and lactoferrin (lf), as an exogenous regulator of cell surface mhc i expression of immune cells and glioblastoma stem cells. in addition, levels of mhc i molecules are reduced on dendritic cells from catg deficient mice compared to their wild type counterparts. furthermore, cell surface catg on immune cells, including t cells, b cells, and nk cells triggers mhc i on thp-1 monocytes suggesting a novel mechanism for catg to facilitate intercellular communication between infiltrating cells and the respective target cell. subsequently, our findings highlight the pivotal role of catg as a checkpoint protease which might force target cells to display their intracellular mhc i: antigen repertoire.
southern_blotting	arthrobacter simplex 156 is a microorganism that is used for steroid drug biotransformation of cortisone acetate (ca) to prednisone acetate (pa). the enzyme 3-ketosteroid-a-(31)-dehydrogenase encoded by the ksdd gene plays an important role in the bioconversion process. to further improve the biotransformation efficiencies of the industrial strain, a genetic manipulation system for a. simplex 156 was developed. additional copies of the ksdd gene under the control of the cat promoter (from pxmj19) were transferred into the strain a. simplex 156 and integrated into the 16s rdna sites, yielding a series of recombinant strains. one of these recombinant strains, designated a. simplex m158, exhibited superior properties for ca biotransformation. at the substrate concentration of 83.6 g/l, the highest pa production of the recombinant strain reached 66.7 g/l, which is approximately 32.9 % higher than that of wild-type strains, and the incubation time for ca to pa bioconversion was reduced by 20 h. southern blotting analysis of the recombinant strain indicated two copies of deregulated ksdd genes were integrated into the 16s rdna sites, which means two of five 16s rrna operons were insertionally disrupted in the recombinant strain. however, the disruption of the two 16s rrna operons did not affect the growth rate of the recombinant strain, which survived and thrived under desired conditions. in addition, the new strain was genetically stable for more than 100 generations without the use of antibiotics for selection. these superior characteristics make the new strain more suitable than the wild-type strain for pa production.
immunology	modern microsurgical techniques have made possible a broad spectrum of novel means for the reconstruction of complex bone and soft tissue defects. these techniques, in combination with developments in transplant immunology, have led to successful hand and facial allotransplantation and achievement of the highest rung in the reconstructive ladder - truly replacing like with like. the utilization of contemporary microsurgical technique in the context of vascularized composite allotransplantation (vca) (1) permits successful technical execution and feasibility of vca, (2) facilitates the study of immunologic tolerance in vca preclinical models, and (3) optimizes functional vca outcomes.
cell_biology	mitochondria have many different functions, the most important one of which is oxidative phosphorylation. they originated from an endosymbiotic event between a bacterium and an archaeal host cell. it was the evolution of a protein import system that marked the boundary between the endosymbiotic ancestor of the mitochondrion and a true organelle that is under the control of the nucleus. in present day mitochondria more than 95% of all proteins are imported from the cytosol in a proces mediated by hetero-oligomeric protein complexes in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. in this review we compare mitochondrial protein import in the best studied model system yeast and the parasitic protozoan trypanosoma brucei. the 2 organisms are phylogenetically only remotely related. despite the fact that mitochondrial protein import has the same function in both species, only very few subunits of their import machineries are conserved. moreover, while yeast has 2 inner membrane protein translocases, one specialized for presequence-containing and one for mitochondrial carrier proteins, t. brucei has a single inner membrane translocase only, that mediates import of both types of substrates. the evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.
northern_blotting	the cdna encoding a protease of perinereis aibuhitensis grube (ppa) was cloned. the deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that the protein had 49% identity to the c-terminal amino acid 169-246 of serine protease of heterodera glycines. northern blotting analysis indicated that the cdna could hybridize with mrna of approximately 260 bases isolated from the marine earthworm. the cdna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pmal-p2 to construct expression vector pmal-ppa. pmal-ppa was introduced into escherichia coli bl21(de3) and overexpression of ppa fused with maltose binding protein was achieved by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin column and ion-exchange chromatography on a diethylaminoethyl-sepharose 4b column. rabbits were immunized with the purified protein and antiserum was prepared. the antibody could react with a protein of approximately 9 kda extracted from the marine earthworm as shown by western blotting analysis. the activity analysis of the recombinant ppa suggested that it was probably a plasminogen activator.
molecular_biology	surface topography of titanium (ti) dental implants strongly influences osseointegration. in the present work, we have analyzed the influence of two ti implant surfaces characterized by similar microtopography but different nanotopography and chemistry on the osteoblastic phenotype of dental pulp stem cells (dpscs). the effect on osteogenic differentiation, extracellular matrix (ecm) and cell adhesion molecules production have been evaluated by means of molecular biology analyses. the morphology of the cells grown onto these surfaces has been analyzed with sem and immunofluorescence (if), and the safety of the surfaces has been tested by using karyotype analysis, ames test and hemocompatibility assay. results showed that starting from 15 days of dpscs culture, a substantial expression of osteoblast specific markers and a strong increase of cell adhesion molecules can be detected. in particular, when dpscs are seeded on the ti implants expression of microrna (mirna)-196a, which is involved in osteoblastic commitment of stem cells, and of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (vcam1), a factor involved in angiogenesis, is strongly enhanced.
molecular_biology	plant oil biosynthesis involves a complex metabolic network with multiple subcellular compartments, parallel pathways, cycles, and pathways that have a dual function to produce essential membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. modern molecular biology techniques provide tools to alter plant oil compositions through bioengineering, however with few exceptions the final composition of triacylglycerol cannot be predicted. one reason for limited success in oilseed bioengineering is the inadequate understanding of how to control the flux of fatty acids through various fatty acid modification, and triacylglycerol assembly pathways of the lipid metabolic network. this review focuses on the mechanisms of acyl flux through the lipid metabolic network, and highlights where uncertainty resides in our understanding of seed oil biosynthesis. this article is part of a special issue entitled: plant lipid biology edited by kent d. chapman and ivo feussner.

southern_blotting	cytogenetic and molecular investigations on the holocentric chromosomes of the aphid macrosiphum euphorbiae (thomas, 1878) have been carried out using silver staining and c-banding (followed by chromomycin a(3) and dapi staining) in order to improve our knowledge about the structure of aphid chromosomes. the c-banding pattern is peculiar since only the two x chromosomes and a single pair of autosomes presented heterochromatic bands. silver staining and fish with the 28s rdna probe localized the rdna genes on one telomere of each x chromosome that were also brightly fluorescent after chromomycin a(3) staining of c-banded chromosomes, whereas all other heterochromatic bands were dapi positive. interestingly, a remarkable nucleolar organizing region (nor) heteromorphism was present making the two x chromosomes easily distinguishable. southern blotting and fish assessed the presence of the (ttagg)(n) repeat at the ends of all the m euphorbiae chromosomes. karyotype analysis showed that all males possessed the x chromosome with the larger amount of rdna suggesting a non-mendelian inheritance of the two x chromosomes.
molecular_biology	in recent years, there have been particular emphases worldwide on the development and optimization of bioprocesses for the utilization of biomass. an essential component of the biomass processing conduit has been the need for robust biocatalysts as high-performance tools for both the depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass and synthesis of new high-value bio-based chemical entities. through functional screening of the metagenome of the hindgut bacterial symbionts of a termite, trinervitermes trinervoides, we discovered open reading frames for 25 cellulases and hemicellulases. these were classified into 14 different glycoside hydrolase (gh) families: eight gh family 5; four gh9, two gh13, and one each in gh2, gh10, gh11, gh26, gh29, gh43, gh44, gh45, gh67, and gh94 families. of these, eight were overexpressed and partially characterized to be shown to be endocellulases (gh5c, gh5e, gh5f, and gh5g), an exocellulase (gh5d), endoxylanases (gh5h and gh11), and an alpha-fucosidase (gh29). the gh11 (xyl1) was of particular interest as it was discovered to be a multimodular beta-1,4-xylanase, consisting of a catalytic domain and two carbohydrate-binding modules (cbms). the cbm functions to selectively bind insoluble xylan and increases the rate of hydrolysis. the primary structure of gh11 showed a classical catalytic dyad of glutamic acid residues that generally forms part of the active site in gh11 enzyme family. this endoxylanase was optimal at ph 6 and 50 degrees c, and generated xylobiose and xylotriose from various xylan sources, including beechwood, birchwood, and wheat arabinoxylan. the catalytic ability of gh11 against natural substrate (e.g., wheat arabinoxylan) renders gh11 as a potential useful biocatalyst in the effective dismantling of complex plant biomass architecture.

genetics	sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (sunds) is a perplexing disorder to both forensic pathologists and clinic physicians. clinical features of sunds survivors suggested that sunds is similar to brugada syndrome (brs). leucine-rich repeat containing 10 (lrrc10) gene was a newly identified gene linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease associated with sudden cardiac death. to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of genetic variants of lrrc10 gene in sunds and brs, the coding regions of lrrc10 were genetically screened in 113 sporadic sunds victims (from january 2005 to december 2015, 30.7 +/- 7.5 years) and ten brs patients (during january 2010 to december 2014, 38.7 +/- 10.3 years) using direct sanger sequencing. afterwards, lrrc10 missense variant carriers were screened for a panel of 80 genes known to be associated with inherited cardiac arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy using target-captured next-generation sequencing. in this study, an in silico-predicted malignant lrrc10 mutation p.e129k was detected in one sunds victim without pathogenic rare variant in a panel of 80 arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy-related genes. we also provided evidence to show that rare variant p.p69l might contribute to the genetic cause for one sunds victim and two brs family members. this is the first report of genetic screening of lrrc10 in chinese sunds victims and brs patients. lrrc10 may be a new susceptible gene for sunds, and lrrc10 variant was initially and genetically linked to brs-associated arrhythmia.
human_metabolism	adipose tissue is functionally composed of brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. the unique thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue results from expression of uncoupling protein 1 in the mitochondrial inner membrane. on the basis of recent findings that adult humans have functionally active brown adipose tissue, it is now recognized as playing a much more important role in human metabolism than was previously thought. more importantly, brown-like adipocytes can be recruited in white adipose tissue upon environmental stimulation and pharmacologic treatment, and this change is associated with increased energy expenditure, contributing to a lean and healthy phenotype. thus, the promotion of brown-like adipocyte development in white adipose tissue offers novel possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat obesity and related metabolic diseases. in this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the recruitment of brown-like adipocyte in white adipose tissue. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
molecular_biology	purpose of review the ebb and flow of genetic influence relative to the understanding of craniofacial and dental disorders has evolved into a tacit acceptance of the current genetic paradigm. this review explores the science behind craniofacial and dental disorders through the lens of recent past and current findings and using tooth agenesis as a model of advances in craniofacial genetics. recent findings contemporary studies of craniofacial biology takes advantage of the technological resources stemming from the genomic and post-genomic eras. emerging data highlights the role of key genes and the epigenetic landscape controlling these genes, in causing dentofacial abnormalities. we also report here a novel glu78fs msx1 mutation in one family segregating an autosomal dominant form of severe tooth agenesis as an illustration of an evolving theme, i.e., different mutations in the same gene can result in a spectrum of dentofacial phenotypic severity. summary the future of clinical therapeutics will benefit from advances in genetics and molecular biology that refine the genotype-phenotype correlation. indeed, the past century suggests a continued convergence of genetic science in the practice of clinical dentistry.
molecular_biology	the brown planthopper (bph), nilaparvata lugens (stal), is one of the major pests of rice throughout asia. extensive use of insecticides for suppressing n. lugens has resulted in the development of insecticide resistance leading to frequent control failures in the field. the aim of the present study was to evaluate resistance in the field populations of n. lugens from major rice growing states of south india to various insecticides. we also determined the activity of detoxifying enzymes (esterases [ests], glutathione s-transferases [gsts], and mixed-function oxidases [mfos]). moderate levels of resistance were detected in the field populations to acephate, thiamethoxam and buprofezin (resistance factors 1.05-20.92 fold, 4.52-14.99 fold, and 1.00-18.09 fold, respectively) as compared with susceptible strain while there were low levels of resistance to imidacloprid (resistance factor 1.23-6.70 fold) and complete sensitivity to etofenoprox (resistance factor 1.05-1.66 fold). est activities in the field populations were 1.06 to 3.09 times higher than the susceptible strain while for gst and mfo the ratios varied from 1.29 to 3.41 and 1.03 to 1.76, respectively. the est activity was found to be correlated to acephate resistance (r = 0.999, p 0.001). the high selection pressure of organophosphate, neonicotinoid, and insect growth regulator (igr) in the field is likely to be contributing for resistance in bph to multiple insecticides, leading to control failures. the results obtained will be beneficial to ipm recommendations for the use of effective insecticides against bph.
human_metabolism	purpose of review the purpose of this review is to highlight recent methodological advances that have helped us to understand the role of intramuscular triglycerides in human health as well as prevention and treatment of disease. in addition to both invasive (muscle biopsy) and noninvasive methods, techniques to assess other lipids within muscle will be reviewed. recent findings in addition to intramuscular triglycerides, other lipids contained within skeletal muscle such as diacylglycerol and ceramides may have an important role in human metabolic disease. both ex-vivo and in-vivo methods to obtain serial measurements of these muscle lipids as a result of experimental perturbation have recently provided unique insight into their respective roles in human metabolism. summary triglyceride accumulation within skeletal muscle has received considerable interest due to its potential role in insulin resistance and fatty acid metabolism of obesity, aging and type 2 diabetes. observations that triglycerides themselves may be used as a fuel source for exercising muscle, and thus may not be detrimental in all circumstances, has in part prompted the development and implementation of analytical methods to quantify the fatty acid composition of muscle triglycerides as well as other lipid species within muscle, e.g. diacylglycerol and ceramides. in addition, noninvasive computed tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging methods have been applied to examine the serial effects of intervention on muscle triglycerides.
southern_blotting	the rainbow trout gastroenteritis (rtge) syndrome is affecting progressively more sites in various european countries causing significant economical losses for the rainbow trout industries. as candidatus arthromitus, a not yet culturable bacteria, is the microorganism responsible for the rtge, molecular methods have been identified as an important tool for the identification of this microorganism. an early, fast and specific detection of c. arthromitus using specific primers and probes, are important goals for the aquaculture sector. in the present study were used: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr), using universal primers annealing the 16s rrna gene, to obtain amplification products representatives of the microbiota present in the intestinal content of trouts, including c. arthromitus when present; a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to produce dna finger printings corresponding to the microbiota present in the intestinal contents of each trout analysed; a specific dna probe designed within the 16s rdna that was used both in dot blot and southern blot techniques to detect the unculturable bacterium c. arthromitus. dot blot applied directly onto dna extracted from the intestinal contents allowed a fast identification of the samples containing c arthromitus. southern blotting allowed the identification of the specific dna band corresponding to c. arthromitus among the various dna bands obtained by the utilisation of the universal primers and run in dgce. molecular methods such as dot blot and southern blot are useful methods for a fast identification of the unculturable c. arthromitus.

northern_blotting	pcd (programmed cell death) is important mechanism for development, homeostasis and disease. to analyze the gene expression pattern in brain cells undergoing pcd in response to serum deprivation, we analyzed the cdna microarray consisting of 2,300 genes and 7 housekeeping genes of cortical cells derived from mouse embryonic brain. cortical cells were induced apoptosis by serum deprivation.for 8 hours. we identified 69 up-regulated genes and 21 down-regulated genes in apoptotic cells. based on the cdna microarray data four genes were selected and analyzed by rt-pcr and northern blotting. to characterize the role of unc-51-like kinase (ulk2) gene in pcd, we investigated cell death effect by ulk2. and we examined expression of several genes that related with pcd. especially gapdh was increased by ulk2. theses findings indicated that ulk2 is involved in apoptosis through p53 pathway.
enzymology	as with natural nucleic acids, pairing between artificial nucleotides can be influenced by tautomerism, with different placements of protons on the heterocyclic nucleobase changing patterns of hydrogen bonding that determine replication fidelity. for example, the major tautomer of isoguanine presents a hydrogen bonding donor donor acceptor pattern complementary to the acceptor acceptor donor pattern of 5-methylisocytosine. however, in its minor tautomer, isoguanine presents a hydrogen bond donor acceptor donor pattern complementary to thymine. calculations, crystallography, and physical organic experiments suggest that this tautomeric ambiguity might be ""fixed"" by replacing the n-7 nitrogen of isoguanine by a ch unit. to test this hypothesis, we prepared the triphosphate of 2'-deoxy-7-deazaiso-guanosine and used it in pcr to estimate an effective tautomeric ratio ""seen"" by taq dna polymerase. with 7-deazaisoguanine, fidelity-per-round was similar to 92%. the analogous pcr with isoguanine gave a lower fidelity-per-round of similar to 86%. these results confirm the hypothesis with polymerases, and deepen our understanding of the role of minor groove hydrogen bonding and proton tautomerism in both natural and expanded genetic ""alphabets"", major targets in synthetic biology.
immunology	the evolutionarily conserved protein kinase p38 mediates innate resistance to environmental stress and microbial infection. four p38 isoforms exist in mammals and may have been co-opted for new roles in adaptive immunity. murine t cells deficient in p38, the ubiquitously expressed p38 isoform, showed no readily apparent cell-autonomous defects while expressing elevated amounts of another isoform, p38. mice with t cells simultaneously lacking p38 and p38 displayed lymphoid atrophy and elevated foxp3(+) regulatory t cell frequencies. double deficiency of p38 and p38 in naive cd4(+) t cells resulted in an attenuation of mapk-activated protein kinase (mk)-dependent mtor signaling after t cell receptor engagement, and enhanced their differentiation into regulatory t cells under appropriate inducing conditions. pharmacological inhibition of the p38-mk-mtor signaling module produced similar effects, revealing potential for therapeutic applications.
molecular_biology	tripterygium wilfordii hook. f. is one of the most valuable medicinal plants because it contains a large variety of active terpenoid compounds, including triptolide, celastrol, and wilforlide. all of the pharmacologically active secondary metabolites are synthesized from the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathway in the isoprenoid biosynthetic system. the key step in this pathway is the isomerization of dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, which is catalyzed by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (ipi). in the present study, a full-length cdna encoding ipi (designate as twipi, genbank accession no. kt279355) was cloned from a suspension of cultured cells from t. wilfordii. the full-length cdna of twipi was 1,564 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 288 amino acids. the bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced twipi sequence contained the tntccshpl and wgeheldy motif. the transcription level of the twipi in the suspension cells increased almost fivefold after treatment with methyl jasmonate as an elicitor. a functional color assay in escherichia coli indicated that twipi could promote the accumulation of lycopene and encoded a functional protein.

cell_biology	neural progenitor cells have a central role in the development and evolution of the vertebrate brain. during early brain development, neural progenitors first expand their numbers through repeated proliferative divisions and then begin to exhibit neurogenic divisions. the transparent and experimentally accessible optic tectum of xenopus laevis is an excellent model system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis, but the precise spatial and temporal relationship between proliferative and neurogenic progenitors has not been explored in this system. here we construct a spatial map of proliferative and neurogenic divisions through lineage tracing of individual progenitors and their progeny. we find a clear spatial separation of proliferative and neurogenic progenitors along the anterior-posterior axis of the optic tectum, with proliferative progenitors located more posteriorly and neurogenic progenitors located more anteriorly. since individual progenitors are repositioned toward more anterior locations as they mature, this spatial separation likely reflects an increasing restriction in the proliferative potential of individual progenitors. we then examined whether the transition from proliferative to neurogenic behavior correlates with cellular properties that have previously been implicated in regulating neurogenesis onset. our data reveal that the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis is associated with a small change in cleavage plane orientation and a more pronounced change in cell cycle kinetics in a manner reminiscent of observations from mammalian systems. our findings highlight the potential to use the optic tectum of xenopus laevis as an accessible system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis.

southern_blotting	we describe a method for synchronization of the cell cycle in the bacterium escherichia coli. treatment of asynchronous cultures with the amino acid analog, dl-serine hydroxamate, induces the stringent response, with concomitant arrest of dna replication at initiation. following release of the stringent response, cells initiate dna replication in synchrony, as determined by flow cytometry for dna content, southern blotting and microscopy. this method has the advantage that it can be used in fully wild-type cells, at different growth rates, and may be applicable to other bacterial species with replication control by the stringent response. we also elaborate other methods useful for establishing cell cycle parameters in bacterial populations. we describe flow cytometric methods for analyzing bacterial populations for dna content using the dna-specific dye picogreen, readily detected by most commercial flow cytometers. we also present an method for incorporation of the nucleotide ethynyl-deoxyuridine, edu, followed by ""click"" labeling with fluorescent dyes, which allows us to measure and visualize newly replicated dna in fixed e. coli k-12 cells under non-denaturing conditions.

southern_blotting	in this study, we cloned and sequenced a 938-base pair polymorphic band, phs27, in the tightly linked random amplified polymorphic dna marker opu10 and converted it into a sequence-characterized amplified region (scar) marker referred to as rhs141, which was specific for the ns genome of psathyrostachys huashanica. a genbank basic local alignment search tool search showed that the sequence of phs27 had no primary sequence homology with known sequences, and southern blotting confirmed this result. this scar marker was used to detect ns genome chromatin in wheat, and it was successfully amplified in p. huashanica itself, a complete set of wheat-p. huashanica disomic addition lines (1ns-7ns), and undetermined homoeologous group addition lines. this scar marker will be a powerful tool for the marker-assisted selection of p. huashanica chromosome(s) in a wheat background, and it should also allow wheat breeders to screen for the excellent traits found in p. huashanica chromatin.
enzymology	protein phosphorylation is one of the major pathways used by eukaryotic cells to propagate signals to the final effectors, regulating multiple aspects of the living cell, such as metabolism, growth, differentiation, adhesion, motility, genome stability and death. in this context, tyrosine kinases (tks) play a central role in signal transduction and their overexpression or disregulated activity has been implicated in tumor onset and malignancy progression. to date, eight tks inhibitors have been approved by fda for the treatment of specific tumors. in spite of their efficacy, insurgence of resistance is a common feature after prolonged administration. the selective pressure by these drugs, in fact, induces clonal expansion of subsets of cancer cells harboring tks mutations, leading to decreased inhibition potency. alternatively, resistance to tk inhibitors can be acquired through the activation of others, often unrelated, tks. for this reason, while stringent target selectivity of tks inhibitors has been always considered a desirable feature in order to limit toxicity, molecules targeting different tks have been recently shown to be promising anti-cancer agents as well. understanding the molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to tk inhibitors, through a combination of enzymatic, structural and cellular studies, is essential in the development of second generation inhibitors active also towards drug resistant tumors.
molecular_biology	the disciplinary structure of research on complex problems related to human activities is supported by the fundaments of the social, life, and hard sciences. in this work, we looked at the development of scientific research in the field of biofuels, as a sustainable source of energy, searching for references regarding its scientific roots and social relevance. scientific communications on biofuels published between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed using a combination of bibliometric methods and text mining techniques. this field of research was characterized as interdisciplinary, with marked social relevance. our bibliometric analysis shows that, in this research subject, 132 different, interacting fields of knowledge overlap, with dominance of chemistry, engineering and agricultural sciences. through the use of text mining techniques, this field was configured into three groups of disciplinary dimensions. the first and most influential group includes the agricultural sciences, social sciences, and environmental sciences. the second group, which gives the field its technological basis, includes chemistry, engineering, and microbiology. the third group includes disciplines with emerging involvement in the field of biofuels: biology and biochemistry, animal and plant sciences, molecular biology and genetics, economics, material sciences, nanosciences and nanotechnology, geosciences, physics, humanities, multidisciplinary sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences. this study suggests that the first group of disciplinary dimensions conforms to the elements that socially validate the progress of research in the field of biofuels. this study also proposes a metric that can be used to measure the interdisciplinarity and the social framing of any other research field.
polymerase_chain_reaction	xp11 translocation renal cell carcinomas (rcc) are characterized by several different translocations involving the tfe3 gene. tumors with different specific gene fusions may have different clinicopathologic manifestations. only 3 rbm10tfe3 rccs have been reported to date. here, we added 4 cases of this rare type of tumors with clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and ultrastructural analyses. most tumors had similar patterns with mixed architectures as follows: acinar, tubular and papillary patterns of epithelioid cells combined with sheets of small cells with ""pseudorosettelike"" architectures, mimicking the typical morphology of t(6;11) rcc. cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear groove, and psammoma bodies were observed in most cases. immunohistochemically, all 4 cases demonstrated moderate to strong immunoreactivity for tfe3, cathepsin k, cd10, ksp-cadherin, e-cadherin, p504s, rcc marker, pax8 and vimentin, whereas negativity for tfeb, hmb45, and ck7. ckpan and melan-a were at least focally expressed. the antibody to ki-67 showed labeling of 3% to 8% (mean, 5%) of tumor cell nuclei. ;of interest, several immunostainings demonstrated expression discrepancy in different histology patterns. rbm10-tfe3 fusion transcripts were identified in all cases by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. by fluorescence in situ hybridization, all 4 cases showed unusual split signals with a distance <1 signal diameter (co-localized or subtle split signals) and usually had false-negative results. we also observed ultrastructures, including melanin pigment, nuclear groove, numerous glycogens, mitochondrion with areas of high electron density material, basement membrane material, and cell junctions with poor development. all 4 patients were alive with no evidence of recurrent disease. our report adds to the known data regarding rbm10-tfe3 rcc.
southern_blotting	the object of the current work was to study low energy ar+ ion beam interactions with silkworm eggs and thus provide further understanding of the mechanisms involved in ion bombardment-induced direct gene transfer into silkworm eggs. in this paper, using low-energy ar+ ion beam bombardment combined with piggybac transposon, we developed a novel method to induce gene transfer in silkworm. using bombardment conditions optimized for egg-incubation (25 key with ion fluences of 800 x 2.6 x 10(15) ions/cm(2) in dry state under vacuum), vector pbac{3 x p3-egfpaf} and helper plasmid pha3pig were successfully transferred into the silkworm eggs. our results obtained from by pcr assay and genomic southern blotting analysis of the g1 generations provide evidence that low-energy ion beam can generate some craters that play a role in acting as pathways of exogenous dna molecules into silkworm eggs.

northern_blotting	lanzhou lily (lilium davidii var. unicolor) with symptoms of severe fasciation or dwarfing was observed in the central region of gansu province, and the disease caused a serious loss in production of the bulb edible crop. in order to determine possible virus infections involved in the described disease, a set of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoelectron microscopy had been performed to test the naturally infected plants. a mixed infection which includes lily symptomless virus (lsv: flexiviridae, carlavirus), cucumber mosaic virus (cmv: bromoviridae, cucumovirus) and lily mottle virus (lmov: potyviridae; potyvirus) has been confirmed by serologic and morphologic evidences. the subsequent thin sectioning observation with a transmission electron microscope on different tissues from infected samples showed that cytopathologic damages happened. total rna extracted from different tissues of infected plants was used in the northern-blotting assays with probes of coat protein gene of each virus, then hybridization data showed a symptomatic infection of related virus. thus, the study gives reliable serologic, morphologic, cytopathologic and molecular evidences for the diagnosis of the systemic infections. this study is hoped to be useful in prevention of certain viral diseases and to increase the quality and production of this crop in the future.
northern_blotting	caffeine biosynthesis involves sequential methylation of the purine ring by the transfer of methyl group from the methyl donor s-adenosyl methionine. genes that code for the individual methyl transferase have a high degree of sequence homology. to achieve decaffeination by genetic engineering of coffee, the effect and efficiency of different post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs) constructs were evaluated. sense, antisense and invert repeat constructs were developed using a 339 bp fragment from the conserved region of the coffee n-methyltransferase genes involved in caffeine biosynthesis. the silencing constructs were mobilized into agrobacterium tumefaciens (eha101). sonication assisted agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the somatic embryos of c. canephora was performed, followed by regeneration of the transformants. molecular analysis and identification of flanking regions confirmed the stable integration of the transgenes in the transformants and their integration in non coding regions of the genome, respectively. effectiveness of the silencing constructs was evaluated by transcript analysis of the targeted genes by rt-pcr and northern blotting. the silencing efficiency was further evaluated by estimation of the purine alkaloid content in the transgenic lines using hplc. the three constructs differed in their silencing efficiencies and specificity. though the constructs were not specific to a single n-methyltransferase, transformants obtained were mainly affected in one of the n-methyltransferases. results show that the use of homologous coding sequence in the ptgs constructs results in a much higher efficiency in silencing the caffeine biosynthetic pathway. further, the lowering of caffeine content should be the preferred over complete decaffeination due to extremely low survival rate of transgenic plants with extremely low levels of caffeine.
northern_blotting	phytoene synthase (psy), as a key regulatory enzyme for carotene biosynthesis, plays an important role in regulating color formation in many species. in the present study, a protocol was developed for the transformation of narcissus tazzeta var chinensis using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba4404 harboring a binary vector pcambia1301 plasmid which contained an antisense phytoene synthase gene, a reporter beta-glucuronidase gene and a selectable marker hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. effects of some factors on efficiency of transformation and regeneration were examined. preculture of the explants for 6 days before inoculation enhanced the transient gus expression. the addition of acetosyringone (as) at 100 mu mol l(-1) stop for inoculation and a period of 3 days co-cultivation yielded efficient transient gus expression. transformants were obtained through selection on ms medium containing 5 mg l(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine(ba), 0.1 mg l(-1) alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (naa) and 40 mg l(-1) hygromycin (.) under bar the transformation frequency was 1.24% based on pcr analysis of gus gene. one or two copies of transgene were demonstrated in different transformations by southern blotting analyses. northern blotting results confirmed that the transcription of the endogenous psy gene in transgenic plants was inhibited or silenced. the method reported here provides new opportunities for improvement of quality traits of narcissus tazzeta via genetic transformation.
enzymology	in recent decades, a number of hypotheses on the autotrophic origin of life have been presented. these proposals invoke the emergence of reaction networks leading from co or co2 to the organic molecules required for life. it has also been suggested that the last (universal) common ancestor (lca or luca) of all extant cell lineages was a chemolitho-autotrophic thermophilic anaerobe. the antiquity of some carbon fixation pathways, the phylogenetic basal distribution of some autotrophic organisms, and the catalytic properties of iron-sulfur minerals have been advanced in support of these ideas. here we critically examine the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of enzymes that are essential for two of the most ancient autotrophic means of metabolism: the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rtca) cycle and the reductive acetyl-coa pathway. phylogenetic analysis of citryl-coa synthetase and of citryl-coa lyase, key enzymatic components of the rtca cycle, and of co dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase, a key enzyme in the reductive acetyl-coa pathway, revealed that all three enzymes have undergone major lateral transfer events and therefore cannot be used as proof of the lca 's metabolic abilities nor as evidence of an autotrophic origin of life.
immunology	rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and multiple inflammatory cytokines are involved in ra pathogenesis. interleukin (il)-18, in particular, has a significant positive correlation with ra. in this study, we investigated the effect of erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (erdr1), which is negatively regulated by il-18, in an animal model of inflammatory arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (cia) in dba/1j mice. treatment of mice with recombinant (r) erdr1 significantly suppressed the severity of arthritis, histologic features of arthritic tissue, and serum levels of anti-collagen autoantibodies (igg, igg1, igg2a and igm) in cia. in addition, il-18 expression was reduced in the affected synovium of rerdr1-treated mice. interestingly, erdr1 treatment suppressed migration in contrast to the pro-migratory effect of il-18, indicating the therapeutic effects of erdr1 on cia through inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration. in addition, erdr1 inhibited activation of erk1/2, a key signaling pathway in migration of various cell types. taken together, these data show that rerdr1 exerts therapeutic effects on ra by inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration, suggesting that rerdr1 treatment might be an effective therapeutic approach for ra.
polymerase_chain_reaction	canine brucellosis caused by brucella canis is a neglected zoonosis worldwide and is a leading cause of reproductive failure in dogs, often causing substantial economic losses in breeding kennels. this study aimed to investigate the occurrence of b.canis infection in dogs of commercial breeding kennels located in sao paulo state, brazil. a total of 753 dogs (183 males and 570 females) from 38 commercial kennels were clinically examined, and blood samples were collected for brucellosis diagnosis through blood culture. the association between clinical manifestations suggestive of brucellosis and positive results through blood culture was determined. of the 753 dogs tested, 166 (22.0%) had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis and 158 (20.9%) had positive blood cultures. seventy-two dogs had positive blood culture and had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis, while 91 dogs showed at least one clinical manifestation suggestive of brucellosis although blood culture was negative. of the 38 kennels, 16 (42.1%) had at least one positive dog. the prevalence of infection in each kennel varied from 3.8% to 62.6%. abortion/stillbirth, failure to conceive and enlargement of lymph nodes were significantly associated with brucellosis in female. no association of clinical signs and positive results in blood culture was observed in males. none of the kennels has been carrying out programmes to control brucellosis, and the sale of infected dogs was considered a common practice yielding risks to the public health, in view of the zoonotic potential of the infection.
human_metabolism	this paper presents an analysis of the implications of some recent studies performed to characterize uranium products from modern uranium recovery facilities important for worker protection. assumptions about the solubility (related to the molecular species being produced) of these materials in humans are critical to properly assess radiation dose from intakes, understand chemotoxic implications, and establish protective exposure standards (airborne concentrations, limits on intake, etc.). recent studies, as well as information in the historical professional literature, were reviewed that address the issue of solubility and related characteristics. these data are important for the design of programs for assessment of both chemical and radiological aspects of worker exposure to the products of modern uranium recovery plants (conventional uranium mills and in situ recovery plants; i.e., isrs). the data suggest strongly that the oxide form produced by these facilities (and therefore, product solubility) is related to precipitation chemistry and thermal exposure (dryer temperature). given the peroxide precipitation and low temperature drying methods being used at many modern uranium recovery facilities in the u. s. today, very soluble products are being produced. the dosimetric impacts of these products to the pulmonary system (except perhaps in case of an extreme acute insult) would be small, and any residual pulmonary retention beyond a month or two would most likely be too small to measure by traditional urinalysis sampling or the current state-of-the-art of natural uranium in vivo lung counting techniques. uranium recovery plants should revisit the adequacy of current bioassay programs in the context of their process and product specifics. workers potentially exposed to these very soluble yellowcake concentrates should have urine specimens submitted for uranium analysis on an approximately weekly basis, including analysis for the biomarkers associated with potential renal injury [e.g., glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and protein albumen]. additionally, implications for compliance with current u. s. nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) regulations (e.g., 10 cfr20) are discussed. nrc, the applicable agreement state agencies, and licensees need to recognize the importance of the uranium chemotoxicity versus dose relationship in the interest of worker protection.
genetics	we have analyzed 24 loci including autosomal and y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (strs), y-indel, and sex-determining marker in a sample of 267 unrelated individuals from the mongolian population using the globalfiler (tm) pcr amplification kit to provide an expanded and more reliable forensic database. khalkh among 15 mongolian minor-groups accounts for about 80% of the entire mongolian population. a total of 267 different dna profiles were found in this work. the highest gene diversity was observed in the se33 (0.9376) locus, and the lowest value was found in the tpox (0.6142) locus. although individual power of discrimination estimates varied at the studied loci, combined probability of match from the 21 str loci was estimated to be 1.139 x 10(-24), which is highly informative. based on the results of pair-wise f-st genetic distances and multi-dimensional scaling plot showed that mongolians were clustered into europeans and asians, although mongolia is geographically located in northeastern asia. thus, the present survey of the mongolian population may help establish a comprehensive reference database for forensic and population genetic analyses.
enzymology	introduction: the role of drug transporters as one of the determinants of cellular drug permeability has become increasingly evident. despite the lipophilicity of a drug molecule as rate-limiting factor for passive diffusion across biological membranes, carrier-mediated and active transport have gained attention over the years. a better understanding of the effects and roles of these influx transporters towards transmembrane permeability of a drug molecule need to be delineated for drug development and delivery. areas covered: this review focuses on findings relative to role of transporters in drug absorption and bioavailability. particularly the areas demanding further research have been emphasized. this review will also highlight various transporters expressed on vital organs and their effects on drug pharmacokinetics. expert opinion: significant efforts have been devoted to understand the role of transporters, their iterative interplay with metabolizing enzymes through molecular enzymology, binding and structure-activity relationship studies. a few assays such as parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (pampa) have been developed to analyze drug transport across phospholipid membranes. although large web-accessible databases on tissue selective expression profiles at transcriptomic as well as proteomic are available, there is a need to collocate the scattered literature on the role of transporters in drug development and delivery.
enzymology	phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pcya) catalyzes the proton-coupled four-electron reduction of biliverdin ix alpha 's two vinyl groups to produce phycocyanobilin, an essential chromophore for phytochromes, cyanobacteriochromes and phycobiliproteins. previous site directed mutagenesis studies indicated that the fully conserved residue his74 plays a critical role in the h-bonding network that permits proton transfer. here, we exploit x-ray crystallography, enzymology and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the functional role of this invariant histidine. the structures of the h74a, h74e and h74q variants of pcya reveal that a ""conserved"" buried water molecule that bridges his74 and catalytically essential his88 is not required for activity. despite distinct conformations of glu74 and gln74 in the h74e and h74q variants, both retain reasonable activity while the h74a variant is inactive, suggesting smaller residues may generate cavities that increase flexibility, thereby reducing enzymatic activity. molecular dynamic simulations further reveal that the crucial active site residue asp105 is more dynamic in h74a compared to wild-type pcya and the two other his74 variants, supporting the conclusion that the ala74 mutation has increased the flexibility of the active site.

polymerase_chain_reaction	fusarium head blight is a major disease of wheat and an important contributor to the reduced cultivation of wheat in south africa, where the crop often is grown under irrigation. we collected fusarium isolates from 860 fusarium head blight-infected wheat heads in seven irrigated wheat-growing areas of south africa. six fusarium species, i.e., f. chlamydosporum, f. crookwellense, f. culmorum, f. equiseti, f. graminearum and f. semitectum were recovered, three of which, i.e., f. chlamydosporum, f. equiseti and f. semitectum, were not previously associated with fusarium head blight in south africa. fusarium graminearum occurred at high frequencies at all seven locations. based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays of diagnostic sequences, more isolates were predicted to produce deoxynivalenol than nivalenol. fusarium graminearum (sensu lato) appears to be the primary causal agent of fusarium head blight in irrigated wheat in south africa, which may not be the case for wheat cultivated under rain-fed conditions. rotations of irrigated wheat with other graminaceous crops and maize could increase fungal inoculum and disease pressure. the establishment of fusarium head blight in the irrigated wheat region of the country means that resistant lines and alternative agronomic practices are needed to limit disease severity, yield losses and mycotoxin contamination.
molecular_biology	the dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddntps) terminate the bio-polymerization of dna and become essential chemical component of dna sequencing technology which is now basic tool for molecular biology research. in this method the radiolabeled or fluorescent dye labeled ddntp analogues are being used for dna sequencing by detection of the terminated dna fragment after single labeled ddntp incorporation into dna under pcr conditions. this report describes the syntheses of rationally designed novel amino-functionalized ddntp analogue such as pyrrolidine nucleoside triphosphates (prntps), and their polymerase activities with dna polymerase by lc-ms and gel-electrophoretic techniques. the mass and page analyses strongly support the incorporation of prntps into dna oligonucleotide with therminator dna polymerase as like control substrate ddntp. as resultant the dna oligonucleotide are functionalized as amine group by prntp incorporation with polymerase. hence prntps provide opportunities to prepare demandable conjugated dna with other biomolecules/dyes/fluorescence molecule without modifying nucleobase structure.

human_metabolism	this text proposes that time is essentially related to one 's visual metabolic rate. metabolic rate is regulated by the speed of the intake of energy, the rate of the production of adenosine triphosphate (atp) to the visual areas. the author 's working hypothesis is that the visual area of the brain known as human v5, the region involved in motion detection, may be the region most responsible for time perception. our time sense from all the senses is, thus, compiled in the visual region, the speed of the human perception of reality. time is the relationship of the human perception of reality and the rate that the reality itself is taking place (given by light waves in the environment). hence, vision (and the visual cortex area v5) may be the vitally important aspects in answering the question: what is time? when we are not looking at a clock, time may be governed by our rate of metabolism; rate of the production of atp by the mitochondria in v5. for example, when general human metabolism (and v5) is fast, time runs slow. when metabolic rate is relatively slow, time runs relatively faster. many factors enter into the speed of metabolism such as age, sex, drug effects, velocity compared to speed c, states of boredom or excitement, darkness or light and mental states such as sleep. the relationship between time and space is discussed with the metabolic rate of v5 in mind. because the uncertainty principle and the quantum picture of reality are adopted, this model qualitatively quantizes space and time, showing why they must forever be connected i.e. space-time. this idea is discussed in relation to zeno 's paradox, which suggests that space and time are indeed quantized events, instants and entropy are defined reality can be understood in terms of the speed of the processing of instants. the arrow of time is pictured as caused by long-term potentiation of synaptic neurons within the brain. minkowski-einstein space-time is analyzed and compared with the visual metabolic rate. the probable consequences of this model are proposed.
molecular_biology	introduction: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (pdac) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. recently, two chemotherapy regimens have proven to improve median overall survival in comparison with gemcitabine. based on better understanding of tumor molecular biology and of the role of tumor microenvironment, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) could be an interesting and new type of targeted treatment of pdac. areas covered: preclinical and clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of several mabs in pancreatic cancer treatment. this review will underline the most important targeted pathways by mabs involved in this disease, including egfr, her-2, igf-1 r, vegf/vegfr, notch, wnt and immune checkpoints. expert opinion: despite the promising results of preclinical and phase i trials, the addition of mabs to standard chemotherapy or in association with other target agents seems not to confirm these results in the following phase ii and iii trials in pancreatic cancer patients. however, an improved patient selection before treatment based on molecular characteristics in association with reliable predictive biomarkers can identified more efficacious treatment approaches, minimizing toxicity profile of these drugs.
southern_blotting	while epstein barr virus (ebv) is associated with about 10% of gastric carcinomas worldwide, the role of the virus in the tumorigenesis of ebv-associated gastric carcinoma (ebvagc) is unclear. previously, we reported that a gastric cancer cell line, snu-719, that is naturally infected with ebv closely resembles ebvagc. here, we attempted to eliminate the ebv genome from snu-719 cells to ascertain the influence of ebv in ebvagc. southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) showed that ebv genomes were maintained as episomes in snu-719 cells. to remove ebv episomes, snu-719 cells were first cultured in a hydroxyurea (hu)-containing medium for up to 6 months. real-time polymerase chain reaction and fish results revealed no evidence of hu-mediated ebv genome reduction, although cell growth was reduced by acute hu treatment in dose- and time-dependent manners. two small interfering rnas against epstein barr nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1) abrogated over 90% of the ectopic ebna1 expression in hela cells, but only 40% of endogenous ebna1 expression in snu-719 cells. together, our data suggest that maintenance of latent ebv infection is essential for the viability of ebvagc cells, avoiding elimination of ebv episomes from the cells.
enzymology	although there is much knowledge of the enzymology (and genes coding the proteins) of lipid biosynthesis in higher plants, relatively little attention has been paid to regulation. we have demonstrated the important role for cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase in the biosynthesis of the major extra-plastidic membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine. we followed this work by applying control analysis to light-induced fatty acid synthesis. this was the first such application to lipid synthesis in any organism. the data showed that acetyl-coa carboxylase was very important, exerting about half of the total control. we then applied metabolic control analysis to lipid accumulation in important oil crops - oilpalm, olive, and rapeseed. recent data with soybean show that the block of fatty acid biosynthesis reactions exerts somewhat more control (63%) than lipid assembly although both are clearly very important. these results suggest that gene stacks, targeting both parts of the overall lipid synthesis pathway will be needed to increase significantly oil yields in soybean. this article is part of a special issue entitled: membrane structure and function: relevance in the cell 's physiology, pathology and therapy.

molecular_biology	bioinformatics field has now solidly settled itself as a control in molecular biology and incorporates an extensive variety of branches of knowledge from structural biology, genomics to gene expression studies. bioinformatics is the application of computer technology to the management of biological information. genomic signal processing (gsp) techniques have been connected most all around in bioinformatics and will keep on assuming an essential part in the investigation of biomedical issues. gsp refers to using the digital signal processing (dsp) methods for genomic data (e.g. dna sequences) analysis. recently, applications of gsp in bioinformatics have obtained great consideration such as identification of dna protein coding regions, identification of reading frames, cancer detection and others. cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases that the world faces and has raised the death rate in recent years, it is known medically as malignant neoplasm, so detection of it at the early stage can yield a promising approach to determine and take actions to treat with this risk. gsp is a method which can be used to detect the cancerous cells that are often caused due to genetic abnormality. this systematic review discusses some of the gsp applications in bioinformatics generally. the gsp techniques, used for cancer detection especially, are presented to collect the recent results and what has been reached at this point to be a new subject of research.
human_metabolism	creatine (cr) is recommended as a dietary supplement especially for athletes but its therapeutic potential is also discussed. it is assumed that human body uses cr for the formation of phosphocreatine, which is necessary for muscular work as a source of energy. production of cr in a body is closely connected to methionine cycle where guanidinoacetate (gaa) is in a final step methylated from s-adenosylmethionine (sam). increased availability of sam for phosphatidylcholine (pc) and sarcosine synthesis can potentially stimulate endogenous production of betaine a thus methylation of homocysteine (hcy) to form methionine. our subject who was methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) 677tt homozygote lowered plasma hcy from 33.3 mu mol/l to 17.1 mu mol/l following one-month cr supplementation (5 g/day) opposite to 677cc and ct genotypes whose hcy levels tended to increase (but still in normal ranges). we suppose that cr supplementation stimulates pathways leading to production of sarcosine which can serve to regenerate tetrahydrofolate (thf) to form 5,10-methylene-thf. this could potentially increase mthfr enzyme activity which may later result in increased hcy methylation. cr supplementation significantly effects metabolism of one carbon unit and potentially lower body 's demands for methyl groups. this could be beneficial as in the case of reduced enzyme activity such as mthfr 677c/t polymorphism.
genetics	species of the drosophila melanogaster species subgroup, including the species d. simulans, d. mauritiana, d. yakuba, and d. santomea, have long served as model systems for studying evolution. however, studies in these species have been limited by a paucity of genetic and transgenic reagents. here, we describe a collection of transgenic and genetic strains generated to facilitate genetic studies within and between these species. we have generated many strains of each species containing mapped piggybac transposons including an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eyfp) gene expressed in the eyes and a phi c31 attp site-specific integration site. we have tested a subset of these lines for integration efficiency and reporter gene expression levels. we have also generated a smaller collection of other lines expressing other genetically encoded fluorescent molecules in the eyes and a number of other transgenic reagents that will be useful for functional studies in these species. in addition, we have mapped the insertion locations of 58 transposable elements in d. virilis that will be useful for genetic mapping studies.
cell_biology	studies on the caenorhabditis elegans nucleus have provided fascinating insight to the organization and activities of eukaryotic cells. being the organelle that holds the genetic blueprint of the cell, the nucleus is critical for basically every aspect of cell biology. the stereotypical development of c. elegans from a one cell-stage embryo to a fertile hermaphrodite with 959 somatic nuclei has allowed the identification of mutants with specific alterations in gene expression programs, nuclear morphology, or nuclear positioning. moreover, the early c. elegans embryo is an excellent model to dissect the mitotic processes of nuclear disassembly and reformation with high spatiotemporal resolution. we review here several features of the c. elegans nucleus, including its composition, structure, and dynamics. we also discuss the spatial organization of chromatin and regulation of gene expression and how this depends on tight control of nucleocytoplasmic transport. finally, the extensive connections of the nucleus with the cytoskeleton and their implications during development are described. most processes of the c. elegans nucleus are evolutionarily conserved, highlighting the relevance of this powerful and versatile model organism to human biology.
genetics	real-time imaging of regulated exocytosis in secreting organs can provide unprecedented temporal and spatial detail. here, we highlight recent advances in 3d time-lapse imaging in drosophila salivary glands at single-granule resolution. using fluorescently labeled proteins expressed in the fly, it is now possible to image the dynamics of vesicle biogenesis and the cytoskeletal factors involved in secretion. 3d imaging over time allows one to visualize and define the temporal sequence of events, including clearance of cortical actin, fusion pore formation, mixing of the vesicular and plasma membranes and recruitment of components of the cytoskeleton. we will also discuss the genetic tools available in the fly that allow one to interrogate the essential factors involved in secretory vesicle formation, cargo secretion and the ultimate integration of the vesicular and plasma membranes. we argue that the combination of high-resolution real-time imaging and powerful genetics provides a platform to investigate the role of any factor in regulated secretion.
immunology	the large majority of classified primary immune deficiency (pid) diseases present in childhood. yet, most patients with pid are adults, with a large proportion experiencing onset of symptoms beyond their childhood years. most of these are diagnosed predominantly with antibody defects, but cellular and other disorders are increasingly being identified in older patients as well. moreover, advances in clinical immunology are allowing pediatric patients, even those with severe disease, to reach adulthood. because of differences in the physiology and pathophysiology of children and adults, the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a complex chronic disease could differ significantly between these patient populations and therefore require modifications in approach.

polymerase_chain_reaction	kin17 dna and rna binding protein (kin17) is a highly conserved protein that participates in dna replication, dna repair and cell cycle progression. recently, the tumor-promoting function of kin17 has been demonstrated and increasingly studied. in the present study, the role of kin17 in the invasion and metastasis of non-small cells lung cancer (nsclc) was investigated. elevated kin17 mrna and protein expression was identified in a total of 97 nsclc and benign lung lesion tissue specimens. kin17 overexpression was significantly correlated with high tumor grade and lymph node metastasis, indicating poor patient prognosis. scratch and transwell assays demonstrated that the knockdown of kin17 inhibited the ability of nsclc cells to migrate and invade. furthermore, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses confirmed that knockdown of kin17 decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7, epidermal growth factor receptor and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog. the results of the present study indicate that kin17 is markedly overexpressed in nsclc tissues compared with benign lung lesion and peritumoral tissue. the upregulation of kin17 may serve an important role in the metastasis of nsclc cells. these results indicate that kin17 is a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of nsclc, in addition to being a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with nsclc.
human_metabolism	alpha-linolenic acid (alpha lna; 18 : 3n-3) is essential in the human diet, probably because it is the substrate for the synthesis of longer-chain, more unsaturated n-3 fatty acids, principally epa (20 : 5n-3) and dha (22 : 6n-3), which confer important biophysical properties on cell membranes and so are required for tissue function. the extent to which this molecular transformation occurs in man is controversial. the present paper reviews the recent literature on the metabolism of alpha lna in man, including the use of dietary alpha lna in beta-oxidation, recycling of carbon by fatty acid synthesis de novo and conversion to longer-chain pufa. sex differences in alpha lna metabolism and the possible biological consequences are discussed. increased consumption of epa and dha in fish oil has a number of well-characterised beneficial effects on health. the present paper also reviews the efficacy of increased alpha lna consumption in increasing the concentrations of epa and dha in blood and cell lipid pools, and the extent to which such dietary interventions might be protective against cvd and inflammation. although the effects on cvd risk factors and inflammatory markers are variable, where beneficial effects have been reported these are weaker than have been achieved from increasing consumption of epa+dha or linoleic acid. overall, the limited capacity for conversion to longer-chain n-3 fatty acids, and the lack of efficacy in ameliorating cvd risk factors and inflammatory markers in man suggests that increased consumption of alpha lna may be of little benefit in altering epa+dha status or in improving health outcomes compared with other dietary interventions.
enzymology	ten years after the initial identification of human renalase the first genuinely catalytic substrates have been identified. throughout the prior decade a consensus belief that renalase is produced predominantly by the kidney and catalytically oxidizes catecholamines in order to lower blood pressure and slow the heart has prevailed. this belief was, however, based on fundamentally flawed scientific observations that did not include control reactions to account for the well-known autoxidation of catecholamines in oxygenated solutions. nonetheless, the initial claims have served as the kernel for a rapidly expanding body of research largely predicated on the belief that catecholamines are substrates for this enzyme. the proliferation of scientific studies pertaining to renalase as a hormone has proceeded unabated despite well-reasoned expressions of dissent that have indicated the deficiencies of the initial observations and other inconsistencies. our group has very recently identified isomeric forms of beta-nad(p)h as substrates for renalase. these substrates arise from non-specific reduction of beta-nad(p)(+) that forms beta-4-dihydronad(p) (beta-nad(p)h), beta-2-dihydronad(p) and beta-6-dihydronad(p); the latter two being substrates for renalase. renalase oxidizes these substrates with rate constants that are up to 10(4)-fold faster than any claimed for catecholamines. the electrons harvested are delivered to dioxygen via the enzyme 's fad cofactor forming both h2o2 and beta-nad(p)(+) as products. it would appear that the metabolic purpose of this chemistry is to alleviate the inhibitory effect of beta-2-dihydronad(p) and beta-6-dihydronad(p) on primary metabolism dehydrogenase enzymes. the identification of this genuinely catalytic activity for renalase calls for re-evaluation of much of the research of this enzyme, in which definitive links between renalase catecholamine consumption and physiological responses were reported. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

northern_blotting	degradation of rna as an intermediate message between genes and corresponding proteins is important for rapid attenuation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. this process is controlled by ribonucleases that have different target specificities. in the bacterial pathogen helicobacter pylori, an exo- and endoribonuclease rnase j is essential for growth. to explore the role of rnase j in h. pylori, we identified its putative targets at a global scale using next generation rna sequencing. we found that strong depletion for rnase j led to a massive increase in the steady-state levels of non-rrnas. mrnas and rnas antisense to open reading frames were most affected with over 80% increased more than 2-fold. non-coding rnas expressed in the intergenic regions were much less affected by rnase j depletion. northern blotting of selected messenger and non-coding rnas validated these results. globally, our data suggest that rnase j of h. pylori is a major rnase involved in degradation of most cellular rnas.
polymerase_chain_reaction	maturation of cumulus-oocyte complexes (cocs) is crucial for further successful monospermic fertilization, embryo growth, and implantation. all these events are accompanied by proliferation and differentiation of cumulus cells. the migration of cocs to the oviduct after ovulation and the interaction between female gametes and/or embryos with maternal tissues are still poorly recognized on the molecular level. this study was aimed to first demonstrate themrnaexpression profile of cell migration markers during different stages of porcine oocytes maturation and developmental capability in vitro. the cocs were collected from a total of 45 pubertal crossbred landrace gilts, brilliant cresyl blue (bcb) stained, and analyzed before (n = 150) or after (n = 150) in vitro maturation (ivm). using the affymetrix((r)) porcine gene 1.1 st array, the expression profile of 12,258 porcine transcripts was examined. we found nine genes involved in cell migration mechanisms, that is, pld1, kit, lama2, map3k1, vegfa, tgfbr3, insr, tpm1, and rtn4. these genes were upregulated in porcine oocytes before ivm as compared with post-ivm expression analysis. moreover, important mechanisms of biological interaction between vegfa-kit and vegfa-insr were also observed. the upregulation and/or downregulation of selected mrnas expression after microarray assays was checked and approved by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we suggest that several genes, including lama2 or tpm1, encode proteins participating in the formation of the oocyte 's protein architecture such as microtubules and kinetochore reorganization. as the expression of all `` migration regulatory genes'' investigated in this study was significantly upregulated in oocytes before ivm, we conclude that they may contribute to the maturational capability of porcine oocytes. however, migration potency of cocs is not accompanied by achievement of the mii stage by porcine oocytes in vitro. the investigated genes such as pld1, kit, lama2, map3k1, vegfa, tgfbr3, insr, tpm1, and rtn4 may be recognized as a new marker of porcine oocytes maturational competence during in vitro culture.
enzymology	as described in enzymology, ""induced fit"" and ""lock and key"" models are used to explain the enzymic specificity of substrate. previously, authors have studied the substrate specificity of eisenia fetida protease i (ffp-i), showing that the interaction between this protease and its substrates underwent an ""induced fit"" followed by ""lock and key"" model. it needs further investigating whether this model is suitable for other enzymes. here, the reactions of substrate-induced eisenia fetida protease ii (efp-ii), subtilisin (sub) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) with their substrates were shown. efp-ii and sub could not recognize chromozym u (cu) (p < 0.05) after incubated with chromozym th (cth) although the two proteases are natively able to react with both cth and cu. the reaction followed an ""induced fit-lock and key"" pattern. in contrast, the two proteases were still able to react with cth even though they have been incubated with cu. but neither earthworm protease nor subtilisin could recognize cu after cu and cth treatment in turn, still suggesting that the reactions followed an ""induced fit and then lock and key"" procedure. furthermore, the activity of ldh with lactate significantly decreased (p<0.05) after the enzyme had been incubated with pyruvate. the activity on the conversion of pyruvate into lactate was not significantly affected by a prior incubation with lactate. this suggests that the pyruvate-induced complementary conformation of ldh is more stable than lactate-induced conformation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objectives: to investigate whether lep g2548a and lepr q223r polymorphisms influence serum lipid levels and whether the 2 polymorphisms affect the efficacy of simvastatin treatment in chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia. methods: we used an extreme sampling approach by selecting 212 individuals from the top and bottom 15% of adjusted lipid-lowering response residuals to simvastatin (n = 106 in each group of good or bad response) from a total of 734 samples with primary hyperlipidemia. they were treated with simvastatin orally 20 mg/d. fasting serum lipids were measured at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. genotyping was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. results: more patients in the good response group (27%) had lepr q223r than in the bad response group (16%, p =.046). secondary stratified analyses showed that patients carrying the rr genotype of the lepr q223r gene had significantly higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than those with the qr genotype at baseline (p = .034) among good responders. after 29 consecutive days of treatment with simvastatin, patients carrying the rr genotype had a significantly larger decrease in triglycerides (change: -0.74 +/- 0.92, p =.036) and total cholesterol levels (change: -1.77 +/- 0.68, p = .023) compared with those carrying qr genotype among bad responders. after bonferroni correction, the results were not statistically significant. conclusion: lepr q223r polymorphism, but not lep g2548a, could modulate the efficacy of simvastatin in chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia.
enzymology	the currently known methods of enzymatic beta-lactam synthesis, as well as the enzymes and heterogeneous biocatalysts used for this purpose, are presented, and the published reports on advances in the field of enzymatic synthesis of selected antibiotics belonging to the groups of penicillin acids and cephalosporin acids are summarized in the present review. the key conditions and parameters of biocatalytic processes, such as the biocatalyst form, concentration of the precursor compounds, solvent type, ph, temperature, etc. are analyzed and compared, and guidelines for further optimization of beta-lactam synthesis are given. the present review may be of use for a wide range of readers, as well as to enzymology and biotechnology experts.
genetics	hybrids are generally less fit than their parental species, and the mechanisms underlying their fitness reductions can manifest through different traits. for example, hybrids can have physiological, behavioral, or ecological defects, and these defects can generate reproductive isolation between their parental species. however, the rate that mechanisms of postzygotic isolation other than hybrid sterility and inviability evolve has remained largely uninvestigated, despite isolated studies showing that behavioral defects in hybrids are not only possible but might be widespread. here, we study a fundamental animal-behavior the ability of individuals to find food-and test the rate at which it breaks down in hybrids. we measured the ability of hybrids from 94 pairs of drosophila species to find food and show that this ability decreases with increasing genetic divergence between the parental species and that male hybrids are more strongly (and negatively) affected than females. our findings quantify the rate that hybrid dysfunction evolves across the diverse radiation of drosophila and highlights the need for future investigations of the genetic and neurological mechanisms that affect a hybrid 's ability to find a suitable substrate on which to feed and breed.
molecular_biology	background: crustaceans have been studied extensively as model systems for nervous system function from single neuron properties to behavior. however, lack of molecular sequence information and tools have slowed the adoption of these physiological systems as molecular model systems. in this study, we sequenced and performed de novo assembly for the nervous system transcriptomes of two decapod crustaceans: the jonah crab (cancer borealis) and the american lobster (homarus americanus). results: forty-two thousand, seven hundred sixty-six and sixty thousand, two hundred seventy-three contigs were assembled from c. borealis and h. americanus respectively, representing 9,489 and 11,061 unique coding sequences. from these transcripts, genes associated with neural function were identified and manually curated to produce a characterization of multiple gene families important for nervous system function. this included genes for 34 distinct ion channel types, 17 biogenic amine and 5 gaba receptors, 28 major transmitter receptor subtypes including glutamate and acetylcholine receptors, and 6 gap junction proteins - the innexins. conclusion: with this resource, crustacean model systems are better poised for incorporation of modern genomic and molecular biology technologies to further enhance the interrogation of fundamentals of nervous system function.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the present study aimed to investigate the effect of dickkopf-related protein 3 (dkk3) on osteogenic differentiation of rat dental follicle cells (decs). a pcr array analysis of wnt pathway activation in decs identified genes dysregulated by mineral induction. among them, dkk3expression levels were decreased, and further experiments were conducted to investigate its role in dec osteogenesis. by comparing decs grown in normal growth and mineral-induction media for 4 weeks, the present study confirmed that dkk3 was a potential target gene of osteogenesis through reverse transcliption-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-gpcr) and western blotting (wb). a short hairpin rna (shrna) was introduced into decs using a lentiviral vector to inhibit dkk3 expression. an alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity assay and alizarin red staining were performed to observe the dkk3-shrna decs. in addition, the osteogenic differentiation of dkk3-shrna decs was analyzed by rt-gpcr and wb. in vivo, dkk3-shrna decs seeded on hydroxyapatiteip-tricalcium phosphate (ha/tcp) scaffolds were transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, followed by hematoxylin-eosin and masson staining. the results confirmed that dkk3 expression was downregulated during mineral induction in rat decs. lentivirus-mediated expression of dkk3 shrna in decs promoted calcified-nodule formation, alp activity and the expression of p-catenin, runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteocalcin, compared with control cells. in vivo, the implanted section presented the majority of newly formed osteoid matrices and collagen, with limited space between the ha/tcp scaffolds and matrices. in conclusion, dkk3 expression negatively regulates the osteogenic differentiation of decs and, conversely, downregulation of dkk3 may enhance dec osteogenesis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	classical contagious caprine pleuropneumonia is one of the most fatal contagious disease of goats listed by world organization for animal health that leads to major economic losses. it is caused by infection with mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae. in order to isolate the causative agents of ccpp for the first time in the kingdom of saudi arabia, fifteen flocks from eastern region (al ahsa, dammam and hafr albaten) and ten flocks from riyadh and al-kharj regions were selected for this study. a total of 700 samples (400 nasal swabs, 300 pleural fluid samples and lung samples (from necropsied animals)) were collected from goats showing typical signs of ccpp. the clinical signs of diseased cases revealed serous to mucoid nasal discharge, coughing, dyspnea, frothy salivation, and fever (40-42 degrees c). necropsied animals showed fibrinous pleuropneumonia and increased pleural fluid. of 400 nasal swabs, 190 pleural fluid, and 110 lung samples, 26 (6.5%), 31 (16.3%) and 19 (17.3%) mycoplasma isolates were recovered, respectively. biochemically, all isolates were sensitive to digitonin and fermented glucose. sixty seven of mycoplasma isolates were belonged to mycoplasma mycoides cluster based on detection of 16s rrna. polymerase chain reaction screening of mycoplasma isolates using specific primer for m. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae confirmed 55 isolates to be m. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae.

genetics	background: in periodontitis, genetics and smoking play important roles in host immune system response. the aim of this study is to determine whether the genetic background of initial periodontitis and caries could be detected using an active matrix metalloproteinase (ammp)-8 chairside test in finnish adolescents. methods: forty-seven participants gave approval for analysis of both oral fluid collection and dna. an ammp-8 chairside test was performed on participants (adolescents aged 15 to 17 years), and full-mouth clinical parameters of oral health were assessed including periodontal, oral mucosal, and caries status in eastern finland from 2014 to 2015. dna was extracted from oral fluid samples and genotyped for 71 polymorphisms in 29 candidate genes for periodontitis. results were analyzed using a logistic regression model. p values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate (= 4 mm pockets were associated with vitamin d receptor (vdr) (rs2228570, p = 0.002, q = 0.04) and mmp3 (rs520540, rs639752, rs679620, p = 0.0009, 0.003, 0.003, q = 0.04, respectively). none of the other single-nucleotide polymorphisms studied showed a significant association with the ammp-8 chairside test and at least one caries lesion positivity. conclusion: genetic polymorphisms of mmp3 and vdr are linked to initial periodontitis in finnish adolescents, and the ammp-8 chairside test can eventually detect initial periodontitis in young patients with predisposing genetic background.
immunology	since the european union enforced the ban on antibiotic growth promoters in 2006, the research has been focused on natural feed additives which would have a proven positive impact on both production and animal health. inulin is both the most commonly used and the most effective probiotic additive. the mechanism of inulin interactions with the avian body is complex, multidirectional and not fully understood. despite a number of unresolved issues, many authors have demonstrated the positive impact of inulin on the host organism. dietary supplementation of poultry feeding with inulin contributes to the modulation of intestinal microbiota through favouring a quick proliferation of beneficial bifidobacterium and lactobacillus strains and inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes. there are indications that inulin-provoked changes in the host gut microbiota in poultry may alter the structure and histomorphology of the intestinal mucosa and improve its absorption capacity in poultry. it has also been demonstrated that inulin may affect the immune system and the systemic metabolism of minerals and lipids. the reports on inulin effects on the body and performance of poultry are often contradictory, as the effectiveness of this prebiotic is strongly dependent on the type and dose used, and the duration of its administration.
genetics	despite tremendous progress in finding genes that, when manipulated, affects lifespan, little is known about the genetics underlying natural variation in lifespan. while segregating genetic variants for lifespan has been notoriously difficult to find in genome-wide association studies (gwas), a complementary approach is to manipulate key genetic pathways in lines that differ in lifespan. if these candidate pathways are down regulated in long-lived lines, these lines can be predicted to respond less to pharmaceutical down-regulation of these pathways than short-lived lines. experimental studies have identified the nutrient-sensing pathway tor as a key regulator of lifespan in model organisms, and this pathway can effectively be down regulated using the drug rapamycin, which extends lifespan in all tested species. we expose short-and long-lived lines of the nematode caenorhabditis remanei to rapamycin, and investigate if long-lived lines, which are hypothesized to already have down-regulated tor signaling, respond less to rapamycin. we found no interaction between line and rapamycin treatment, since rapamycin extended lifespan independent of the intrinsic lifespan of the lines. this shows that rapamycin is equally effective on long and short-lived lines, and suggests that the evolution of long life may involve more factors that down-regulation of tor.

enzymology	the termination module of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps) and polyketide synthases (pks) off-loads the final product as an acid (occasionally also accompanied by cyclization) upon hydrolysis by employing thioesterase domains (te-domains). reductase domains (r-domains) of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr) family offer an alternative offloading mechanism by reducing 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-ppant) arm-tethered peptidyl chain, a thioester, to an aldehyde or an alcohol. recent studies have highlighted their functional importance, for instance in the glycopeptidolipid (gpl) biosynthesis of mycobacterium smegmatis, where the resulting alcoholic group is the site for subsequent modifications such as glycosylations. the mechanistic understanding of how these r-domains function in the context of multi-modular nrps and pks is poorly understood. in this study, conformational differences in functionally important loops, not reported previously, were identified in a new crystal form of r-domain which may be relevant to functioning in the context of assembly-line nrps and pks enzymology. here, we propose a concerted loop movement model that allows gating of cofactor binding to these enzymes, enabling the release of the final product only after the substrate has reached the active site during biosynthesis, and therefore distinct from a canonical single domain sdr family of enzymes.

molecular_biology	beyond the universality of the symmetry concept, there are different emphases on its application in different branches of science. chemistry, being between particle physics and astrophysics, represents a bridge in, and a utilitarian approach to, the application of the symmetry concept, which has proved immensely fruitful in twentieth-century science. some pivotal discoveries, especially in structural chemistry, molecular biology, and materials science, emerged by relaxing some of the stipulations of the classical teachings about symmetry. this highly personal presentation relies on ideas expressed by a number of notable individuals in recent science, among them j. desmond bernal, francis crick, ronald j. gillespie, aleksandr i. kitaigorodskii, alan l. mackay, george a. olah, linus pauling, roger penrose, dan shechtman, james d. watson, steven weinberg, and eugene p. wigner.
human_metabolism	xylitol, a five carbon sugar alcohol, occurs widely in nature but it is also a normal intermediate in human metabolism. as an alternative sweetener, it is recommended for diabetics and for the prevention of dental caries. xylitol is currently produced chemically on a large scale. microbial production is lately becoming more attractive since the downstream processing is expected to be cheaper. among microorganisms, yeasts are the best xylitol producers, particularly those belonging to the genus candida. the key enzymes for xylitol production in yeasts are d-xylose reductase which, using either nadh or nadph, reduces d-xylose to xylitol, and predominantly, nad-linked xylitol dehydrogenase which reoxidizes xylitol to d-xylulose. xylitol accumulation in yeasts is sensitive to environmental conditions such as nutrition, temperature, ph, inoculum, substrate and aeration, with the last two being critical for yeast growth and fermentation. hemicellulosic hydrolysates derived from hardwood and particularly from agricultural residues, such as sugar cane bagasse, corn cabs, wheat and rice straw, are used as feedstock for xylitol production. due to the presence of inhibitory components, some of the hydrolysates have to be treated prior to microbial utilization. the most investigated types of processes have been batch ones, although fed-batch and immobilized systems have been characterized by the highest yields and productivities. apart from the naturally occurring yeasts, recombinant strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae in free and immobilized form were also investigated for xylitol production.
northern_blotting	glycogen and trehalose are important energy source and key regulation factors in the development of many organisms pass through energy metabolism, including bacteria, fungi, and insects. to study glycogen metabolism pathway in spodoptera exigua, first cdnas for glycogen synthase (spoexgs) and glycogen phosphorylase (spoexgp) were cloned from s. exigua. spoexgs cdna contains an open reading frame of 2,010 nucleotides encoding a protein of 669 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 76.19 kda and a pi of 5.84. spoexgp contains an open reading frame of 2,946 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 841 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 96.63 kda and a pi of 6.03. second, northern blotting revealed that spoexgs and spoexgp mrnas were expressed in brain, fat body, mid-gut, malpighian tubules, spermary, and tracheae of s. exigua. expression patterns for spoexgs and spoexgp mrnas were similar in fat body, but differed in whole body at different developmental stages. the last, under starvation conditions, spoexgs and spoexgp transcript expression rapidly decreased with increasing starvation time. when the starvation stress was removed, spoexgs and spoexgp mrna levels were lower in the groups starved for 6 and 12 h than in the 24-h starvation and control groups. treatment with excessive sugar intake led to higher levels of spoexgs and spoexgp transcripts after 12 h compared to the control group. these findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns, and potential function of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase proteins.

human_metabolism	obesity is a major problem and maintaining a healthy diet and body weight has become increasingly important. insulin is a known biomarker for the human metabolism, and measuring insulin may thus help inform decisions about diet choices. this provides a strong motivation to develop a fast, cheap, sensitive and easy to use home biosensor for insulin. here we discuss the challenges and trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range, analysis times, instrumentation and sample transport and storage requirements for different biosensor development approaches. we show that the sensitivity of conventional spr with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 nm is too low for practical purposes. label-free antibody and aptamer carbon nanotube based systems suffer from lack of specificity. highest sensitivity is afforded by mesoscale and phase monitoring electrochemical impedance spectroscopy assays with detection limits in the fm range, currently available only in a laboratory setting. thus, a home-based insulin dip-stick is yet to be developed. [graphics] biosensing traces and structure of insulin: an important molecule to be quantified with role in obesity and diabetes.
cell_biology	small gtp-hydrolyzing enzymes (gtpases) of the rhoa family play manifold roles in cell biology and are regulated by upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factors (gefs). herein, we focus on the gefs of the vav subfamily. vav1 was originally described as a proto-oncogene of the hematopoietic lineage. the gefs vav2 and vav3 are more broadly expressed in various tissues. in particular, the gef vav3 may play important roles in the developing nervous system during the differentiation of neural stem cells into the major lineages, namely neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. we discuss its putative regulatory roles for progenitor differentiation in the developing retina, polarization of neurons and formation of synapses, migration of oligodendrocyte progenitors and establishment of myelin sheaths. we propose that vav3 mediates the response of various neural cell types to environmental cues.
northern_blotting	escherichia coli is able to utilize d-ribose as its sole carbon source. the genes for the transport and initial-step metabolism of d-ribose form a single rbsdacbk operon. rbsabc forms the abc-type high-affinity d-ribose transporter, while rbsd and rbsk are involved in the conversion of d-ribose into d-ribose 5-phosphate. in the absence of inducer d-ribose, the ribose operon is repressed by a laci-type transcription factor rbsr, which is encoded by a gene located downstream of this ribose operon. at present, the rbs operon is believed to be the only target of regulation by rbsr. after genomic selex screening, however, we have identified that rbsr binds not only to the rbs promoter but also to the promoters of a set of genes involved in purine nucleotide metabolism. northern blotting analysis indicated that rbsr represses the purhd operon for de novo synthesis of purine nucleotide but activates the add and udk genes involved in the salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis. taken together, we propose that rbsr is a global regulator for switch control between the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and its salvage pathway.
enzymology	prokaryotes form ubiquitin (ub)-like isopeptide bonds on the lysine residues of proteins by at least two distinct pathways that are reversible and regulated. in mycobacteria, the c-terminal gln of pup (prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein) is deamidated and isopeptide linked to proteins by a mechanism distinct from ubiquitylation in enzymology yet analogous to ubiquitylation in targeting proteins for destruction by proteasomes. ub-fold proteins of archaea (samps, small archaeal modifier proteins) and thermus (ttub, trna-two-thiouridine b) that differ from ub in amino acid sequence, yet share a common beta-grasp fold, also form isopeptide bonds by a mechanism that appears streamlined compared with ubiquitylation. samps and ttub are found to be members of a small group of ub-fold proteins that function not only in protein modification but also in sulfur-transfer pathways associated with trna thiolation and molybdopterin biosynthesis. these multifunctional ub-fold proteins are thought to be some of the most ancient of ub-like protein modifiers.
northern_blotting	background: in cat visual cortex, critical period neuronal plasticity is minimal until approximately 3 postnatal weeks, peaks at 5 weeks, gradually declines to low levels at 20 weeks, and disappears by 1 year of age. dark rearing slows the entire time course of this critical period, such that at 5 weeks of age, normal cats are more plastic than dark reared cats, whereas at 20 weeks, dark reared cats are more plastic. thus, a stringent criterion for identifying genes that are important for plasticity in visual cortex is that they show differences in expression between normal and dark reared that are of opposite direction in young versus older animals. results: the present study reports the identification by differential display pcr of a novel gene, alpha-chimaerin, as a candidate visual cortex critical period plasticity gene that showed bidirectional regulation of expression due to age and dark rearing. northern blotting confirmed the bidirectional expression and 5'race sequencing identified the gene. there are two alternatively-spliced alpha-chimaerin isoforms: alpha 1 and alpha 2. western blotting extended the evidence for bidirectional regulation of visual cortex alpha-chimaerin isoform expression to protein in cats and mice. alpha 1- and alpha 2-chimaerin were elevated in dark reared compared to normal visual cortex at the peak of the normal critical period and in normal compared to dark reared visual cortex at the nadir of the normal critical period. analysis of variance showed a significant interaction in both cats and mice for both alpha-chimaerin isoforms, indicating that the effect of dark rearing depended on age. this differential expression was not found in frontal cortex. conclusions: chimaerins are rhogtpase-activating proteins that are epha4 effectors and have been implicated in a number of processes including growth cone collapse, axon guidance, dendritic spine development and the formation of corticospinal motor circuits. the present results identify alpha-chimaerin as a candidate molecule for a role in the postnatal critical period of visual cortical plasticity.
cell_biology	most prokaryote-secreted proteins are transported to the cell surface using either the general secretion (sec) or twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathway. a majority of secreted proteins are anchored to the cell surface, while the remainder are released into the extracellular environment. the anchored surface proteins play a variety of important roles in cellular processes, ranging from facilitating interactions between cells to maintaining cell stability. the extensively studied s-layer glycoprotein (slg) of haloferax volcanii, previously thought to be anchored via c-terminal intercalation into the membrane, was recently shown to be lipidated and to have its c-terminal segment removed in processes dependent upon archaeosortase a (arta), a recently discovered enzyme. while slg is a sec substrate, in silico analyses presented here reveal that, of eight additional arta substrates predicted, two substrates also contain predicted tat signal peptides, including hvo_0405, which has a highly conserved tripartite structure that lies closer to the center of the protein than to its c terminus, unlike other predicted arta substrates identified to date. we demonstrate that, even given its atypical location, this tripartite structure, which likely resulted from the fusion of genes encoding an arta substrate and a cytoplasmic protein, is processed in an arta-dependent manner. using an hvo_0405 mutant lacking the conserved ""twin"" arginines of the predicted tat signal peptide, we show that hvo_0405 is indeed a tat substrate and that arta substrates include both sec and tat substrates. finally, we confirmed the tat-dependent localization and signal peptidase i (spase i) cleavage site of hvo_0405 using mass spectrometry. importance the specific mechanisms that facilitate protein anchoring to the archaeal cell surface remain poorly understood. here, we have shown that the proteins bound to the cell surface of the model archaeon h. volcanii, through a recently discovered novel arta-dependent anchoring mechanism, are more structurally diverse than was previously known. specifically, our results demonstrate that both tat and sec substrates, which contain the conserved tripartite structure of predicted arta substrates, can be processed in an arta-dependent manner and that the tripartite structure need not lie near the c terminus for this processing to occur. these data improve our understanding of archaeal cell biology and are invaluable for in silico subcellular localization predictions of archaeal and bacterial proteins.
molecular_biology	this study aims to investigate the impacts of a digital learning module with guided peer feedback on students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change in the field of biotechnology and molecular life sciences. the extent to which the use of this module is appreciated by students is studied as well. a pre-test, post-test design was used with 203 students who were randomly assigned to groups of three. they were asked to work on the digital module with the aim of exploring various perspectives, and the pros and cons on the topic of genetically modified organisms (gmos). the results suggest that the module can be used to foster students' domain-specific knowledge gain and their attitudinal change. furthermore, the module was evaluated positively in terms of students' motivation and satisfaction with the learning experiences.

cell_biology	drosophila ovary is recognized as one of the best model systems to study stem cell biology in vivo. we had previously identified an autonomous role of the histone hi in germline stem cell (gsc) maintenance. here, we found that histone h1 depletion in escort cells (ecs) resulted in an increase of spectrosome-containing cells (sccs), an ovary tumor-like phenotype. further analysis showed that the dpp pathway is excessively activated in these scc cells, while the expression of bam is attenuated. in the h1-depleted ecs, both transposon activity and dna damage had increased dramatically, followed by ec apoptosis, which is consistent with the role of h1 in other somatic cells. surprisingly, h1-depleted ecs acquired cap cell characteristics including dpp expression, and the resulting abnormal dpp level inhibits scc further differentiation. most interestingly, double knockdown of h1 and dpp in ecs can reduce the number of sccs to the normal level, indicating that the additional dpp secreted by ecs contributes to the germline tumor. taken together, our findings indicate that histone h1 is an important epigenetic factor in controlling ec characteristics and a key suppressor of germline tumor.
genetics	several major market operators argue that the current level of knowledge about quality is too scant to justify a switch to a large-scale production of triploid salmon. the aim of the present study was, therefore, to elucidate how rearing conditions (5, 10 and 15 degrees c) affect the flesh quality of triploid atlantic salmon (salmo solar l, 1.6 +/- 0.3 kg). as a reference, diploid salmon kept under equal conditions and with equal genetics were used. the main design discriminant was the holding temperature; increased temperature gave increased blood lactate, rigor index (i-r), drip loss (dl), content of astaxanthin and intensity of redness, but reduced muscle ph, cathepsin activity and fillet lightness. salmon kept at 10 degrees c grew the fastest. it is concluded that ploidy gave less variation than temperature. triploids were characterized by lower blood haernatocrit (hct) and i-r higher dl and collagenase activity, and on average, paler and less yellowish fillets.

human_metabolism	in human in-vitro fertilization (ivf), embryos are routinely transferred to the uterus on either day 2 or day 3 of development, resulting in a 10-15% implantation rate. however, in other mammalian species, the transfer of cleavage stage embryos, which normally reside in the oviduct, to the uterus results in a significantly lower implantation rate compared with blastocysts. it is therefore proposed that, in order to increase implantation rates in human ivf, one has to move to extended culture and transfer at the blastocyst stage. the transfer of blastocysts will not only help synchronize the embryo with the female tract but will facilitate the identification of those embryos with little or no developmental potential. in order to culture viable blastocysts it is important to use more than one culture medium to cater for the changing requirements of the preimplantation embryo as it develops and differentiates. if sequential culture media are not used, one can obtain blastocysts but their resultant viability is low the use of sequential serum-free media in human ivf has resulted in >50% of embryos becoming blastocysts with an implantation rate of similar to 50%. further advances in human embryo culture should come from the replacement of protein with the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronate, which is more suitable than albumin in supporting implantation in the mouse, and which will eliminate biological variation and possible contamination from blood products. with the routine culture of human blastocysts will come the introduction of non-invasive tests of embryo viability, capable of identifying those blastocysts most likely to develop from a given cohort. as the implantation rate of blastocysts is higher than that of the cleavage stage embryo, fewer embryos will be required for transfer in order to establish a successful pregnancy, thereby reducing the number of multiple gestations and increasing the overall efficiency of human ivf.
molecular_biology	the gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase 7b (cbh7b) of the thermophilic fungus thielavia terrestris was identified, subcloned, and expressed in pichia pastoris. cbh7b encoded 455 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 51.8 kda. domain analysis indicated that cbh7b contains a family 7 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic core but lacks a carbohydrate-binding module. purified cbh7b exhibited optimum catalytic activity at ph 5.0 and 55 degrees c with 4-methylumbelliferryl-cellobioside as the substrate and retained 85% of its activity following 24 h incubation at 50 degrees c. despite the lack of activity toward microcrystalline substrates, this enzyme worked synergistically with the commercial enzyme cocktail cellic((r)) ctec2 to enhance saccharification by 39% when added to a reaction mixture containing 0.25% alkaline pretreated oil palm empty fruit bunch (opefb). attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested a reduction of lignin and crystalline cellulose in opefb samples supplemented with cbh7b. scanning electron microscopy revealed greater destruction extent of opefb strands in samples supplemented with cbh7b as compared with the nonsupplemented control. therefore, cbh7b has the potential to complement commercial enzymes in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass.

immunology	despite the clear need, progress toward a vaccine for congenital cytomegalovirus (cmv) has been slow. however, recent events have provided new interest, and several vaccine candidates are either in clinical trials or the trials are close to starting. in this issue of clinical and vaccine immunology, schleiss and colleagues show that a nonreplicating lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rlcmv)-vectored vaccine expressing cmv glycoprotein b (gb) and/or pp65 induces b and t cells and improves pup survival in a guinea pig model of congenital cmv infection (clin vaccine immunol 24: e00300-16, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00300-16). the combination vaccine appeared to be the most effective.
southern_blotting	a specific and sensitive conventional and real-time pcr assays were developed for the detection and quantification of rhizoctonia solani populations infecting pulses. five different sets of r. solani specific molecular primers arsf1&r1, arsf2&r2 and arsf3&r3, arsf4&r4 and arsf5&r5 were designed from the internal transcribed spacer sequences of r. solani isolates associated with pulse crops representing 7 anastomosis groups (ag1, ag2-2, ag2-2lp, ag2-3, ag3, ag4 and ag5). the designed primers yielded variable amplicons ranging from 174 to 563 bp specific to r. solani populations. the markers proved to be highly sensitive to r. solani and were able to detect the pathogen from both mycelium and infected mung bean plants at various concentrations of genomic dna ranging from 0.025 to 1.0 ng using conventional pcr. the markers were also found suitable for real-time pcr assay with enhanced sensitivity up to 1.24 pg genomic dna. the efficacy of markers for early detection of r. solani infection in mung bean plants was also tested and the marker arsf4&r4 was the most sensitive in detecting the pathogen at 24 h after artificial inoculation under field and at 6 h after artificial inoculation under in vitro conditions. the radioactive and fluorescein amidite labelled probes for markers arsf4&r4 and arsf5&r5 were designed and tested for cross-reactivity and sensitivity by southern blotting and real-time pcr analyses, respectively. both probes proved to be highly sensitive and specific only to r. solani. both quantitative pcr and probe-based diagnostics have been developed for r. solani detection in pulses.
immunology	background: anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency of which reliable epidemiological data are lacking. this study aimed to analyze how quickly patients presenting with anaphylaxis were treated in emergency and whether treatment followed the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology (eaaci) guidelines. methods: patient data were collected between april 2009 and april 2013. emergency doctors completed a questionnaire for adult patients presenting at the emergency department (ed) of the st. pierre hospital in brussels with anaphylaxis. inclusion criteria were based on the sampson criteria of anaphylaxis. data were analyzed using a microsoft excel database. results: about 0.04% (100/230878) of all emergency visits in adults presented with anaphylaxis. 64% of patients received their first medical help later than 30 min after symptom onset. 67% of patients received adrenaline, 85% oral antihistamines, and 89% received iv glucocorticosteroids. 46/100 patients were discharged directly from the ed, of which 87% received further medical prescriptions for self-administration: 67% corticosteroids, 83% antihistamines, and 9% intramuscular adrenaline. 74% were instructed to consult an allergologist for adequate diagnosis. 54/100 patients were hospitalized. conclusion: the majority of patients were treated according to the eaaci guidelines for management of anaphylaxis, but only a minority received the recommended adrenaline auto-injector for self-administration at discharge. because the majority of patients received medical help later than 30 min after symptom onset, adrenaline auto-injector prescription is a necessity. the low rate of doctors prescribing adrenaline auto-injectors in the ed setting underlines the need to train doctors of various backgrounds in prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis and the close collaboration with allergologists.
molecular_biology	therapeutic interventions for advanced prostate cancer (pca) center on inhibiting androgen receptor (ar) and downstream signaling pathways. resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and/or ar antagonists is inevitable and molecular mechanisms driving castration-resistant pca (cr-pca) primarily involve alterations in ar expression and activity. detailed molecular biology work over the past decade, discussed at length in this review article, has revealed several ar transcripts that result from alternative splicing. these ar splice variants are increased in cell and mouse models of cr-pca and in cr-pca tumors. several ar variants lack the ligand binding domain, but retain their ability to bind dna and activate transcription-linking constitutive ar function and therapeutic failure. arv7 is the only variant endogenously detected at the protein level and thus has undergone more thorough molecular characterization. clinical trials in pca are currently investigating arv7 utility as a biomarker and new therapeutics that inhibit arv7. overall, this review will illustrate the historical perspectives of ar splice variant discovery using fundamental molecular biology techniques and how it changed the clinical approach to both therapeutic decisions and strategy. the body of work investigating ar splice variants in pca represents a true example of translational research from bench to bedside.
southern_blotting	transgenic animal have extensive perspective of research and application in field of medicine, life science and biopharmacy. for this reason, scientists have been explored a more convenient and easy, economic and practical, and high-performance transgenic methods. intratesticular injection as a method to transfer foreign gene into sperm can avoid inhibitory factor and complicated dealing of sperm, ensuring fertilization and embryo development. recombinant efficient expression was made from pires2-egfp plasmid backbone by inserting antimicrobial peptide -thanatin sequence constructed into the mcs region. then the linear vector was injected into the testis of the bailai-hang chicken by surgical operation. 268 s were collected, 257 of them were transgenic chicken embryos. pcr and southern blotting results revealed that 160 of them were positive transgenic chicken embryos, and transgenic rate was 59.70%. southern blotting results showed that the foreign gene was integrated in chicken chromosomes with multi-inserted repeat sequences.
northern_blotting	mirnas have emerged as key regulators of gene expression in both plants and animals. these small (generally 21-22 nt) rna molecules, originated from primary ""hairpin"" transcripts, can induce translational suppression or direct mrna cleavage. similar to regular mrnas, the expression of mirnas is highly regulated. their expression pattern could provide critical clues to understanding mirna functions. however, man), previously identified mirna families have multiple paralogous loci. within each family, different members are often closely related and sometimes give rise to identical mirnas. this poses critical challenges in the analysis of individual mirna genes. this chapter describes several methods that are commonly used for mirna expression analysis, including high-throughput sequencing, microarrays, and briefly discusses qrt-pcr, northern blotting, and other approaches used for data validation.
northern_blotting	bsmv (barley stripe mosaic virus) particles were obtained in a pure state from infected host plant tissues of hordeum vulgare. the three genomic parities (alpha, beta and gamma) were amplified by pcr using specific primers for each particle; each was cloned. partial sequence of the alpha, beta and gamma segments was determined for the egyptian isolate of barley stripe mosaic virus (bsmv ae1). alignment of nucleotide sequences with that of other known strains of the virus, bsmv type strains (cv17, nd18 and china), and the generation of phylogenetic trees was performed. a low level of homology was detected comparing 467 bp of the alpha and 643 bp of the segments to that of the other strains, and thus bsmv alpha and beta segments were in separate clusters. however, 1154 bp of the gamma segments of bsmv ae1 showed a high level of homology especially to strain bsmv nd18, as they both formed a distinct cluster. northern blotting of pure bsmv ae1 virus and h. vulgare-infected tissue were compared using an alpha nd18 specific probe. western blotting using antibodies specific for the coat protein (cp) and the triple gene block 1. (tgb1) protein, which are both encoded by the beta nd18 segment, still indicated a high level of similarity between proteins produced by bsmv nd18 and ael we suggest that the bsmv ae1 isolate is a distinct strain of bsmv which reflects the genetic evolutionary divergence among bsmv strains and members of the hordeivirus group.
cell_biology	two articles recently published in nature and nature cell biology reported that early human embryos were successfully cultured beyond blastulation. this development heralds an important step toward exploring the unknown molecular events driving human pregastrulation development, but it inevitably raises the ante in the decades-old ethical debate on how to define early human life and how to save human lives through research without destroying another life in the process. copyright (c) 2016, chongqing medical university. production and hosting by elsevier b.v.
northern_blotting	mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades are signalling modules that transduce extracellular signalling to a range of cellular responses. plant mapk cascades have been implicated in development and stress response. in this study, we isolated a novel group c mapkk gene, zmmkk4, from maize. northern blotting analysis revealed that the zmmkk4 transcript expression was up-regulated by cold, high salt and exogenous h(2)o(2), but down-regulated by exogenous abscisic acid (aba). over-expression of zmmkk4 in arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold and salt stresses by increased germination rate, lateral root numbers, plant survival rate, chlorophyll, proline and soluble sugar contents, and antioxidant enzyme [peroxidase (pod), catalase (cat)] activities compared with control plants. furthermore, zmmkk4 enhanced a 37 kda kinase activity after cold and salt stresses. rt-pcr analysis revealed that the transcript levels of stress-responsive transcription factors and functional genes were higher in zmmkk4-over-expressing plants than in control plants. in addition, zmmkk4 protein is localized in the nucleus. taken together, these results indicate that zmmkk4 is a positive regulator of salt and cold tolerance in plants.
immunology	cellular metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of adaptive immunity. while the metabolic requirements of conventional t cells are increasingly understood, the role of cellular metabolism in foxp3(+) regulatory t (treg) cells is less clear. although it is well accepted that repression of akt/mtor, hif-1 alpha and aerobic glycolysis are important for the efficient generation of treg cells in vitro, clear evidence how these pathways impact on treg-cell development in vivo is limited. furthermore, newer studies have shown that the same pathways that appear to suppress treg-cell development are active in and required for functionally mature treg cells. thus, it becomes increasingly evident that development and function of regulatory t cells require different wiring of metabolic pathways. finally, it is likely that critical differences remain to be uncovered between the metabolism of resting or 'naive' treg cells and those fully differentiated and actively engaged in suppression. in this comment, we briefly discuss our current understanding of treg-cell metabolism and the need to address this area with new approaches based on in vivo models.
southern_blotting	low temperature plays a crucial role in seasonal development of woody plants and may directly impact crop production, more particularly in temperate fruit trees. given its high genetic variability and adaptability to different climatic conditions, almond (prunus dulcis mill.) is an interesting model to understand the mechanisms regulating low temperature sensing in fruit trees. in this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of two genes (pdcbf1 and pdcbf2) belonging to the c-repeat-binding factor (cbf) family of transcription factors. southern blotting analysis showed that this family is composed of at least five members. in almond shoots propagated in vitro, transcription of these genes was rapidly induced by low temperature, suggesting an involvement in cold acclimation. transactivation assays showed that pdcbf1 and pdcbf2 could bind to dehydration responsive element/c-repeat containing sequences, as activators of gene expression. in addition, induction of both pdcbfs by cold was higher towards the end of the day, which agreed with the expression pattern of pddehydrin1, a predicted cbf target gene. furthermore, pdcbf1 and pdcbf2 were also transiently induced by abscisic acid and drought treatments. considering the bin mapping analysis that correlated pdcbfs and pddhn1 (respectively in linkage groups 5 and 7) with two different quantitative trait locicontrolling blooming time, it is relevant to perform further association studies that may validate their effect on this trait.
polymerase_chain_reaction	improvement of cultivar resistance is the key strategy to control the host-specialized pathogen verticillium longisporum in oilseed rape (osr). a special feature of this pathogen is its systemic, non-homogenous and delayed colonization of the plant xylem resulting in an extended symptomless period of latency. as a result, severity of infection in the field is difficult to score as it becomes apparent only at crop maturity stages when it may be confused with natural senescence. assessment of verticillium disease severity in osr by visual scoring of microsclerotia on harvested stubbles unsatisfactorily reflects genotypic resistance as it is strongly affected by the ripening stage of the plant. to overcome these limitations, we developed a qpcr method, which unambiguously differentiates levels of quantitative resistance to v. longisporum in osr genotypes under field conditions. the specificity and sensitivity of two primer pairs targeting its or tubulin loci in the v. longisporum genome were tested. while tubulin primers showed a high specificity to v. longisporum isolates, its primers exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity in detecting fungal dna in stem tissue (limit of quantification =0.56 fg dna) of field-grown pre-symptomatic plants. the best discrimination of resistant and susceptible osr cultivars based on fungal dna analysis in stem tissue was achieved at growth stage 80, at the transition of fungal vascular growth in viable plants to saprotrophic colonization of senescent stem tissues. field screening data obtained with qpcr at growth stage 80 confirmed results from greenhouse testing thus corroborating the relevance and reliability of seedling assays for determining cultivar responses to v. longisporum in the field, as a useful tool for breeders in first selection of elite osr genotypes with improved resistance to verticillium.
enzymology	background/aims: to investigate the feasibility and mechanism of liver damage repair using bmscs, we investigated the potential for bmscs in recovery from liver damage, using the ccl4-induced rat model for liver damage. methodology: phenotypings of bmscs of the third generation were analyzed by flow cytometry. bmscs labelled by brdu were infused via the tail vein of ccl4-induced rat model. the labeling yields observed were detected by flow cytometry and liver samples were taken for immunohistochemistry. concentration changes of ast, alt and akp were observed by a serum enzymology test after transplantation. results: the brdu(+) cells in recipient livers were detected on day 7 after bmscs transplantation and engrafted cells were found in the pen-portal regions of the hepatic lobule and on day 14 more of them spread throughout the lobules. bmscs engraftments were detected on whole hepatic parenchyma. the serum levels of alt, ast and akp in group 3 were all lower than those of group 2 from the 7th to 28th day. conclusions: ex vivo-expanded bmscs were capable of relocating to the chemically-injured liver. transplantation of these pluripotent stem cells appeared to improve serum indices of liver function.
enzymology	now that the centennial anniversary of the first report on pressure denaturation of proteins by nobel laureate p. w. bridgman can be celebrated, this review on the application of high pressure as a key variable for studying the energetics and interactions of proteins appears. we demonstrate that combined temperature-pressure-dependent studies help delineate the free-energy landscape of proteins and elucidate which features are essential in determining their stability. pressure perturbation also serves as an important tool to explore fluctuations in proteins and reveal their conformational substates. from shaping the free-energy landscape of proteins themselves to that of their interactions, conformational fluctuations not only dictate a plethora of biological processes, but are also implicated in a number of debilitating diseases. finally, the advantages of using pressure to explore biomolecular assemblies and modulate enzymatic reactions are discussed.
northern_blotting	since their discovery about 20 years ago, small rnas have been shown to play a critical role in a myriad of biological processes. the greater availability of high-throughput sequencing has been invaluable to furthering our understanding of small rnas as regulatory molecules. in particular, these sequencing technologies have been crucial in understanding the role of small rnas in reproductive tissues, where millions of individual sequences are generated. in this context, high-throughput sequencing provides the requisite level of resolution that other procedures, like northern blotting, would not be able to achieve. here, we describe a protocol for the preparation of small rna libraries for sequencing using the solexa/illumina technology.
southern_blotting	borrelia burgdorferisensu lato infection has been confirmed in clinical cases in the northeast of mexico; however, the bacterium has not been identified as infecting the tick vector ixodes, amblyomma and dermacentor ticks were collected from mammals and plants in northeastern mexico and examined for borrelia. eighteen of 214 ticks were pcr-positive for the fla and 16s rrna genes and 15 for the ospa gene. southern blotting with a fla probe and sequencing of ospa genes confirmed infection with b. burgdorferi sensu stricto. these findings, together with reports of indigenous cases, fulfil the criteria that allow northeastern mexico to be considered as a zone endemic for lyme disease.
enzymology	seven z-octadecenoic acids having the double bond located in positions 6z to 13z were photooxidized. the resulting hydroperoxy-e-octadecenoic acids [hpome(e)] were resolved by chiral phase-hplc-ms, and the absolute configurations of the enantiomers were determined by gas chromatographic analysis of diastereoisomeric derivatives. the ms/ms/ms spectra showed characteristic fragments, which were influenced by the distance between the hydroperoxide and carboxyl groups. these fatty acids were then investigated as substrates of cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1), manganese lipoxygenase (mnlox), and the (8r)-dioxygenase (8r-dox) activities of two linoleate diol synthases (lds) and 10r-dox. cox-1 and mnlox abstracted hydrogen at c-11 of (12z)-18:1 and c-12 of (13z)-18:1. (11z)-18:1 was subject to hydrogen abstraction at c-10 by mnlox and at both allylic positions by cox-1. both allylic hydrogens of (8z)-18:1 were also abstracted by 8r-dox activities of lds and 10r-dox, but only the allylic hydrogens close to the carboxyl groups of (11z)-18:1 and (12z)-18:1. 8r-dox also oxidized monoenoic c-14-c-20 fatty acids with double bonds at the (9z) position, suggesting that the length of the omega end has little influence on positioning for oxygenation. we conclude that cox-1 and mnlox can readily abstract allylic hydrogens of octadecenoic fatty acids from c-10 to c-12 and 8r-dox from c-7 and c-12.-oliw, e. h., a. wennman, i. hoffmann, u. garscha, m. hamberg, and f. jerneren. stereoselective oxidation of regioisomeric octadecenoic acids by fatty acid dioxygenases. j. lipid res. 2011. 52: 1995-2004.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aimsthe aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a real-time pcr technology for microbiological control methods to examine individualized cell therapeutics, an emerging class of pharmaceutical formulations. methods and resultsoligonucleotide primers and hybridization probe for bacterial detection targeting the 16srrna gene were adapted based on nadkarni etal. [microbiology148 (2002) 257]. for detection of yeast and moulds, primers and probe were designed from conserved sequences of the 18srrna gene in this study. the real-time pcr assays were tested on genomic dna of escherichia coli and candida albicans to assess efficiency and linear dynamic range. after successful establishment of robust real-time pcrs, applicability of the assays was evaluated by extracting microbial target dna from cell-based preparations. different commercial dna extraction methods were compared identifying the magna pure dna isolation kit iii as the method of choice. sensitivity was examined for different strains and a detection limit of 10(2)-10(3) cfu per ml in a sample containing similar to 10(6) mammalian cells per ml was achieved. conclusionsthis study reports the successful establishment of two qualitative real-time pcr assays, enabling in general the broad-range detection of microbial contaminants in a cell-based sample matrix. significance and impact of the studyindividualized cell therapeutics tend to have a short shelf life. due to lengthy incubation periods, compendial testing according to current pharmacopoeial guidelines may not be applicable. we report a suitable alternative method upon which future microbiological quality control methods for such products could be based on. however, to implement valid rapid microbiological testing methods using real-time pcr technology, further challenges need to be addressed.
northern_blotting	rearing in darkness slows the time course of the visual cortical critical period, such that at 5 weeks of age normal cats are more plastic than dark-reared cats, while at 20 weeks dark-reared cats are more plastic [mower gd (1991) the effect of dark rearing on the time course of the critical period in cat visual cortex. dev brain res 58:151-158]. thus, genes that are important for visual cortical plasticity should show differences in expression between normal and darkreared visual cortex that are of opposite direction in young versus older animals. previously, we showed by differential display polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting that mrna for munc13-3, a mammalian homologue of the c. elegans uncoordinated (unc) gene, shows such bidirectional regulation in cat visual cortex [yang cb, zheng yt, li gy, mower gd (2002) identification of munc13-3 as a candidate gene for critical period neuroplasticity in visual cortex. j neurosci 22:8614-8618]. here, the analysis is extended to munc13-3protein in mouse visual cortex, which will provide the basis for gene manipulation analysis. in mice, munc13-3 protein was elevated 2.3-fold in dark-reared compared with normal visual cortex at 3.5 weeks and 2.0-fold in normal compared with dark-reared visual cortex at 9.5 weeks. analysis of variance of protein levels showed a significant interaction, indicating that the effect of dark rearing depended on age. this bidirectional regulation was restricted to visual cortex and did not occur in frontal cortex. bidirectional regulation was also specific to munc13-3 and was not found for other munc13 family members. munc13 proteins serve a central priming function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis at glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses and this work contributes to the growing evidence indicating a role of munc13 genes in synaptic plasticity.

human_metabolism	the jet machine and associated facilities require significant maintenance and enhancement installation activities in support of the experimental exploitation programme. a proportion of these activities are within radiological and respiratory hazardous environments. as such, breathing air-fed one-piece pressurised suits provide workers with protection from the inhalation of both airborne tritium and beryllium dust. the design of these suits has essentially developed empirically. there is a practical necessity to improve the design to optimise worker performance, protection and thermal comfort. this paper details the complexity of modeling the three-dimensional thermofluid domain between the inner surface of the suit and under garments that includes mass as well as heat transfer, suiting geometry, human metabolism and respiration and effects of limb movements. the methods used include computational fluid dynamics (cfd), theoretical adaptations of mixed-phase turbulent now, profile scanning of a suit and actuating life size mannequin and data processing of the images and experimental validation trials. the achievements of the current programme and collaborations are presented in the paper and future endeavors are discussed.

molecular_biology	rice stripe virus (rsv) is an insect-borne tenuivirus of economical significance. it is endemic to the rice growing regions of east asia and exhibits more genetic diversity in yunnan province of china. to gain more insights into the molecular epidemiology and evolution of rsv, recombination analyses were conducted and potential events were detected in each of the four rna segments of rsv. bayesian coalescent method was then applied to the time-stamped coding sequences of the cp gene. the nucleotide substitution rate and the divergence time were estimated. age calculations suggested that the first diversification event of the rsv isolates analyzed might take place in the early 20th century, and rsv has existed in yunnan long before notice. surveys of codon usage variation showed that the rsv genes had influences other than mutational bias. in codon choice, rsv conformed to neither vector small brown planthopper nor host rice, although the former exerted a more dominant influence on shaping codon usage pattern of rsv. in addition, cpg dinucleotide deficiency was observed in rsv.

genetics	background: microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancers (crc) that are due to deficient dna mismatch repair (dmmr) represent approximately 15% of all crcs in the united states. these microsatellite-unstable crcs represent a heterogenous group of diseases with distinct oncogenesis pathways. there are overlapping clinicopathologic features between some of these groups, but many important differences are present. therefore, determination of the etiology for the dmmr is vital for proper patient management and follow-up. main body: epigenetic inactivation of mlh1 mmr gene (sporadic microsatellite-unstable crc) and germline mutation in an mmr gene (lynch syndrome, ls) are the two most common mechanisms in the pathogenesis of microsatellite instability in crc. however, in a subset of dmmr crc cases that are identified by screening tests, no known ls-associated genetic alterations are appreciated by current genetic analysis. when the etiology for dmmr is unclear, it leads to patient anxiety and creates challenges for clinical management. conclusion: it is critical to distinguish ls patients from other patients with tumors due to dmmr, so that the proper screening protocol can be employed for the patients and their families, with the goal to save lives while avoiding unnecessary anxiety and costs. this review summarizes the major pathogenesis pathways of dmmr crcs, their clinicopathologic features, and practical screening suggestions. in addition, we include frequently asked questions for mmr immunohistochemistry interpretation.
northern_blotting	a full-length beet black scorch virus (bbsv) cdna clone (pubf52) was constructed by rt-pcr. the clone contains an upstream t7 rna polymerase promoter designed for in vitro transcription of infectious rnas from the linearized plasmid that faithfully represent the viral cdna. leaves of chenopodium amaranticolor inoculated with in vitro transcripts developed the same symptoms and disease phenotype as the wild type virus. the presence of bbsv rna and coat protein in the leaves was confirmed respectively by northern blotting and western blotting. comparisons of specific immunoreactions between the expression product of the bbsv p24 gene in e. coli and antiserum against purified bbsv virions demonstrated that the p24 gene encodes the coat protein. based on the sequence of the pubf52 cdna, a frame-shift mutant and two deletion mutants were generated. one of the deletions encompasses the entire cp orf and the other truncates 174 amino acids from the central region of the protein. transcripts derived from the frame-shift cp mutant, which terminates the cp after the first 23 amino acids, elicited the same symptom phenotype and levels of rna accumulation as the wild type virus, but the leaves infected with the cp deletion mutants exhibited greatly reduced rna accumulation. in addition, leaves inoculated with in vitro transcripts of the mutant in which the entire cp gene was deleted had lower local lesions than wild type virus transcripts. two expression vectors, pbgfp and pbgus, were constructed by fusing the gfp and gus genes to the 23 n-terminal amino acids of the cp gene, respectively. leaves infected with in vitro transcripts of pbgfp and pbgus exhibited expression of gfp and gus proteins as assessed by laser confocal microscopy and histochemical staining, respectively. the high levels of expression of the gfp and gus proteins provide tools that can be used for studies of replication and movement of the virus, and indicate that bbsv has considerable biotechnology potential as a plant virus expression vehicle.
immunology	neutrophil extracellular traps are networks of dna, histones and neutrophil proteins released in response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli. although a component of the innate immune response, nets are implicated in a range of disease processes including autoimmunity and thrombosis. this protocol describes a simple method for canine neutrophil isolation and quantification of nets using a microplate fluorescence assay. blood is collected using conventional venipuncture techniques. neutrophils are isolated using dextran sedimentation and a density gradient using conditions optimized for dog blood. after allowing time for attachment to the wells of a 96 well plate, neutrophils are treated with net-inducing agonists such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate or platelet activating factor. dna release is measured by the fluorescence of a cell-impermeable nucleic acid dye. this assay is a simple, inexpensive method for quantifying net release, but net formation rather than other causes of cell death must be confirmed with alternative methods.
cell_biology	recent advances in the field of immunometabolism support the concept that fundamental processes in t cell biology, such as tcr-mediated activation and t helper lineage differentiation, are closely linked to changes in the cellular metabolic programs. although the major task of the intermediate metabolism is to provide the cell with a constant supply of energy and molecular precursors for the production of biomolecules, the dynamic regulation of metabolic pathways also plays an active role in shaping t cell responses. key metabolic processes such as glycolysis, fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolism are now recognized as crucial players in t cell activation and differentiation, and their modulation can differentially affect the development of t helper cell lineages. in this review, we describe the diverse metabolic processes that t cells engage during their life cycle from nave towards effector and memory t cells. we consider in particular how the cellular metabolism may actively support the function of t cells in their different states. moreover, we discuss how molecular regulators such as mtor or ampk link environmental changes to adaptations in the cellular metabolism and elucidate the consequences on t cell differentiation and function.

polymerase_chain_reaction	chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p), are used in grasslands to maximize plant biomass production for livestock. despite a substantial body of work on how fertilization affects aboveground plant and belowground microbial communities, the short-term response of soil ammonia oxidizing microbial communities, which play the central role in nitrification, to fertilization is not well understood. the responses of ammonia-oxidizing microbial communities to short-term (3 years) n and/or p additions were investigated in an alpine grassland of the qinghai-tibetan plateau. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) analysis of the amoa genes showed that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (aoa) dominated over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (aob) in non-amended soil. short-term urea addition significantly increased the abundance of aob, whereas aoa abundance remained unchanged, resulting in a shift from aoa to aob dominance, which suggests that aob are likely to be more important in the first step of the nitrification following urea amendment. pyrosequencing demonstrated a significant shift in aob but not aoa community composition within short-term n fertilizer plots, indicating that aob community composition was more sensitive than aoa in response to urea amendment. this study demonstrated that the abundance and composition of aoa and aob communities responded differently to 3 years of urea addition, suggesting that n fertilizer may be an important controller of ammonia oxidizing microbial communities in managed alpine grasslands, such as those of the qinghai-tibet plateau.
molecular_biology	oscillators are essential to fuel autonomous behaviours in molecular systems. artificial oscillators built with programmable biological molecules such as dna and rna are generally easy to build and tune, and can serve as timers for biological computation and regulation. we describe a new artificial nucleic acid biochemical reaction network, and we demonstrate its capacity to exhibit oscillatory solutions. this network can be built in vitro using nucleic acids and three bacteriophage enzymes, and has the potential to be implemented in cells. numerical simulations suggest that oscillations occur in a realistic range of reaction rates and concentrations.
immunology	myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs) are immune suppressive cells that are hallmarks of human cancer. mdscs inhibit cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) and nk cell functions to promote tumor immune escape and progression, and therefore are considered key targets in cancer immunotherapy. recent studies determined a key role of the apoptosis pathways in tumor-induced mdsc homeostasis and it is known that ceramide plays a key role in regulation of mammalian cell apoptosis. in this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of ceramide in suppression of mdscs. treatment of tumor-bearing mice with lcl521, a lysosomotropic inhibitor of acid ceramidase, significantly decreased mdsc accumulation in vivo. using a mdsc-like myeloid cell model, we determined that lcl521 targets lysosomes and increases total cellular c16 ceramide level. although mdsc-like cells have functional apoptosis pathways, lcl521-induced mdsc death occurs in an apoptosis-and necroptosis-independent mechanism. lcl521 treatment resulted in an increase in the number of autophagic vesicles, heterolysosomes and swollen ers. finally, concomitant inhibition of cathepsin b and cathepsin d was required to significantly decrease lcl521-induced cell death. our observations indicate that lcl521 targets lysosomes to activate cathepsin b and cathepsin d, resulting in interrupted autophagy and er stress that culminates in mdsc death. therefore, a ceramidase inhibitor is potentially an effective adjunct therapeutic agent for suppression of mdscs to enhance the efficacy of ctl-based cancer immunotherapy.
genetics	the anticipation of ethical issues that may arise with the clinical use of genomic technologies is crucial to envision their future implementation in a manner sensitive to local contexts. yet, populations in low- and middle-income countries are underrepresented in studies that aim to explore stakeholders' perspectives on the use of such technologies. within the framework of a research project entitled ""personalized medicine in the treatment of epilepsy"", we sought to increase inclusiveness by widening the reach of our survey, inviting neurologists from around the world to share their views and practices regarding the use of whole-genome sequencing in clinical neurology and its associated ethics. we discuss herein the compelling scientific and ethical reasons that led us to attempt to recruit neurologists worldwide, despite the lack, in many low- or middle-income countries, of access to genomic technologies. recruitment procedures and their results are presented and discussed, as well as the barriers we faced. we conclude that inclusive recruitment remains a challenging, albeit necessary and legitimate, endeavour.
cell_biology	duckweed can be used for bioremediation of selenium (se) polluted water because of its capability of absorbing minerals from growing media. however, the presence of se in the media may affect the growth of the duckweed. landoltia punctata 7449 has been studied for its changes in chemical and biological properties with the presence of se in the media. the duckweed was cultivated over a 12-day period at different initial concentrations of selenite (na2seo3) from 0 to 80moll(-1). the growth rate, the organic and total se contents, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the photosynthetic pigment contents, the chlorophyll a fluorescence ojip transient, and the ultrastructure of the duckweed were monitored during the experiment. the results have shown that se at low concentrations of 20moll(-1) promoted the growth of the l.punctata and inhibited lipid peroxidation. substantial increases in duckweed growth rate and organic se content in the duckweed were observed at low se concentrations. the anti-oxidative effect occurred likely with the increases in guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities as well as the amount of photosynthetic pigments. however, negative impact to the duckweed was observed when the l.punctata was exposed to high se concentrations (40moll(-1)), in which the duckweed growth was inhibited by the selenium. the results indicate that l.punctata 7449 can be used for bioremediation of selenium (se) polluted water when the se concentration is 20moll(-1).
human_metabolism	background: selenium is an essential element, but its metabolism in humans is not well characterized. a few small studies indicate that the trimethylselenonium ion (tmse) is a common selenium metabolite in humans. objective: this study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of selenium to tmse. design: study individuals constituted subsamples of 2 cohorts: 1) pregnant women (n = 228) and their 5-y-old children (n = 205) in rural bangladesh with poor selenium status [median urinary selenium (u-se): 6.4 mu g/l in mothers, 14 mu g/l in children] and 2) women in the argentinian andes (n = 83) with adequate selenium status (median u-se: 24 mu g/l). total u-se and blood selenium were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icpms), and urinary concentrations of tmse were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/vapor generation/icpms. a genomewide association study (gwas) was performed for 1,629,299 (after filtration) single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the bangladeshi women (n = 72) by using illumina omni5m, and results were validated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: tmse ""producers"" were prevalent (approximately one-third) among the bangladeshi women and their children, in whom tmse constituted similar to 10-70% of u-se, whereas ""nonproducers"" had, on average, 0.59% tmse. the tmse-producing women had, on average, 2-mu g u-se/l higher concentrations than did the nonproducers. in contrast, only 3 of the 83 andean women were tmse producers (6-15% tmse in the urine); the average percentage among the nonproducers was 0.35%. comparison of the percentage of urinary tmse in mothers and children indicated a strong genetic influence. the gwas identified 3 snps in the indolethylamine n-methyltransferase gene (inmt) that were strongly associated with percentage of tmse (p < 0.001, false-discovery rate corrected) in both cohorts. conclusions: there are remarkable population and individual variations in the formation of tmse, which could largely be explained by snps in inmt. the tmse-producing women had higher u-se concentrations than did nonproducers, but further elucidation of the metabolic pathways of selenium is essential for the understanding of its role in human health.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the ability to identify and stratify patients that will respond to specific therapies has been transformational in a number of disease areas, particularly oncology. it is anticipated that this will also be the case for cell-based therapies, particularly in complex and heterogeneous diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (ra). recently, clinical results with expanded allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eascs) have indicated clinical efficacy in highly refractory ra patients. in this study, we set out to determine if circulating micrornas (mirnas) could be identified as potential biomarkers associated with response to eascs in these ra patients. the mirna expression profiles of pre-treatment plasma samples from responder and nonresponder patients were determined using microarrays. ten mirnas were identified that were differentially expressed in the responder group as compared to the nonresponder group. to confirm the differential expression of these 10 mirna biomarkers, they were further assayed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). from this analysis, three mirnas, mir-26b-5p, mir-487b-3p and mir-495-3p, were confirmed as being statistically significantly upregulated in the responder group as compared with the nonresponder group. receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed their diagnostic potential. these mirnas could represent novel candidate stratification biomarkers associated with ra patient response to eascs and are worthy of further clinical validation.
molecular_biology	objective: to provide selectable microrna for intervening diabetes mellitus diseases, nod mice 's expression of microrna in pancreas tissues and blood under the exendin-4 intervention of was observed and the difference of microrna target gene was screened. materials and methods: forty clean nod mice were randomly divided into four groups (in each group, n = 10): one is blank control group d which is intervened with normal saline, and the other three groups were divided into low-dose group a, middle-dose group b, and high-dose group c according to the different exendin- 4 dosage 2, 4, and 8 mu g/kg.d. after the 8-week intervention, these four groups were killed, and the pancreatic tissue and blood were left to prepare specimens for morphology and molecular biology analysis. the specimen with differential expression microrna in pancreas tissue and blood should be screened out after detected with the locked nucleic acid array system (lnatm) microrna expression profile chip. the primers should be designed, and the abi7500 real-time fluorescent quantitative pcr should be applied to amplify, analyze, and verify according to the screen results of the microrna chip in order to screen out the significant differentially expressed microrna. results: histological detection showed that the pancreas of the mice in control group d was fibrosis gradually and the islet frame was relatively disordered and significantly atrophied. groups a, b, and c have no islet hypertrophy or atrophy and the degree of fibrosis of the pancreas has reduced. according to the gene chip detection, there are four significantly differently expressed micrornas in pancreas tissue and blood among the group a, b, and c, among which mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-22 were down-regulated expressed while the mirna-1 was upregulated expressed. bioinformatics analysis showed that the target genes of 4 differentially regulated microrna genes were related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and angiogenesis. the expression of microrna in pancreatic tissue and blood of nod rats was highly consistent. conclusions: microrna expression file of pancreatic tissue and blood can be changed during the intervention of the nod rat model with exendin-4. microrna that indicates the differential expression may take part in the recovering process of the nod pancreatic trauma. at the same time, the administration of exendin- 4 can protect nod mice, reduce its pancreatic tissue fibrosis, and regulate molecular markers of pancreatic cells in size and pancreatic mast cells. this may be one of the main mechanisms of pancreatic injury in diabetes prevention.
immunology	this study examined the effect of resistance exercise on the production, recruitment, percentage, and adhesion characteristics of granulocytes with andwithout polyphenol (ppb) supplementation. thirty-eight untrained men were randomized into three groups: ppb (n=13, 21.8 +/- 2.5 years, 171.2 +/- 5.5cm, 71.2 +/- 8.2kg), placebo (pl; n=15, 21.6 +/- 2.5years, 176.5 +/- 4.9cm, 84.0 +/- 15.7kg), or control (con; n=10, 23.3 +/- 4.3years, 173.7 +/- 12.6cm, 77.3 +/- 16.3kg). blood samples were obtained pre (pre), immediately (ip), 1h (1h), 5h (5h), 24h (24h), 48h (48h), and 96h (96h) postresistance exercise (ppb/pl) or rest (con). fine-needle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis at pre, 1h, 5h, and 48h. plasma concentrations and intramuscular content of interleukin-8 (il-8), granulocyte (g-csf), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) were analyzed via multiplex assays. changes in relative number of circulating granulocytes and adhesion receptor (cd11b) were assessed using flow cytometry. intramuscular il-8 was significantly elevated at 1h, 5h, and 48h (p<0.001). area under the curve analysis indicated a greater intramuscular il-8 content in pl than ppb (p=0.011). across groups, circulating g-csf was elevated from pre at ip (p<0.001), 1h (p=0.011), and 5h (p=0.025), while gm-csf was elevated at ip (p<0.001) and 1h (p=0.007). relative number of granulocytes was elevated at 1h (p<0.001), 5h (p<0.001), and 24h (p=0.005, p=0.006) in ppb and pl, respectively. across groups, granulocyte cd11b expression was upregulated from pre to ip (p<0.001) and 1h (p=0.015). results indicated an increase in circulating cd11b on granulocytes, and il-8 within the muscle following intense resistance exercise. polyphenol supplementation may attenuate the il-8 response, however, did not affect granulocyte percentage and adhesion molecule expression in peripheral blood following resistance exercise.
northern_blotting	mammalian embryonic implantation requires reciprocal interactions between implantation-competent blastocysts and a receptive uterus. some micrornas might play a key role during embryo implantation in the mouse, but the let-7a expression profiles in the rat uterus during peri-implantation are unknown. in the study, the expression of let-7a in the uterus during early pregnancy, pseudopregnancy, artificial decidualization and activation of delayed implantation was detected by northern blotting and in situ hybridization. the effect of steroid hormones on let-7a expression was also detected by northern blotting and in situ hybridization. here, we found that the expression level of let-7a was higher on gestation day 6-7 (g.d. 6-7) in rats than oil g.d.4-5 and g.d.8-9. let-7a was specifically localized in glandular and luminal epithelia and decidua. the expression of let-7a was not significantly different in the pseudopregnant uterus and increased significantly in the uteri of rats subjected to artificial decidualization and activation of delayed implantation. treatment with estradiol-17 beta or progesterone significantly increased let-7a expression. thus, let-7a expression was significantly induced by the process of embryo invasion, and this increased expression level was mainly induced by active blastocysts and decidualization during the window of implantation, implying that let-7a may participate in endometrial decidualization. steroid hormones, estradiol-17 beta or progesterone stimulated let-7a expression.
northern_blotting	plant beta-1, 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development. very little data are available on the expression of rice glucanases both in developmental tissues and under various stresses. in this study, we cloned and characterized twenty-seven rice beta-1, 3-glucanases (osglu) from at total of 71 putative glucanases. the osglu genes were obtained by pcr from a cdna library and were classified into seven groups (group i to vii) according to their dna or amino acid sequence homology. analysis of the expression of the twenty-seven osglu genes by northern blotting revealed that they were differentially expressed in different developmental tissues as well as in response to plant hormones, biotic stress, high salt etc. osglu11 and 27 in group iv were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by sa (5 mm), aba (200 mu m), and m. grisea. osglu1, 10, 11, and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible m. grisea interaction than in compatible one. taken together, our findings suggest that the twenty-seven rice osglu gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in development.
southern_blotting	facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (fshd) is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy. we retrospectively studied three families (two indian, one nepalese) with 12 affected members (male:female-7:5). mean age at onset of weakness was 17.63 + 5.48 years. patients were classified according to muscle groups affected (f-face, s-scapula, h-humeral, pg-pelvic girdle, p-peroneal, a-loss of independent ambulation): fsh-a (2), four fsh (4), sh (3), fsh-pg (2) and one: f (1). progression of weakness was classified as f>s>p>pg in eight cases, s>f>p in one, static in three. eleven patients had electromyographic findings suggestive of myopathy and one had features of neurogenic involvement. molecular diagnosis was done by southern blotting using probe p13e-11 after digestion of genomic dna with ecori and/or ecori/blni for twelve patients and three unaffected relatives. no ecori fragment smaller than 35 kb was seen in unaffected subjects. size of ecori fragment varied between 17 kb to 27 kb in affected subjects and was constant for affected members of the same family. molecular diagnosis by southern blotting has helped to provide genetic counseling for the families.
cell_biology	cell physiology is impaired before protein aggregation and this may be more relevant than inclusions themselves for neurodegeneration. the present study aimed to characterize an animal model to enable the analysis of the cell biology before and after protein aggregation. ten-month-old lewis rats were exposed either to 1 or 2 mg/kg/day of rotenone, delivered subcutaneously through mini-pumps, for one month. hyperphosphorylated tau, alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta peptide and protein carbonylation (indicative of oxidative stress) were evaluated in the hippocampus, substantia nigra and locus coeruleus through immunohistochemistry or western blot. it was found that 2 mg/kg/day rotenone increased amyloid-beta peptide, hyperphosphorytation of tau and alpha-synuclein. rotenone at 1mg/kg/day did not alter protein levels. protein carbonylation remained unchanged. this study demonstrated that aged lewis rats exposed to a low dose of rotenone is a useful model to study cellular processes before protein aggregation, while the higher dose makes a good model to study the effects of protein inclusions.
molecular_biology	background: the industrial workhorse fungus, trichoderma reesei, is typically exploited for its ability to produce cellulase enzymes, whereas use of this fungus for over-expression of other proteins (homologous and heterologous) is still very limited. identifying transformants expressing target protein is a tedious task due to low transformation efficiency, combined with highly variable expression levels between transformants. routine methods for identification include pcr-based analysis, western blotting, or crude activity screening, all of which are time-consuming techniques. to simplify this screening, we have adapted the 2a peptide system from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) to t. reesei to express a readily screenable marker protein that is co-translated with a target protein. the 2a peptide sequence allows multiple independent genes to be transcribed as a single mrna. upon translation, the 2a peptide sequence causes a ""ribosomal skip"" generating two (or more) independent gene products. when the 2a peptide is translated, the ""skip"" occurs between its two c-terminal amino acids (glycine and proline), resulting in the addition of extra amino acids on the c terminus of the upstream protein and a single proline addition to the n terminus of the downstream protein. to test this approach, we have cloned two heterologous proteins on either side of a modified 2a peptide, a secreted cellobiohydrolase enzyme (cel7a from penicillium funiculosum) as our target protein, and an intracellular enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) as our marker protein. using straightforward monitoring of egfp expression, we have shown that we can efficiently monitor the expression of the target cel7a protein. results: co-expression of cel7a and egfp via the fmdv 2a peptide sequence resulted in successful expression of both test proteins in t. reesei. separation of these two polypeptides via the modified 2a peptide was similar to 100% efficient. the cel7a was efficiently secreted, whereas the egfp remained intracellular. both proteins were expressed when cloned in either order, i. e., cel7a-2a-egfp (c2g) or egfp-2a-cel7a (g2c); however, egfp expression and/or functionality were dependent upon the order of transcription. specifically, expression of cel7a was linked to egfp expression in the c2g orientation, whereas expression of cel7a could not be reliably correlated to egfp fluorescence in the g2c construct. whereas egfp stability and/or fluorescence were affected by gene order, cel7a was expressed, secreted, and exhibited the expected functionality in both the g2c and c2g orientations. conclusions: we have successfully demonstrated that two structurally unrelated proteins can be expressed in t. reesei using the fmdv 2a peptide approach; however, the order of the genes can be important. the addition of a single proline to the n terminus of egfp in the c2g orientation did not appear to affect fluorescence, which correlated well with cel7a expression. the addition of 21 amino acids to the c terminus of egfp in the g2c orientation, however, appeared to severely reduce fluorescence and/or stability, which could not be linked with cel7a expression. the molecular biology tool that we have implemented in this study will provide an efficient strategy to test the expression of heterologous proteins in t. reesei, while also providing a novel platform for developing this fungus as an efficient multi-protein-expressing host using a single polycistronic gene expression cassette. an additional advantage of this system is that the co-expressed proteins can be theoretically produced at equimolar ratios, as ( a) they all originate from a single transcript and ( b) unlike internal ribosome entry site ( ires)-mediated polycistronic expression, each cistron should be translated equimolarly as there is no ribosomal dissociation or reloading between cistrons.
polymerase_chain_reaction	a novel three-dimensional dna-aunps network structure amplification strategy was employed to design a lateral flow biosensor by introducing streptavidin coated gold nanoparticles (au-sa) in this paper. they act as amplification probes which aggregate numerous gold nanoparticles (aunps) on test line by forming a threedimensional dna-aunps network structure in the presence of target. sensitive detection of nucleic acid with point-of-care analysis is significant for infectious agent, early diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. the use of these particles in rapid ultrasensitive point of care (poc) lateral flow assays lead to a linear range from 0.1 pm to 250 nm with a limit of detection of 0.01 pm without polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the proposed method could increase the sensitivity by 4 orders of magnitudes than traditional sandwich assays labeled with aunps. furthermore, the assay owns good reproducibility and stability, which will prove practical diagnostic applications.
immunology	the mhc is a highly polymorphic genomic region that encodes the transplantation and immune regulatory molecules. it receives special attention for genetic investigation because of its important role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and its strong association with numerous infectious and/or autoimmune diseases. the mhc locus was first discovered in the mouse and for the past 50 years it has been studied most intensively in both mice and humans. however, in recent years the macaque species have emerged as some of the more important and advanced experimental animal models for biomedical research into mhc with important human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus and transplantation studies undertaken in association with precise mhc genotyping and haplotyping methods using sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing. here, in this special issue on 'macaque immunology' we provide a short review of the genomic similarities and differences among the human, macaque and mouse mhc class i and class ii regions, with an emphasis on the association of the macaque class i region with mhc polymorphism, haplotype structure and function.
cell_biology	purpose of reviewdendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells which link innate and adaptive immunity, through recognition and presentation of antigen to t cells. although the importance of dendritic cells has been demonstrated in many animal models, their contribution to human immunity remains relatively unexplored in vivo.given their central role in infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy, dendritic cell deficiency or dysfunction would be expected to have clinical consequences.recent findingshuman dendritic cell deficiency disorders, related to gata binding protein 2 (gata2) and interferon regulatory factor 8 (irf8) mutations, have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells and monocytes in primary immunodeficiency diseases and begun to shed light on their nonredundant roles in host defense and immune regulation in vivo. the contribution of dendritic cell and monocyte dysfunction to the pathogenesis of primary immunodeficiency disease phenotypes is becoming increasingly apparent. however, dendritic cell analysis is not yet a routine part of primary immunodeficiency disease workup.summarywidespread uptake of dendritic cell/monocyte screening in clinical practice will facilitate the discovery of novel dendritic cell and monocyte disorders as well as advancing our understanding of human dendritic cell biology in health and disease.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the androgen receptor splice variant 7 (ar-v7) is associated with resistance to hormonal therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc). due to limitations of the methods available for ar-v7 analysis, the identification of a reliable detection method may facilitate the use of this biomarker in clinical practice. objective: to confirm ar-v7 as a predictor of resistance to hormonal therapy and develop a new approach to assess ar-v7 by highly sensitive digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddpcr) in plasma-derived exosomal rna. design, setting, and participants: plasma samples were collected from 36 crpc patients before they began second-line hormonal treatment. exosomes were isolated and rna extracted for analysis of ar-v7 by ddpcr. outcome measurements and statistical analysis: the absolute target gene concentration as copies per milliliter (copies/ml) was determined by ddpcr. statistical analyses were performed with spss software (ibm corp., armonk, ny, usa). results and limitations: a total of 26 patients received abiraterone and 10 enzalutamide; 39% of patients were found to be ar-v7 positive (ar-v7(+)). median progression-free survival was significantly longer in ar-v7 negative (ar-v7(-)) versus ar-v7(+) patients (20 vs 3 mo; p < 0.001). overall survival was significantly shorter in ar-v7(+) participants at baseline compared with ar-v7(-) participants (8 mo vs not reached; p < 0.001). conclusions: this study demonstrates that plasma-derived exosomal rna is a reliable source of ar-v7 that can be detected sensitively by ddpcr assay. we also showed that resistance to hormonal therapy may be predicted by ar-v7, making it a clinically relevant biomarker. patient summary: we report a first study on a method for androgen receptor splice variant 7 (ar-v7) detection in rna extracted from cancer cell vesicles released in blood. results confirmed the role of ar-v7 as a predictive biomarker of resistance to hormonal therapy. our assay showed that vesicles are a reliable source of ar-v7 rna and that the method is fast, highly sensitive, and affordable.

northern_blotting	aim: an rna-seq analysis recently identified a 236-nucleotide transcript upstream from mals in salmonella enterica serovar typhi. here, we investigated its molecular characteristics and function. materials & methods: race and northern blotting were used to determine the molecular characteristics of the sequence, and mutagenesis, microarray, immunoblotting and an invasion assay were used to investigate the functions of the transcript. results: the transcript was identified as the mals 5'-untranslated region (utr), which could influence the expression of the flagellar and spi-1 genes and the invasion of hela cells by s. typhi. deletion of bax increased the expression of the invasion genes and the invasive capacity of s. typhi, whereas the expression of the mals 5'-utr reduced the expression of bax. conclusion: the mals 5'-utr reduces the expression of bax and increases the invasive capacity of s. typhi.
molecular_biology	diencephalic defects underlie an array of neurological diseases. previous studies have suggested that retinoic acid (ra) signaling is involved in diencephalic development at late stages of embryonic development, but its roles and mechanisms of action during early neural development are still unclear. here we demonstrate that mice lacking enzymatic activity of the acetyltransferase gcn5 ((gcn5(hat/hat))), which were previously characterized with respect to their exencephalic phenotype, exhibit significant diencephalic expansion, decreased diencephalic ra signaling, and increased diencephalic wnt and shh signaling. using a variety of molecular biology techniques in both cultured neuroepithelial cells treated with a gcn5 inhibitor and forebrain tissue from (gcn5(hat/hat)) embryos, we demonstrate that gcn5, rar alpha/gamma, and the poorly characterized protein tacc1 form a complex in the nucleus that binds specific retinoic acid response elements in the absence of ra. furthermore, ra triggers gcn5-mediated acetylation of tacc1, which results in dissociation of tacc1 from retinoic acid response elements and leads to transcriptional activation of ra target genes. intriguingly, ra signaling defects caused by in vitro inhibition of gcn5 can be rescued through ra-dependent mechanisms that require rar beta. last, we demonstrate that the diencephalic expansion and transcriptional defects seen in (gcn5(hat/hat)) mutants can be rescued with gestational ra supplementation, supporting a direct link between gcn5, tacc1, and ra signaling in the developing diencephalon. together, our studies identify a novel, nonhistone substrate for gcn5 whose modification regulates a previously undescribed, tissue-specific mechanism of ra signaling that is required to restrict diencephalic size during early forebrain development.
cell_biology	pten-induced putative kinase 1 (pink1) was identified initially as a gene upregulated in cancer cells which regulates cellular processes of significance in cancer cell biology, including cell survival, stress resistance and the cell cycle. however, the expression and function of pink1 in non small cell lung cancer (nsclc) has not been determined yet. we demonstrated high pink1 expression in nsclc tumor tissues and cell lines as assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry (ihc) assays. in addition, ihc analysis revealed that pink1 expression was associated with a more invasive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis. furthermore, in vitro studies using upregulation and knockdown of pink1 confirmed that pink1 promoted cell proliferation of nsclc, which might be through as the nf-kb pathway. moreover, we also demonstrated that downregulation of pink1 enhanced cisplatin (cddp)-induced nsclc cell apoptosis. together, our findings indicate that pink1 plays a significant role in nsclc progression and chemoresistance, and highlights its potential role as a target in future anticancer therapies.
polymerase_chain_reaction	chinese tallow (sapium sebiferum l.) is a promising landscape and bioenergy plant. measuring gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) can provide valuable information on gene function. stably expressed reference genes for normalization are a prerequisite for ensuring the accuracy of the target gene expression level among different samples. however, the reference genes in chinese tallow have not been systematically validated. in this study, 12 candidate reference genes (185, gapdh, ubq, rps15, sand, tip41, 60s, act7, pdf2, apt, tbp and tub) were investigated with qrt-pcr in 18 samples, including those from different tissues, from plants treated with sucrose and cold stresses. the data were calculated with four common algorithms, genorm, bestkeeper, normfinder, and the delta cycle threshold (delta ct). tip41 and gapdh were the most stable for the tissue-specific experiment, gapdh and 60s for cold treatment, and gapdh and ubq for sucrose stresses, while the least stable genes were 60s, tip41, and 18s respectively. the comprehensive results showed apt, gapdh, and ubq to be the top-ranked stable genes across all the samples. the stability of 60s was the lowest during all experiments. these selected reference genes were further validated by comparing the expression profiles of the chalcone synthase gene in chinese tallow in different samples. the results will help to improve the accuracy of gene expression studies in chinese tallow.
genetics	background: hereditary vitamin d-resistant rickets (hvdrr) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the vitamin d receptor (vdr) gene. variable phenotypes have been associated with these mutations, and some of these were linked to the effects they have on the interacting partners of vdr, mainly the retinoic x receptor (rxr). methods: we examined four patients with hvdrr from three unrelated lebanese families. all parents were consanguineous with normal phenotype. we used sanger sequencing to identify mutations in the coding exons of vdr. results: two homozygous mutations (p.r391s and p.h397p), both in exon 9 of the vdr gene, were identified. phenotype/genotype association was not possible even for the same mutation. alopecia was seen only with the p.r391s mutation. despite a comparable rachitic bone disease, the patients showed different responsiveness to large doses of alfacalcidol (1-alpha-hydroxy vitamin d3) supplementation. conclusions: this is the first report of vdr mutations in lebanon with promising clinical outcomes despite the severity of the phenotypes.
polymerase_chain_reaction	gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the digestive tract, with an incidence of 1.1 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year. a group of experts from the spanish society of pathology and the spanish society of oncology met to discuss a brief update on gists and agree on aspects relating to the pathological and molecular diagnosis of these tumors. gists are generally solitary, well-circumscribed lesions of variable size (< 10 mm-35 cm) that may present with intra- or extra-luminal parietal growth or a mixed-type (hourglass) growth pattern. histologically, they are unencapsulated neoplasms displaying expansive growth and spindle-shaped (70%), epithelioid (20%), or mixed cellularity (10%). mitotic activity is generally moderate or low and should be evaluated only in areas with high cellularity or higher mitotic frequency. the great majority of gists harbour mutually exclusive activating mutations in genes coding for the type iii receptor tyrosine kinases kit and pdgfra; less commonly, gists have also been reported to display mutations elsewhere, including braf and nf1 and sdh-complex genes. the method most widely used to detect kit and pdgfra mutations is amplification of the exons involved by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing (sanger method) of these amplification products. molecular analyses should always specify the type of analysis performed, the region or mutations evaluated, and the sensitivity of the detection method employed.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the function of rhog, a rac1 activator, was explored in the ovary during ovarian follicular development and pathological conditions. with the help of immunoblotting and immunolocalization, we determined the expression and localization of rhog in normal (estrous cycle) and polycystic ovaries using sprague dawley (sd) rat model. employing polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, we analyzed the transcript and expression levels of downstream molecules of rhog, dock1, and rac1 in the polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) ovary along with normal antral follicular theca and granulosa cells after dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) supplementation. the effect of rhog knockdown on dock1, vav, and rac1 expression was evaluated in the human ovarian cells (skov3), theca cells, and granulosa cells from sd rats with the help of flow cytometry. oocyte at secondary follicles along with stromal cells showed optimal expression of rhog. immunoblotting of rhog revealed its maximum expression at diestrus and proestrus, which was downregulated at estrus stage. mild immunostaining of rhog was also present in the theca and granulosa cells of the secondary and antral follicles. polycystic ovary exhibited weak immunostaining for rhog and that was corroborated by immunoblotting-based investigations. rhog effectors dock1 and elmo1 were found reduced in the ovary in pcos condition/dhea. rhog silencing reduced the expression of dock1 and rac1 in the theca and granulosa cells from sd rat antral follicles and that was mirrored in the human ovarian cells. collectively, rhog can mediate signaling through downstream effectors dock1 and rac1 during ovarian follicular development (theca and granulosa cells and oocyte), but dhea downregulated them in the pcos ovary.
enzymology	. background: a key feature of factorixa is its allosteric transformation from an enzymatically latent form into a potent procoagulant. although several small molecules have been found to be capable of partially affecting fixa function (i.e. ethylene glycol, ca2+, and low molecular weight heparin [lmwh]), the resulting modest changes in peptidolytic activity have made the study of their mechanisms of action challenging. as these effects provide hints about potential regulatory forces that may be operational in the full expression of fixa coagulant activity, their description remains of great interest. studies of crystal structures have yielded insights into the structural changes induced by these effectors, but there remains a paucity of information to correlate any given structural change with specific consequences for fixa function.objectives: to correlate structural changes induced by these modulators with defined consequences for fixa substrate discrimination and function.methods: a peptidomics-based mass spectrometry (ms) approach was used to examine the patterns of hydrolysis of four combinatorial chemistry-derived pentapeptide libraries by fixa under various conditions in a soluble, active enzyme system.results: ethylene glycol specifically altered the s3 subsite of fixa to render it more tolerant to side chains at the p3 substrate position, whereas ca2+ enhanced tolerance at the s2 subsite. in contrast, lmwh altered both the s2 and s1' subsites.conclusions: these results demonstrate the role of plasticity in regulating fixa function with respect to discrimination of extended substrate sequences, as well as providing crucial insights into active site modulations that may be capitalized on by various physiologic cofactors of fixa and in future drug design.
molecular_biology	the construction of physical three-dimensional (3d) models of biomolecules can uniquely contribute to the study of the structure-function relationship. 3d structures are most often perceived using the two-dimensional and exclusively visual medium of the computer screen. converting digital 3d molecular data into real objects enables information to be perceived through an expanded range of human senses, including direct stereoscopic vision, touch, and interaction. such tangible models facilitate new insights, enable hypothesis testing, and serve as psychological or sensory anchors for conceptual information about the functions of biomolecules. recent advances in consumer 3d printing technology enable, for the first time, the cost-effective fabrication of high-quality and scientifically accurate models of biomolecules in a variety of molecular representations. however, the optimization of the virtual model and its printing parameters is difficult and time consuming without detailed guidance. here, we provide a guide on the digital design and physical fabrication of biomolecule models for research and pedagogy using open source or low-cost software and low-cost 3d printers that use fused filament fabrication technology.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: to quantify cell free fetal dna (cffdna) with fetal specific epigenetic marker, hypermethylated rassf1a, in maternal plasma of normal pregnant women from 20 weeks of gestation and to assess its relationship with maternal age, height, pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (bmi). methods: hundred normal pregnant women within the gestational age of 21-40 weeks were randomly selected and grouped into five (n = 20). group 1: 21-24, group 2: 25-28, group 3: 29-32, group 4: 33-36 and group 5: 37-40 weeks. maternal plasma dna was extracted, digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, bstui and the fetal specific dna (cffdna) was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). results: the mean hypermethylated rassf1a concentrations in different gestational groups were group 1: 30.1 +/- 14.9, group 2: 52.6 +/- 22.18, group 3: 93.2 +/- 19.08, group 4: 172.8 +/- 26.81 and group 5: 337.8 +/- 52.9 copies/ml. pearson 's correlation analysis showed highly significant positive correlation between cffdna and gestational age (r = 0.899, p < 0.001). bmi was also found to be positively related to cffdna (r = 0.217, p < 0.05). however, it did not show any correlation with maternal age, height and pre-pregnancy weight. conclusions: the gestational age-dependent increase of hypermethylated rassf1a; the fetal specific epigenetic marker in maternal plasma was demonstrated, in an indian study group of normal pregnant women. findings would form the basis of future studies involving pregnancy complications that would aid in the early diagnosis of placental pathologies with hypermethylated rassf1a.
northern_blotting	biological functions of globo-series glycosphingolipids are not well understood. in this study, murine cdnas of two glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of globo-series glycolipids and mrna expression of those genes were analyzed. distribution of their products was also analyzed. murine cdnas for gb3/cd77 synthase and gb4 synthase predicted that both of them are type ii membrane proteins with 348 and 331 amino acids, respectively. in northern blotting, gb3/cd77 synthase gene was mainly expressed in kidney and lung but also detected in many other tissues. gb4 synthase was expressed in brain, heart, kidney, liver, skin, and testis. in the immunohistological analysis, gb3/cd77 was mainly expressed in the proximal tubules as revealed with coincidental expression with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace). in spleen, it was detected in pre-b cells in the peripheral region of the white pulp, as suggested with coincidental expression with cd10. it was also expressed on the endothelia of the alveolar capillaries in lung and on the sebaceous ducts aside of the hair follicles. gb4 was also detected mainly on the proximal tubules in kidney and on the endothelia of the alveolar capillaries in lung as gb3/cd77. but it was also detected on the epithelium of the bronchus, seminiferous tubules and tails of spermatozoa in testis, blood vessels of choroids plexus and endothelial cells in brain, and central and hepatoportal veins in liver. the expression patterns of two genes and their products almost corresponded with some exception. the results would provide essential information for the functional studies of globo-series glycolipids.
northern_blotting	recent studies in our laboratories have shown that protein kinase c delta (pkc delta) is essential for insulin-induced glucose transport in skeletal muscle, and that insulin rapidly stimulates pkc delta activity skeletal muscle. the purpose of this study was to examine mechanisms of regulation of pkc delta protein availability. studies were done on several models of mammalian skeletal muscle and utilized whole cell lysates of differentiated myotubes. pkc delta protein levels were determined by western blotting techniques, and pkc delta rna levels were determined by northern blotting, rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr. insulin stimulation increased pkc delta protein levels in whole cell lysates. this effect was not due to an inhibition by insulin of the rate of pkc delta protein degradation. insulin also increased 35 s-methionine incorporation into pkc delta within 5-15 min. pretreatment of cells with transcription or translation inhibitors abrogated the insulin-induced increase in pkc delta protein levels. we also found that insulin rapidly increased the level of pkc delta rna, an effect abolished by inhibitors of transcription. the insulin-induced increase in pkc delta expression was not reduced by inhibition of either p13 kinase or map kinase, indicating that these signaling mechanisms are not involved, consistent with insulin activation of pkc delta. studies on cells transfected with the pkc delta promoter demonstrate that insulin activated the promoter within 5 min. this study indicates that the expression of pkc delta may be regulated in a rapid manner during the course of insulin action in skeletal muscle and raise the possibility that pkc delta may be an immediate early response gene activated by insulin.

immunology	background: fractional exhaled nitric oxide (feno) is a safe and convenient test for assessing t(h)2 airway inflammation, which is potentially useful in the management of patients with chronic cough. objective: to summarize the current evidence on the diagnostic usefulness of feno for predicting inhaled corticosteroid (ics) responsiveness in patients with chronic cough. methods: a systematic literature review was conducted to identify articles published in peer-reviewed journals up to february 2015, without language restriction. we included studies that reported the usefulness of feno (index test) for predicting ics responsiveness (reference standard) in patients with chronic cough (target condition). the data were extracted to construct a 2 3 2 accuracy table. study quality was assessed with quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2. results: we identified 5 original studies (2 prospective and 3 retrospective studies). we identified considerable heterogeneities in study design and outcome definitions, and thus were unable to perform a meta-analysis. the proportion of ics responders ranged from 44% to 59%. sensitivity and specificity ranged from 53% to 90%, and from 63% to 97%, respectively. the reported area under the curve ranged from about 0.60 to 0.87; however, studies with a prospective design and a lower prevalence of asthma had lower area under the curve values. none measured placebo effects or objective cough frequency. conclusions: we did not find strong evidence to support the use of feno tests for predicting ics responsiveness in chronic cough. further studies need to have a randomized, placebo-controlled design, and should use validated measurement tools for cough. standardization would facilitate the development of clinical evidence.

southern_blotting	the lepidopteran ostrinia furnacalis is one of the most serious pests of maize production. the cry1c proteins are group of bacillus thuringiensis (bt) proteins that are toxic to the intestine of insects. overexpression of cry1c protein has led to increased resistance to lepidopteran pests in several crops. in the present study, the synthetic cry1c* gene that was previously tested in rice was introduced into maize hi-ii genotypes via biolistic gun-mediated transformation. a total of nine independent putative callus were obtained and 87 transgenic plants were positive with cry1c* according to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. three highly insect-resistant transgenic plants, zmkc-2-3, zmkc-3-2, and zmkc-3-5, were further confirmed by pcr analysis, field assessment, and genomic southern blotting in the t-3 generations. insect bioassays were conducted in both the field and the laboratory, and showed that progeny of the three transgenic lines were significantly resistant to lepidopteran maize pests during the whole development and growth period. the stable integration and expression of the cry1c* in the three transgenic plants' progeny were confirmed by reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (elisa) methods. hybrids were produced by crossing transgenic line zmkc-2-3 with the elite inbred line zheng58. there was small variation among the hybrids and backcross offspring, indicating that these cry1c* transgenic lines can be used to produce insect-resistant hybrids and served as insect-resistant sources for the development of bt maize.
molecular_biology	fibrolamellar carcinoma is a unique type of hepatocellular carcinoma with a distinctive predilection for young patients without underlying liver disease, characteristic large neoplastic cells with intervening, dense fibrosis, co-expression of keratin 7 and cd68 and activation of protein kinase a (most often by formation of dnajbi-prkaca). fibrolamellar carcinoma has a similar prognosis to conventional hepatocellular carcinomas arising in non-cirrhotic livers. the current american joint cancer committee staging system does not provide optimal stratification of patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma and an alternate systems should be considered in the future. the only effective treatment for fibrolamellar carcinoma is complete resection. novel therapies may be on the horizon as investigation into the molecular biology of fibrolamellar carcinoma continues.

southern_blotting	cotyledons from 8-day-old seedlings of lotus corniculatus were transformed with a gene encoding the avian influenza (h5n1) hemagglutinin (ha) under the control of the camv35s promoter along with matrix attachment regions using agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the ha gene was detected in genomic dna from transformed plants by pcr and southern blotting. immunoblot analysis of the plant-derived protein revealed the presence of the avian influenza (h5n1) ha. the elisa results showed that the maximum expression level of the ha protein is up to 0.00786% of the total soluble protein. this is the first report of successful expression of the avian influenza (h5n1) ha in transgenic l. corniculatus, cultivar leo.
southern_blotting	a full-length citrate synthase gene designated magcs was isolated from a banana fruit cdna library, which contained a 1885 bp fragment carrying a 1542 bp open reading frame (orf) that encodes a 513 amino acid protein. magcs includes the glyoxysomal targeting signal pst2, an oxaloacetic acid binding site and a citrate synthase active site. southern blotting showed that the banana genome has two copies of magcs. magcs is constitutively expressed in all organs with high levels in the fruit and the lowest levels in the leaves. with natural ripening, the magcs expression pattern was similar to that of ethylene production and respiration rate. magcs expression could be induced by ethylene and inhibited by the ethylene receptor inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-mcp), which is in accordance with ripening-related ethylene synthesis and respiration rate, and demonstrates that magcs is associated with ethylene biosynthesis. oxaloacetic acid (oa) accelerated fruit ripening, and in contrast, citric acid (ca) delayed it. the expression of magcs, the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc) oxidase gene 1 (maaco1, aj223232) and the acc synthase gene i (maacs1, ab021906) was evaluated by real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr), which showed that the expression of magcs, maaco1, and maacs1 were greatly improved by oa and suppressed by ca. these results indicate that magcs plays an important role in postharvest banana fruit ripening, and that oa and ca could affect fruit ripening. this effect on climacteric ethylene and ripening progress was due to the regulation of magcs, maaco1, and maacs1 expression.

genetics	sweet chestnut is a tree of great economic (fruit and wood production), ecological, and cultural importance in europe. a large-scale landscape genetic analysis of natural populations of sweet chestnut across europe is applied to (1) evaluate the geographic patterns of genetic diversity, (2) identify spatial coincidences between genetic discontinuities and geographic barriers, and (3) propose certain chestnut populations as reservoirs of genetic diversity for conservation and breeding programs. six polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for genotyping 1608 wild trees sampled in 73 european sites. the geostatistical idw technique (arcgis 9.3) was used to produce maps of genetic diversity parameters (he, ar, par) and a synthetic map of the population membership (q value) to the different gene pools. genetic barriers were investigated using barrier 2.2 software and their locations were overlaid on a digital elevation model (gtopo30). the diva-gis software was used to propose priority areas for conservation. high values of genetic diversity (he) and allelic richness (ar) were observed in the central area of c. sativa 's european distribution range. the highest values of private allelic richness (par) were found in the eastern area. three main gene pools and a significant genetic barrier separating the eastern from the central and western populations were identified. areas with high priority for genetic conservation were indicated in georgia, eastern turkey, and italy. our results increase knowledge of the biogeographic history of c. sativa in europe, indicate the geographic location of different gene pools, and identify potential priority reservoirs of genetic diversity.
cell_biology	background: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by bacteria and their virulence factors. bortezomib (btz) is the first proteasome inhibitor for clinical treatment of malignancies. its anticancer activity is accompanied by an anti-inflammatory effect. however, there are few reports about its anti-inflammatory effect and underlying mechanism in periodontal disease, especially on human periodontal ligament cells (hpdlcs), which are considered a promising cell-based therapy for treating periodontitis. methods: hpdlcs were treated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) and pre-treated with btz. mrna and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6, and il-8 were determined. the anti-inflammatory mechanism of btz was studied. further, experimental rat periodontitis was induced with ligature and lps injection, and simultaneously and locally treated with btz (three injections/week). four weeks after treatment, microcomputed tomography, immunohistochemical, and histopathologic analyses were performed. results: bortezomib administration at safe concentrations (<= 1 nm) inhibited production of proinflammatory cytokines in lps-stimulated hpdlcs via nuclear factor (nf)-kappa b, p38/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein-1 pathways. moreover, in the lps and ligature-induced periodontitis rat model, btz suppressed expression of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, and il-8, reduced the ratio of receptor activator of nf-kappa b ligand/osteoprotegerin, and prevented alveolar bone absorption. conclusion: these findings demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity of btz against periodontal inflammatory response and present btz as a promising therapy for periodontal disease.
southern_blotting	the intragenomic distribution of five retrotransposon families (297, 1731, copia, mdg1 and roo) in the species of the melanogaster complex was studied by comparing results of the southern blotting technique in males and females with those of in situ hybridization. the degree of structural polymorphism of each family in the different species was also investigated by restriction enzyme analysis. it was found that genomic distribution is a trait that depends on the family and species. the distribution of roo is mainly euchromatic in the four species and 1731 is heterochromatic, but the distribution of families 297, copia and mdg1 is markedly different in the melanogaster and simulans clades. these families were mainly euchromatic in d. melanogaster but heterochromatic in its sibling species. in the simulans clade most copia and mdg1 elements are located on chromosome y. differences in genomic distribution are unrelated with structural conservation. the relation of intragenomic distribution to phylogeny, transpositional activity and the role of the host genome are discussed.
genetics	was the 1993/1994 fatal canine distemper virus (cdv) epidemic in lions and spotted hyaenas in the serengeti ecosystem caused by the recent spillover of a virulent domestic dog strain or one well adapted to these noncanids? we examine this question using sequence data from 13 serengeti' strains including five complete genomes obtained between 1993 and 2011. phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses reveal that strains from noncanids during the epidemic were more closely related to each other than to those from domestic or wild canids. all noncanid serengeti' strains during the epidemic encoded: (1) one novel substitution g134s in the cdv-v protein; and (2) therare amino acid combination 519i/549h at two sites under positive selection in the region of the cdv-h protein that binds to slam (cd 150) host cell receptors. worldwide, only a few noncanid strains in the america ii lineage encode cdv-h 519i/549h. all canid serengeti' strains during the epidemic coded cdv-v 134g, and cdv-h 519r/549y, or 519r/549h. a functional assay of cell entry revealed the highest performance by cdv-h proteins encoding 519i/549h in cells expressing lion slam receptors, and the highest performance by proteins encoding 519r/549y, typical of dog strains worldwide, in cells expressing dog slam receptors. our findings are consistent with an epidemic in lions and hyaenas caused by cdv variants better adapted to noncanids than canids, but not with the recent spillover of a dog strain. our study reveals a greater complexity of cdv molecular epidemiology in multihost environments than previously thought.
southern_blotting	spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (sca31) is defined by the presence of an insertion mutation containing a tggaa repeat within the intron of the brain-expressed, associated with nedd4 (bean) gene. detecting this mutation is conventionally done by southern blotting or dna sequencing, but these methods are technically demanding and not easily implemented in clinical diagnosis. here, we adapted repeat-primed pcr (rp-pcr) to develop a clinical genetic test for sca31 using only the pcr process to detect the tggaa repeat within the insertion mutation. pentanucleotide rp-pcr and subsequent dna fragment analysis demonstrated characteristic ladder peaks with a 5-bp periodicity, originating from the tggaa repeat, in 100% of samples (n = 14) from sca31 patients in whom the presence of the tggaa repeat had been verified by dna sequencing. no peaks were observed in a normal control and two non-sca31 patients, in whom the tggaa repeat was absent. this method is valuable for genetic diagnosis of sca31 in clinical practice. journal of human genetics (2012) 57, 807-808; doi:10.1038/jhg.2012.112; published online 20 september 2012
molecular_biology	background: hpv-16 modifies the overall survival (os) of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (opscc). hpv-16 has been established as risk factor for opscc, but hpv-16 infection may also reside in the larynx and oral cavity. we evaluated hpv-16 status on os of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) patients. methods: hpv-16 infection was confirmed by amplification of e6 and e7 viral oncogenes through pcr assay and e6 ihc in 185 hnscc samples. associations between hpv-16 status and clinicopathological parameters were performed using fisher 's exact test and x(2). survival analysis was completed using kaplan-meier estimator and multivariate cox regression analysis. results: os of hpv-16 positive patients was longer compared to hpv-16 negative patients (p = 0.002). hpv-16 positive tumors of the larynx (lscc) and pharynx (pscc) showed improved os compared to hpv-16 negative tumors. also, hpv-16 positive patients exposed to radiotherapy presented a better survival. conclusions: hpv-16 status has a positive prognostic value in hnscc. addition of hpv-16 status to the tnm staging can provide better assessment in prognosis and guide treatment for hnscc patients.
immunology	the objective of this study was to assess the immune and stress responsiveness of cows identified as extremely high and low feed conversion efficiency phenotypes. the study utilised 16 holstein-friesian cows in their third to fourth lactation, and identified as having either extremely high (n = 8) or extremely low (n = 8) feed conversion efficiency. a commercial vaccine was used to induce measurable antibody-and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses and assess general immune responsiveness. stress responsiveness was assessed by measuring changes in plasma cortisol concentrations in response to yarding and handling. no significant differences in antibody-or cell-mediated immune responsiveness were observed between the extreme high and low feed conversion efficiency phenotypes (p = 0.343 and 0.546, respectively). however, results suggested that plasma cortisol concentrations trended higher in the low feed conversion efficiency phenotype cows than their high feed conversion efficiency counterparts (p = 0.079) 48 h post-yarding and handling. a significant negative correlation was observed between antibody-mediated immune responsiveness and stress responsiveness (r = -0.44, p = 0.043) but not with cell-mediated immune responsiveness (r = 0.135, p = 0.309). this study provides preliminary evidence that cows selected for feed conversion efficiency may have improved stress-coping abilities and immune responsiveness.
southern_blotting	background: hyperthermia plays an important role in cancer therapy. however, as with radiation, it can cause dna damage and therefore genetic instability. we studied whether hyperthermia can induce gene amplification in cancer cells and explored potential underlying molecular mechanisms. materials and methods: (1) hyperthermia: hct116 colon cancer cells received water-submerged heating treatment at 42 or 44 degrees c for 30 min; (2) gene amplification assay using n-(phosphoacetyl)-l-aspartate (pala) selection of cabamyl-p-synthetase, aspartate transcarbarmylase, dihydro-orotase (cad) gene amplified cells; (3) southern blotting for confirmation of increased cad gene copies in pala-resistant cells; (4) gamma h2ax immunostaining to detect gamma h2ax foci as an indication for dna double strand breaks. results: (1) heat exposure at 42 or 44 degrees c for 30 min induces gene amplification. the frequency of cad gene amplification increased by 2.8 and 6.5 folds respectively; (2) heat exposure at both 42 and 44 degrees c for 30 min induces dna double strand breaks in hct116 cells as shown by gamma h2ax immunostaining. conclusion: this study shows that heat exposure can induce gene amplification in cancer cells, likely through the generation of dna double strand breaks, which are believed to be required for the initiation of gene amplification. this process may be promoted by heat when cellular proteins that are responsible for checkpoints, dna replication, dna repair and telomere functions are denatured. to our knowledge, this is the first study to provide direct evidence of hyperthermia induced gene amplification.

molecular_biology	when living organisms independently invade a new environment, the evolution of similar phenotypic traits is often observed. an interesting but contentious issue is whether the underlying molecular biology also converges in the new habitat. independent invasions of tropical intertidal zones by woody plants, collectively referred to as mangrove trees, represent some dramatic examples. the high salinity, hypoxia, and other stressors in the new habitatmight have affected both genomic features and protein structures. here, we developed a new method for detecting convergence at conservative sites (ccs) and applied it to the genomic sequences of mangroves. in simulations, the ccs method drastically reduces random convergence at rapidly evolving sites as well as falsely inferred convergence caused by the misinferences of the ancestral character. in mangrove genomes, we estimated similar to 400 genes that have experienced convergence over the background level of convergence in the nonmangrove relatives. the convergent genes are enriched in pathways related to stress response and embryo development, which could be important for mangroves' adaptation to the new habitat.
enzymology	halogenated pyrroles (halopyrroles) are common chemical moieties found in bioactive bacterial natural products. the halopyrrole moieties of mono-and dihalopyrrole-containing compounds arise from a conserved mechanism in which a proline-derived pyrrolyl group bound to a carrier protein is first halogenated and then elaborated by peptidic or polyketide extensions. this paradigm is broken during the marine pseudoalteromonad bacterial biosynthesis of the coral larval settlement cue tetrabromopyrrole (1), which arises from the substitution of the proline-derived carboxylate by a bromine atom. to understand the molecular basis for decarboxylative bromination in the biosynthesis of 1, we sequenced two pseudoalteromonas genomes and identified a conserved four-gene locus encoding the enzymes involved in its complete biosynthesis. through total in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis of 1 using purified enzymes and biochemical interrogation of individual biochemical steps, we show that all four bromine atoms in 1 are installed by the action of a single flavin-dependent halogenase: bmp2. tetrabromination of the pyrrole induces a thioesterase-mediated offloading reaction from the carrier protein and activates the biosynthetic intermediate for decarboxylation. insights into the tetrabrominating activity of bmp2 were obtained from the high-resolution crystal structure of the halogenase contrasted against structurally homologous halogenase mpy16 that forms only a dihalogenated pyrrole in marinopyrrole biosynthesis. structure-guided mutagenesis of the proposed substrate- binding pocket of bmp2 led to a reduction in the degree of halogenation catalyzed. our study provides a biogenetic basis for the biosynthesis of 1 and sets a firm foundation for querying the biosynthetic potential for the production of 1 in marine (meta) genomes.
northern_blotting	the study of microrna (mirna), a component of low molecular weight rna (lmw rna), has received increasing attention in recent years. a critical prerequisite in mirna studies is acquisition of high quality lmw rna. lmw rna is generally obtained from total rna or from total nucleic acids solutions. most traditional methods for lmw rna isolation involve many steps and chemical reagents which upon degradation may negatively affect results. we employed a simple and quick method involving trizol for total rna extraction from citrus tissues, then generation of lmw rna using 4m licl, which have been successfully utilized in studies in our laboratory. compared with traditional methods, this method is less expensive and produced high rna yields while avoiding the use of phenol or other toxic reagents. in addition, the entire procedure can be completed within 4 hours with many samples being processed simultaneously. therefore, this is a practical and efficient method for lmw rna extraction from woody fruit crops containing high levels of polysaccharide and polyphenolics. using the extracted lmw rna, mirnas were successfully detected and characterized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and northern blotting.
immunology	adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to improve their immunogenicity. used for more than 80years, aluminum, the first adjuvant in human vaccines, proved insufficient to develop vaccines that could protect against new challenging pathogens such as hiv and malaria. new adjuvants and new combinations of adjuvants (adjuvant systems) have opened the door to the delivery of improved and new vaccines against re-emerging and difficult pathogens. adjuvant systems concept started through serendipity. the access to new developments in technology, microbiology and immunology have been instrumental for the dicephering of what they do and how they do it. this knowledge opens the door to more rational vaccine design with implications for developing new and better vaccines.
molecular_biology	life is so remarkable, and so unlike any other physical system, that it is tempting to attribute special factors to it. physics is founded on the assumption that universal laws and principles underlie all natural phenomena, but is it far from clear that there are 'laws of life' with serious descriptive or predictive power analogous to the laws of physics. nor is there (yet) a 'theoretical biology' in the same sense as theoretical physics. part of the obstacle in developing a universal theory of biological organization concerns the daunting complexity of living organisms. however, many attempts have been made to glimpse simplicity lurking within this complexity, and to capture this simplicity mathematically. in this paper we review a promising new line of inquiry to bring coherence and order to the realm of biology by focusing on 'information' as a unifying concept.
polymerase_chain_reaction	caspian horse, a rare horse breed found in 1965 by louise firouz in northern iran, is a small horse which is reported to be in danger of extinction in its original homeland. there seems to be a great need to prevent extinction of this valuable horse. in this study, 51 fibroblast cell lines from caspian horse ear marginal tissue were successfully established by sampling 60 horses using primary explant technique. cells were authenticated and growth curve was plotted. according to results obtained, population doubling time (pdt) was calculated 23 +/- 0.5 h for all cell lines. multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex pcr) revealed that cell lines had no cross-contamination with other species. bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma contamination were checked using standard methods such as pcr, direct culture, and hoechst staining. in addition to providing a valuable source for genomic, postgenomic, and somatic cloning researches, the established cell lines would preserve caspian horse genetic resources. it will also create an accessible database for researchers.
enzymology	background: recently, the concept of recurrent implantation failure (rif) in assisted reproductive technology has been enlarged. chronic uterine inflammation is a known cause of implantation failure and is associated with high matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activity in uterine cavity flushing. mmp activity of women with rif has been reported to be higher than that of fertile women. in the present retrospective study we evaluated the efficacy of treatment for high mmp activity in the uterine cavity of patients with rif. methods: of the 597 patients recruited to the study, 360 patients underwent mmp measurements and 237 patients did not (control group). all patients had failed to become pregnant, despite at least two transfers of good-quality embryos. gelatinase mmp-2 and mmp-9 activity in uterine flushing fluid was detected by enzymology (mmp test). all samples were classified into two groups (positive or negative) based on the intensity of the bands on the enzyme zymogram, which represents the degree of mmp activity. patients who tested positive on the initial test were treated for 2 weeks with a quinolone antibiotic and a corticosteroid, and subsequently underwent a second mmp test. negative results on the second mmp tests after treatment and subsequent rates of pregnancy and miscarriage were used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. data were analyzed by the mann-whitney u-test and the chi-square test. results: of the patients who underwent the mmp test, 15.6% had positive results (high mmp activity). after treatment, 89.3% of patients had negative results on the second mmp test. these patients had a significantly better pregnancy rate (42.0%) than the control group (26.6%), as well as a lower miscarriage rate (28.5% vs 36.5%, respectively). conclusions: a 2-week course of antibiotics and corticosteroids effectively improves the uterine environment underlying rif by reducing mmp activity.
enzymology	proline is not only an essential component of proteins but it also has important roles in adaptation to osmotic and dehydration stresses, redox control, and apoptosis. here, we review pathways of proline biosynthesis in the three domains of life. pathway reconstruction from genome data for hundreds of eubacterial and dozens of archaeal and eukaryotic organisms revealed evolutionary conservation and variations of this pathway across different taxa. in the most prevalent pathway of proline synthesis, glutamate is phosphorylated to -glutamyl phosphate by -glutamyl kinase, reduced to -glutamyl semialdehyde by -glutamyl phosphate reductase, cyclized spontaneously to (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and reduced to proline by (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. in higher plants and animals the first two steps are catalysed by a bi-functional (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. alternative pathways of proline formation use the initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway to ornithine, which can be converted to (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by ornithine aminotransferase and then reduced to proline or converted directly to proline by ornithine cyclodeaminase. in some organisms, the latter pathways contribute to or could be fully responsible for the synthesis of proline. the conservation of proline biosynthetic enzymes and significance of specific residues for catalytic activity and allosteric regulation are analysed on the basis of protein structural data, multiple sequence alignments, and mutant studies, providing novel insights into proline biosynthesis in organisms. we also discuss the transcriptional control of the proline biosynthetic genes in bacteria and plants.
molecular_biology	endoribonuclease (nendou) is unique and conserved as a major genetic marker in nidoviruses that infect vertebrate hosts. arterivirus nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) was shown to have nendou activity and play essential roles in the viral life cycle. here, we report three crystal structures of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and equine arteritis virus (eav) nsp11 mutants. the structures of arterivirus nsp11 contain two conserved compact domains: the n-terminal domain (ntd) and c-terminal domain (ctd). the structures of prrsv and eav endoribonucleases are similar and conserved in the arterivirus, but they are greatly different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronaviruses (cov), representing important human pathogens in the nidovirales order. the catalytic center of nendou activity is located in the ctd, where a positively charged groove is next to the key catalytic residues conserved in nidoviruses. although the ntd is nearly identical, the catalytic region of the arterivirus nsp11 family proteins is remarkably flexible, and the oligomerization may be concentration dependent. in summary, our structures provide new insight into this key multifunctional nendou family of proteins and lay a foundation for better understanding of the molecular mechanism and antiviral drug development. importance porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and equine arteritis virus are two major members of the arterivirus family. prrsv, a leading swine pathogen, causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. due to the lack of a suitable vaccine or effective drug treatment and the quick spread of these viruses, infected animals either die quickly or must be culled. prrsv costs the swine industry around $ 644 million annually in the united states and almost (sic)1.5 billion in europe every year. to find a way to combat these viruses, we focused on the essential viral nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11). nsp11 is associated with multiple functions, such as rna processing and suppression of the infected host innate immunity system. the three structures solved in this study provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of this crucial protein family and will benefit the development of new treatments against these deadly viruses.
genetics	among the four different types of thyroid cancer, treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma poses a major challenge because of its propensity of early metastasis. to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of medullary thyroid carcinoma and discover candidates for targeted therapies, we developed a new mouse model of medullary thyroid carcinoma based on our cgrp(creer) mouse line. this system enables gene manipulation in parafollicular c cells in the thyroid, the purported cells of origin of medullary thyroid carcinoma. selective inactivation of tumor suppressors, such as p53, rb, and pten, in mature parafollicular c cells via an inducible cre recombinase from cgrp(creer) led to development of murine medullary thyroid carcinoma. loss of pten accelerated p53/rb-induced medullary thyroid carcinoma, indicating interactions between pathways controlled by tumor suppressors. moreover, labeling differentiated parafollicular c cells by cgrp(creer) allows us to follow their fate during malignant transformation to medullary thyroid tumor. our findings support a model in which mutational events in differentiated parafollicular c cells result in medullary thyroid carcinoma. through expression analysis including rna-seq, we uncovered major signaling pathways and networks that are perturbed following the removal of tumor suppressors. taken together, these studies not only increase our molecular understanding of medullary thyroid carcinoma but also offer new candidates for designing targeted therapies or other treatment modalities.
northern_blotting	the enzyme squalene synthase (ec 2.5.1.21) catalyzes a reductive dimerization of two farnesyl diphosphate (fpp) molecules into squalene, a key precursor for the sterol and triterpene biosynthesis. a full-length cdna encoding squalene synthase (designated as tesqs) was isolated from taxus cuspidata, a kind of important medicinal plants producing potent anti-cancer drug, taxol. the full-length cdna of tcsqs was 1765 bp and contained a 1230 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a polypeptide of 409 amino acids. bioinformatic analysis revealed that the deduced tcsqs protein had high similarity with other plant squalene synthases and a predicted crystal structure similar to other class i isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes. southern blot analysis revealed that there was one copy of tcsqs gene in the genome of t cuspidata. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis and northern blotting analysis showed that tcsqs expressed constitutively in all tested tissues, with the highest expression in roots. the promoter region of tcsqs was also isolated by genomic walking and analysis showed that several cis-acting elements were present in the promoter region. the results of treatment experiments by different signaling components including methyl-jasmonate, salicylic acid and gibberellin revealed that the tesqs expression level of treated cells had a prominent diversity to that of control, which was consistent with the prediction results of tcsqs promoter region in the plantcar-e database.
human_metabolism	whereas selenium (se) is an important antioxidant in human metabolism to prevent cancer, aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic. brazil nuts from eastern and western amazon regions were evaluated to find any relationship between se and aflatoxins levels. a total of 80 (in-shell and shelled) nuts samples were collected directly from different forest sites and analyzed for se by atomic emission spectrometry and aflatoxins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. the limit of quantitation (loq) for se was 2.0 mg/kg, and loq for total aflatoxins was 0.390 mu g/kg. nut se levels from the eastern region were higher than the western, in addition to the aflatoxins. the moisture content (mc) and water activity (a(w)) of the raw nuts from the two regions did not present a significant difference, for either in-shell or shelled. the mc was 24.5% (minimum of 20.1% and maximum of 30.4%) and 22.1% (minimum of 14.6% and maximum of 28.9%) and a(w) of 0.85 for both regions. further studies need to be carried out to discover the role of se on fungi growth stress and aflatoxin production mechanisms.
immunology	background: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) capsule enables evasion from phagocytosis, invasion of keratinocytes, and bacterial survival. in mixed infection, the capsule also participates in coaggregation, which may lead to characteristic virulence not present in the monoinfection. the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pg capsule as a virulence factor in coaggregated mixed infection with fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). methods: mixed infections containing fn and non-capsulated or capsulated strains of pg were compared with the same infection with lactose as coaggregation inhibitor. murine experimental periodontitis was used to assess disease severity. primary polymorphonuclear leukocytes and keratinocytes were used to examine phagocytosis and bacterial invasion, respectively. results: mixed infection with capsulated pg augmented alveolar bone loss compared with that of mixed infection with non-capsulated pg. addition of lactose led to attenuation of bone loss in the capsulated mixed infection and to intensification of bone loss in the non-capsulated mixed infection. in the latter mixed infection, fn evaded phagocytosis, whereas in the capsulated mixed infection pg displayed a greater capacity for invasion of keratinocytes. conclusions: pg capsule was found to serve as a unique virulence factor in mixed infection with fn. capsule-dependent coaggregation led to augmented invasion of pg and may be responsible for the severity of disease after mixed infection with fn.
northern_blotting	the cdna amphiarf , encoding a novel member of arf family was for the first time identified from the gut cdna library of amphioxus branchiostoma becheri tsingtauense . the deduced amino acid sequence includes the motifs involved in gtp binding (dvgg, nkqd and sak) and hydrolysis (gxdxxgk), and a glycine at position 2 for n-terminal myristoylation, which are all characteristic of arfs. however, it has a 46 amino acid c-terminal extension (positions 183-227), which was not found in any arf family previously described including arf-like proteins. this suggests that amphiarf is a new member of arf family, which was also supported by the phylogenetic analysis. it is highly likely that the extended c-terminal of amphiarf is a novel addition occurring after cephalochordate/vertebrate split. northern blotting analysis revealed that amphiarf transcript was present in all tissues examined, consistent with the involvement of arfs in the fundamental role like vesicular trafficking of proteins.
northern_blotting	manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) plays an important role in crustacean immune defense reaction by eliminating oxidative stress. knowledge on mnsod at molecular level allows us to understand its regulatory mechanism in crustacean immune system. a novel mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (mmnsod) was cloned from hepatopancreas of chinese shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) pcr. the full-length cdna consists of 1185 bp with a 660 bp open reading frame, encoding 220 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal peptide of 20 amino acids. sequence comparison showed that the mmnsod of f. chinensis shares 88% and 82% identity with that of giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii and blue crab callinectes sapidus, respectively. mmnsod transcripts were detected in hepatopancreas, hemocytes, lymphoid organ, intestine, ovary, muscle and gill by northern blotting. rt-pcr analysis indicated that mmnsod showed different expression profiles in shrimp hemocytes and hepatopancreas after artificial infection with while spot syndrome virus (wssv). in addition, a fusion protein containing mmnsod was produced in vitro. lc-esi-ms analysis showed that two peptide fragments (-gdvntvislapalk- and -nvrpdyvnaiwk-) of the recombinant protein were identical to the corresponding sequence of m. rosenbergii mmnsod, and the enzyme activity of the refolded recombinant protein was also measured.

molecular_biology	brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and its tyrosine kinase receptor trkb have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (nb) patients. our previous studies indicated that bdnf activation of trkb induces chemo-resistance through activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (pi3k)/akt pathway. in this study, we investigated the role of bdnf/trkb on metastasis in nb. a tetracycline-regulated trkb-expressing nb cell line (tb3) was used. scratch wound healing assay, boyden chamber migration, and invasion assays were performed to study the migration and invasion of tb3 cells. a tumor xenograft model using scid-beige mice was utilized to detect the metastasis of nb tumors in vivo. inhibitors of pi3k, mapk, akt, and mtor were used. western blotting was performed to study the expressions of p-akt, p-erk, and p-mtor. our results showed that in trkb-expressing nb cells, bdnf treatment significantly increased gap closing (p < 0.01) in scratch wound healing assay, also significantly enhanced the numbers of migrating cells (p < 0.01) and invading cells (p < 0.01) in the boyden chamber migration and invasion assays. in vivo, nb distant metastases were significantly increased in mice with trkb-expressing xenograft tumors compared to those with non-trkb-expressing tumors (p < 0.05). pre-treatment with any of the inhibitors for pi3k (ly294002), mapk (pd98059), akt (perifosine), or mtor (rapamycin) blocked the bdnf/trkb-induced increases of cell migration and invasion in tb3 cells, and also blocked the bdnf/trkb-induced expressions of p-akt, p-erk, and p-mtor. these data indicated that bdnf/trkb increased metastasis in nb via pi3k/akt/mtor and mapk pathways, and bdnf/trkb and the downstream targets may be potential targets for the treatment of nb metastasis.
northern_blotting	riboswitches are cis-acting mrna elements that regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding. recently, a class of riboswitches was proposed to respond to the molybdenum cofactor (moco), which serves as a redox center for metabolic enzymes. the 5' leader of the escherichia coli moaabcde transcript exemplifies this candidate riboswitch class. this mrna encodes enzymes for moco biosynthesis, and moaa expression is feedback inhibited by moco. previous rna-seq analyses showed that moaa mrna copurified with the rna binding protein csra (carbon storage regulator), suggesting that csra binds to this rna in vivo. among its global regulatory roles, csra represses stationary phase metabolism and activates central carbon metabolism. here, we used gel mobility shift analysis to determine that csra binds specifically and with high affinity to the moaa 5' mrna leader. northern blotting and studies with a series of chromosomal lacz reporter fusions showed that csra posttranscriptionally activates moaa expression without altering moaa mrna levels, indicative of translation control. deletion analyses, nucleotide replacement studies and footprinting with csra-febabe identified two sites for csra binding. toeprinting assays suggested that csra binding causes changes in moaa rna structure. we propose that the moaa mrna leader forms an aptamer, which serves as a target of posttranscriptional regulation by at least two different factors, moco and the protein csra. while we are not aware of similar dual posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, additional examples are likely to emerge.

cell_biology	iq motif containing gtpase activating protein1 (iqgap1) is a scaffold protein, which is aberrantly expressed in several tumor types and is closely associated with the development, metastasis and prognosis of cancer. several studies have demonstrated that iqgap1 has broad prospects in the basic and clinical research of tumors. the present study aimed to explore the effects of iqgap1-small interfering (si) na on the proliferation and metastasis of u251 and u373 glioma cell lines, which markedly expressed iqgap1. the human glioma cell lines (u251 and u373) were transfected with sirna and transfection efficacy was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) and western blot analysis. cell proliferation was detected using the cell counting kit-8, and cell metastasis capabilities were detected using cell adhesion, migration and invasion assays. in addition, the expression levels of several tumor-associated genes were determined by rt-qpcr and western blotting. the results indicated that iqgap1 was expressed at higher levels in glioma tissues compared with in normal brain tissues. iqgap1-sirna significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and cell adhesion, migration and invasion. furthermore, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)2, snail, mmp9, fibronectin 1 and twist were suppressed, and e-cadherin was upregulated in response to sirna-iqgap1. the present study identified the function of iqgap1 in glioma cell biology, and indicated that it may be considered a novel target for glioma treatment.
polymerase_chain_reaction	intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) is a lifethreat-ening type of stroke. previous studies have reported that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmscs) may exert beneficial effects on the treatment of ich. however, it remains unknown whether the neuroprotection exerted by bmscs on ich is due to the differentiation of bmscs, or the trophic factors secreted into their conditioned medium (cm). in addition, growth-associated protein-43 (gap-43) is a protein associated with neurite extension, which may be considered a prospective therapeutic target in the treatment of ich. the present study investigated whether administration of bmsc-cm could be considered as an alternative to the established treatment of direct bmsc transplantation; in addition, the underlying mechanisms were evaluated. neurological function tests, brain water content, reverse transcription -quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used in present study. the current study indicated that the neuroprotective effects of bmsc implantation and bmsc-cm treatment are similar, and that both decrease the severity of post-ich cerebral edema, as well as improving neurological functions. at the molecular level, treatment with bmsc-cm resulted in a marked elevation in the expression of gap-43 and interleukin (il) -10, in addition to a significant reduction in the expression levels of il-1a, tumor necrosis factor-a and il-6. following application of a phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk1/2) inhibitor, pd98059, in a bmsc-cm rat model, the mrna and protein expression levels of gap-43 were significantly attenuated. therefore, the findings of the present study demonstrated that treatment with bmsc-cm may be an alternative to direct bmsc transplantation in a rat model of ich. the mechanism underlying bmsc-cm-mediated neuroprotection may be associated with anti-inflammatory effects, as well as activation of gap-43 transcription and expression through erk-1/2 phosphorylation. therefore, the erk-1/2-gap-43 signaling pathway may be considered a potential novel application target of bmsc-cm for the treatment of neurological diseases.
southern_blotting	the reverse transcriptase (rt) domain of the copia retrotransposons was amplified from genomic dna of an aquatic perennial grass, zizania latifolia (griseb.)-a wild relative of rice. in total, 71 different sequences were obtained, which, according to alignment and phylogenetic analysis, can be classified into seven distinct families, with five each containing multiple sequences and two each containing a single sequence. the nucleotide sequence similarity values varied widely among the sequences, indicative of their high degree of heterogeneity. of the 71 sequences, 25 are intact whereas the others have a frameshift, a stop codon, or both. southern blot analysis revealed differential occurrence of the z. latifolia copia retrotransposons among representative species of the grass family, and upon which three groups (1, 11 and 111) can be divided. an interesting observation is that whereas the occurrence patterns of groups i and 11 among the grass species is compatible with their organismal phylogeny, which of group iii shows apparent incongruity. because cytosine methylation has been proposed as a major mechanism controlling transpositional behavior, amplification, and hence distribution, of mobile elements, the extent and pattern of this epigenetic modification were analyzed for the zizania copia retrotransposons. southern blotting with a pair of isoschizomers, hpall and mspl, with differential sensitivity to cytosine methylation revealed an atypical methylation pattern of the z. latifolia copia retrotransposons. it was found that only two of the seven families (families 1 and 4) showed typical methylation patterns as found in other plants, i.e., cg is more heavily methylated than cng, while the rest five families showed an atypical pattern, i.e., cng is more methylated than cg, which was further verified by using the z. latifolia copia-mixture as a probe. in addition, the homologues of those z. latifolia copia elements that exist in both cultivated rice and the common wild rice are largely undermethylated and highly conserved, though some of which showed evidence for methylation alteration in several rice-zizania introgression lines. thus, the atypical patterns of cytosine methylation of the copia retrotransposons in z. latifolia might have played a role in their differentiation into distinct groups, and differential occurrence of their homologs in other species of the grass family.

genetics	pine pollen dispersal has been well-studied over a century due to its ubiquity, robust shape and unusual longevity; this knowledge can be brought to bear on forest population genetics applications and gene conservation programs for pines and other high-latitude wind-pollinated species. dispersal models are shifting towards meso-scale transport processes so i assert here that this shift in transport scale is important to population genetics assumptions inherent to gene conservation decision-making. support comes from the following: (1) aerodynamic properties for pollen is more akin to spores than seeds. (2) gradient-free dispersal is typical of pollen transported at meso-scale distances. (3) importance of vertically uplifted pollen on meso-scale transport has been overlooked and its interaction with atmospheric processes is not yet understood. (4) a fraction of pine pollen retains its capacity for germination and seed fertilization after meso-scale transport. these findings raise the question of whether forest fragmentation aligns with genetics theory of small populations; this question shapes ex situ and in situ collections. the shift to meso-scale transport of pine pollen can re-shape forest gene conservation decision-making about ex situ and in situ collection strategies.
northern_blotting	background diamond-blackfan anemia and shwachman-diamond syndrome are inherited bone marrow failure syndromes linked to defects in ribosome synthesis. the purpose of this study was to determine whether yeast models for diamond-blackfan anemia and shwachman-diamond syndrome differed in the mechanism by which ribosome synthesis was affected. design and methods northern blotting, pulse-chase analysis, and polysome profiling were used to study ribosome synthesis in yeast models. localization of 60s ribosomal subunits was assessed using rpl25egfp. results relative to wild-type controls, each disease model showed defects in 60s subunit maturation, but with distinct underlying mechanisms. in the model of diamond-blackfan anemia, 60s subunit maturation was disrupted at a relatively early stage with abortive complexes subject to rapid degradation. 5s ribosomal rna, unlike other large subunit ribosomal rna in this model, accumulated as an extra-ribosomal species. in contrast, subunit maturation in the shwachman-diamond syndrome model was affected at a later step, giving rise to relatively stable pre-60s particles with associated 5s ribosomal rna retained in the nucleus. conclusions these differences between the yeast diamond-blackfan anemia and shwactiman-diamond syndrome models have implications for signaling mechanisms linking abortive ribosome. assembly to cell fate decisions and may contribute to the divergent clinical presentations of diamond-blackfan anemia and shwachman-diamond syndrome.
northern_blotting	the oriental leafworm moth, spodoptera litura, is a major agricultural pest in southeast asia and nearby pacific regions. two distinct trehalases have been identified in insects: soluble trehalase (treh1) and membrane-bound trehalase (treh2), although there is currently no information on these genes in s. litura. to characterize the distribution and function of treh, cdnas of treh proteins were cloned from s. litura. spolitreh1 cdna has an open reading frame of 1758 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 585 amino acids, with a predicted mass of approximately 67.07 kda and an isoelectric point of 4.86. spolitreh2 cdna has an open reading frame of 2325 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 645 amino acids, a mass of approximately 73.62 kda, and an isoelectric point of 5.90. northern blotting analysis revealed that spolitreh1 transcripts are in the midgut, fat body, tracheae, and epidermis, but not in the brain and malpighian tubules of s. litura larvae, whereas spolitreh2 transcripts were found in all 6 tissues. spolitreh1 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body the pre-pupal stage, and spolitreh2 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body of 3-day-old larvae of the 6th instar and during the 1st 6 days of the pupal stage, except the 2nd day. both spolitreh1 and spolitreh2 were highly expressed in third-instar larvae.
molecular_biology	background: during the last few years, investigators have debated the role that infectious agents may have in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. with the emergence of new molecular biology techniques, several studies have been conducted; therefore, we performed a meta-analysis in order to better explain this possible association. methods: this review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) statement from the cochrane collaboration guidelines. four different databases (medline, scopus, web of science, and cochrane collaboration) were searched for all original articles published from 1980 to 2015. the present meta-analysis included case-control studies that reported the presence of microorganisms in samples of patients with sarcoidosis using culture methods or molecular biology techniques. we used a random effects or a fixed-effect model to calculate the odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed in order to explore the heterogeneity among studies. results: fifty-eight studies qualified for the purpose of this analysis. the present meta-analysis, the first, to our knowledge, in evaluation of all infectious agents proposed to be associated with sarcoidosis and involving more than 6000 patients in several countries, suggests an etiological link between propionibacterium acnes and sarcoidosis, with an or of 18.80 (95% ci 12.62, 28.01). we also found a significant association between sarcoidosis and mycobacteria, with an or of 6.8 (95% ci 3.73, 12.39). borrelia (or 4.82; 95% ci 0.98, 23.81), hhv-8 (or 1.47; 95% ci 0.02, 110.06) as well as rickettsia helvetica, chlamydia pneumoniae, epstein-barr virus and retrovirus, although suggested by previous investigations, were not associated with sarcoidosis. conclusion: this meta-analysis suggests that some infectious agents can be associated with sarcoidosis. what seems clear is that more than one infectious agent might be implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis; probably the patient 's geographical location might dictate which microorganisms are more involved. future investigations and more clinical trials are need to bring these evidences to a more global level.
human_metabolism	levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-thp) is a tetrahydroprotoberberine isoquinoline alkaloid and has been used as an analgesic agent in china for over 50 years. recent studies revealed that l-thp was effective in the treatment of drug addiction. however, the plasma metabolic profile, mass balance and clearance pathways of l-thp in human remain unknown. in the present study, an analytical strategy was developed for qualitative and quantitative investigation of metabolism and disposition of l-thp in human. detection and structural characterization of l-thp metabolites were performed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. selected major metabolites in plasma, urine and feces determined by liquid chromatography with uv detection were further quantified using a triple quadruple mass spectrometry and reference standards. a total of 20 metabolites were identified, most of which were formed via demethylation, mono-hydroxylation, and glucuronidation and sulfonation of desmethyl metabolites. five major metabolites accounted for over 10% of the parent drug concentration in plasma. major urinary and fecal metabolites and the parent drug that were monitored for 72 h accounted for 463% of the dose, while only 0.16% of the dose was the unchanged drug. multiple demethylations followed by glucuronide and sulfate conjugations and renal excretion were the major drug clearance pathways of l-thp in human.

enzymology	flavonoids represent a large class of secondary metabolites produced by plants. these polyphenolic compounds are well known for their antioxidative abilities, are antimicrobial phytoalexins responsible for flower pigmentation to attract pollinators and, in addition to other properties, are also specific bacterial regulators governing the expression of rhizobium genes involved in root nodulation (firmin et al., 1986). the bacterial chalcone isomerase (chi) from eubacterium ramulus catalyses the first step in a flavanone-degradation pathway by ring opening of (2s)-naringenin to form naringenin chalcone. the structural biology and enzymology of plant chis have been well documented, whereas the existence of bacterial chis has only recently been elucidated. this first determination of the structure of a bacterial chi provides detailed structural insights into the key step of the flavonoid-degradation pathway. the active site could be confirmed by co-crystallization with the substrate (2s)-naringenin. the stereochemistry of the proposed mechanism of the isomerase reaction was verified by specific h-1/h-2 isotope exchange observed by h-1 nmr experiments and was further supported by mutagenesis studies. the active site is shielded by a flexible lid, the varying structure of which could be modelled in different states of the catalytic cycle using small-angle x-ray scattering data together with the crystallographic structures. comparison of bacterial chi with the plant enzyme from medicago sativa reveals that they have unrelated folds, suggesting that the enzyme activity evolved convergently from different ancestor proteins. despite the lack of any functional relationship, the tertiary structure of the bacterial chi shows similarities to the ferredoxin-like fold of a chlorite dismutase and the stress-related protein sp1.
molecular_biology	objective: by primary cultivation of clinical specimens of human cervical cancer, the main and side population cells were isolated and their biological characteristics were analyzed. methods: clinical specimens of human cervical tissue were cultured to get the primary cells. after staining by hoechst33342, flow cytometry was used for sorting to get the main and side population cells. their molecular biology, morphology and tumorigenicity were compared with that of hela cells. results: the primary cervical cancer and side population cells were isolated successfully, and the two cells have obvious tumor cell morphology. ck17, ck19, p63 and beta 1-integrin and other related markers were expressed. tumorigenicity of side population cells was significantly higher than the main group of cells. distribution of the cytoskeleton and expression associated tumor markers were not affected before and after tumorigenesis of the two cells. conclusion: side population cells which were cultured and isolated from clinical specimens of human cervical cancer have the characteristics of tumor stem cell, which can be used for further study of targeted therapy for cervical cancer.
genetics	peroxisomes are thought to have played a key role in the evolution of metabolic networks of photosynthetic organisms by connecting oxidative and biosynthetic routes operating in different compartments. while the various oxidative pathways operating in the peroxisomes of higher plants are fairly well characterized, the reactions present in the primitive peroxisomes ( microbodies) of algae are poorly understood. screening of a chlamydomonas insertional mutant library identified a strain strongly impaired in oil remobilization and defective in cre05.g232002 (cracx2), a gene encoding a member of the acyl-coa oxidase/dehydrogenase superfamily. the purified recombinant cracx2 expressed in escherichia coli catalyzed the oxidation of fatty acyl-coas into trans-2-enoyl-coa and produced h2o2. this result demonstrated that cracx2 is a genuine acyl-coa oxidase, which is responsible for the first step of the peroxisomal fatty acid ( fa) beta-oxidation spiral. a fluorescent protein-tagging study pointed to a peroxisomal location of cracx2. the importance of peroxisomal fa beta-oxidation in algal physiology was shown by the impact of the mutation on fa turnover during day/night cycles. moreover, under nitrogen depletion the mutant accumulated 20% more oil than the wild type, illustrating the potential of beta-oxidation mutants for algal biotechnology. this study provides experimental evidence that a plant-type fa beta-oxidation involving h2o2- producing acyl-coa oxidation activity has already evolved in the microbodies of the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
genetics	voltage-gated sodium channels are pore-forming transmembrane proteins that selectively allow sodium ions to flow across the plasma membrane according to the electro-chemical gradient thus mediating the rising phase of action potentials in excitable cells and playing key roles in physiological processes such as neurotransmission, skeletal muscle contraction, heart rhythm, and pain sensation. genetic variations in the nine human genes encoding these channels are known to cause a large range of diseases affecting the nervous and cardiac systems. understanding the molecular effect of genetic variations is critical for elucidating the pathologic mechanisms of known variations and in predicting the effect of newly discovered ones. to this end, we have created a web-based tool, the ion channels variants portal, which compiles all variants characterized functionally in the human sodium channel genes. this portal describes 672 variants each associated with at least one molecular or clinical phenotypic impact, for a total of 4,658 observations extracted from 264 different research articles. these data were captured as structured annotations using standardized vocabularies and ontologies, such as the gene ontology and the ion channel electrophysiology ontology. all these data are available to the scientific community via nextprot at https://www.nextprot.org/portals/navmut.
genetics	background: age-related macular degeneration (amd) is a common condition of vision loss with disease development strongly influenced by environmental and genetic factors. recently, 34 loci were associated with amd at genome-wide significance. so far, little is known about a genetic overlap between amd and other complex diseases or disease-relevant traits. methods: for each of 60 complex diseases/traits with publicly available genome-wide significant association data, the lead genetic variant per independent locus was extracted and a genetic score was calculated for each disease/trait as the weighted sum of risk alleles. the association with amd was estimated based on 16,144 amd cases and 17,832 controls using logistic regression. results: of the respective disease/trait variance, the 60 genetic scores explained on average 4.8% (0.27-20.69%) and 16 of them were found to be significantly associated with amd (q-values < 0.01, p values from < 1.0 x 10(-16) to 1.9 x 10(-3)). notably, an increased risk for amd was associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular diseases, increased risk for autoimmune diseases, higher hdl and lower ldl levels in serum, lower bone-mineral density as well as an increased risk for skin cancer. by restricting the analysis to 1824 variants initially used to compute the 60 genetic scores, we identified 28 novel amd risk variants (q-values < 0.01, p values from 1.1 x 10(-7) to 3.0 x 10(-4)),known to be involved in cardiovascular disorders, lipid metabolism, autoimmune diseases, anthropomorphic traits, ocular disorders, and neurological diseases. the latter variants represent 20 novel amd-associated, pleiotropic loci. genes in the novel loci reinforce previous findings strongly implicating the complement system in amd pathogenesis. conclusions: we demonstrate a substantial overlap of the genetics of several complex diseases/traits with amd and provide statistically significant evidence for an additional 20 loci associated with amd. this highlights the possibility that so far unrelated pathologies may have disease pathways in common.
cell_biology	treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (aml), an aggressive and heterogeneous hematological malignancy, remains a challenge. despite advances in our understanding of the complex genetics and biology of aml pathophysiology, these findings have been translated to the clinic with only limited success, and poor outcomes persist for the majority of patients. thus, novel treatment strategies are clearly needed for achieving deeper and prolonged remissions and for avoiding the development of resistance. due to its profound role in (cancer) stem cell biology and differentiation, the hedgehog (hh)/glioma-associated oncogene homolog (gli) signaling pathway may be an attractive novel therapeutic target in aml. in this review, we aim to provide a critical and concise overview of the currently known potential and challenges of hh/gli targeting. we describe the biological role of the hh/gli pathway in aml pathophysiology. we specifically focus on ways of targeting non-canonical hh/gli signaling in aml, particularly in combination with standard treatment regimens, which may overcome some hurdles observed with approved hh pathway inhibitors in solid tumors.
cell_biology	a novel animal model involving chimeric mice with humanized livers established via human hepatocyte transplantation has been developed. these mice, in which the liver has been repopulated with functional human hepatocytes, could serve as a useful tool for investigating human hepatic cell biology, drug metabolism, and other preclinical applications. one of the key factors required for successful transplantation of human hepatocytes into mice is the elimination of the endogenous hepatocytes to prevent competition with the human cells and provide a suitable space and microenvironment for promoting human donor cell expansion and differentiation. to date, two major liver injury mouse models utilizing fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (fah) and uroplasminogen activator (upa) mice have been established. however, fah mice are used mainly with mature hepatocytes and the application of the upa model is limited by decreased breeding. to overcome these limitations, albtoxin receptor mediated cell knockout (treck)/scid mice were used for in vivo differentiation of immature human hepatocytes and humanized liver generation. human hepatic stem cells (hpscs) successfully repopulated the livers of alb-treck/scid mice that had developed lethal fulminant hepatic failure following diphtheria toxin (dt) treatment. this model of a humanized liver in alb-treck/scid mice will have functional applications in studies involving drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions and will promote other in vivo and in vitro studies.
human_metabolism	di-iso-nonylphthalate (dinp), a complex mixture of predominantly nine-carbon branched chain dialkyl phthalate isomers, has replaced di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (dehp) as the major plasticiser for polyvinylchloride (pvc) polymers. similar to dehp, dinp is a developmental and reproductive toxicant in rodents. this study for the first time describes human metabolism and elimination of dinp in a male volunteer after we applied a single oral dinp dose of 1.27 mg/kg body-weight. to avoid interference by omnipresent background exposure we used deuterium-labelled dinp. we investigated the urinary excretion of the simple monoester mono-iso-nonylphthalate (minp) and oxidised isomers with hydroxy (oh-minp), oxo (oxo-minp) and carboxy (carboxy-minp) functional groups. we used isomeric minp and three specific oxidised isomer standards for quantification: mono-(4-methyl-7-hydroxy-octyl)phthalate (70h-mmeop), mono-(4-methyl-7-oxo-octyl)phtalate (7oxo-mmeop) and rnono-(4-methyl-7-carboxyheptyl)phthalate (7carboxy-mmehp). these specific dinp metabolites are currently the only synthetic dinp metabolite standards available. within 48 h we recovered 43.6% of the applied dose in urine as the above dinp metabolites, 20.2% as oh-minp, 10.7% as carboxy-minp, 10.6% as oxo-minp and only 2.2% as minp. other oxidised dinp metabolites not determined in this study probably increase the share of the dinp dose excreted via urine. elimination followed a multi-phase pattern, elimiation half-lives in the second phase (beginning 2411 post-dose) can only roughly be estimated to be 12h for the oh- and oxo-mnp-metabolites and 18h for carboxy-minp metabolites. after 24h, the carboxy-minp metabolites replaced the oh-minp metabolites as the major urinary metabolites. all oxidised dinp metabolites are suitable parameters for biomonitoring human dinp exposure.

human_metabolism	the investigation of very complex dynamical systems like the human metabolism requires the comprehension of important subsystems. the present paper deals with energy supply chains as subsystems of the metabolism on the molecular, cellular, and individual levels. we form a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations and we show fundamental properties by fourier techniques. the results are supported by a transition from a system of ordinary differential equations to a partial differential equation, namely, a transport equation. in particular, the behavior of supply chains with dominant pull components is discussed. a special focus lies on the role of buffer compartments.
northern_blotting	matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) degrade collagen and mediate tissue remodeling. the novel cytokine il-17 is expressed during various inflammatory conditions and modulates mmp expression. we investigated the effect of il-17 on mmp-1 expression in primary human cardiac fibroblasts (hcf) and delineated the signaling pathways involved. hcf were treated with recombinant human il-17. mmp-1 expression was analyzed by northern blotting, rt-quantitative pcr, western blotting, and elisa; transcriptional induction and transcription factor binding by emsa, elisa, and reporter assay; and p38 mapk and erk1/2 activation by protein kinase assays and western blotting. signal transduction pathways were investigated using pharmacological inhibitors, small interfering rna (sirna), and adenoviral dominant-negative expression vectors. il-17 stimulated mmp-1 gene transcription, net mrna levels, protein, and promoter-reporter activity in hcf. this response was blocked by il-17 receptor- fc chimera and il-17 receptor antibodies, but not by il-6, tnf-alpha, or il-1 beta antibodies. il-17-stimulated type i collagenase activity was inhibited by the mmp inhibitor gm-6001 and by sirna-mediated mmp-1 knockdown. il-17 stimulated activator protein-1 [ap-1 (c-fos, c-jun, and fra-1)], nf-kappa b (p50 and p65), and ccaat enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp)-beta dna binding and reporter gene activities, effects attenuated by antisense oligonucleotides, sirna-mediated knockdown, or expression of dominant-negative signaling proteins. inhibition of ap-1, nf-kappa b, or c/ebp activation attenuated il-17-stimulated mmp-1 expression. il-17 induced p38 mapk and erk1/2 activation, and inhibition by sb-203580 and pd-98059 blunted il-17-mediated transcription factor activation and mmp-1 expression. our data indicate that il-17 induces mmp-1 in human cardiac fibroblasts directly via p38 mapk- and erk-dependent ap-1, nf-kappa b, and c/ebp-beta activation and suggest that il-17 may play a critical role in myocardial remodeling.
genetics	amphibians, as the first terrestrial vertebrates, offer a window into early major histocompatibility complex (mhc) evolution. we characterized the mhc class i of two korean amphibians, the asiatic toad (bufo gargarizans) and the japanese tree frog (hyla japonica). we found at least four transcribed mhc class i (mhc i) loci, the highest number confirmed in any anuran to date. furthermore, we identified mhc i transcripts in terrestrial adults, and possibly in aquatic larvae, of both species. we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on mhc i sequence data and found that b. gargarizans and h. japonica cluster together in the superfamily nobleobatrachia. we further identified three supertypes shared by the two species. our results reveal substantial variation in the number of mhc i loci in anurans and suggest that certain supertypes have particular physiochemical properties that may confer pathogen resistance.

genetics	species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes emerge as key organisms to understand the astonishing diversity of sex-determination systems. whereas new genomic methods are widening opportunities to study these systems, the difficulty to separately characterize their x and y homologous chromosomes poses limitations. here we demonstrate that two simple f-statistics calculated from sex-linked genotypes, namely the genetic distance (f-st) between sexes and the inbreeding coefficient (f-is) in the heterogametic sex, can be used as reliable proxies to compare sex-chromosome differentiation between populations. we correlated these metrics using published microsatellite data from two frog species (hyla arborea and rana temporaria), and show that they intimately relate to the overall amount of x-y differentiation in populations. however, the fits for individual loci appear highly variable, suggesting that a dense genetic coverage will be needed for inferring fine-scale patterns of differentiation along sex-chromosomes. the applications of these f-statistics, which implies little sampling requirement, significantly facilitate population analyses of sex-chromosomes.
molecular_biology	fourteen novel miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (mite) families are found in the florida carpenter ant genome, camponotus floridanus. they constitute approximately 0.63 % of the entire genome. analysis of their insertion time showed that most members of these mites were inserted into their host genome in less than 8 million years ago. in addition, the association between mites and the noncoding regions of genes in c. floridanus is random. interestingly, an autonomous partner (named cftec) responsible for the amplification of these mites was also found in c. floridanus. meanwhile, we present evidence, based on searches of publicly available databases, that this autonomous element was widespread in animals. moreover, structure and phylogenetic analyses supported that tecs might represent a novel cade of transposons intermediate between the classic cacta transposon and trcs. finally, their transposition mechanism and impact on host genome evolution were also discussed.
cell_biology	the objective of this study was to examine age-dependent changes in both t-1-weighted and t-2-weighted image contrasts and spin-echo t-2 relaxation time in the human brain during healthy ageing. a total of 37 participants between the ages of 49 and 87 years old were scanned with a 3 tesla system, using t-1-weighted, t-2 weighted and quantitative spin-echo t-2 imaging. contrast between image intensities and t-2 values was calculated for various regions, including between individual hippocampal subfields. the t-1 contrast-to-noise (cnr) and gray:white signal intensity ratio (gwr) did not change in the hippocampus, but it declined in the cingulate cortex with age. in contrast, t-2 cnr and gwr declined in both brain regions. t-2 relaxation time was almost constant in gray matter and most (but not all) hippocampal subfields, but increased substantially in white matter, pointing to an age effect on water relaxation in white matter. changes in t-1 and t-2 mr characteristics influence the appearance of brain images in later life and should be considered in image analyses of aged subjects. it is speculated that alterations at the cell biology level, with concomitant alterations to the local magnetic environment, reduce dephasing and subsequently prolong spin-echo t-2 through reduced diffusion effects in later life.
human_metabolism	the pig is increasingly being used in pharmacological and toxicological studies, and is the species of choice for future research into xenotransplantation, extracorporeal liver support and hepatocyte-based bioartificial liver. however, relatively little is known about xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in this species. in the present study, immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-rat and anti-human cytochrome p450 (cyp) antibodies revealed the presence of proteins in pig liver which cross-reacted with anti-human cyp1a2, cyp2d6 and cyp3a4, and with anti-rat cyp2e1 antibodies. northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of mrna which hybridized to cdna probes for human cyp2d6, cyp2e1 and cyp3a4, and to an oligonucleotide probe for pig cyp3a29. as there is a lack of a good animal model for cyp2d6, the presence of a cyp2d6-related protein in pig liver was of particular interest. pig hepatocytes also demonstrated cyp2d6 immunoreactive protein, and mrna hybridizable to a cyp2d6 cdna probe. we investigated the ability of pig li,er microsomes to catalyse dextromethorphan o-demethylation, a widely-used marker enzyme activity for cyp2d6. this enzyme activity demonstrated biphasic kinetics.,vith a high affinity apparent k-m1 = 6.9 +/- 3.6 mu m and v-max1 = 10.5 +/- 6.1 nmol/min/nmol cyp. the reaction was sensitive to inhibition by the cyp2d6-selective inhibitors quinidine, quinine, lobeline and nor-fluoxetine, whereas chemical inhibitors selective for other cyp isoforms failed to affect the reaction. we conclude that dextromethorphan o-demethylation is catalysed by a cyp2d enzyme which is remarkably similar to human cyp2d6, suggesting potential value of the pig as a model for predicting human metabolism of xenobiotics which undergo cyp2d6-dependent biotransformation, (c) 2000 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
molecular_biology	fimbriae are protein-based filamentous appendages that protrude from the bacterial cell surface and facilitate host adhesion. two types of fimbriae, fima and mfa1, of the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis are responsible for adherence to other bacteria and to host cells in the oral cavity. both fimbrial forms are composed of 5 proteins, but there is limited information about their polymerization mechanisms. here, the authors evaluated the function of mfa5, one of the mfa1 fimbrial accessory proteins. using mfa5 gene disruption and complementation studies, the authors revealed that mfa5 affects the incorporation of other accessory proteins, mfa3 and mfa4, into fibers and the expression of fimbriae on the cell surface. mfa5 is predicted to have a c-terminal domain (ctd) that uses the type ix secretion system (t9ss), which is limited to this organism and related bacteroidetes species, for translocation across the outer membrane. to determine the relationship between the putative mfa5 ctd and the t9ss, mutants were constructed with in-frame deletion of the ctd and deletion of poru, a c-terminal signal peptidase linked to t9ss-mediated secretion. the ctd-expressing strain presented a similar phenotype to the mfa5 disruption mutant with reduced expression of fimbriae lacking all accessory proteins. the poru mutants and the ctd-expressing strain showed intracellular accumulation of mfa5. these results indicate that mfa5 function requires t9ss-mediated translocation across the outer membrane, which is dependent on the ctd, and subsequent incorporation into fibers. these findings suggest the presence of a novel polymerization mechanism of the p. gingivalis fimbriae.
immunology	esophageal cancer (ec) is a highly malignant tumor, and the overall survival rate remains very low. traditional treatment is not sufficiently effective, and thus, there is an urgent need for new and effective treatments. the advances in cancer immunotherapy have changed this situation because this type of therapy has a significant potential to eliminate tumors with little damage to normal tissue. this treatment primarily aims to enhance the ability of the immune system to eliminate tumors and prevent tumor immune escape, which is associated with immune surveillance. this review summarizes current cancer therapeutic strategies and immunotherapy studies to demonstrate the potential of immunotherapy for the treatment of ec.
enzymology	the hepatic peroxisomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (act) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-enzyme whose deficiency is responsible for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (ph1), an autosomal recessive disorder. in the last few years the knowledge of the characteristics of agt and the transfer of this information into some pathogenic variants have significantly contributed to the improvement of the understanding at the molecular level of the ph1 pathogenesis. in this review, the spectroscopic features, the coenzyme 's binding affinity, the steady-state kinetic parameters as well as the sensitivity to thermal and chemical stress of the two allelic forms of act, the major (agt-ma) and the minor (agt-mi) allele, have been described. moreover, we summarize the characterization obtained by means of biochemical and bioinformatic analyses of the following ph1-causing variants in the recombinant purified forms: g82e associated with the major allele, f1521 encoded on the background of the minor allele, and the g41 mutants which co-segregate either with the major allele (g41r-ma and g41v-ma) or with the minor allele (g41r-mi). the data have been correlated with previous clinical and cell biology results, which allow us to (i) highlight the functional differences between agt-ma and agt-mi, (ii) identify the structural and functional molecular defects of the pathogenic variants, (iii) improve the correlation between the genotype and the enzymatic phenotype, (iv) foresee or understand the molecular basis of the responsiveness to pyridoxine treatment of patients bearing these mutations, and (v) pave the way for new treatment strategies. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phospate enzymology.

polymerase_chain_reaction	rabbit cells and models are frequently used in pharmacological experiments and toxicity tests and are particularly useful for corneal transplant experiments. here, we obtained a corneal endothelial cell line from normal rabbit corneal endothelium that had acquired infinite proliferative potential without requiring gene transfer. these infinitely proliferative rabbit corneal endothelial cells (ircecs) could be cultured for >250 generations and exhibited a greater ability to proliferate than did normal rabbit corneal endothelial cells (rcecs) cultivated by conventional methods. the results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunostaining analyses revealed that the expression profiles of corneal endothelial markers, such as collagen type viii1 and na+/k+-atpase, were similar to those of rcecs and in vivo corneal endothelium. scanning electron microscopy showed that many microvilli were present on the surface of the cells and that the ultrastructure was maintained. in addition, we verified that the ircecs had similar levels of pump function as did rcecs using an ussing chamber system. the results of a soft agar colony-formation assay suggested that the ircecs were not tumourigenic. taken together, our results demonstrated that the ircecs exhibited gene expression profiles and properties that were equivalent to those of native rabbit corneal endothelium, making these cells useful for corneal endothelial research studies. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
enzymology	differences in the metabolism of tyrosine between insects and mammals present an interesting example of molecular evolution. both insects and mammals possess fine-tuned systems of enzymes to meet their specific demands for tyrosine metabolites; however, more homologous enzymes involved in tyrosine metabolism have emerged in many insect species. without knowledge of modern genomics, one might suppose that mammals, which are generally more complex than insects and require tyrosine as a precursor for important catecholamine neurotransmitters and for melanin, should possess more enzymes to control tyrosine metabolism. therefore, the question of why insects actually possess more tyrosine metabolic enzymes is quite interesting. it has long been known that insects rely heavily on tyrosine metabolism for cuticle hardening and for innate immune responses, and these evolutionary constraints are likely the key answers to this question. in terms of melanogenesis, mammals also possess a high level of regulation; yet mammalian systems possess more mechanisms for detoxification whereas insects accelerate pathways like melanogenesis and therefore must bear increased oxidative pressure. our research group has had the opportunity to characterize the structure and function of many key proteins involved in tyrosine metabolism from both insects and mammals. in this mini review we will give a brief overview of our research on tyrosine metabolic enzymes in the scope of an evolutionary perspective of mammals in comparison to insects.
polymerase_chain_reaction	conclusions: the levels of expression of various c-type lectin receptors (clrs) messenger ribo nucleic acids (mrnas) were significantly higher in cholesteatomas than in normal skin, suggesting that these clrs may be involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. objectives: altered expression of pattern recognition receptors may be associated with immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. this study assessed the levels of expression of clr mrnas in normal skin and in cholesteatoma. methods: cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 38 patients with acquired cholesteatoma. the levels of expression of various clr mrnas were assessed quantitatively using real-time rt-pcr (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and correlated with age, sex, the presence of bacteria, hearing level, frequency of surgery, and degree of ossicle destruction. results: the levels of cd206 (cluster of differentiation 206), dec-205 (dendritic and epithelial cell-205), mgl (monoacylglycerol lipase), clec5a (c-type lectin domain family 5 member a), dectin-2 (dendrite cell-associated c-type lectin-2), bdca2 (blood dendritic cell antigen 2), mincle, dcir (dendritic cell immunoreceptor), dectin-1, micl (myeloid inhibitory c type-like lectin), and clec12b (c-type lectin domain family 12, member b) mrnas were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p= 2 than <= 1 destroyed ossicles (p<0.05), and the levels of mgl, mincle, dectin-1, and clec12b mrnas were significantly higher in recurrent than initial cholesteatoma specimens (p<0.05). the level of clec5a mrnas was significantly higher in patients with severe than mild-to-moderate hearing loss (p<0.05). \
human_metabolism	cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2136 (cyp2b6) is a human cyp isoform found in variable amounts in the liver and other organs. it is known to be inducible and polymorphic and has a wide range of xenobiotic substrates. studies of cyp2136 to date have concentrated heavily on clinical drugs. in the present communication, however, we concentrate on its role in the metabolism of environmental xenobiotics. the term environment is used, in its broadest sense, to include natural ecosystems and agroecosystems as well as the industrial and indoor domestic environments. in essence, this excludes only clinical drugs and drugs of abuse. many of these chemicals, including agrochemicals and industrial chemicals, can serve as substrates, inhibitors and/or inducers of cyp2136, these activities being often modified by the existence of polymorphic variants. metabolism-based interactions between environmental chemicals are discussed, as well as the emerging possibility of metabolic interactions between environmental chemicals and clinical drugs.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the aim of this single-center cross-sectional study was to detect the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogenic bacteria and active matrix metalloproteinase-8 (ammp-8) level in patients before (preltx) and after liver transplantation (postltx). periodontal pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment loss (cal) were assessed. subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect 11 common periodontal pathogens. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) samples were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) to determine ammp-8 level and assigned to a scoring system: score 0: 0-8 ng/ml, score 1: 8-20 ng/ml, and score 2: >20 ng/ml. the following were used for the statistical analysis: t test, mann-whitney u test, fishers test (alpha = 5 %). in total, 110 patients (preltx: n = 35, postltx: n = 75) could be included in the study. periodontal findings were not significantly different between groups. in microbiological analysis, a significantly higher prevalence of campylobacter rectus in preltx group was detected (p = 0.03). significantly more patients with score 0 in postltx group (p = 0.024) and significantly more patients with score 1 in preltx group were found (p = 0.004). furthermore, ammp-8 concentrations for patients with moderate periodontitis were significantly lower in postltx group compared to preltx group (p = 0.045). additionally, in postltx group, ammp-8 concentration was significantly higher in patients with severe periodontitis compared to those with no/mild periodontitis (p = 0.016). ltx appears to affect ammp-8 level, but not bacterial findings in patients after ltx. determination of ammp-8 level in patients after ltx with immunosuppressive medication might lead to wrong interpretation of the results.
human_metabolism	synthetic polyesters have deeply impacted various biomedical and engineering fields, such as tissue scaffolding and therapeutic delivery. currently, many applications involving polyesters are being explored with polymers derived from monomers that are endogenous to the human metabolism. examples of these monomers include glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, and lactic, sebacic, citric, succinic, alpha-ketoglutaric, and fumaric acids. in terms of mechanical versatility, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, and biocompatibility, polyesters synthesized partially or completely from these monomers can display a wide range of properties. the flexibility in these macromolecular properties allows for materials to be tailored according to the needs of a particular application. along with the presence of natural monomers that allows for a high probability of biocompatibility, there is also an added benefit that this class of polyesters is more environmentally friendly than many other materials used in biomedical engineering. while the selection of monomers may be limited by nature, these polymers have produced or have the potential to produce an enormous number of successes in vitro and in vivo.
human_metabolism	a rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was applied to human urine samples to discover new molecular biomarkers of the alteration of psychophysical well-being due to the environmental, physiological and confinement stress conditions achieved in the mars500 project. urine samples of crew members were submitted to metabolomic studies by means of separative techniques coupled with mass spectrometric techniques and data analysis. more than 2,000 metabolite features were found in each comparison, and more than 150 metabolites were identified for every differential analysis. significant modifications in eight metabolites were shared by the subjects under study.
immunology	antibodies against the toxin portion of recombinant immunotoxins (rit) reduce their efficacy and pose a potential safety risk. to overcome this problem we mutated the very immunogenic immunotoxin ss1p to produce lmb-t20, a de-immunized rit that has the eight human t-cell epitopes in ss1p modified or removed. to determine the effect of t-cell epitope removal in vivo we mapped the t-cell epitopes in immune-competent balb/c mice and found that these mice recognize two epitopes. one corresponds to the human immunodominant t-cell epitope and the other to a human subdominant epitope; both were eliminated in lmb-t20. we found that mice immunized with lmb-t20 did not have t-cell activation and did not develop anti-drug antibodies (ada), whereas mice immunized with ss1p, showed t-cell activation, and developed ada detected by both elisa and drug neutralizing assays. the ability of the mice treated with lmb-t20 to respond to other antigens was not compromised. we conclude that elimination of t-cell epitopes is sufficient to prevent formation of antibodies to an immunogenic foreign protein.cellular & molecular immunology (2017) published online 19 october 2015
southern_blotting	an early light-inducible protein (gbelip) isolated from immature ginkgo leaves by rapid amplification of cdna ends method contains a 570 bp open reading frame encoding a 189 amino acid protein, with significant homology to early light-inducible proteins from other plant species. the genomic dna of gbelip gene contains three exons and two introns. southern blotting revealed that gbelip is a single-copy gene in ginkgo. light, defense and stress responsive element were found in the promoter region of gbelip. gbelip expressional patterns were detected by real-time pcr at various conditions. elip expressions were variable at different time points of 1 day and increasing significantly at the commencement of light illumination then dropping to a basal level gradually. elip expression in small size leaves (1-1.5 cm width and 7-day age) was higher then middle (2-3 cm width and 15-day age) and large (4 cm width and 30-day age) size leaves. it revealed that elip expression was under the control of developmental regulation. under temperature and light intensity treatments, gbelip transcripts accumulation may relate to photoinhibition. the peak expression of gbelip appeared later by chilling than heating. meanwhile, gbelip expression under high light was higher than low light at both two temperatures. gbelip expression was also increased by wounding and methyl jasmonate (meja) treatment, but not corresponded with increasing malondialdehyde (mda) concentration. in conclusion, gbelip appears to be induced by an imbalance between chlorophyll formation and degradation during development or under abiotic stress. these results suggest that gbelip may function in response to environmental signals, possibly regulating responses to abiotic stresses.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background:extrapulmonary tuberculosis (eptb) constitutes about 15% to 20% of all cases of tuberculosis (tb). the confirmation of eptb has always been a challenge to laboratory personnel. we aim to evaluate the diagnostic potential of immunostaining with anti-mpt64 in various eptb specimens.materials and methods:we studied a total of 51 tb cases and 38 non-tb control specimens comprising of fine-needle aspirates and formalin-fixed biopsies. these were investigated using a combination of the ziehl-neelsen method, the lowenstein-jensen culture, immunostaining with anti-mpt64 and anti-bcg, and nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for is6110. results of all the tests were compared using nested-pcr as the gold standard.results:diagnostic validation of immunostaining for anti-mpt64 was performed using nested-pcr as the gold standard. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for immunostaining with anti-mpt64 were 100%, 97%, 97%, and 100%, respectively.conclusions:immunostaining using anti-mpt64 is a rapid and sensitive method for establishing an early and specific diagnosis of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. the technique is simple to be incorporated into routine pathology laboratories.
southern_blotting	a reproducible and highly efficient protocol for genetic transformation mediated by agrobacterium has been established for greengram (vigna radiata l. wilczek). double cotyledonary node (dcn) explants were inoculated with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba 4404 harboring a binary vector pcambia 2301 containing neomycin phosphotransferase (npt ii) gene as selectable marker, beta-glucuronidase (gus) as a reporter (uida) gene and annexin 1 bj gene. important parameters like optical density of agrobacterium culture, culture quantity, infection medium, infection and co-cultivation time and acetosyringone concentration were standardized to optimize the transformation frequency. kanamycin at a concentration of 100 mg/l was used to select transformed cells. transient and stable gus expressions were studied in transformed explants and regenerated putative plants, respectively. transformed shoot were produced on regeneration medium containing 100 mg/l kanamycin and 250 mg/l cefotaxime and rooted on 1/2 ms medium. transient and constitutive gus expression was observed in dcn explants and different tissues of t-0 and t-1 plants. rooted t-0 and t-1 shoots confirming polymerase chain reaction (pcr) positive for npt ii and annexin 1bj genes were taken to maturity to collect the seeds. integration of annexin gene into the greengram genome was confirmed by southern blotting.
genetics	parents have the opportunity to educate their children to facilitate behaviours and lifestyle habits that may prevent or delay genetic disease, or mitigate predispositions within the family. we sought to determine parents' understanding of genetic knowledge and heritability. using a quantitative survey methodology 108 volunteer participants were surveyed from a convenience sample of all parents/caregivers within the waiting room of a general children 's outpatient clinic. results indicated that average genetic knowledge levels were fairly high, with the majority of participants scoring 70-80 % correct on knowledge-based questions. further, scores were found to be positively correlated with education, but inversely correlated with self-perceived knowledge. this finding suggests that participants with less experience tended to overestimate their knowledge. we suggest that gaps in knowledge of genetics and heritability could be improved by using educational interventions such as media campaigns, provision of informational brochures, or changes to current high school curriculum which would increase exposure to genetics and heritability for both parents and children.
northern_blotting	high metabolic activity and low levels of antioxidant enzymes make neurons particularly prone to damage by reactive oxygen species. thus, repair of oxidative dna damage is essential for normal brain function. base excision repair is the major pathway for repair of oxidative dna damage, and is initiated by dna glycosylases recognizing and removing the damaged base. in mammalian cells at least five different dna glycosylases with overlapping substrate specificity, neil1, neil2, neil3, ogg1 and nth1, remove oxidative dna base lesions. here we report mrna expression and distribution of these five dna glycosylases in human and rodent brains using in situ hybridization and northern blotting supported by glycosylase activity assays. neil1, neil2, ogg1 and nth1 showed widespread expression at all ages. in situ hybridization studies in mouse brain showed that expression of mneil1 increased with age. in newborn mouse brain, mneil3 revealed a discrete expression pattern in brain regions known to harbour stem cell populations, i.e., the subventricular zone, the rostral migratory stream, and the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. expression of mneil3 decreased with age, and in old mice brains could be detected only in layer v of neocortex. mnth1 was constitutively expressed during lifespan. in northern blots, mogg1 expression showed a transient decrease followed by an increase after 8 weeks of age. assays for fapy dna glycosylase activity revealed increased activity level with age in all brain regions analyzed.
cell_biology	vascular disease, such as atherosclerosis and diabetic vasculopathy, is frequently complicated by vascular calcification. previously believed to be an end-stage process of unregulated mineral precipitation, it is now well established to be a multi-faceted disease influenced by the characteristics of its vascular location, the origins of calcifying cells and numerous regulatory pathways. it reflects the fundamental plasticity of the vasculature that is gradually being revealed by progress in vascular and stem cell biology. this review provides a brief overview of where we stand in our understanding of vascular calcification, facing the challenge of translating this knowledge into viable preventive and therapeutic strategies.

enzymology	polyketides are structurally and functionally diverse secondary metabolites that are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (pkss) using acyl-coa precursors. recent studies in the engineering and structural characterization of pkss have facilitated the use of target enzymes as biocatalysts to produce novel functionally optimized polyketides. these compounds may serve as potential drug leads. this review summarizes the insights gained from research on type iii pkss, from the discovery of chalcone synthase in plants to novel pkss in bacteria and fungi. to date, at least 15 families of type iii pkss have been characterized, highlighting the utility of pkss in the development of natural product libraries for therapeutic development.
polymerase_chain_reaction	glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system, which results in both a poor prognosis and outcome because of the aggressive progression of disease, growth and resistance to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. mir-140-5p is a small, non-coding single-stranded rna molecule, which was previously studied in the settings of human tongue cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. however, detailed data that formally demonstrate the contribution of mir-140-5p to glioma development are missing. similarly, relatively little is known about the relationship of mir-140-5p, vascular endothelial growth factor a, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in glioma progression. in this study, we found that mir-140-5p expression was significantly decreased in glioma tissues and in the glioma cell-lines u87 and u251 as compared with non-cancerous brain tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. in addition, mir-140-5p inhibited glioma cell proliferation and invasion and promoted glioma cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. interestingly, while the expression levels of mir-140-5p were higher in glioma cells, the messenger rna or protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor a and matrix metalloproteinase-2 were lower in glioma cells as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot assay, and immunohistochemistry. by contrast, downregulation in the expression levels of mir-140-5p augmented the messenger rna and protein expression levels of both vascular endothelial growth factor a and matrix metalloproteinase-2. these findings suggested that mir-140-5p inhibited glioma proliferation and invasion by regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor a/matrix metalloproteinase-2 signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo.
southern_blotting	to investigate the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between agricultural microorganisms and soil microorganisms in the environment, bacillus subtilis kb producing iturin and the pgpr recombinant strain pseudomonas fluorescens mx1 were used as model microorganisms. the soil samples of cucumber or tomato plants cultivated in pots and the greenhouse for a six month period were investigated by pcr, real-time pcr, southern hybridization, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) fingerprinting. our data from southern blotting and t-rflp patterns suggest that the model bacteria do not give significant impacts on the other bacteria in the pots and greenhouse during cultivation.
molecular_biology	purpose: to evaluate the expression of egfr, kras genes, micrornas-21 and 203 in colon and rectal cancer samples, correlated with their age at diagnosis, histological subtype, value of pretreatment cea, tnm staging and clinical outcome. methods: expression of genes and micrornas by real time pcr in tumor and non-tumor samples obtained from surgical treatment of 50 patients. results: an increased expression of micrornas-21 and 203 in tumor samples in relation to non-tumor samples was found. there was no statistically significant difference between the expression of these genes and micrornas when compared to age at diagnosis and histological subtype. the egfr gene showed higher expression in relation to the value of cea diagnosis. the expression of microrna-203 was progressively lower in relation to the tnm staging and was higher in the patient group in clinical remission. conclusions: the therapy of colon and rectum tumors based on micrornas remains under investigation reserving huge potential for future applications and clinical interventions in conjunction with existing therapies. we expect, based on the exposed data, to stimulate the development of new therapeutic possibilities, making the treatment of these tumors more effective.
polymerase_chain_reaction	noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans. real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time rt-pcr) is a promising molecular method for the detection of noroviruses. in this study, the performance of three taqman real-time rt-pcr assays was assessed, which were one commercially available real-time rt-pcr kit (assay a: norovirus real time rt-pcr kit) and two in-house real-time rt-pcr assays (assay b: lightcycler rna master hybprobe and assay c: realtime ready rna virus master). assays a and b showed higher sensitivity than assay c for norovirus gi, while they all had the same sensitivity (103 dna copies/ml) for gii dna standard controls. assay b had the highest efficiency for both genogroups. no cross-reactivity was observed among gi and gii noroviruses, rotavirus, hepatitis a virus, and poliovirus. the detection rates of these assays in gi and gii norovirus-positive fecal samples were not significantly different. however, the mean quantification cycle (cq) value of assay b for gii was lower than assays a and c with statistical significance (p-value, 0.000). all three real-time rt-pcr assays could detect a variety of noroviruses including gi. 2, gii. 2, gii. 3, gii. 4, gii. 6, gii. 12, gii. 17, and gii. 21. this study suggests assay b as a suitable assay for the detection and quantification of noroviruses gi and gii due to good analytical sensitivity and higher performance to amplify norovirus on dna standard controls and clinical samples.
enzymology	the activity of bioorganic chemistry group (bcg) within department of organic chemistry and technology at budapest university of technology and economics is related to various areas of synthetic chemistry, biotechnology and enzymology. this review gives an overview on the research activity of the group covering development of synthetic organic chemistry methods; stereoselective biotransformations with lipases, ammonia-lyases and further biocatalysts in batch and continuous-flow reactions; novel enzyme immobilization methods; and enzyme structural and mechanistic studies by experimental and computational techniques.
enzymology	though some genetic features of lactobacillar fructan hydrolases were elucidated, information about their enzymology or mutational analyses were scarce. lactobacillus casei iam1045 exhibits extracellular activity degrading inulin. after partial purification of the inulin-degrading protein from the spent culture medium, several fragments were obtained by protease digestion. based on their partial amino-acid sequences, oligonucleotide primers were designed, and its structural gene (levh1) was determined using the gene library constructed in the e. coli system. the levh1 gene encoded a protein (designated as levh1), of which calculated molecular mass and pl were 138.8-kda and 4.66, respectively. levh1 (1296 amino-acids long) was predicted to have a four-domain structure, containing (i) an n-terminal secretion signal of 40 amino-acids, (ii) variable domain of about 140 residues whose function is unclear, (iii) a catalytic domain of about 630 residues with glycoside-hydrolase activity consisting of two modules, a five-blade beta-propeller module linked to a beta-sandwich module, (iv) a c-terminal domain of about 490 residues comprising five nearly perfect repeat sequences of 80 residues homologous to equivalents of other hypothetical cell surface proteins, followed by 37-residues rich in ser/thr/pro/gly, a pentad lpqag (the lpxtg homologue). when overproduced in e. coli, the putative variable-catalytic domain region of about 770 residues exhibited exo-inulinase activity. deletion analyses demonstrated that the variable-catalytic domain region containing two modules is important for enzymatic activity. presence of eight conserved motifs (i-viii) was suggested in the catalytic domain by comparative analysis, among which motif viii was newly identified in the beta-sandwich module in this study. site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino-acids in these motifs revealed that d198, r388, d389 and e440, were crucial for inulinase activity. moreover, mutations of d502a and d683a in motif vi and viii respectively caused significant decrease in the activity. these results suggested that the variable domain and beta-sandwich module, besides the beta-propeller module, are important for inulin-degrading activity of levh1.

northern_blotting	the expression of cytochrome p-450 and cytochrome p-450 reductase (cpr) genes in the conterminous biotransformation of corticosteroids and pahs was studied in cunninghamella elegans 1785/21gp. we had previously used this strain as a microbial eucaryotic model for studying the relationship between mammalian steroid hydroxylation and the metabolization of pahs. we reported that cytochrome p-450 reductase is involved in the biotransformaton of cortexolone and phenanthrene. rt-pcr and northern blotting analyses indicated that the cytochrome p-450 and cpr genes appear to be inducible by both steroids and pahs. the expression of the cytochrome p-450 gene was increased ninefold and the expression of the cpr gene increased 6.4-fold in cultures with cortexolone and/or phenanthrene in comparison with controls. we conclude that the increase in cytochrome p-450 gene expression was accompanied by an increase in cytochrome p-450 enzymatic activity levels.
human_metabolism	details of the major pathways of metabolism have been elucidated, in large measure through work on experimental animals. it is unlikely that they differ qualitatively between mammalian species. the more important challenge facing researchers today is that of metabolic regulation, and of the integrated control of metabolic pathways in the whole organism. these aspects may well differ quantitatively or even qualitatively between species. in this review, methods for studying metabolism and metabolic regulation in humans are described. there are both scientific and practical advantages to performing studies of metabolic regulation in humans. the scientific advantages are clear from some fundamental differences in metabolic regulation between rats and humans, such as the importance of de novo lipogenesis to the deposition of body fat, and the metabolism of atherogenic triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. the practical advantages result mainly from the size of a human compared with that of most laboratory animals, enabling large blood samples to be obtained, and several measurement techniques to be applied at one time. reasons for the persistence of animal experimentation as the norm, rather than the exception, among life science researchers are discussed.
polymerase_chain_reaction	in preclinical studies, heregulin (hrg) expression was shown to be the most relevant predictive biomarker for response to patritumab, a fully human anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 3 monoclonal antibody. in support of a phase 2 study of erlotinib +/- patritumab in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), a reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) assay for relative quantification of hrg expression from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) nsclc tissue samples was developed and validated and described herein. test specimens included matched ffpe normal lung and nsclc and frozen nsclc tissue, and hrg-positive and hrg-negative cell lines. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was examined for functional performance. heregulin distribution was also analyzed across 200 nsclc commercial samples. applied biosystems taqman gene expression assays were run on the bio-rad cfx96 real-time pcr platform. heregulin rt-qpcr assay specificity, pcr efficiency, pcr linearity, and reproducibility were demonstrated. the final assay parameters included the qiagen ffpe rna extraction kit for rna extraction from ffpe nsclc tissue, 50 ng of rna input, and 3 reference (housekeeping) genes (hmbs, ipo8, and eif2b1), which had expression levels similar to hrg expression levels and were stable among ffpe nsclc samples. using the validated assay, unimodal hrg distribution was confirmed across 185 evaluable ffpe nsclc commercial samples. feasibility of an rtqpcr assay for the quantification of hrg expression in ffpe nsclc specimens was demonstrated.
polymerase_chain_reaction	exportin 5 (xpo5) is a microrna (mirna)-related nuclear export protein, and its disorder may lead to the dysregulation of mirnas. recent studies have demonstrated that the aberrant expression of xpo5 might participate in carcinogenesis in certain cancers. however, there is only limited information of xpo5 in thyroid cancer (tc) development. in our study, we quantified the expression level of xpo5 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in 64 tc patients' cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. after confirming the xpo5 expression, we evaluated the association between xpo5 potential functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and risk of tc in a chinese population (1140 cases vs 1230 controls). finally, luciferase assays were performed to investigate the function of the snp in xpo5 3' untranslation region. the message ribonucleic acid (rna) levels of xpo5 were significantly lower in cancer tissues than normal tissues (p=0.004). in snps screening, only 1 noble snp rs11077 was identified in xpo5 functional region. the results in our case-control study also confirmed that xpo5 rs11077 was significantly associated with onset of tc (gt/gg vs tt p=0.035, adjusted odds ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.54). the adverse influence of this polymorphism was mainly observed in age >45 years (p=0.028), female (p=0.020), t1 staging (p=0.026), n1 (p=0.038), metastasis (p=0.031 m0, and p=0.035 for m1), and early stage (i+ii) (p=0.021). a following luciferase test revealed the critical role of rs11077 for triggering the xpo5 expression. furthermore, patients with g allele of rs11077 showed lower xpo5 expression level. xpo5 snp rs11077 influences the expression of xpo5, and this snp could also be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of tc in clinical, especially in chinese population.
immunology	lipid analysis performed by high performance thin layer chromatography (hptlc) is a relatively simple, cost-effective method of analyzing a broad range of lipids. the function of lipids (e. g., in host-pathogen interactions or host entry) has been reported to play a crucial role in cellular processes. here, we show a method to determine lipid composition, with a focus on the cholesterol level of primary blood-derived neutrophils, by hptlc in comparison to high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the aim was to investigate the role of lipid/cholesterol alterations in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). net release is known as a host defense mechanism to prevent pathogens from spreading within the host. therefore, blood-derived human neutrophils were treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (m beta cd) to induce lipid alterations in the cells. using hptlc and hplc, we have shown that m beta cd treatment of the cells leads to lipid alterations associated with a significant reduction in the cholesterol content of the cell. at the same time, m beta cd treatment of the neutrophils led to the formation of nets, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. in summary, here we present a detailed method to study lipid alterations in neutrophils and the formation of nets.
enzymology	background: the ige-binding dna aptamer 17.4 is known to inhibit the interaction of ige with the high-affinity ige fc receptor fc epsilon r1. while this and other aptamers have been widely used and studied, there has been relatively little investigation of the kinetics and energetics of their interactions with their targets, by either single-molecule or ensemble methods. methods: the dissociation kinetics of the d17.4/ige complex and the effects of temperature and ionic strength were studied using fluorescence anisotropy and single-molecule spectroscopy, and activation parameters calculated. results: the dissociation of d17.4/ige complex showed a strong dependence on temperature and salt concentration. the k(off) of d17.4/ige complex was calculated to be (2.92 +/- 0.18) x 10(-3) s(-1) at 50 mm nacl, and (1.44 +/- 0.02) x 10(-2) s(-1) at 300 mm nacl, both in 1 mm mgcl2 and 25 degrees c. the dissociation activation energy for the d17.4/ige complex, e-a, was 16.0 +/- 1.9 kcal mol(-1) at 50 mm nacl and 1 mm mgcl2. interestingly, we found that the c19a mutant of d17.4 with stabilized stem structure showed slower dissociation kinetics compared to d17.4. single-molecule observations of surface-immobilized d17.4/ige showed much faster dissociation kinetics, and heterogeneity not observable by ensemble techniques. conclusions: the increasing k(off) value with increasing salt concentration is attributed to the electrostatic interactions between d17.4/ige. we found that both the changes in activation enthalpy and activation entropy are insignificant with increasing nacl concentration. the slower dissociation of the mutant c19a/ige complex is likely due to the enhanced stability of the aptamer. general significance: the activation parameters obtained by applying transition state analysis to kinetic data can provide details on mechanisms of molecular recognition and have applications in drug design. single-molecule dissociation kinetics showed greater kinetic complexity than was observed in the ensemble in-solution systems, potentially reflecting conformational heterogeneity of the aptamer. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

cell_biology	purpose of review kruppel-like factors (klfs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate integral functions of endothelial cells including inflammation, proliferation, growth, apoptosis, cell differentiation and plasticity, and migration. this review will focus on the role of klfs in physiological activity and their loss in vascular pathology. recent findings new studies have pointed at the role of micrornas as repressors of klfs in atherosclerotic areas providing another level of signaling regulation of klfs. summary klfs are important regulators of almost all facets of endothelial biology, making them a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. further research is needed to fully characterize their functions.
polymerase_chain_reaction	ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites of great medical and veterinary significance that can transmit bacteria, protozoa, fungi and viruses, causing a variety of human and animal diseases worldwide. in the present study, the intestinal bacterial flora associated with haemaphysalis flava ticks in different developmental stages were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). eleven distinct dgge bands were found using pcr-dgge method. sequences analyses indicated that they belonged to bacillus cereus, candidatus rickettsia, erwinia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, rickettsia peacockii, rickettsia helvetica, rickettsia slovaca, staphylococcus simulans and uncultured bacterium clone. our find that the k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa isolates were presented in all h. flava ticks in different developmental stages. the present results indicated that zoonotic pathogens are present in h. flava ticks in henan province, china. to our knowledge, this is the first report on intestinal bacterial flora associated with h. flava ticks in china.
human_metabolism	background and objective: phytoestrogens (weak estrogens found in plants or derived from plant precursors by human metabolism) have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of a number of cancers. however, epidemiologic studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of a comprehensive phytoestrogen database for quantifying exposure. the purpose of this research was to develop such a database for use with food-frequency questionnaires in large epidemiologic studies. methods: the database is based on consumption patterns derived from semistructured interviews with 118 african-american, latina, and white women residing in california 's san francisco bay area. hplc-mass spectrometry was used to determine the content of seven specific phytoestrogenic compounds (i.e. the isoflavones: genistein, daidzein, biochanin a, and formononetin; the coumestan: coumestrol; and the plant lignans: matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol) in each of 112 food items/groups. results: traditional soy-based foods were found to contain high levels of genistein and daidzein, as expected, as well as substantial amounts of coumestrol. a wide variety of ""hidden"" sources of soy (that is, soy protein isolate, soy concentrate, or soy flour added to foods) was observed. several other foods (such as various types of sprouts and dried fruits, garbanzo beans, asparagus, garlic, and licorice) were also found to be substantial contributors of one or more of the phytoestrogens analyzed. conclusions: databases, such as the one described here, are important in assessing the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and cancer risk in epidemiologic studies. agencies, such as the united states department of agriculture (usda), that routinely provide data on food composition, on which epidemiologic investigations into dietary health effects are based, should consider instituting programs for the analysis of phytochemicals, including the phytoestrogens.
immunology	the ability of the adaptive immune system to respond to arbitrary pathogens stems from the broad diversity of immune cell surface receptors. this diversity originates in a stochastic dna editing process (vdj recombination) that acts on the surface receptor gene each time a new immune cell is created from a stem cell. by analyzing t-cell receptor (tcr) sequence repertoires taken from the blood and thymus of mice of different ages, we quantify the changes in the vdj recombination process that occur from embryo to young adult. we find a rapid increase with age in the number of random insertions and a dramatic increase in diversity. because the blood accumulates thymic output over time, blood repertoires are mixtures of different statistical recombination processes, and we unravel the mixture statistics to obtain a picture of the time evolution of the early immune system. sequence repertoire analysis also allows us to detect the statistical impact of selection on the output of the vdj recombination process. the effects we find are nearly identical between thymus and blood, suggesting that our analysis mainly detects selection for proper folding of the tcr receptor protein. we further find that selection is weaker in laboratory mice than in humans and it does not affect the diversity of the repertoire.
immunology	background: celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by an accumulation of immune cells in the duodenal mucosa as a consequence of both adaptive and innate immune responses to undigested gliadin peptides. mast cells (mcs) are innate immune cells that are a major source of costimulatory signals and inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa. although mcs have previously been associated with cd, functional studies have never been performed. objective: we aimed at evaluating the role of mcs in the pathogenesis of cd. methods: intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with cd were scored according to the marsh classification and characterized for leukocyte infiltration and mc distribution. moreover, mc reactivity to gliadin and its peptides was characterized by using in vitro assays. results: infiltrating mcs were associated with the severity of mucosal damage, and their numbers were increased in patients with higher marsh scores. mcs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators. immunohistochemical characterization of infiltrating mcs and the effects of gliadin peptides on intestinal mcs indicated an increase in proinflammatory mc function in advanced stages of the disease. this was also associated with increased neutrophil accumulation, the prevalence of m1 macrophages, and the severity of tissue damage. conclusion: we provide a description of the progressive stages of cd, in which mcs are the hallmark of the inflammatory process. thus the view of cd should be revised, and the contribution of mcs in the onset and progression of cd should be reconsidered in developing new therapeutic approaches.
northern_blotting	based on the significant differences in the resistance to sclerotinia sclerotiorum between two brassica napus cultivars, zhongr888 and zhongyou821, near isogenic lines (nils) were established. the resistance differences between zhongyou821 and bc5 progeny (the fifth generation from a cross between zhongyou821 and zhongr888 with zhongyou821 as successive backcross parent) was displayed by cdna-aflp and differential transcripts-derived fragments (tdfs). the full-length cdna of 1,707 bp with 1,323 bp open reading frame (orf, open box), named rsk was identified by rt-race from the resistance related fragment 40-2 in zhongyou821. it encoded a protein of 440 amino acid residues, which contained a putative extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of rsk revealed that it had high homology to arabidopsis thaliana kinase involved in protein binding, and had a conserved region of lrr-ri, indicating it might be a member of leucine-rich repeats, ribonuclease inhibitor-like subfamily. dna sequences of 1,685 bp and 1,703 bp without an intron were also identified from zhongyou821 and bc5, respectively. expression analysis showed that rsk might play a role in disease resistance pathways.
human_metabolism	a $600 million nutritional supplements market growing at 30% every year attests to consumer awareness of, and interests in, health benefits attributed to these supplements. for over 80years the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) consumption for human health has been established. the fda recently approved the use of -3 pufas in supplements. additionally, the market for -3 pufa ingredients grew by 24.3% last year, which affirms their popularity and public awareness of their benefits. pufas are essential for normal human growth; however, only minor quantities of the beneficial -3 pufas eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) are synthesized by human metabolism. rather pufas are obtained via dietary or nutritional supplementation and modified into other beneficial metabolites. a vast literature base is available on the health benefits and biological roles of -3 pufas and their metabolism; however, information on their dietary sources and palatability of foods incorporated with -3 pufas is limited. dha and epa are added to many foods that are commercially available, such as infant and pet formulae, and they are also supplemented in animal feed to incorporate them in consumer dairy, meat, and poultry products. the chief sources of epa and dha are fish oils or purified preparations from microalgae, which when added to foods, impart a fishy flavor that is considered unacceptable. this fishy flavor is completely eliminated by extensively purifying preparations of n-3 pufa sources. while n-3 pufa lipid autoxidation is considered the main cause of fishy flavor, the individual oxidation products identified thus far, such as unsaturated carbonyls, do not appear to contribute to fishy flavor or odor. alternatively, various compound classes such as free fatty acids and volatile sulfur compounds are known to impart fishy flavor to foods. identification of the causative compounds to reduce and eventually eliminate fishy flavor is important for consumer acceptance of pufa-fortified foods.
cell_biology	molecular ecologists have good reasons to be excited about the newest dna/rna sequencing technologies. however, this exuberance should be tempered with a hefty dose of reality: new sequencing technologies come with significant new challenges. herein, we offer a brief overview of some practical problems encountered during transcriptomics studies conducted in our laboratory, and of nontrivial issues that prospective practitioners should consider. these include template contamination (e.g. from xenobiotics) and the cutting-room floor problem, whereby most of the data are often unassembled, unannotated and unused. we also highlight computational requirements, including hardware, personnel time and associated skill sets. we are very optimistic about the future of molecular ecology, but we hope this cautionary overview will help neophytes better recognize some key challenges associated with new technologies.
genetics	eimeria maxima is one of the most pathogenic species of avian coccidia, yet it is unknown why different e. maxima strains differ in the pathogenic effects they cause in chickens. the purpose of this study was to determine if a more pathogenic e. maxima strain (apu1) was also more fecund than a less pathogenic e. maxima strain (apu2). at identical doses, e. maxima apu1 always produces greater intestinal lesions and lower weight gain compared to e. maxima apu2. using a dose response study, median and mean intestinal lesion scores in e. maxima apu2-infected chickens were greater by a score of 1-1.5 compared to chickens infected with e. maxima apu2. likewise, weight gain depression in e. maxima apu1-infected chickens was 20-25% greater (equivalent to 110-130 g body weight) than in e. maxima apu2-infected chickens. in order to understand the underlying cause of these observed clinical effects, 120 broiler chicks (5 oocyst levels, 6 replicates/level) were inoculated with various doses of e. maxima apu1 or apu2 oocysts. the dynamics of oocyst shedding was investigated by collecting fecal material every 12 h from 114 to 210 h post-inoculation (p.i.) and every 24 h thereafter from 210 to 306 h, and then processed for measuring e. maxima oocyst output. oocysts were first observed at 138 h p.i., and time of peak oocyst production was nearly identical for both e. maxima apu1 and apu2 around 150-162 h. total oocyst production was 1.1-2.6 fold higher at all dose levels for e. maxima apu1 compared to e. maxima apu2, being significantly higher (p <0.05) at the log 1.5 dose level. other groups of chickens were infected with higher doses of e. maxima apu1 or apu2 oocysts, and intestinal lesions were assessed by histology at 72, 96, 120, and 144h p.i. although schizonts, gamonts, and oocysts were observed at expected time-points, no obvious differences were noted in lesions induced by the two e. maxima strains. this study showed that the greater fecundity of e. maxima apu1 compared to e. maxima apu2 explains in part the observed differences in pathogenicity of the two e. maxima strains, but that other factors may contribute to differences in observed clinical effects.
human_metabolism	we propose a computationally efficient probabilistic modeling, methodology to estimate the adverse effects on humans of exposure to contaminated groundwater. our work is aligned with the standard suggested by the regulatory agencies and allows to propagate uncertainty from hydrogeological, toxicological and behavioral parameters to the final health risk endpoint. the problem under consideration consists of a contaminated aquifer supplying water to a population. contamination stems from a continuous source that feeds a steady plume which constitutes the hazard source. this scenario is particularly suited for napl pollutants. the erratic displacement of the contaminant plume in groundwater, due to the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, is characterized within the lagrangian stochastic framework which enables the complete probabilistic characterization of the contaminant concentration at an environmentally sensitive location. following the probabilistic characterization of flow and transport, we quantify the adverse health effects on humans. the dose response assessment involves the estimation of the uncertain effects of the exposure to a given contaminant while accounting for the exposed individual 's metabolism. the model integrates groundwater transport, exposure and human metabolism in a comprehensive probabilistic framework which allows the assessment of the risk probability through a novel simple analytical solution. aside from its computational efficiency, the analytical features of the framework allows the assessment of uncertainty arising from the hydrogeological parameters.

northern_blotting	the enolase2 gene is usually expressed in mature neurons and also named neuron specific enolase (nse). in the present study, we first obtained the nse gene cdna sequence by using the race method based on the expressed sequence tag (est) fragment from the cdna library of gekko japonicus and identified one transcript of about 2.2 kb in central nervous system of gekko japonicus by northern blotting. the open reading frame of nse is 1305 bp, which encodes a 435 amino-acid protein. we further investigated the multi-tissue expression pattern of nse by rt-pcr and found that the expression of nse mrna was very high in brain, spinal cord and low in heart, while it was not detectable in other tissues. the real-time quantitative pcr was used to investigate the time-dependent change in the expression of the nse mrna level after gecko spinal cord transection and found it significantly increased at one day, reaching its highest level three days post-injury and then decreasing at the seventh day of the experiment. the recombinant plasmid of pet-32a-nse was constructed and induced to express his fused nse protein. the purified nse protein was used to immunize rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera. the titer of the antiserum was more than 1:65536 determined by elisa. western blotting showed that the prepared antibody could specifically recognize the recombinant and endogenous nse protein. the result of immunohistochemistry revealed that positive signals were present in neurons of the brain and the spinal cord. this study provided the tools of cdna and polyclonal antibody for studying nse function in gekko japonicus.
enzymology	background: chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide on earth and as such a great target for bioconversion applications. the phylum bacteroidetes is one of nature 's most ubiquitous bacterial lineages and is essential in the global carbon cycle with many members being highly efficient degraders of complex carbohydrates. however, despite their specialist reputation in carbohydrate conversion, mechanisms for degrading recalcitrant crystalline polysaccharides such as chitin and cellulose are hitherto unknown. results: here we describe a complete functional analysis of a novel polysaccharide utilization locus (pul) in the soil bacteroidete flavobacterium johnsoniae, tailored for conversion of chitin. the f. johnsoniae chitin utilization locus (chiul) consists of eleven contiguous genes encoding carbohydrate capture and transport proteins, enzymes, and a two-component sensor-regulator system. the key chitinase (chia) encoded by chiul is atypical in terms of known bacteroidetes-affiliated pul mechanisms as it is not anchored to the outer cell membrane and consists of multiple catalytic domains. we demonstrate how the extraordinary hydrolytic efficiency of chia derives from synergy between its multiple chitinolytic (endo-and exo-acting) and previously unidentified chitin-binding domains. reverse genetics show that chia and pul-encoded proteins involved in sugar binding, import, and chitin sensing are essential for efficient chitin utilization. surprisingly, the chiul encodes two pairs of susc/d-like outer membrane proteins. ligand-binding and structural studies revealed functional differences between the two susd-like proteins that enhance scavenging of chitin from the environment. the combined results from this study provide insight into the mechanisms employed by bacteroidetes to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides and reveal important novel aspects of the pul paradigm. conclusions: by combining reverse genetics to map essential pul genes, structural studies on outer membrane chitin-binding proteins, and enzymology, we provide insight into the mechanisms employed by bacteroidetes to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides and introduce a new saccharolytic mechanism used by the phylum bacteroidetes. the presented discovery and analysis of the chiul will greatly benefit future enzyme discovery efforts as well as studies regarding enzymatic intramolecular synergism.
genetics	dams fragment aquatic networks and impact the evolutionary dynamics of migratory fish populations. historically, the lake pend oreille-lower clark fork river system in idaho and montana supported a large metapopulation of adfluvial westslope cutthroat trout (westslope). these fish matured in the lake and made upstream spawning migrations to their natal tributaries in the river. currently, dams allow downstream passage for juvenile fish to the lake, but no upstream passage for adults. we examined 19 microsatellite and anonymous nuclear loci to characterize spatial patterns of non-native rainbow trout (rainbow) genetic introgression in westslope populations upstream and downstream of these dams. we detected hybridization at 20 of 42 sites sampled throughout the system, with rainbow introgression ranging from 1.1 to 99.8%. rainbow introgression was higher in tributaries downstream of both dams (12 of 18 sites downstream vs 6 of 22 sites upstream). within tributaries, hybrids were more common in lower sections and only one sampled site contained a hybrid swarm. fish collected below both dams during the spawning migration were admixtures of westslope, rainbows and hybrids with an average rainbow introgression of 48%. phenotypic criteria reduced rainbow introgression to less than 1% for putative westslope identified for selective upstream transport at both dams. lack of upstream fish passage at these dams has likely constrained spread of hybridization and increased isolation among non-hybridized westslope populations by reducing the abundance of the migratory life history form in areas upstream of these dams.
northern_blotting	fusarium wilt, caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (foc), is among the most destructive diseases of banana (musa spp.). because no credible control measures are available, development of resistant cultivars through genetic engineering is the only option. we investigated whether intron hairpin rna (ihprna)-mediated expression of small interfering rnas (sirnas) targeted against vital fungal genes (velvet and fusarium transcription factor 1) in transgenic banana could achieve effective resistance against foc. partial sequences of these two genes were assembled as ihprnas in suitable binary vectors (ihprna-vel and ihprna-ftf1) and transformed into embryogenic cell suspensions of banana cv. rasthali by agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. eleven transformed lines derived from ihprna-vel and twelve lines derived from ihprna-ftf1 were found to be free of external and internal symptoms of foc after 6-week-long greenhouse bioassays. the five selected transgenic lines for each construct continued to resist foc at 8 months postinoculation. presence of specific sirnas derived from the two ihprnas in transgenic banana plants was confirmed by northern blotting and illumina sequencing of small rnas derived from the transgenic banana plants. the present study represents an important effort in proving that host-induced post-transcriptional ihprna-mediated gene silencing of vital fungal genes can confer efficient resistance against debilitating pathogens in crop plants.
immunology	high-throughput screening (hts) is currently the mainstay for the identification of chemical entities capable of modulating biochemical reactions or cellular processes. with the advancement of biotechnologies and the high translational potential of small molecules, a number of innovative approaches in drug discovery have evolved, which explains the resurgent interest in the use of hts. the oncology field is currently the most active research area for drug screening, with no major breakthrough made for the identification of new immunomodulatory compounds targeting transplantation-related complications or autoimmune ailments. here, we present a novel in vitro murine fluorescent-based lymphocyte assay easily adapted for the identification of new immunomodulatory compounds. this assay uses t or b cells derived from a transgenic mouse, in which the nur77 promoter drives gfp expression upon t-or b-cell receptor stimulation. as the gfp intensity reflects the activation/ transcriptional activity of the target cell, our assay defines a novel tool to study the effect of given compound(s) on cellular/biological responses. for instance, a primary screening was performed using 4,398 compounds in the absence of a ""target hypothesis"", which led to the identification of 160 potential hits displaying immunomodulatory activities. thus, the use of this assay is suitable for drug discovery programs exploring large chemical libraries prior to further in vitro/in vivo validation studies.
southern_blotting	immortalized human precartilaginous stem cells (ipscs) were established to provide stable cell resource for the study of the molecular mechanism of gene targeting on the differentiation of pscs. plasmid pcmvsv40t/pur containing simian virus 40 large t antigen gene (sv40tag) was transfected into human pscs by using lipofectin transfection. colonies were isolated by puromycin selection and expanded by multiple passages. immunohistochemistry, rt-pcr and southern blotting were used to identify the transfected cells and to detect the expression and integration of sv40tag in expanded cell lines. the positive colonies were isolated and subcultured, designated immortalized precartilaginous stem cells (ipscs), which were confirmed as fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (fgfr-3) positive cells by immunohistochemistry and rt-pcr. sv40tag cdna was found in cultured ipscs of passage 8 by southern blotting, and the expressions of sv40tag mrna and protein were confirmed by rt-pcr. these findings suggested that ipscs strain with sv40tag was constructed successfully.
cell_biology	synthetic binding proteins are constructed using nonantibody molecular scaffolds. over the last two decades, in-depth structural and functional analyses of synthetic binding proteins have improved combinatorial library designs and selection strategies, which have resulted in potent platforms that consistently generate binding proteins to diverse targets with affinity and specificity that rival those of antibodies. favorable attributes of synthetic binding proteins, such as small size, freedom from disulfide bond formation and ease of making fusion proteins, have enabled their unique applications in protein science, cell biology and beyond. here, we review recent studies that illustrate how synthetic binding proteins are powerful probes that can directly link structure and function, often leading to new mechanistic insights. we propose that synthetic proteins will become powerful standard tools in diverse areas of protein science, biotechnology and medicine.
immunology	in recent years, the myocardium has been rediscovered under the lenses of immunology, and lymphocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies with different etiologies. aging is an important risk factor for heart diseases, and it also has impact on the immune system. thus, we sought to determine whether immunological activity would influence myocardial structure and function in elderly mice. morphological, functional, and molecular analyses revealed that the age-related myocardial impairment occurs in parallel with shifts in the composition of tissue-resident leukocytes and with an accumulation of activated cd4+ foxp3(-)(forkhead box p3) ifn-gamma(+) t cells in the heart-draining lymph nodes. a comprehensive characterization of different aged immune-deficient mouse strains revealed that t cells significantly contribute to age-related myocardial inflammation and functional decline. upon adoptive cell transfer, the t cells isolated from the mediastinal lymph node (med-ln) of aged animals exhibited increased cardiotropism, compared with cells purified from young donors or from other irrelevant sites. nevertheless, these cells caused rather mild effects on cardiac functionality, indicating that myocardial aging might stem from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic (immunological) factors. taken together, the data herein presented indicate that heart-directed immune responses may spontaneously arise in the elderly, even in the absence of a clear tissue damage or concomitant infection. these observations might shed new light on the emerging role of t cells in myocardial diseases, which primarily affect the elderly population.
molecular_biology	as bacterial resistance becomes increasingly common, a new hybrid peptide, cecropina-magainin (kwalskegpgkflgkkkkf), has been developed that can kill a broad spectrum of bacteria without damaging human cells. the mechanism of antibacterial toxicity for the hybrid peptides is unknown. herein, we investigate the localization of the hybrid peptide in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the minimum inhibitory concentration was 64 mu g/ml. the hybrid peptides could enhance the hydrophobicity of mrsa. dye leakage experiments showed that the hybrid peptides caused dye leakage from liposomes. the hybrid peptides influenced the permeability of the outer membrane and plasma membrane of mrsa. after cecropina-magainin treatment of mrsa, the membrane ultrastructure was damaged and the concentration of k+ increased. ultimately, the peptide destroyed the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, allowing the dye propidium iodide to enter the cytoplasm. therefore, the hybrid antibacterial peptide can kill mrsa.

enzymology	human 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylase (ogg1) excises the mutagenic oxidative dna lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxog) from dna. kinetic characterization of ogg1 is undertaken to measure the rates of 8-oxog excision and product release. when the ogg1 concentration is lower than substrate dna, time courses of product formation are biphasic; a rapid exponential phase (i.e. burst) of product formation is followed by a linear steady-state phase. the initial burst of product formation corresponds to the concentration of enzyme properly engaged on the substrate, and the burst amplitude depends on the concentration of enzyme. the first-order rate constant of the burst corresponds to the intrinsic rate of 8-oxog excision and the slower steady-state rate measures the rate of product release (product dna dissociation rate constant, k(off)). here, we describe steady-state, pre-steady-state, and single-turnover approaches to isolate and measure specific steps during ogg1 catalytic cycling. a fluorescent labeled lesion-containing oligonucleotide and purified ogg1 are used to facilitate precise kinetic measurements. since low enzyme concentrations are used to make steady-state measurements, manual mixing of reagents and quenching of the reaction can be performed to ascertain the steady-state rate (k(off)). additionally, extrapolation of the steady-state rate to a point on the ordinate at zero time indicates that a burst of product formation occurred during the first turnover (i.e. y-intercept is positive). the first-order rate constant of the exponential burst phase can be measured using a rapid mixing and quenching technique that examines the amount of product formed at short time intervals (s). these approaches can measure elementary rate constants that influence the efficiency of removal of a dna lesion.
human_metabolism	astrocytes are important for normal brain functioning. astrocytes are metabolic regulators of the brain that exert many functions such as the preservation of blood-brain barrier (bbb) function, clearance of toxic substances, and generation of antioxidant molecules and growth factors. these functions are fundamental to sustain the function and survival of neurons and other brain cells. for these reasons, the protection of astrocytes has become relevant for the prevention of neuronal death during brain pathologies such as parkinson 's disease, alzheimer 's disease, stroke, and other neurodegenerative conditions. currently, different strategies are being used to protect the main astrocytic functions during neurological diseases, including the use of growth factors, steroid derivatives, mesenchymal stem cell paracrine factors, nicotine derivatives, and computational biology tools. moreover, the combined use of experimental approaches with bioinformatics tools such as the ones obtained through system biology has allowed a broader knowledge in astrocytic protection both in normal and pathological conditions. in the present review, we highlight some of these recent paradigms in assessing astrocyte protection using experimental and computational approaches and discuss how they could be used for the study of restorative therapies for the brain in pathological conditions.
immunology	inadequate access to prevention and medical treatment for female sex workers (sw) represents a challenge for the german health system. accessibility and care for sw in bochum (germany) through a cooperation between the interdisciplinary immunology outpatient clinic, center for sexual health and medicine of st. josef 's hospital, the bochum health department and the madonna e.v. was the focus of this work. medical outreach services were provided for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (sti) in sw in brothels in bochum between august 2013 and january 2014. after clarification and verbal consent from the sw, free hiv, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis tests were offered and carried out using pseudonyms for the sw. a total of 112 sw were reached (up to 55.4 % within the framework of the sti outreach study). of the sw, 94.6 % had an immigrant background. the majority (61.3 %) of sw were between 20 und 29 years old. only 19.0 % of the collective had health insurance. the following stis were diagnosed: 12.5 % chlamydia, 6.2 % syphilis, 3.6 % gonorrhea, 3.6 % trichomoniasis, and 0.9 % hiv. these results were compared with results from sti studies in sw in germany. treatment was performed in accordance with the standards of the german sti society. the offer improved the accessibility and the utilization of medical services by sw in bochum. a further improvement of services is urgently needed.
northern_blotting	the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase, encoded by pnp) is a major player in bacterial rna decay. in escherichia coli, pnpase expression is post-transcriptionally regulated at the level of mrna stability. the primary transcript is very efficiently processed by the endonuclease rnase iii at a specific site and the processed pnp mrna is rapidly degraded in a pnpase-dependent manner. while investigating the pnpase autoregulation mechanism we found, by uv-cross-linking experiments, that the ribosomal protein s1 in crude extracts binds to the pnp-mrna leader region. we assayed the potential role of s1 protein in pnp gene regulation by modulating s1 expression from depletion to overexpression. we found that s1 depletion led to a sharp decrease of the amount of pnp and other tested mrnas, as detected by northern blotting, whereas s1 overexpression caused a strong stabilization of pnp and the other transcripts. surprisingly, mrna stabilization depended on pnpase, as it was not observed in a pnp deletion strain. pnpase-dependent stabilization, however, was not detected by chemical decay assay of bulk mrna. overall, our data suggest that pnpase exonucleolytic activity may be modulated by the translation potential of the target mrnas and that, upon ribosomal protein s1 overexpression, pnpase protects from degradation a set of full-length mrnas. it thus appears that a single mrna species may be differentially targeted to either decay or pnpase-dependent stabilization, thus preventing its depletion in conditions of fast turnover.
immunology	p53 was reported to be an attractive immunotherapy target because it is mutated in approximately half of human cancers, resulting in its inactivation and often accumulation in tumor cells. peptides derived from p53 are presented by class i mhc molecules and may act as tumor-associated epitopes which could be targeted by p53-specific t cells. interestingly, it was recently shown that there is a lack of significant correlation between p53 expression levels in tumors and their recognition by p53-tcr transduced t cells. to better understand the influence of the mutational status of p53 on its presentation by the mhc system and on t cell antitumor reactivity, we generated several mutant p53 constructs and expressed them in hla-a2(+)/p53(-) cells. upon co-culture with p53-specific t cells, we measured the specific recognition of p53-expressing target cells by means of cytokine secretion, marker upregulation and cytotoxicity, and in parallel determined p53 expression levels by intracellular staining. we also examined the relevance of antigen presentation components on p53 recognition and the impact of mutant p53 expression on cell-cycle dynamics. our results show that selected p53 mutations altering protein stability can modulate p53 presentation to t cells, leading to a differential immune reactivity inversely correlated with measured p53 protein levels. thus, p53 may behave differently than other classical tumor antigens and its mutational status should therefore be taken into account when elaborating immunotherapy treatments of cancer patients targeting p53.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background/objectives: although the antioxidative effects of lycopene are generally known, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of lycopene are not fully elucidated. this study aimed to examine the role and mechanism of lycopene as an inhibitor of inflammation. methods/materials: lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated sw 480 human colorectal cancer cells were treated with 0, 10, 20, and 30 pm lycopene. the mtt assay was performed to determine the effects of lycopene on cell proliferation. western blotting was performed to observe the expression of inflammation-related proteins, including nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappa b), inhibitor kappa b (i kappa b), mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), extracellular signal-related kinase (erk), c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 (p38 map kinase). real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to investigate the mrna expression of tumor necrosis factor a (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2). concentrations of nitric oxide (no) and prostaglandin e-2 (pge(2)) were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. results: in cells treated with lycopene and lps, the mrna expression of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, inos, and cox-2 were decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). the concentrations of pge2 and no decreased according to the lycopene concentration (p < 0.05). the protein expressions of nf-kappa b and jnk were decreased significantly according to lycopene concertation (p < 0.05). conclusions: lycopene restrains nf-kappa b and jnk activation, which causes inflammation, and suppresses the expression of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, cox-2, and inos in sw480 human colorectal cancer cells.
southern_blotting	transgenic technology has been successfully used for gene function analyses and trait improvement in cereal plants. however, its usage is limited in woody plants, especially in the difficult-to-transform but commercially viable hybrid poplar. in this work, an efficient regeneration and transformation system was established for the production of two hybrid aspen clones: populus alba x p. berolinensis and populus davidiana x p. bolleana. a plant transformation vector designed to express the reporter gene uida, encoding beta-glucuronidase (gus), driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, was used to detect transformation event at early stages of plant regeneration, and to optimize the parameters that may affect poplar transformation efficiency. bacterium strain and age of leaf explant are two major factors that affect transformation efficiency. addition of thidiazuron (tdz) improved both regeneration and transformation efficiency. the transformation efficiency is approximately 9.3% for p. alba x p. berolinensis and 16.4% for p. davidiana x p. bolleana. using this system, transgenic plants were usually produced in less than 1 month after co-cultivation. the growth characteristics and morphology of transgenic plants were identical to the untransformed wild type plants, and the transgenes could be inherited by vegetative propagation, as confirmed by pcr, southern blotting, rt-pcr and beta-glucuronidase staining analyses. the establishment of this system will help to facilitate the studies of gene functions in tree growth and development at a genome level, and as well as the introduction of some valuable traits in aspen breeding.
genetics	study question: do genetic effects regulate gene expression in human endometrium? summary answer:this study demonstrated strong genetic effects on endometrial gene expression and some evidence for genetic regulation of gene expression in a menstrual cycle stage-specific manner. what is known already:genetic effects on expression levels for many genes are tissue specific. endometrial gene expression varies across menstrual cycle stages and between individuals, but there are limited data on genetic control of expression in endometrium. study design, size, duration:we analysed genome-wide genotype and gene expression data to map cis expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) in endometrium. participants/materials, setting, methods:we recruited 123 women of european ancestry. dna samples from blood were genotyped on illumina humancoreexome chips. total rna was extracted from endometrial tissues. whole-transcriptome profiles were characterized using illumina human ht-12 v4.0 expression beadchips. we performed eqtl mapping with similar to 8 000 000 genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and 12 329 genes. main results and the role of chance:we identified a total of 18 595 cis snp-probe associations at a study-wide level of significance (p < 1 x 10(-7)), which correspond to independent eqtls for 198 unique genes. the eqtls with the largest effect in endometrial tissue were rs4902335 for churc1 (p = 1.05 x 10(-32)) and rs147253019 for zp3 (p = 8.22 x 10(-30)). we further performed a context-specific eqtl analysis to investigate if genetic effects on gene expression regulation act in a menstrual cycle-specific manner. interestingly, five cis-eqtls were identified with a significant stage-by-genotype interaction. the strongest stage interaction was the eqtl for c10orf33 (pyroxd2) with snp rs2296438 (p = 2.0 x 10(-4)), where we observe a 2-fold difference in the average expression levels of heterozygous samples depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle. large scale data:the summary eqtl results are publicly available to browse or download. limitations, reasons for caution:a limitation of the present study was the relatively modest sample size. it was not powered to identify trans-eqtls and larger sample sizes will also be needed to provide better power to detect cis-eqtls and cycle stage-specific effects, given the substantial changes in expression across the menstrual cycle for many genes. wider implications of the findings:identification of endometrial eqtls provides a platform for better understanding genetic effects on endometriosis risk and other endometrial-related pathologies. study funding/competing interest(s):funding for this work was provided by nhmrc project grants gnt1026033, gnt1049472, gnt1046880, gnt1050208, gnt1105321 and app1083405. there are no competing interests.
northern_blotting	two genotypes showing differential immunity against karnal bunt (tilletia indica) were used to investigate the role of three members of cystatin gene family in growth stage dependent immunity in wheat (triticum aestivum l.). three members of cystatin gene family (wc1, wc2, and wc4) were cloned and sequenced. analysis of sequenced data showed that there was 76-99% nucleotide and protein sequence identity between different genes of the wheat cystatin. in silico amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of a conserved signature pattern of residues and also the functional domains were presumed to be actively involved in imparting cysteine protease inhibition capability. the semi-quantitative and quantitative levels of these members were measured by means of rt-pcr, northern blotting, western blotting, and by elisa techniques. the members of cystatin gene family were expressed in both resistant (hd 29) and susceptible genotypes (wh 542); however, the expression level was significantly (p0.05) in contrary to wc1 family whose expression gradually increased from s-v to s-2 stage. according to the intensity of the detected band in rt pcr, northern blot and western blot, wc1 family seems to be expressed more than the other gene families. the immunoassay results further showed that wc1 protein was abundantly expressed in resistant genotype and high expression was observed at the s2 stage as compared to susceptible genotype (p < 0.001) suggesting that low level of expression of wc1 in s2 stage is responsible for kb infection. the results of the present study clearly indicate the role of cystatin gene family in differential and stage dependent immunity against kb.
southern_blotting	salinity is an adverse environmental stress that limits the yield and quality of maize. as one of the most important osmolytes present in higher plants, glycinebetaine helps stabilize metabolism in plant cells and protects the constituents of cells from damage. in this study, a gene from atriplex micrantha that encodes betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase was introduced by agrobacterium-mediated transformation into maize inbred lines zheng58 and qi319 under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. putative transgenic plants were confirmed by pcr and southern blotting analysis. the transgenic maize plants expressed higher amounts of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and also grew better than the wt plants under nacl stress. compared with the wild type, the transgenic plants had increased fresh weight, lower malondialdehyde content, lower relative electrical conductivity, higher chlorophyll content, taller plant height, and higher grain yield under salt stress, which indicated that the expression of badh gene in maize seedlings enhanced the salt tolerance of these plants.
polymerase_chain_reaction	streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, can gain access to the bloodstream and has been associated with cardiovascular disease. however, the roles of s.mutans in inflammation in cardiovascular disease remain unclear. the aim of this study was to examine cytokine production induced by s.mutans in human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) and to evaluate the participation of toll-like receptors (tlrs) and cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) -like receptors in haecs. cytokine production by haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and the expression of tlrs and nod-like receptors was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. the involvement of tlr2 and nod2 in cytokine production by invaded haecs was examined using rna interference. the invasion efficiencies of s.mutans strains were evaluated by means of antibiotic protection assays. five of six strains of s.mutans of various serotypes induced interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production by haecs. all s.mutans strains upregulated tlr2 and nod2 mrna levels in haecs. streptococcus mutans xc upregulated the intracellular tlr2 and nod2 protein levels in haecs. silencing of the tlr2 and nod2 genes in haecs invaded by s.mutans xc led to a reduction in interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. cytokine production induced by invasive s.mutans via intracellular tlr2 and nod2 in haecs may be associated with inflammation in cardiovascular disease.
enzymology	flavin is a general name given to molecules having the heteroaromatic ring system of 7,8-dimethylisoalloxazine but practically means riboflavin (rfl), flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad), and flavin mononucleotide (fmn) in biological systems, whose structures are illustrated in fig. 1, together with the atomic numbering scheme and ring numbering of the isoalloxazine moiety. as the isoalloxazine skeleton cannot be synthesized in human cells, it is obtained from diet as rfl (vitamin b-2). fad and fmn can act as cofactors in flavoenzymes but rfl does not. most flavoenzymes catalyze redox reactions of substrates (miura, chem rec 1:183-194, 2001). when o-2 serves as the oxidant in the oxidation half cycle of an enzymic reaction, the enzyme is called ""flavo-oxidase"" but when others do, the enzyme is called ""flavo-dehydrogenase."" the difference between the two types of oxidative catalysis arises from delicate differences in the pi-electron distributions in the isoalloxazine ring, which can be revealed by raman spectroscopy (miura, chem rec 1:183-194, 2001). since a flavin is an extremely versatile molecule, the scientific field including chemistry, biochemistry, and enzymology is collectively called ""flavonology."" it was found recently, however, that the flavin also acts as a chromophore to initiate light-induced dna repair and signal transductions (sancar, chem rev 103:2203-2237, 2003).
southern_blotting	tanhx2, a vacuolar na+-h+ antiport gene from wheat (triticum aestivum l.), was transformed into alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) via agrobacterium-mediated transformation to evaluate the role of vacuolar energy providers in plant salt stress responses. pcr and southern blotting analysis showed that the target gene was integrated into the medicago genome. reverse transcription-pcr indicated that gene tanhx2 was expressed at the transcriptional level. the relative electrical conductivity in the t-2 transgenic plants was lower and the osmotic potential was higher compared to the wild-type plants under salt stress conditions. the tonoplast h+-atpase, h+-pyrophosphatase (ppase) hydrolysis activities and atp-dependent proton pump activities in transgenic plants were all higher than those of wild-type plants, and the enzyme activities could be induced by salt stress. the ppi-dependent proton pump activities decreased when nacl concentrations increased from 100mm to 200mm, especially in transgenic plants. the vacuolar na+-h+ antiport activities of transgenic plants were 2-3 times higher than those of the wild -type plants under 0mm and 100mm nacl stress. na+-h+ antiport activity was not detectable for wild-type plants under 200mm nacl, but for transgenic plants, it was further increased with an increment in salt stress intensity. these results demonstrated that expression of the foreign tanhx2 gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic alfalfa.
northern_blotting	hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) acts as a signaling molecule modulating the expression of various genes in plants. however, the reference gene(s) used for gene expression analysis of h2o2 signaling is still arbitrary. a reliable result obtained by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (rt-qpcr) highly depends on accurate transcript normalization using stably expressed reference genes, whereas the inaccurate normalization could easily lead to the false conclusions. in this report, by using genorm and normfinder algorithms, 12 candidate reference genes were evaluated and compared in root and shoot tissues of arabidopsis upon different doses of h2o2. the results revealed that, in our experimental conditions, three novel reference genes (tip41-like, ukn, and ubc21) were identified and validated as suitable reference genes for rt-qpcr normalization in both root and shoot tissues under oxidative stress. this conclusion was further confirmed by publicly available microarray data of methyl viologen and drought stress. in comparison with a single reference gene (ef-1a), the expression pattern of zat12 modulated by h2o2, when using tip41-like, ukn, and ubc21 as multiple reference gene(s), was similar with the previous reports by using northern blotting. thus, we proposed that these three reference genes might be good candidates for other researchers to include in their reference gene validation in gene expression studies under h2o2-related oxidative stress.
northern_blotting	we have reported that orally administrated acetate contributed to suppression of lipogenesis in the liver and to reduction of lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue of otsuka long-evans tokushima fatty (oletf) rats. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acetate on skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. treatment with acetate showed a higher rate of oxygen consumption and a smaller size of lipid droplets in white adipose and brown adipose tissues. an analysis by northern blotting revealed that the transcripts of myoglobin and glut4 genes in the abdominal muscle of the oletf rats were increased by acetate treatment, while the transcripts of lipolytic genes increased in the white adipose and brown adipose tissues. it is possible that acetate has effects on lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscles and the adipose tissues, and has functions that work against obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the relation between viral load and disease severity in childhood acute respiratory tract infections (ari) is not fully understood. objectives: to assess the clinical relevance of the relation between viral load, determined by cycle threshold (ct) value of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and disease severity in children with single-and multiple viral ari. study design: 582 children with ari were prospectively followed and tested for 15 viruses. correlations were calculated between ct values and clinical parameters. results: in single viral ari, statistically significant correlations were found between viral loads of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and hospitalization and between viral loads of human coronavirus (hcov) and a disease severity score. in multiple-viral ari, statistically significant correlations between viral load and clinical parameters were found. in rsv-rhinovirus (rv) multiple infections, a low viral load of rv was correlated with a high length of hospital stay and a high duration of extra oxygen use. the mean ct value for rv, hcov and parainfluenza virus was significantly lower in single-versus multiple infections. conclusion: although correlations between ct values and clinical parameters in patients with single and multiple viral infection were found, the clinical importance of these findings is limited because individual differences in host-,viral and laboratory factors complicate the interpretation of statistically significant findings. in multiple infections, viral load cannot be used to differentiate between disease causing virus and innocent bystanders.

molecular_biology	trichosanthin (tcs) exhibits an anti-cancer effect on various human cancer cells. however, the mechanism of anti-cancer effect at the molecular level remains to be elucidated. in this study, the underlying anti-cancer mechanism of tcs in human ovarian cancer cells (ovcar-3) was investigated using various molecular biology techniques, such as flow cytometry, western blotting. we major focus on the potential roles of apoptosis and autophagy in tcs inhibition of human ovarian cancer cells. the results demonstrated tcs inhibits human ovarian cancer cells growth due to apoptosis and autophagy. tcs triggers autophagy firstly, which was confirmed by an increased atg5 expression and promoted lc3 cleavage, and subsequent apoptotic cell death. the apoptotic cell death induced by tcs was attenuated by both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy. the autophagy inhibitor 3-ma, which functions at the early stage of autophagy, significantly reduced tcs-induced cell death and caspase-3 activity in human ovarian cancer cells. we also demonstrated that inhibition of apoptosis had no effect on tcs-induced autophagy in ovcar-3 cells. in conclusion, we found that a common pathway between autophagy and apoptosis exists in tcs-induced cell death in human ovarian cancer cells, which might shed light on drug therapy.
genetics	lambda interferon (ifn-lambda) has potent antiviral effects against multiple enteric viral pathogens, including norovirus and rotavirus, in both preventing and curing infection. because the intestine includes a diverse array of cell types, however, the cell(s) upon which ifn-lambda acts to exert its antiviral effects is unclear. here, we sought to identify ifn-lambda-responsive cells by generation of mice with lineage-specific deletion of the receptor for ifn-lambda, ifnlr1. we found that expression of ifnlr1 on intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) in the small intestine and colon is required for enteric ifn-lambda antiviral activity. iec ifnlr1 expression also determines the efficacy of ifn-lambda in resolving persistent murine norovirus (mnov) infection and regulates fecal shedding and viral titers in tissue. thus, the expression of ifnlr1 by iecs is necessary for the response to both endogenous and exogenous ifn-lambda. we further demonstrate that iec ifnlr1 expression is required for the sterilizing innate immune effects of ifn-lambda by extending these findings in rag1-deficient mice. finally, we assessed whether our findings pertained to multiple viral pathogens by infecting mice specifically lacking iec ifnlr1 expression with reovirus. these mice phenocopied ifnlr1-null animals, exhibiting increased intestinal tissue titers and enhanced reovirus fecal shedding. thus, iecs are the critical cell type responding to ifn-lambda to control multiple enteric viruses. this is the first genetic evidence that supports an essential role for iecs in ifn-lambda-mediated control of enteric viral infection, and these findings provide insight into the mechanism of ifn-lambda-mediated antiviral activity. importance human noroviruses (hnovs) are the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. type iii interferons (ifn-lambda) control enteric viral infections in the gut and have been shown to cure mouse norovirus, a small-animal model for hnovs. using a genetic approach with conditional knockout mice, we identified iecs as the dominant ifn-lambda-responsive cells in control of enteric virus infection in vivo. upon murine norovirus or reovirus infection, ifnlr1 depletion in iecs largely recapitulated the phenotype seen in ifnlr1(-/-) mice of higher intestinal tissue viral titers and increased viral shedding in the stool. moreover, ifn-lambda-mediated sterilizing immunity against murine norovirus requires the capacity of iecs to respond to ifn-lambda. these findings clarify the mechanism of action of this cytokine and emphasize the therapeutic potential of ifn-lambda for treating mucosal viral infections.
immunology	the purposes of this study were to determine: (i) the extent of an acute session of high-intensity intermittent exercise (hiie) followed by a concurrent strength session (conc) on the increase of systemic inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and (ii) whether eight weeks of high intensity interval training plus concurrent strength training alters the acute inflammatory response and immune status. ten recreationally active males (aged 26.9 +/- 4.3 years) performed two experimental exercise sessions interspersed by eight weeks of hilt plus concurrent strength training. the experimental exercise session was composed of a 5-km run on a treadmill (1:1 at 100% of maximal aerobic speed (mas)), and after 10 min of passive recovery, back squat exercises were performed (80% 1rm, four sets until exhaustion). serum samples were collected after fasting, pre-hiie, post-hiie, pre-conc, post-conc, and 30 and 60 min postexercise session. the comparison between both concurrent exercise sessions was performed using repeated measure anova, with the bonferroni post-hoc when necessary. interleukin-6 (il-6) presented a moment effect (f = 6.72; p < 0.05), with post-conc significantly higher than pre-hiie, post-hiie, and 60 min, only a tendency was found between pre-hiie and post-hiie (difference =-5.99; p = 0.09). mcp-1 and il-ira did not present effects for condition, moment, or interaction. interleuldn-10 (il-10) presented both moment and interaction effects (f = 5.31 and 2.50; p = 0.005 and 0.036). pre-conc and post-conc were significantly higher than pre-hiie. the interaction between before and after eight weeks of concurrent training probably occurred at post-conc (11.42 +/- 3.09 pg ml(-1) and 8.88 +/- 1.29 pg ml(-1)). in addition, maintenance of immune function was observed. therefore, hiie and concurrent strength exercise lead to an increase in cytokines response, but eight weeks of training program promoted antiinflammatory response after an acute session of concurrent exercise.

southern_blotting	nine italian peach nurseries, which use agrobacterium rhizogenes strain k84 to protect plants from crown gall, were monitored for three years with the aim of determining whether transconjugant populations may arise following plasmid exchanges between k84 and autochtonous soil agrobacteria. six hundred and seventy-eight agrobacterium isolates were obtained from 120 tumours developed on apricot and peach rootstocks that had been treated in pre-planting with the antagonist. agrobacteria were characterized for pathogenicity, biovar, opine catabolism and agrocin 84 sensitivity. colony hybridization was used for screening the isolates harbouring plasmids pti and/or pagk84. analysis of plasmid content and southern blotting were performed on putative transconjugant agrobacteria found in tumours collected from one nursery where a biological control breakdown was observed. the rflp analysis of 16s + igs regions showed that pagk84 was transferred from the antagonist to virulent and avirulent soil agrobacteria belonging to different ribotypes. pathogenic transconjugants, inoculated on gf677 rootstocks, were not controlled in vivo by k84 and stably maintained pti and pagk84 in the bacterial cells for at least one year. at the end of a biocontrol trial, new transconjugant tumorigenic agrobacteria originated by the transfer of pagk84 to the pathogen. virulent and avirulent transconjugants may represent a real threat for biological control by k84 strain since all of them produced agrocin and were insensitive to it. survival in soil of these populations could make the future application of k84 ineffective.
genetics	the pyrenean desman (galemys pyrenaicus) is a small, semiaquatic mammal endemic to the pyrenean mountains and the northern half of the iberian peninsula where it lives in cold and well-oxygenated flowing mountain streams. this species is currently classified as vulnerable on the iucn red list and has been undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation for decades, inevitably impacting its distribution. a recent genetic study, based on mitochondrial and intronic sequences, showed that the genetic variability of the pyrenean desman is very low in the pyrenees. in this study, we investigated the potential existence of genetic structure and gene flow at a smaller scale using 24 polymorphic microsatellite loci. as the pyrenean desman is a very elusive species, we supplemented our tissue sample collection with samples of feces collected in the french range of this species. we successfully identified 70 individuals based on 355 fecal samples. bayesian analyses revealed 3 genetic and geographic clusters (1 eastern, 1 central, and 1 western, including 3 genetic subclusters), with origins tracing back only 200 years. these clusters were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and high inbreeding coefficients. although gene flow among clusters appeared to be limited, populations seem to have exchanged alleles recently. therefore, connectivity between watersheds should be enhanced to maintain genetic diversity and potentially improve the long-term survival of the pyrenean desman in france.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective several studies have reported that retinoic acid (ra) might be used to treat malignancies. the effects of ra are mediated by the ra receptor (rar), and rar/rar especially acts as a tumor suppressor. however, little is known about its role in human endometrial cancer. materials and methods in this study, we examined the effects of all-trans ra (atra) on progression of human endometrial cancer cell line, rl95-2 and hec1a. we then examined the expression of rar and rar in 50 endometrial cancer tissues by using immunohistochemistry. results we found inhibitory effects of atra on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in rl95-2 cells, but not in hec1a cells. rar or rar knockdown individually could not cancel out the inhibition of cell proliferation by atra in rl95-2 cells, but simultaneous knockdown of rar and rar could block its effect on proliferation. rar and rar knockdown dose dependently reduced the inhibition of migration by atra, but the effect was more pronounced with rar knockdown than with rar knockdown. we confirmed that rar gene was directly regulated by atra in microarray and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. furthermore, the rar agonist (bms453) significantly suppressed proliferation of rl95-2 cells. in immunohistochemical analysis, rar expression was positively correlated with tumor grade, and rar showed the opposite tendency in endometrial cancer. conclusions retinoic acid might have multiple antitumor effects, and rar may be a potent therapeutic target in ra treatment for endometrial cancers.
enzymology	the positive effect of lipoxygenase, added as an enzyme-active soy flour, during the production of white bread is well established. in addition to increasing the mixing tolerance and overall dough rheology, lipoxygenase is also an effective bleaching agent. it is known that these effects are mediated by enzyme-coupled cooxidation of gluten proteins and carotenoids. however, the mechanism whereby these effects are achieved is not yet fully understood. in order to gain a better understanding into the reactions governing the beneficial effects of lipoxygenases in bread dough, an in-depth knowledge of the lipoxygenase catalytic mechanism is required. until now no single review combining the molecular enzymology of lipoxygenase enzymes and their application in the baking industry has been presented. this review, therefore, focuses on the extraction and molecular characterization of lipoxygenases in addition to the work done on the application of lipoxygenases in the baking industry.
molecular_biology	to observe the biological characteristic and the prognoses in patients with acute erythroleukemia (ael). the results of 167 patients with newly diagnosed ael, from january 2004 and june 2014 in the department of hematology, shandong province chinese medicine hospital, were reviewed by morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, molecular biology. flow cytometry analysis indicated that cd13 (96.1 %), cd33 (95.1 %), cd117 (87.4 %) and cd34 (79.4 %) were highly expressed in ael. 56 of 148 (37.8 %) ael patients had a variety of cytogenetic abnormalities, 27 of 148 (18.2 %) patients were complex karyotype (abnormal involving 3 or more chromosomes), the abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more frequently involved and the most common one was +8, accounting for 35.7 % of all abnormal karyotype, followed by 5q- (17.9 %). mutation analysis showed cebpa mutation ratio of ael patients was 44.0 % (11/25), that of npm1as 15.4 % (4/26). initial induced remission rate of ael was 56.6 % (30/53), compared by 33.3 % (4/12) of mdsm6. survival analysis was shown that the overall survival in female was better than that in male (p = 0.047). the overall survival time of transplantation group was significantly longer than chemotherapy group (p = 0.000). the os of 13-39 years old group was the best, 40-49 years old group took second place, >50 years old group appeared to be the worst. patients with aml-m-6 had dysplasia in varying degrees in granulocyte, erythrocyte and megakaryocyte series. periodic acid-shiff reaction staining in polychromatic erythroblast and ortho-chromatic erythroblast had a specificity in the diagnosis of ael. ael had its own unique biological features, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could significantly improve its poor prognosis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	chimerism associated with placental sharing in marmosets has been traditionally analysed using conventional chromosome staining on metaphase spreads or polymerase chain reaction. however, the former technique requires the presence of proliferating cells, whereas the latter may be associated with possible blood cell contamination. therefore, we aimed to develop a single-cell analysis technique for sexing marmoset cells. we applied fluorescent in situ hybridisation (fish) to cell nuclei using differentially labelled x and y chromosome-specific probes. herein we present the validation of this method in metaphase cells from a marmoset lymphoblastoid cell line, as well as application of the method for evaluation of cross-sex chimerism in interphase blood lymphocytes and haematopoietic bone marrow cells from marmosets of same- and mixed-sex litters. the results show conclusively that haematopoietic cells of bone marrow and leucocytes from blood are cross-sex chimeric when the litter is mixed sex. in addition, single samples of liver and spleen cell suspensions from one individual were tested. cross-sex chimerism was observed in the spleen but not in liver cells. we conclude that fish is the method of choice to identify cross-sex chimerism, especially when combined with morphological identification of nuclei of different cell types, which will allow a targeted tissue-specific analysis.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introductiondetection of recurrent genetic abnormalities is of great significance for a refined diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in leukemia. conventional nested reverse transcription pcr is labor intensive and time-consuming. methodswe have developed a novel dual-color taqman probe-based real-time pcr method for the simultaneous screening of 45 fusion transcripts in 12 parallel reactions. the method was tested and validated with cell lines carrying known fusion transcripts and patient samples. resultsa multiplex real-time pcr method was successfully developed for rapid detection of 45 fusion genes and validated for 15 of the more commonly detected fusion genes. intra-assay reproducibility assessed for the most frequent rearrangements ranged from 0.41% to 0.74% for the coefficient of variation (cv) of cycle threshold (ct) and the interassay reproducibility ranged from 1.62% to 2.83% in five separate experiments. the lowest detection limit for the translocations tested ranged between 1 : 16 000 and 1 : 32 000. validation of the method with 213 patient samples showed 100% specificity and excellent consistence with conventional nested rt-pcr. conclusionoverall, we believe that this method is easily applicable, cost-effective, and clinically useful for a rapid screening of fusion genes in the initial diagnostic phase of leukemia. its use can also be extended to the monitoring of minimal residual disease.
cell_biology	the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (igf) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of islet cell biology. however, the signaling pathway(s) utilized by insulin to directly modulate -cells is unclear. to interrogate whether insulin exerts endocrine effects in regulating proteins in the insulin/igf-1 signaling cascade in vivo in physiological states via the insulin receptor, we designed two experimental approaches: 1) glucose gavage and 2) hyperinsulinemic intravenous infusion, for studies in either -cell specific insulin receptor knock-out (irko) or control mice. immunostaining of sections of pancreas (collected immediately after glucose gavage or insulin infusion) from controls showed significant increases in pakt+, p-p70s6k+, and perk+ -cells and a significant decrease in % nuclear foxo1+ -cells compared with corresponding vehicle-treated groups. in contrast, in irkos, we observed no significant changes in pakt+ or p-p70s6k+ -cells in either experiment; however, perk+ -cells were significantly increased, and an attenuated decrease in % nuclear foxo1+ cells was evident in response to glucose gavage or insulin infusion. treatment of control and irko -cell lines with glucose or insulin showed significantly decreased % nuclear foxo1+ -cells suggesting direct effects. furthermore, blocking mapk signaling had virtually no effect on foxo1 nuclear export in controls, in contrast to attenuated export in irko -cells. these data suggest insulin acts on -cells in an endocrine manner in the normal situation; and that in -cells lacking insulin receptors, insulin and glucose minimally activate the akt pathway, while erk phosphorylation and foxo1 nuclear export occur independently of insulin signaling.
genetics	the leon springs pupfish (cyprinodon bovinus) is an endangered species currently restricted to a single desert spring and a separate captive habitat in southwestern north america. following establishment of the captive population from wild stock in 1976, the wild population has undergone natural population size fluctuations, intentional culling to purge genetic contamination from an invasive congener (cyprinodon variegatus) and augmentation/replacement of wild fish from the captive stock. a severe population decline following the most recent introduction of captive fish prompted us to examine whether the captive and wild populations have differentiated during the short time they have been isolated from one another. if so, the development of divergent genetic and/or morphologic traits between populations could contribute to a diminished ability of fish from one location to thrive in the other. examination of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and morphologic variation revealed no evidence of residual c. variegatus characteristics in contemporary c. bovinus samples. however, significant genetic and morphologic differentiation was detected between the wild and captive populations, some of which might reflect local adaptation. our results indicate that genetic and physical characteristics can diverge rapidly between isolated subdivisions of managed populations, potentially compromising the value of captive stock for future supplementation efforts. in the case of c. bovinus, our findings underscore the need to periodically inoculate the captive population with wild genetic material to help mitigate genetic, and potentially morphologic, divergence between them and also highlight the utility of parallel morphologic and genomic evaluation to inform conservation management planning.
polymerase_chain_reaction	oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most aggressive cancer that is associated with high recurrence, metastasis, and poor treatment outcome. dysregulation of long non-coding rnas has been shown to promote tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers. in this study, we investigated the expression of 11 selected long non-coding rnas that are associated with cell proliferation, metastasis, and tumor suppression in oral squamous cell carcinomas and normal tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. out of the 11 long non-coding rnas profiled, 9 were significantly overexpressed in tumors with tobacco chewing history. moreover, the long non-coding rna profile was similar to the head and neck cancer datasets of the cancer genome atlas database. linc-ror, a regulator of reprogramming, implicated in tumorigenesis was found to be overexpressed in undifferentiated tumors and showed strong association with tumor recurrence and poor therapeutic response. in oral squamous cell carcinomas, for the first time, we observed linc-ror overexpression, downregulation of mir-145-5p, and overexpression of c-myc, klf4, oct4, and sox2, suggesting the existence of linc-ror-mediated competing endogenous rna network in undifferentiated tumors. taken together, this study demonstrated the association of linc-ror overexpression in undifferentiated oral tumors and its prognostic value to predict the therapeutic response.
genetics	adna studies are a cooperative field of research with a broad range of applications including evolutionary biology, genetics, anthropology and archaeology. scientists are using ancient molecules as source material for historical questions. colleagues from the humanities are observing this with both interest and concern because adna research is affecting academic identities and both concepts of history and historiography. adna research developed in a way that can be described as a hype cycle (chackie fenn). technological triggers such as sanger sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction kicked off a multitude of experiments with ancient dna during the 1980s and 1990s. geneticists, microbiologists, anthropologists and many more euphorically joined a ""molecule hunt"". adna was promoted as a time machine. media attention was enormous. as experiments and implementations began to fail and contamination was discovered to be a tremendous problem, media interest waned and many labs lost their interest. some turned their disillusionment into systematic research into methodology and painstakingly established lab routines. the authenticity problem was first addressed by control oriented measures but later approached from a more cognitive theoretical perspective as the pitfalls and limits of adna became clearer. by the end of the 2000s the field reached its current plateau of productivity. cross-disciplinary debates, conflicts and collaborations are increasing critical reflection among all participants. historians should consider joining the field in a kind of critical friendship to both make the most of its possibilities and give an input from a constructivist perspective.
immunology	nk cell cytotoxicity in chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) is strongly impaired as lytic granules are not released upon nk-target cell contact, contributing to several defects typical of this severe immunodeficiency. correction of ni(cell defects in chs should improve the outcome of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, proposed as therapy. we investigated nk cell functions in a chs patient before and after cord-blood transplantation, and the ability of in vitro il-2 treatment to restore them. before the transplant, the strong defect in nk cell-mediated natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, as well as in ifn-gamma production, could be restored up to normal levels by in vitro il-2 treatment. this cytokine also caused the appearance of smaller lysosomal granules and their orientation towards the nk-target cell contact area, thus suggesting that il-2 had a more general capacity to restore nk cell effector functions. moreover after the transplant, although the successful engraftment, nk cell cytotoxicity resulted still partially impaired at one year, almost normal at ten years and, anyhow, fully recovered by in vitro il-2 treatment. taken together, our results indicate that il-2 had a wide capacity to restore nk cell effector functions, being able to reverse the altered cytotoxic activity, lytic granule pattern, and cytokine production observed in the chs patient.

molecular_biology	here, we report a method for time-resolved, longitudinal extraction and quantitative measurement of intracellular proteins and mrna from a variety of cell types. cytosolic contents were repeatedly sampled from the same cell or population of cells for more than 5 d through a cell-culture substrate, incorporating hollow 150-nm-diameter nanostraws (ns) within a defined sampling region. once extracted, the cellular contents were analyzed with conventional methods, including fluorescence, enzymatic assays (elisa), and quantitative real-time pcr. this process was nondestructive with >95% cell viability after sampling, enabling long-term analysis. it is important to note that the measured quantities from the cell extract were found to constitute a statistically significant representation of the actual contents within the cells. of 48 mrna sequences analyzed from a population of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stemcells (hipsc-cms), 41 were accurately quantified. the ns platform samples from a select subpopulation of cells within a larger culture, allowing native cell-to-cell contact and communication even during vigorous activity such as cardiomyocyte beating. this platform was applied both to cell lines and to primary cells, including cho cells, hipsc-cms, and human astrocytes derived in 3d cortical spheroids. by tracking the same cell or group of cells over time, this method offers an avenue to understand dynamic cell behavior, including processes such as induced pluripotency and differentiation.
immunology	among athletes and coaches, there is a common perception that high training loads and competitions, applied chronically, with inadequate nutritional control and/or recovery periods, may reduce the immune resistance, increasing susceptibility to infection episodes, mainly upper respiratory tract infection (urti). in this sense, this study is focused on reviewing the interactions between immunological parameters with the overtraining syndrome, specifically in team sports, considering its intermittent nature. thus, a review of national and international journals related to the topic was held. the correlations between exercise, immune system and susceptibility to urti have been evaluated mainly in individual and endurance sports compared to the team sports. the modulations of leukocytes throughout the season, against the totalization of training loads and competitions, when analyzed specifically for neutrophils and monocytes, are possibly related to tissue repair processes and incidence of urti. modulations related to lymphocytes seem to be more directly related to the incidence of urti. moreover, an understanding of all the proposed markers, including immunological markers, in association with the performance indicators and control of training, appears to be a more promising avenue for clinical diagnosis of the athlete 's immune status and prevention of overtraining syndrome than the search for a unique marker of overtraining.
cell_biology	we review the bio-activities of natural product sesquiterpenes and present the first description of their effects upon mitosis. this type of biological effect upon cells is unexpected because sesquiterpenes are believed to inactivate proteins through michael-type additions that cause non-specific cytotoxicity. yet, certain types of sesquiterpenes can arrest cells in mitosis as measured by cell biology, biochemical and imaging techniques. we have listed the sesquiterpenes that arrest cells in mitosis and analyzed the biological data that support those observations. in view of the biochemical complexity of mitosis, we propose that a subset of sesquiterpenes have a unique chemical structure that can target a precise protein(s) required for mitosis. since the process of mitotic arrest precedes that of cell death, it is possible that some sesquiterpenes that are currently classified as cytotoxic might also induce a mitotic arrest. our analysis provides a new perspective of sesquiterpene chemical biology.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aimsthymomas and thymic squamous cell carcinomas (tsqccs) are rare thymic epithelial tumours. data on angiogenesis and vascular phenotype in these tumours are limited, and no study has taken histological world health organization (who) subtypes into account. the aim of this study was to compare vascularization, pericytes coverage and expression of angiogenic growth factors in different who-defined subtypes of thymoma methods and resultsvascular density, diameter and architecture and expression of -smooth muscle actin (sma), platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) receptor- (pdgfr), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) receptor 1 (vegfr1) and vegf receptor 2 (vegfr2) were investigated in who type a, ab, b1, b2 and b3 thymomas and tsqccs, by the use of immunostaining, quantitative morphometry, and tumour vessel isolation by trypsin digestion. expression levels of angiopoietin 1 (ang-1), angiopoietin 2 (ang-2), vegf-a, pdgf-b and hif-1 were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. a and ab thymomas were characterized by a dense network of capillary-like vessels with tight pericyte coverage, whereas b thymomas showed a loose vascular network with increasing vascular diameters and increasing expression of sma and pdgfr from b1 to b3 thymomas and tsqccs. vegfr1 and vegfr2 were expressed in vessels of all analysed tumour entities, and at higher levels in epithelial cells of a and b3 thymomas and tsqccs. mrna of ang-2, but not of ang-1, was significantly up-regulated in all thymoma subtypes, with the highest levels being found in a thymomas. in tsqccs, ang-1 and vegf were the predominantly up-regulated growth factors. hif-1 was only up-regulated in b3 thymomas and tsqccs. conclusionthymomas and tsqccs differ significantly in their vascular architecture and expression of key angiogenic growth factors. the findings could help to improve the differential diagnosis of difficult-to-classify thymic epithelial tumours, and indicate different mechanisms of tumour angiogenesis and functional differences of tumour vessels of major thymoma subtypes and tsqccs.
immunology	rationale: forkhead box p3(+) t regulatory cells (tregs) are key players in maintaining immune homeostasis. evidence suggests that tregs respond to environmental cues to permit or suppress inflammation. in atherosclerosis, th1-driven inflammation affects treg homeostasis, but the mechanisms governing this phenomenon are unclear. objective: here, we address whether atherosclerosis impacts treg plasticity and functionality in apoe(-/-) mice, and what effect treg plasticity might have on the pathology of atherosclerosis. methods and results: we demonstrate that atherosclerosis promotes treg plasticity, resulting in the reduction of cxcr3(+) tregs and the accumulation of an intermediate th1-like interferon (ifn)-gamma(+) ccr5(+) treg subset (th1/tregs) within the aorta. importantly, th1/tregs arise in atherosclerosis from bona fide tregs, rather than from t-effector cells. we show that th1/tregs recovered from atherosclerotic mice are dysfunctional in suppression assays. using an adoptive transfer system and plasticity-prone mir146a-/-tregs, we demonstrate that elevated ifn gamma(+)mir146a(-/-)th1/tregs are unable to adequately reduce atherosclerosis, arterial th1, or macrophage content within apoe(-/-) mice, in comparison to mir146a(+/+) tregs. finally, via single-cell rna-sequencing and real-time-polymerase chain reaction, we show that th1/tregs possess a unique transcriptional phenotype characterized by coexpression of treg and th1 lineage genes and a downregulation of treg-related genes, including ikzf2, ikzf4, tigit, lilrb4, and il10. in addition, an ingenuity pathway analysis further implicates ifn gamma, ifn alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-7, ctla-4 (cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4), t-cell receptor, and csnk2b-related pathways in regulating treg plasticity. conclusions: atherosclerosis drives treg plasticity, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional ifn gamma(+) th1/tregs that may permit further arterial inflammation and atherogenesis.
human_metabolism	the cytochrome enzyme p4503a4 (cyp3a4) is thought to play a major part in the human metabolism of clozapine. nefazodone is a potent and specific in-vivo inhibitor of cyp3a4. we co-administered nefazodone and clozapine in six patients and found that mean clozapine levels rose by 4% of baseline and norclozapine levels by 16%. based on these observations, it is inferred that inhibition of cyp3a4 in vivo has minimal effects on clozapine metabolism. nefazodone appears to be safe when co-administered,vith clozapine. int clin psychopharmacol 14-185-187 (c) 1999 lippincott williams & wilkins.
polymerase_chain_reaction	purpose: to compare tendon-to-bone healing in remnant-preserving and conventional anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. methods: 72 new zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to conventional acl reconstruction group (group a), remnant-preserving and tensioning acl reconstruction group (group b), and remnant-preserving and graft through remnant sleeve acl reconstruction group (group c), with 24 rabbits (48 knees) in each group. the incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement in each group were analyzed using ct 3d reconstruction. graft tendon-bone healing was monitored by he and masson staining, and osteoprotegerin (opg) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand (rankl) mrna expression in the bone tissue surrounding the graft. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to evaluate the ratio of opg/rankl expression. results: histological analysis showed that group c had the best graft tendon-bone healing, followed by group b and group a at all time-points post-surgery. at weeks 3 and 6 post-surgery, opg mrna levels and opg/rankl values were higher in groups b and c compared to group a (p < 0.05). rankl mrna levels of groups b and c were lower than group a (p0.05). at 3 weeks post-surgery, the incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement were greater in group a compared to groups b and c (p < 0.05). conclusion: both remnant-preserving construction approaches promoted graft tendon-bone healing, the underlying mechanism may be associated with the upregulation of opg mrna and downregulation of rankl mrna in bone tunnel early post-operation.
northern_blotting	both cdna and a genomic dna fragment encoding a new potato proteinase inhibitor ii were isolated from a diploid potato ivp101 (solanum phurejia l.) and named pinii-2x. nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the dna fragment of pinii-2xwas 580 bp, including a 115-bp intron and two exons. the deduced pinii-2x protein contained an intact signal peptide and two active sites. the pinii-2x gene and its deduced pinii-2x protein had 88% and 93% homology with another tetraploid potato proteinase inhibitor ii, respectively. northern blotting analysis indicated that the mrna of pinii-2x gene was wound induced in potato leaves. binary vector pnar301 and pnar302 were constructed for rice transformation, in which the pinii-2x cdna was driven, respectively, by rice actin i promoter (acti) and maize ubiquitin promoter (ubii). via an agrobacterium-mediated method, these two constructs were transferred into japonica rice cv. xiushui 63. pcr and southern blotting analysis for transgenic rice revealed the integration of the pinii-2x gene. northern blotting analysis also confirmed transcripts of the pinii-2x gene in transgenic rice plants. insect bioassays using stripe stem borer (chilo suppressalis walker) demonstrated that the average weight and body length of larvae in transgenic plants were only nearly 50% and 61% of those of larvae in control plants, respectively. these results indicate that the pinii-2x gene should be an effective insect-resistance gene and could be valuable for application in crop breeding for insect resistance.
immunology	objective: to determine if the molecular profiles of endometriotic lesions contain informative measures of inflammation and immune dysfunction that may contribute to better understanding of the interplay between immune dysfunction and inflammation and their contribution to endometriosis pathogenesis. design: immune and inflammation transcriptomic analysis with the use of the nanostring ncounter gx human immunology v2 platform (579 human immune and inflammation-related genes and 15 housekeeping genes). setting: academic university and teaching hospital. intervention(s): none. patient(s): stage iii-iv endometriosis patients with infertility (n = 8) and fertile disease-free control women undergoing tubal ligation (n = 8). menstrual stage was matched to secretory phase in all participants. main outcome measure(s): immune and inflammation transcriptomics quantification from ectopic endometriotic lesions and matched eutopic endometrium from patients. endometria of fertile women served as control subjects. result(s): our results displayed endometriotic lesions as molecularly distinct entities compared with eutopic endometrium and endometrium of control samples; 396 out of 579 screened immune and inflammation-related genes were significantly different in ectopic tissues compared with control endometrium. most importantly, eutopic endometrium of the patients displayed a unique molecular profile compared with the control endometrium (91/579 genes were significantly different), particularly of genes involved in regulation of cell apoptosis and decidualization. conclusion(s): we characterize differential expression of immune-inflammation genes in endometriosis patients, and show molecular distinction of eutopic endometrium of patients compared with control fertile women.

cell_biology	background: fluorescent proteins have continued to shed light on cell biology since the cdna of wild type green fluorescent protein was first isolated. nowadays, these remarkable proteins are useful tools, not only in basic research, but also in clinical medicine. highlight: by taking advantage of fluorescent protein-based technologies, we identified a signaling network critical for influenza virus internalization and infection. in addition, we developed a highly sensitive biosensor for monitoring kinase activity that utilizes energy transfer between fluorescent proteins. this has led to a high-performance clinical test that enables the prediction of future therapeutic responses and the risk of acquired drug resistance for each individual patient before beginning molecular target therapy. conclusion: technologies that utilize fluorescent proteins, such as the biosensor presented here, should find increasing applications in clinical medicine.

immunology	respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is an important etiological agent of respiratory infections, particularly in children. much information regarding the immune response to rsv comes from animal models and in vitro studies. here, we provide a comprehensive description of the human immune response to rsv infection, based on a systematic literature review of research on infected humans. there is an initial strong neutrophil response to rsv infection in humans, which is positively correlated with disease severity and mediated by interleukin-8 (il- 8). dendritic cells migrate to the lungs as the primary antigen-presenting cell. an initial systemic t-cell lymphopenia is followed by a pulmonary cd8(+) t-cell response, mediating viral clearance. humoral immunity to reinfection is incomplete, but rsv igg and iga are protective. b-cell-stimulating factors derived from airway epithelium play a major role in protective antibody generation. gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) has a strongly protective role, and a th2-biased response may be deleterious. other cytokines (particularly il-17a), chemokines (particularly ccl-5 and ccl-3), and local innate immune factors (including cathelicidins and ifn-lambda) contribute to pathogenesis. in summary, neutrophilic inflammation is incriminated as a harmful response, whereas cd8(+) t cells and ifn-gamma have protective roles. these may represent important therapeutic targets to modulate the immunopathogenesis of rsv infection.
molecular_biology	the theory of computer science is based around universal turing machines (utms): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. modern digital computers are physical embodiments of classical utms. for the most important class of problem in computer science, non- deterministic polynomial complete problems, non- deterministic utms (nutms) are theoretically exponentially faster than both classical utms and quantum mechanical utms (qutms). however, no attempt has previously been made to build an nutm, and their construction has been regarded as impossible. here, we demonstrate the first physical design of an nutm. this design is based on thue string rewriting systems, and thereby avoids the limitations of most previous dna computing schemes: all the computation is local (simple edits to strings) so there is no need for communication, and there is no need to order operations. the design exploits dna 's ability to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in p time. each thue rewriting step is embodied in a dna edit implemented using a novel combination of polymerase chain reactions and site- directed mutagenesis. we demonstrate that the design works using both computational modelling and in vitro molecular biology experimentation: the design is thermodynamically favourable, microprogramming can be used to encode arbitrary thue rules, all classes of thue rule can be implemented, and non- deterministic rule implementation. in an nutm, the resource limitation is space, which contrasts with classical utms and qutms where it is time. this fundamental difference enables an nutmto trade space for time, which is significant for both theoretical computer science and physics. it is also of practical importance, for to quote richard feynman ` there 's plenty of room at the bottom'. this means that a desktop dna nutm could potentially utilize more processors than all the electronic computers in the world combined, and thereby outperform the world 's current fastest supercomputer, while consuming a tiny fraction of its energy.
immunology	accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver contributes to cholestatic liver injury. inflammation induced by excessive bile acids is believed to play a crucial role, however, the mechanisms of bile acids triggered inflammatory response remain unclear. recent studies have highlighted the effect of nlrp3 inflammasome in mediating liver inflammation and fibrosis. in this study, we for the first time showed that chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca), the major hydrophobic primary bile acid involved in cholestatic liver injury, could dose-dependently induce nlrp3 inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-il-1 beta in macrophages by promoting ros production and k+ efflux. mechanistically, cdca triggered ros formation in part through tgr5/egfr downstream signaling, including protein kinase b, extracellular regulated protein kinases and c-jun n-terminal kinase pathways. meanwhile, cdca also induced atp release from macrophages which subsequently causes k+ efflux via p2x7 receptor. furthermore, in vivo inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically decreased mature il-1 beta level of liver tissue and ameliorated liver fibrosis in bile duct ligation (bdl) mouse model. in conclusion, excessive cdca may represent an endogenous danger signal to activate nlrp3 inflammasome and initiate liver inflammation during cholestasis. our finding offers a mechanistic basis to ameliorate cholestatic liver fibrosis by targeting inflammasome activation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	sugarcane grassy shoot (scgs) disease is associated with the presence of 16srxi group phytoplasmas that are transmitted by leafhoppers; limited studies have been performed in india toward its natural transmission. to determine the insect vectors that transmit the disease in nature, leafhopper species from scgs-infected fields at shahjahanpur, central uttar pradesh, india, were collected and analyzed for phytoplasma presence using nested polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primers. an similar to 1.2-kb amplified dna fragment was detected in nested pcr from the three major leafhopper species, viz. maiestas portica (melichar), exitianus indicus (ross) and cofana unimaculata (signoret), and the symptomatic sugarcane leaves of variety cos 07250. blastn analysis of similar to 1.2-kb 16s rdna partial sequences obtained from symptomatic sugarcane plants and these leafhoppers revealed 99-100 % sequence identities among themselves and 99 % identity with other reported strains of 'candidatus phytoplasma oryzae' (16srxi group). phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences of scgs, m. portica, c. unimaculata and e. indicus phytoplasma strains also indicated the closest phylogenetic relationship with those of 'ca. p. oryzae' group. transmission tests and population sampling study further confirmed that m. portica and c. unimaculata were vectors of the scgs phytoplasma from diseased to healthy sugarcane plants. the identification of new vectors of scgs phytoplasma suggested that these leafhopper species may be responsible for secondary spread of scgs phytoplasma.
molecular_biology	parasitic worms of the genus trichinella (phylum nematoda; class enoplea) represent a complex of at least twelve taxa that infect a range of different host animals, including humans, around the world. they are foodborne, intracellular nematodes, and their life cycles differ substantially from those of other nematodes. the recent characterization of the genomes and transcriptomes of all twelve recognized taxa of trichinella now allows, for the first time, detailed studies of their molecular biology. in the present study, we defined, curated, and compared the protein kinase complements (kinomes) of trichinella spiralis and t. pseudospiralis using an integrated bioinformatic workflow employing transcriptomic and genomic data sets. we examined how variation in the kinome might link to unique aspects of trichinella morphology, biology, and evolution. furthermore, we utilized in silico structural modeling to discover and characterize a novel, mos-like kinase with an unusual, previously undescribed n-terminal domain. taken together, the present findings provide a basis for comparative investigations of nematode kinomes, and might facilitate the identification of enoplea-specific intervention and diagnostic targets. importantly, the in silico modeling approach assessed here provides an exciting prospect of being able to identify and classify currently unknown (orphan) kinases, as a foundation for their subsequent structural and functional investigation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the metastatic detection rate can vary according to the approach adopted in the microscopic analysis of the lns, which includes frozen-section examination, total inclusion of the tissue with and without whole-mount sections, serial sectioning, and the application of immunohistochemistry. the assessment of the sentinel ln, the search for micrometastases, and the evaluation of atypical ln metastatic sites further contribute to the detection of the metastatic spread. in this review, an update on the histopathological evaluation of lnd specimens in patients with pca is given, and focus is made on their clinical and prognostic significance.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the current study aimed to investigate the potential role of mir-9 in the inhibition of ovarian cancer progression through the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1)/ c-x-c chemokine receptor type 4 (cxcr4) pathway and to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. human ovarian cancer ovcar-3 cells were transfected with mir-9 short hairpin rna (shrna). the effect of mir-9 on the mrna expression levels of cxcr4 were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. the effects of mir-9 on ovcar-3 cell proliferation, invasion and apoptotic ability were detected using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, matrigel method, and annexin v-fluorescein isothiocyanate flow cytometry, respectively. in addition, expression levels of sdf-1/cxcr4 pathway associated proteins were determined by western blot analysis. mrna expression levels of cxcr4 in ovcar-3 cells transfected with mir-9 shrna was significantly downregulated compared with the blank and control groups (p<0.05). furthermore, compared with the two control groups, the current results revealed that mir-9 inhibited cell proliferation, suppressed invasive ability and induced cell apoptosis in ovcar-3 cells (p<0.05). finally, it was observed that mir-9 functioned as a tumor inhibitor through the sdf-1/cxcr4 pathway by suppressing the expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (erk1), erk2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 proteins. the present study suggested that mir-9 may function as a promising tumor inhibitor for ovarian cancer through targeting the sdf-1/cxcr4 pathway.
molecular_biology	echinococcus granulosus (eg) is the major cause of cystic echinococcosis in humans and livestock in the world. in chile is a zoonosis of great importance. the most frequently affected geographic areas are the regions of aysen, los rios, los lagos, coquimbo and the araucania. hence, it was discovered that in endemic areas of hydatidosis there could be several strains and genotypes of eg. in addition, there is evidence that some strains and genotypes are more infectious for human beings than others. this interesting phenomenon of the biology of eg has been studied using molecular biology techniques based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna sequence analysis, which has made it possible to characterize the cestode species complex called eg sensu lato (s l) as being comprised of eg sensu stricto (s. s.) (genotypes g1-g3), e. equinus (g4), e. ortleppi (g5) and e. canadensis (g6-g10), which present an important phenotypic variation detectable in characteristics of the biological cycle, specificity of the intermediate host, pattern of development, pathogenicity, antigenicity, transmission dynamics and, consequently, in the measures needed to control the disease. the aim of this manuscript is to describe the different genotypes of eg described in humans and different livestock host reported in the literature.
human_metabolism	introduction in the almost six decades of bariatric surgery, a variety of surgical approaches to treating morbid obesity have been developed. history and evolution rather than prior techniques being continually superseded by new ones, a broad choice of surgical solutions based on restrictive, malabsorptive, humoral effects, or combinations thereof, is now available. in fact, in recent years, the advent of surgically modifying human metabolism promises new approaches to ameliorate traditionally medically treated metabolic entities, i.e., diabetes, even in the non-obese. the understanding of the various metabolic effects have led to a paradigm shift from bariatric surgery as a solely weight-reducing procedure to metabolic surgery affecting whole body metabolism. conclusion the bariatric surgeon now faces the challenge and opportunity of selecting the most suitable technique for each individual case. to assist in such decision-making, this review, metabolic surgery-principles and current concepts, is presented, tracing the historical development; describing the various surgical techniques; elucidating the mechanisms by which glycemic control can be achieved that involve favorable changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, gut hormones, adipokines, energy expenditure, appetite, and preference for low glycemic index foods; as well as exploring the fascinating future potential of this new interdisciplinary field.
human_metabolism	animal models are used to study many aspects of human disease and to test therapeutic interventions. however, some very important features of human biology cannot be replicated in animals, even in nonhuman primates or transgenic rodents engineered with human genes. most human microbial pathogens do not infect animals and the metabolism of many xenobiotics is different between human beings and animals. the advent of transgenic immune-deficient mice has made it possible to generate chimeric animals harboring human tissues and cells, including hepatocytes. the liver plays a central role in many human-specific biological processes and mice with humanized livers can be used to model human metabolism, liver injury, gene regulation, drug toxicity, and hepatotropic infections.
cell_biology	progress in biomaterial science and engineering and increasing knowledge in cell biology have enabled us to develop functional biomaterials providing appropriate biochemical and biophysical cues for tissue regeneration applications. tissue regeneration is particularly important to treat chronic wounds of people with diabetes. understanding and controlling the cellular microenvironment of the wound tissue are important to improve the wound healing process. in this study, we review different biochemical (e.g., growth factors, peptides, dna, and rna) and biophysical (e.g., topographical guidance, pressure, electrical stimulation, and pulsed electromagnetic field) cues providing a functional and instructive acellular matrix to heal diabetic chronic wounds. the biochemical and biophysical signals generally regulate cell-matrix interactions and cell behavior and function inducing the tissue regeneration for chronic wounds. some technologies and devices have already been developed and used in the clinic employing biochemical and biophysical cues for wound healing applications. these technologies can be integrated with smart biomaterials to deliver therapeutic agents to the wound tissue in a precise and controllable manner. this review provides useful guidance in understanding molecular mechanisms and signals in the healing of diabetic chronic wounds and in designing instructive biomaterials to treat them.
human_metabolism	purpose the presence of activated brown adipose tissue (abat) has been associated with a reduced risk of obesity in adults. we aimed to investigate whether the presence of abat in patients undergoing f-18-fdg pet/ct examinations was related to blood lipid profiles, liver function, and the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). methods we retrospectively and prospectively analysed the f-18-fdg pet/ct scans from 5,907 consecutive patients who were referred to the nuclear medicine department of the marmara university school of medicine from outpatient oncology clinics between july 2008 and june 2014 for a variety of diagnostic reasons. attenuation coefficients for the liver and spleen were determined for at least five different areas. blood samples were obtained before pet/ct to assess the blood lipid profiles and liver function. results a total of 25 of the 5,907 screened individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the study demonstrated brown fat tissue uptake [abat(+) subjects]. after adjustment for potential confounders, 75 individuals without evidence of abat on pet [abat(-) subjects] were enrolled for comparison purposes. the abat(+) group had lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase levels (p < 0.01), whereas we found no significant differences in the serum triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between the two groups. the prevalence of nafld was significantly lower in abat(+) than in abat(-) subjects (p < 0.01). conclusion our study showed that the presence of abat in adults had a positive effect on their blood lipid profiles and liver function and was associated with reduced prevalence of nafld. thus, our data suggest that activating brown adipose tissue may be a potential target for preventing and treating dyslipidaemia and nafld.
southern_blotting	exotoxins produced by actinobacillus (a.) pleuropneumoniae (apx) play major roles in the pathogenesis of pleuropneumonia in swine. this study investigated the role of apxi in hemolysis and cellular damage using a novel apxia mutant, apxia336, which was developed from the parental strain a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10 that produces only apxi in vitro. the genotype of apxia336 was confirmed by pcr, southern blotting, and gene sequencing. exotoxin preparation derived from apxia336 was analyzed for its bioactivity towards porcine erythrocytes and alveolar macrophages. analysis results indicated that apxia336 contained a kanamycin-resistant cassette inserted immediately after 1005 bp of the apxia gene. phenotype analysis of apxia336 revealed no difference in the growth rate as compared to the parental strain. meanwhile, apxi production was abolished in the bacterial culture supernatant, i.e. exotoxin preparation. the inability of apxia336 to produce apxi corresponded to the loss of hemolytic and cytotoxic bioactivity in exotoxin preparation, as demonstrated by hemolysis, lactate dehydrogenase release, mitochondrial activity, and apoptosis assays. additionally, the virulence of apxia336 appeared to be attenuated by 15-fold in balb/c mice. collectively, apxi, but not other components in the exotoxin preparation of a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 10, was responsible for the hemolytic and cytotoxic effects on porcine erythrocytes and alveolar macrophages.
cell_biology	chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a myeloproliferative disease with a characteristic bcr-abl tyrosine kinase (tk) fusion protein. despite the clinical efficacy accomplished by tkis therapies, disease progression may affect patient response rate to these inhibitors due to a multitude of factors that could lead to development of a mechanism known as multidrug resistance (mdr). 7-ketocholesterol (7kc) is an oxidized cholesterol derivative that has been extensively reported to cause cell death in a variety of cancer models. in this study, we showed the in vitro efficacy of 7kc against mdr leukemia cell line, lucena. 7kc treatment induced reduction in cell viability, together with apoptosis-mediated cell death. moreover, downregulation of mdr protein caused intracellular drug accumulation and 7kc co-incubation with either daunorubicin or vincristine reduced cell viability compared to the use of each drug alone. additionally, quantitative label-free mass spectrometry-based protein quantification showed alteration of different molecular pathways involved in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and misfolded protein response. conclusively, this study highlights the effect of 7kc as a sensitizing agent of multi drug resistance cml and elucidates its molecular mechanisms. significance: cml patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) have showed a 5-year estimated overall survival of 89%, with cumulative complete cytogenetic response of 87%. however, development of drug resistance is a common feature of the disease progression. this study aimed at showing the effect of 7kc as a cytotoxic and sensitizing agent of multidrug resistance cml cell lines. the cellular and molecular basis of this compound were elucidated using a comprehensive strategy based on quantitative proteomic and cell biology assays. we showed that 7kc induced cell death and overcomes drug resistance in cml through mechanisms that go beyond the classical mdr1 pathways.

genetics	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of upper and lower motor neurons. despite intensive research, the origin and progression of als remain largely unknown, suggesting that the traditional clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies might not be adequate to completely capture the molecular complexity underlying the disease. in our previous work, comprehensive genomic profiling of 41 motor cortex samples enabled to discriminate control from sporadic als patients and segregated these latter into two distinct subgroups, each associated with different deregulated genes and pathways. interestingly, some deregulated genes in sporadic als were previously associated with familiar als, indicating shared pathogenic mechanisms between the two forms of disease. in this, we performed cluster analysis on the same whole-genome expression profiles using a restricted (203) subset of genes extensively implicated in monogenic forms of als. surprisingly, this short and unbiased gene list was sufficiently representative to allow the accurate separation of sals patients from controls and the stratification of sals patients into two molecularly distinct subgroups. overall, our findings support the existence of a molecular taxonomy for als and represent a further step toward the establishment of a molecular-based diagnosis and patient-tailored therapies.
immunology	arctic wildlife can be exposed to high mercury (hg) levels, and are also naturally exposed to gastrointestinal parasites that can reduce condition and negatively affect reproductive output and/or survival in similar ways. importantly, both hg and parasites are increasing in wildlife in some arctic regions. we studied the northern common eider duck (somateria mollissima) to explore how hg in association with both natural levels and experimentally reduced parasitic infections, affect reproduction and survival. female eiders were measured, banded, and blood sampled to determine blood hg burdens, prior to breeding. propensity to nest, clutch size, nest survival, nest attendance, and return rates were assessed in relation to both hg burden and parasite treatment. neither reproduction nor return rates of females varied with hg concentrations, but females arriving late to the colony, or in low body condition, showed increased nesting propensity when given the anti-parasite treatment as compared to placebo treatment. our results suggest that parasites can play a critical role in decisions to invest in avian breeding annually, particularly among individuals with a late onset to breeding, and in poor condition. crown copyright (c) 2016 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
immunology	neutrophils (pmn) are best known for their phagocytic functions against invading pathogens and microorganisms. they have the shortest half-life amongst leukocytes and in their non-activated state are constitutively committed to apoptosis. when recruited to inflammatory sites to resolve inflammation, they produce an array of cytotoxic molecules with potent antimicrobial killing. yet, when these powerful cytotoxic molecules are released in an uncontrolled manner they can damage surrounding tissues. in recent years however, neutrophil versatility is increasingly evidenced, by demonstrating plasticity and immunoregulatory functions. we have recently identified a new neutrophil-derived subpopulation, which develops spontaneously in standard culture conditions without the addition of cytokines/growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf)/interleukin (il)-4. their phagocytic abilities of neutrophil remnants largely contribute to increase their size immensely; therefore they were termed giant phagocytes (g phi). unlike neutrophils, g phi are long lived in culture. they express the cluster of differentiation (cd) neutrophil markers cd66b/cd63/cd15/cd11b/myeloperoxidase (mpo)/neutrophil elastase (ne), and are devoid of the monocytic lineage markers cd14/cd16/cd163 and the dendritic cd1c/cd141 markers. they also take-up latex and zymosan, and respond by oxidative burst to stimulation with opsonized-zymosan and pma. g phi also express the scavenger receptors cd68/cd36, and unlike neutrophils, internalize oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxldl). moreover, unlike fresh neutrophils, or cultured monocytes, they respond to oxldl uptake by increased reactive oxygen species (ros) production. additionally, these phagocytes contain microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3b (lc3b) coated vacuoles, indicating the activation of autophagy. using specific inhibitors it is evident that both phagocytosis and autophagy are prerequisites for their development and likely nadph oxidase dependent ros. we describe here a method for the preparation of this new subpopulation of long-lived, neutrophil-derived phagocytic cells in culture, their identification and their currently known characteristics. this protocol is essential for obtaining and characterizing g phi in order to further investigate their significance and functions.
human_metabolism	this work shows that the main photochemical pathways of acetaminophen (apap) transformation in surface waters would be direct photolysis (with quantum yield of (4.57 +/- 0.17).10(-2)), reaction with co3- (most significant at ph >7, with second-order rate constant of (3.8 +/- 1.1).10(8) m-1 s(-1)) and possibly, for dissolved organic carbon higher than 5 mg c l-1, reaction with the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((cdom)-c-3*). the modelled photochemical half-life time of apap in environmental waters would range from days to few weeks in summertime, which suggests that the importance of phototransformation might be comparable to biodegradation. apap transformation by the main photochemical pathways yields hydroxylated derivatives, ring-opening compounds as well as dimers and trimers (at elevated concentration levels). in the case of (cdom)-c-3* (for which the triplet state of anthraquinone-2-sulphonate was used as proxy), ring rearrangement is also hypothesised. photochemistry would produce different transformation products (tps) of apap than microbial biodegradation or human metabolism, thus the relevant tps might be used as markers of apap photochemical reaction pathways in environmental waters.

molecular_biology	obesity continues to be a major global problem. various cancers are related to obesity and proper understanding of their aetiology, especially their molecular tumour biology is important for early diagnosis and better treatment. genes play an important role in the development of obesity. few genes such as leptin, leptin receptor encoded by the db (diabetes), pro-opiomelanocortin, agrp and npy and melanocortin-4 receptors and insulin-induced gene 2 were linked to obesity. micrornas control gene expression via mrna degradation and protein translation inhibition and influence cell differentiation, cell growth and cell death. overexpression of mir-143 inhibits tumour growth by suppressing b cell lymphoma 2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 activities and kras oncogene. cancers of the breast, uterus, renal, thyroid and liver are also related to obesity. any disturbance in the production of sex hormones and insulin, leads to distortion in the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. the possible mechanism linking obesity to cancer involves alteration in the level of adipokines and sex hormones. these mediators act as biomarkers for cancer progression and act as targets for cancer therapy and prevention. interestingly, many anti-cancerous drugs are also beneficial in treating obesity and vice versa. we also reviewed the possible link in the mechanism of few drugs which act both on cancer and obesity. the present review may be important for molecular biologists, oncologists and clinicians treating cancers and also pave the way for better therapeutic options.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: ovarian cancer is the leading lethal, gynecological malignancy in the united states. no doubt, the continued morbidity and mortality of ovarian cancer reflects a poor understanding of invasive mechanisms. recent studies reveal that ovarian cancers express aberrant micrornas (mirnas or mirs), some of which have oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties. several studies suggested that mir-205 is involved in tumorigenesis. presently, we investigate the molecular mechanisms and target of mir-205 in ovarian cancer. methods: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were performed to assess mir-205 and transcription factor 21 (tcf21) expression in ovarian cancer and normal ovary samples. the effect of mir-205 on tcf21 was determined by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. the effect of mir-205 and tcf21 on cell invasion was quantitated using transwell invasion assay. result: mir-205 expression was increased in ovarian cancer and it promoted the invasive behavior of ovarian cancer cell lines (ovcar-5, ovcar-8 and skov-3). mir-205 directly targeted tcf21, which was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissue. mir-205 inhibited tcf21 expression and as a consequence blunted the inhibitory effect of tcf21 on cell invasion. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. tcf21 inhibited mmp-2 and mmp-10 and decreased ovarian cancer cell invasion. co-transfection of tcf21 expression plasmid with mir-205 mimic diminished the inhibitory effect of tcf21 on mmp-2 and mmp-10 in ovarian cancer cells. conclusion: mir-205 appears to have an important role in the spread of ovarian cancer by targeting tcf21. these findings offer a new mechanism of ovarian cancer tumorigenesis, which could be useful for the development of new therapeutic approaches to ovarian cancer treatment.
northern_blotting	the shape of the inflorescence in arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia is a raceme with individual flowers developing acropetally. the ecotype landsberg harboring the erecta (er) mutation shows a corymb-like inflorescence, namely a compact inflorescence with a flattened arrangement of flower buds at the tip. to gain insight into inflorescence development, we previously isolated corymb-like inflorescence mutants, named corymbosal (crm1), and found that the corymb-like inflorescence in crm1-1 was due to reduced cell elongation of pedicels and stem internodes. double mutants of crm1 with er and crm2, and crm1-1 crm2-1 er-105 triple mutants show an additive phenotype. crm1-1 is caused by a mutation in big, which is required for polar auxin transport. crm1/big is expressed in inflorescence meristems, floral meristems and vascular tissues. we analyzed a collection of 12 reduced lateral root formation (rlr) mutants, which are allelic to crm1-1, and categorized the mutants into three classes, depending on the plant developmental defects. although all 12 alleles had new stop codons, the phenotype of heterozygous crm1-1/doc1-1 and northern blotting suggest that new crm1/big mutant alleles are hypomorphic. auxin-responsive dr5rev::gfp expression was decreased in crm1-1 vasculature of pedicels and stem internodes. pinformed1 (pin1) and crm1/big are expressed in vasculature of pedicels and stem internodes. the severity of corymb-like inflorescence in crm1/big mutants correlated with increased levels of pin1. our results suggest that crm1/big controls the elongation of the pedicels and stem internodes through auxin action.
genetics	we report herein results of a study performed in the balearic islands which had the following goals: 1) determine the proportion of pregnant or non-pregnant women planning pregnancy, who would choose to undergo a screening test for fragile x syndrome (fxs), if it is accompanied by the appropriate information; 2) assess satisfaction and any increase in stress among women who participate in screening; 3) collect epidemiological information about the incidence of the disease in our population; and 4) collect demographic and health history data and assess participants' awareness of the disease. screening was performed on 3,731 pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age and the results indicate: a very high voluntary rate of participation; a high level of self-reported satisfaction and low levels of stress because of the test; a very high incidence of premutation (1/106) in our population; and a low level of awareness about the existence of fxs (25 %). additional findings indicate no significant correlation between self-reported health history and premutation detection, and the high premutation incidence does not seem to be specific to the indigenous balearic population. based on these results, we discuss the pros and cons of an implementation of preconception and pregnant women screening for fxs within a public health screening program.
polymerase_chain_reaction	1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-dcp) and dichloromethane (dcm) are possible causative agents associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in employees working in printing plant in osaka, japan. however, few reports have demonstrated an association between these agents and cholangiocarcinoma in rodent carcinogenicity studies. moreover, the combined effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. in the present study, we evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1,2-dcp and dcm, alone or combined, in the livers of gpt delta rats. six-week-old male f344 gpt delta rats were treated with 1,2-dcp, dcm or 1,2-dcp+dcm by oral administration for 4weeks at the dose (200mgkg(-1) body weight 1,2-dcp and 500mgkg(-1) body weight dcm) used in the carcinogenesis study performed by the national toxicology program. in vivo mutagenicity was analyzed by gpt mutation/spi(-) assays in the livers of rats. in addition, gene and protein expression of cyp2e1 and gstt1, the major enzymes responsible for the genotoxic effects of 1,2-dcp and dcm, were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. gpt and spi(-) mutation frequencies were not increased by 1,2-dcp and/or dcm in any group. additionally, there were no significant changes in the gene and protein expression of cyp2e1 and gstt1 in any group. these results indicated that 1,2-dcp, dcm and 1,2-dcp+dcm had no significant impact on mutagenicity in the livers of gpt delta rats under our experimental conditions. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
enzymology	background: dna-pkcs stimulates the endonucleolytic activities of artemis but not the 5-exonuclease activity. results: point mutagenesis, small molecule inhibitors, and modulation of divalent cation concentrations all affect both the endonuclease and 5-exonuclease activities in parallel. conclusion: artemis has intrinsic 5-exonuclease activity, in addition to its known endonuclease activity. significance: artemis may use both its endo- and its 5-exonuclease activity in nhej. artemis is a member of the metallo--lactamase protein family. artemis has endonuclease activity at dna hairpins and at 5- and 3-dna overhangs of duplex dna, and this endonucleolytic activity is dependent upon dna-pkcs. there has been uncertainty about whether artemis also has 5-exonuclease activity on single-stranded dna and 5-overhangs, because this 5-exonuclease is not dependent upon dna-pkcs. here, we show that the 5-exonuclease and the endonuclease activities co-purify. second, we show that a point mutant of artemis at a putative active site residue (h115a) markedly reduces both the endonuclease activity and the 5-exonuclease activity. third, divalent cation effects on the 5-exonuclease and the endonuclease parallel one another. fourth, both the endonuclease activity and 5-exonuclease activity of artemis can be blocked in parallel by small molecule inhibitors, which do not block unrelated nucleases. we conclude that the 5-exonuclease is intrinsic to artemis, making it relevant to the role of artemis in nonhomologous dna end joining.
immunology	background: alloimmunization against human platelet antigens (hpas) can occur prenatally and induce fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (fnait). the aim of this study was to identify placental histological features associated with platelet alloimmunization and their clinical significance. methods: this study examined 21 placentas from fnait-affected pregnancies and 42 age-matched control cases, all collected from pathology departments in the rhone-alpes region. clinical and laboratory findings were collected for each fnait case. two pathologists reviewed the placental slides of each fnait and control case. histological features, with special emphasis on chronic inflammatory lesions, were evaluated. differences between the two groups were calculated with odds ratios (ors) and assessed with wald 's chi-square. results: fnait was associated with a significantly higher frequency of chronic chorioamnionitis (cc) (or 14, 95%cl 1.7-113.8), basal chronic villitis (bcv) (or 17, 95%ci 2-145.6) and chronic intervillositis (civ). chronic villitis (cv) (or 3.7, 95%ci 0.9-15.2) and chronic deciduitis (cd) (or 4.7, 95%ci 0.79-28.2) were also more frequent in the fnait than the control group, but these differences were not statistically significant. conclusions: fnait is significantly associated with cc, bcv, and civ. this chronic inflammatory reaction is preferentially localized on the maternofetal interface. anti-hpa alloimmunization may trigger an immunological conflict similar to graft-versus-host disease.

genetics	five species of whale with matrilineal social systems (daughters remain with mothers) have remarkably low levels of mitochondrial dna diversity. non-heritable matriline-level demography could reduce genetic diversity but the required conditions are not consistent with the natural histories of the matrilineal whales. the diversity of nuclear microsatellites is little reduced in the matrilineal whales arguing against bottlenecks. selective sweeps of the mitochondrial genome are feasible causes but it is not clear why these only occurred in the matrilineal species. cultural hitchhiking (cultural selection reducing diversity at neutral genetic loci transmitted in parallel to the culture) is supported in sperm whales which possess suitable matrilineal socio-cultural groups (coda clans). killer whales are delineated into ecotypes which likely originated culturally. culture, bottlenecks and selection, as well as their interactions, operating between- or within-ecotypes, may have reduced their mitochondrial diversity. the societies, cultures and genetics of false killer and two pilot whale species are insufficiently known to assess drivers of low mitochondrial diversity.
cell_biology	diet-induced obesity can lead to detrimental chronic disorders. the severity of this global epidemic has encouraged ongoing research to characterize the mechanisms underlying obesity and its comorbidities. recent evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids (sea) in high-fat diets rapidly generate inflammation in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (arc), which centrally regulates whole-body energy homeostasis. herein, we will review the roles of hypothalamic neurons and resident microglia in the initiation of sfa-induced hypothalamic inflammation. particularly, we focus on neuronal and microglial free fatty acid-sensing and capacity to produce inflammatory signaling. we also outline a potential role of peripherally-derived monocytes in this inflammation. and finally, we explore synaptic plasticity as a mechanism through which hypothalamic inflammation can modulate arc circuitry, and thus disrupt energy homeostasis.

immunology	chronic granulomatous disease (cgd), a disease characterized by inadequate neutrophil killing of microbial pathogens, affects 4 to 5 per million live births. for many decades following its description, cgd was a fatal disease in childhood. with the development of effective preventive therapies and the early recognition of infectious complications, 90% of children with cgd now survive into adulthood. the management of cgd in adults includes unique challenges and potential disease manifestations. in this article, the authors discuss the current approach to the management of cgd in both children and adults. this includes a focus on the importance of a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach in the care of cgd and its potential complications. in addition, a novel approach to improving education about cgd, and subsequently improving adherence to preventive therapies, is discussed.

enzymology	ap endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester bond 5'- to the ap (apurinic or apyrimidinic) sites and is one of the major enzymes involved in base excision repair. so far, the properties of several archaeal ap endonuclease homologues have been characterized in vitro, but little is known about their functions in vivo. herein, we report on the biochemical and genetic analysis of two ap endonucleases, sisexoiii and sisendoiv, from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon sulfolobus islandicus rey15a. both sisexoiii and sisendoiv exhibit ap endonuclease activity, but neither of them has 3'-5' exonuclease activity. sisexoiii and sisendoiv have similar k (m) values on the substrate containing an ap site, but the latter cleaves the ap substrate at a dramatically higher catalytic rate than the former. unlike other ap endonucleases identified in archaea, sisexoiii and sisendoiv do not exhibit any cleavage activity on dna having oxidative damage (8-oxo-dg) or uracil. genetic analysis revealed that neither gene is essential for cell viability, and the growth of a dagger sire_2666 (endoiv), a dagger sire_0100 (exoiii), and a dagger sire_0100a dagger sire_2666 is not affected under normal growth conditions. however, a dagger sire_2666 exhibits higher sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (mms) than a dagger sire_0100. over-expression of sire_0100 can partially complement the sensitivity of a dagger sire_2666 to mms, suggesting a backup role of sisexoiii in ap site processing in vivo. intriguingly, over-expression of sisendoiv renders the strain more sensitive to mms than the control. taken together, we conclude that sisendoiv, but not sisexoiii, is the main ap endonuclease that participates directly in base excision repair in s. islandicus.
immunology	cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection occurs frequently in young children, who, when infected, are then a major source of transmission. oral cmv shedding by 14 infants with primary infection was comprehensively characterized using quantitative polymerase chain reaction weekly for >= 9 months. three phases of oral shedding were identified: expansion, transition, and clearance. viral expansion occurred over a median of 7 weeks, with a median doubling time of 3 days. during the transition phase, expansion slowed over a median of 6 weeks before peak viral load was reached. clearance was slow (22-day median half-life), and shedding did not resolve during observation for any infant. mathematical modeling demonstrated that prolonged oral cmv expansion is explained by a low within-host reproduction number (median, 1.63) and a delayed immune response that only decreases the infected cell half-life by 44%. thus, the prolonged oral cmv shedding observed during primary infection can be explained by slow viral expansion and inefficient immunologic control.
human_metabolism	background: there is evidence that adipocytokines play an important role in metabolism and in inflammation. because human metabolism dramatically changes in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and chronic inflammation is the hallmark of the disease, we studied serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn 's disease (cd) in comparison with healthy controls (hc). methods: leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and active ghrelin serum levels were measured in 100 ibd patients (46 uc and 54 cd) and in 60 matched hc using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin levels were correlated with disease activity, type, localization, and treatment. results: mean serum leptin levels were 10.6 +/- 2.0 ng/ml in uc patients, 12.5 +/- 2.6 ng/ml in cd patients, and 15.0 +/- 1.8 ng/rnl in hc (p = .01). mean serum adiponectin levels were 9514.8 +/- 787.8 ng/ml in uc patients, 7651.1 +/- 613 ng/ml in cd patients, and 7270.6 +/- 559.4 ng/ml in hc (p = .05). mean serum resistin levels were 21.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml in uc patients, 18.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml in cd patients and 11.8 +/- 0.6 ng/ml in hc (p = .0002). mean serum ghrelin levels were 48.2 +/- 4.2 pg/ml in uc patients, 49.4 +/- 4.6 pg/ml in cd patients and 14.8 +/- 3.0 pg/ml in hc (p < .0001). serum levels of these adipocytokines were not correlated with either c-reactive protein levels or the clinical indices of activity. no association between serum adipocytokines levels and disease localization in both uc and cd patients was found. only serum ghrelin was significantly higher in ileal compared with colonic cd (p = .04). conclusions: serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, and active ghrelin are increased whereas serum levels of leptin are decreased in patients with ibd. further studies are needed to elucidate the role of adipocytokines in ibd.
southern_blotting	type-a spermatogonia first appear at between 3-7 d postnatally in mice and are the only immortalized diploid cells that reproduce in adulthood in these animals. in our current study, we explored the feasibility of producing stable transgenic mice using these cells. enhanced pegfp-n1 plasmids were suspended in exgen500 transfection reagent and injected at different angles into the testes of 7-d-old male icr mice. the resulting type-a spermatogonia-mediated gene transfer (tasmgt) mice were then mated with normal females at different stages of sexual maturity (6, 12, and 24 wk). the integration and expression of the introduced egfp gene was evaluated in the f(1) transgenic offspring by pcr and southern blotting analysis. the foreign gene integration rates for a low-dose group (15 mu l gene suspension injected into each testis) and a high-dose group (30 mu l suspensions injected) at the three stages of female sexual maturity tested were 11.76% (2/17), 14.29% (3/21), and 11.11% (2/18), and 5% (1/20), 5.56% (1/18), and 0 (0/17), respectively. the average integration rates for these two dose groups were 12.5% (7/56) and 3.64% (2/55), respectively, which was a significant difference (p<0.05). semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis further showed that the introduced gfp gene was expressed in 3/9 integration mice. in addition, gfp expression was observed in the sperm cells from the tasmgt mice, and also in the embryos and f(2) pups from the f(1) generation transgenic mice. hence, although the foreign gene integration rate for tasmgt is not high and the transgenic offspring show as yet unexplained defects, our results indicate that this method is a potentially feasible and reproducible new approach to creating transgenic mice.
northern_blotting	objective: normalization of mrna data, i.e., the calculation of mrna expression values comparable in between different experiments, is a major issue in biomedical and orthopaedic/rheumatology research, both for single-gene technologies [northern blotting, conventional and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr)] and large-scale gene expression experiments. in this study, we tested several established normalization methods for their effects on gene expression measurements. method. five standard normalization strategies were applied on a previously published data set comparing peripheral and central late stage osteoarthritic cartilage samples. results: the different normalization procedures had profound effects on the distribution as well as the significance values of the gene expression levels. all applied normalization procedures, except the median absolute deviation scaling, showed a bias towards up- or down-regulation of genes as visualized in volcano plots. of interest, the p-values were much more depending on the normalization procedure than the fold changes. ten commonly used housekeeping genes showed a significant variability in between the different specimens investigated. the gene expression analysis by cdna arrays was confirmed for these genes by qpcr. conclusion: this study documents how much normalization strategies influence the outcome of gene expression profiling analysis (i.e., the detection of regulated genes). different normalization approaches can significantly change the p-values and fold changes of a large number of genes. thus, it is of vital importance to check every individual step of gene expression data analysis for its appropriateness. the use of global robustness and quality measures for analyzing individual outcomes can help in estimating the reliability of final microarray study results.

polymerase_chain_reaction	background & aims: mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs) mediate tissue repair and might be used to prevent or reduce liver fibrosis. however, little is known about the anti-fibrotic factors secreted from mscs or their mechanisms. methods: umbilical cord-derived mscs ( ucmscs) were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells ( hpucmscs), medium was collected, and secretome proteins were identified and quantified using nanochip-liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. liver fibrosis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide or ccl4; some mice were then given injections of secretomes or proteins. liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology or polymerase chain reaction array to analyze changes in gene expression patterns. we analyzed the effects of msc secretomes and potential anti-fibrotic proteins on transforming growth factor beta 1 ( tgf beta 1)-mediated activation of human hepatic stellate cell ( hsc) lines ( htert-hsc and lx2) and human primary hscs. liver tissues were collected from 16 patients with liver cirrhosis and 16 individuals without cirrhosis ( controls) in korea and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. results: in mice with fibrosis, accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins was significantly reduced 3 days after injecting secretomes from ucmscs, and to a greater extent from hpucmscs; numbers of activated hscs that expressed the myogenic marker a-smooth muscle actin ( alpha-sma, encoded by acta2 [ actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle]) were also reduced. secretomes from ucmscs, and to a greater extent from hpucmscs, reduced liver expression of multiple fibrotic factors, collagens, metalloproteinases, tgf beta, and smad proteins in the tgfb signaling pathways. in hsc cell lines and primary hscs, tgf beta 1-stimulated upregulation of alpha-sma was significantly inhibited ( and smad2 phosphorylation reduced) by secretomes from ucmscs, and to a greater extent from hpucmscs. we identified 32 proteins in secretomes of ucmscs that were more highly concentrated in secretomes from hpucmscs and inhibited tgf beta-mediated activation of hscs. one of these, milk fat globule-egf factor 8 ( mfge8), was a strong inhibitor of activation of human primary hscs. we found mfge8 to downregulate expression of tgfb type i receptor by binding to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin on hscs and to be secreted by mscs from umbilical cord, teeth, and bone marrow. in mice, injection of recombinant human mfge8 had anti-fibrotic effects comparable to those of the hpucmsc secretome, reducing extracellular matrix deposition and hsc activation. co-injection of an antibody against mfge8 reduced the anti-fibrotic effects of the hpucmsc secretome in mice. levels of mfge8 were reduced in cirrhotic liver tissue from patients compared with controls. conclusions: mfge8 is an anti-fibrotic protein in msc secretomes that strongly inhibits tgf beta signaling and reduces extracellular matrix deposition and liver fibrosis in mice.
molecular_biology	5-bromouracil is a nucleobase analogue that can replace thymine in dna strands and acts as a strong radiosensitizer, with potential applications in molecular biology and cancer therapy. here, the deactivation of 5-bromouracil after ultraviolet irradiation is investigated in the singlet and triplet manifold by accurate quantum chemistry calculations and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. it is found that, after irradiation to the bright pp* state, three main relaxation pathways are, in principle, possible: relaxation back to the ground state, intersystem crossing (isc) and c-br photodissociation. based on accurate ms-caspt2 optimizations, we propose that ground-state relaxation should be the predominant deactivation pathway in the gas phase. we then employ different electronic structure methods to assess their suitability to carry out excited-state dynamics simulations. mrcis (multi-reference configuration interaction including single excitations) was used in surface hopping simulations to compute the ultrafast isc dynamics, which mostly involves the (1)n(o)pi* and (3)pi pi* states. this article is part of the themed issue 'theoretical and computational studies of non-equilibrium and non-statistical dynamics in the gas phase, in the condensed phase and at interfaces'.
molecular_biology	background: in many parts of the old world, domesticated camels (genus - camelus) are an essential resource, providing food, labor, commodities, and sport to millions of people of the three extent species, two have been domesticated (single-humped dromedarius, camelus dromedarius, and two humped bactrian camels camelus bactrianus) and one remains wild (two-humped wild bactrian camels camelus ferus). all three species possess a variety adaptations to harsh desert conditions, including mechanisms to tolerate of extreme temperatures, dehydration, and sandy terrain. people residing in harsh climate zones of the world are being benefitted by raising camels in terms of draft, milk, meat, hides and wool from centuries. there are different breeds of dromedary camels distributed in various parts of pakistan; however there have been scarcity of research work on camels in pakistan. identification of novel link between camel breeders with fatal neurodegenerative disorders is presence or not can be detect by a prion gene and it was not carried out in pakistan soil to date. prion diseases which are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affect both animals and humans. it is believed that the prions are infectious agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. in this study we report the first study on prion protein gene in dromedary camels of pakistan. material, methods & results: genes are the blueprint of life and determine the functional aspects of cellular mechanisms. genomic dna of the enrolled blood samples was extracted using the nucleospin((r)) dna extraction kit. genomic dna was run on agarose gel electrophoresis, checked the genomic dna quality and amplified using prion region specific primer pair. prion protein gene was amplified (770 bp) in 35 individuals of seven dromedary camel breeds from the province balochistan and punjab of pakistan. samples having required fragment size were selected and sent for sequencing through sanger sequencing. all the sequences were aligned through multiple sequence alignment and edited using codon code aligner and explored for phylogenetic analysis. a portion of 667 bp was finally selected for phylogenetic analysis of dromedary camels from pakistan with 61 different mammalian species (drawn from genbank) that revealed five different clades. we found 99.9% nucleotide sequence similarities among dromedary camels (germany), dromedary camels (iran), and dromedary camels (pakistan). we observed deletion in dromedary camels in codon region 66-69 except wild bactrian camels that might be the causative factor for prion protein gene resistance in camels. the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates was used to draw phylogenetic tree. discussion: this study documents the presence of 14 prp polymorphisms and shows the relationship between different camel breeds. the deletion had not previously been examined prp allelic variation, and was found to segregate in these breeds. however, additional data are necessary to demonstrate prp and genetic approach will be ideal for the future studies and, more investigations are necessary to demonstrate prp genetic resistance in camels. the utility of these techniques in identifying prion genes and selecting superior animals and culling the weak animals and making them parents of the next generation that will lead to producing more meat and milk with fewer animals are well discussed and by slaughtering of high prion incidence will eliminate human animal fatal neurodegenerative disorders.
immunology	background: patients who have failed traditional treatment of chronic urticaria may require trials of alternative medications. safety profiles, continuous laboratory monitoring, and physician comfort are often barriers to treatment. objectives: to evaluate the safety of alternative agents used in chronic urticaria. methods: a retrospective chart review of electronic medical records from a single-center allergy and immunology clinic in a major academic hospital was conducted. one hundred twenty-six charts of patients with chronic urticaria treated with alternative agents were reviewed. results: adverse effects were reported in 39 of 73 (53%) patients on dapsone, 19 of 47 (40%) patients on sulfasalazine, 15 of 36 (42%) patients on tacrolimus, 7 of 45 (16%) patients on hydroxychloroquine, 9 of 27 (33%) patients on mycophenolate, 6 of 8 (75%) patients on cyclosporine, and 3 of 24 (4%) patients on omalizumab. most of these adverse effects were mild, did not require discontinuation of the medication, and resolved after stopping the medication or decreasing the dose. conclusions: the use of alternative agents for the treatment of chronic urticaria angioedema is generally safe when proper laboratory and clinical monitoring is observed.

human_metabolism	occurring alongside the main saccharide components, antioxidant compounds in honey play significant roles in human metabolism and nutrition. six individual organic acids and two saccharides were determined by a simple and rapid capillary electrophoretic technique without any special treatment. gluconic acid was the predominant organic acid and was detected in all samples. formic, malic, citric and succinic acids were determined at minor concentrations, while oxalic acid was not detected in any of the samples. glucose and fructose content was found between 223.50 g.kg(-1) and 422.40 g.kg(-1), and 310.20 g.kg(-1) and 642.20 g.kg(-1), respectively. the fructose/glucose ratios of the ten honey samples in this study were between 1.18 and 1.75 with an average value of 1.50. gluconic acid content changed depending on the type of honey between 1.50 g.kg(-1) and 13.8 g.kg(-1) with an average value of 6.24 g.kg(-1), while the other organic acids were at minor concentrations, or were not detected at all. the antioxidant properties of the honey were analysed in terms of total polyphenols, ferric-reducing/antioxidant power (frap) and 1,1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) scavenging activities. among the samples, darker honeys showed higher antioxidant values, related to their total phenolic compound contents.
enzymology	introduction: enzymes are the macromolecular catalysts of many living processes and represent a sizable proportion of all druggable biological targets. enzymology has been practiced just over a century during which much progress has been made in both the identification of new enzymes and the development of novel methodologies for enzyme kinetics. areas covered: this review aims to address several key practical aspects in enzyme kinetics in reference to translational drug discovery research. the authors first define what constitutes a high performance enzyme kinetic assay. the authors then review the best practices for turnover, activation and inhibition kinetics to derive critical parameters guiding drug discovery. notably, the authors recommend global progress curve analysis of dose/time dependence employing an integrated michaelis-menten equation and global curve fitting of dose/dose dependence. expert opinion: the authors believe that in vivo enzyme and substrate abundance and their dynamics, binding modality, drug binding kinetics and enzyme 's position in metabolic networks should be assessed to gauge the translational impact on drug efficacy and safety. integrating these factors in a systems biology and systems pharmacology model should facilitate translational drug discovery.
polymerase_chain_reaction	background and objectivebacteria in the dental biofilm surrounding marginal gingival grooves cause periodontal diseases. numerous bacteria within the biofilm consume nutrients from the gingival crevicular fluid. furthermore, some gram-negative bacteria in mature dental biofilms produce butyrate. thus, gingival epithelial cells in close proximity to mature dental biofilms are at risk of both starvation and exposure to butyrate. in the present study, we determined the combined effects of starvation and butyrate exposure on gingival epithelial cell death and the underlying mechanisms. material and methodsthe ca9-22 cell line was used as an in vitro counterpart of gingival epithelial cells. cell death was measured as the amount of total dna in the dead cells using sytox green dye, which penetrates through membranes of dead cells and emits fluorescence when it intercalates into double-stranded dna. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) activity, the amount of autophagy, and acetylation of histone h3 were determined using western blot. gene expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3b (lc3b) were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. resultsbutyrate-induced cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner whether cells were starved or fed. however, the induction of cell death was two to four times higher when cells were placed under starvation conditions compared to when they were fed. moreover, both starvation and butyrate exposure induced ampk activity and autophagy. while ampk inactivation resulted in decreased autophagy and butyrate-induced cell death under conditions of starvation, ampk activation resulted in butyrate-induced cell death when cells were fed. combined with the results of our previous report, which demonstrated butyrate-induced autophagy-dependent cell death, the results of this study suggest that the combination of starvation and butyrate exposure activates ampk inducing autophagy and subsequent cell death. notably, this combination markedly induced lc3b production and the induction was attenuated by ampk inhibition. lc3b knockdown, in turn, significantly decreased butyrate-induced cell death. therefore, ampk-dependent lc3b induction apparently plays an important role in butyrate-induced cell death. there was a lack of correspondence between the levels of ampk activation and lc3b induction; this may reflect the histone deacetylase-inhibitory capacity of butyrate on histone proteins. conclusiontaken together, starvation and butyrate exposure promote autophagy via ampk signaling, while the histone deacetylase-inhibitory effects of butyrate alter chromatin to transcriptionally active state, resulting in strong lc3b induction and subsequent cell death. these findings may help improve the understanding of the cellular processes underlying periodontal disease initiation.
southern_blotting	two promoter probe plasmid vectors, designated pipp1 and pipp2, were constructed from the existing plasmids pxe4 and pset152. pipp1 and 2 use the xyle gene of pseudomonas putida as a reporter and can be transferred to streptomycetes by conjugation from escherichia coli. the function of these plasmids as promoter probes was demonstrated in streptomyces antibioticus and streptomyces coelicolor using the phenoxazinone synthase and polynucleotide phosphorylase promoters from s. antibioticus. xyle activity could be detected in colonies on agar plates or via the in vitro assay for catechol dioxygenase. the integration into the s. antibioticus chromosome of the constructs containing the phsa promoter was verified by southern blotting. the presence of the bla locus in pipp1 allows the recovery of putative promoters by marker rescue.

southern_blotting	the marine photosynthetic bacterium rhodovulum sulfidophilum produces extracellular nucleic acids involved in its flocculation. previously, we showed that the rna fraction of these extracellular nucleic acids released into the culture medium contains mainly non-aminoacylated fully mature-sized trnas and fragments of 16s and 23s rrnas. here, we report the characterization of extracellular dna itself and its production during cultivation. no differences were detected in nucleotide sequence between the intracellular dna and extracellular soluble dna on southern blotting. whole intracellular dna seemed to be released from the cell. the bacterial floc was degraded by deoxyribonuclease or ribonuclease treatment, indicating that at least the extracellular dna and rnas in the floc are involved in the maintenance of the floc. when cultivated in nutritionally rich medium, the bacteria formed small flocs and produced large amounts of extracellular dna, which were solubilized in the medium. in nutritionally poor medium, however, huge flocs of cells appeared and almost no extracellular soluble dna was observed in the medium. as the floc was degraded by deoxyribonuclease treatment, it seems likely that the extracellular soluble dna observed in the rich medium may be incorporated into the large floc and play a role in floc maintenance in poor medium. addition of an inhibitor of quorum sensing, alpha-cyclodextrin, inhibited huge floc maintenance in the nutritionally poor medium. in the presence of alpha-cyclodextrin, the floc was rapidly degraded and extracellular soluble dna production increased.
northern_blotting	background/aims: the organization of actin cytoskeleton in podocyte foot processes plays a critical role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. the camp pathway is an important regulator of the actin network assembly in cells. however, the role of the camp pathway in podocytes is not well understood. type 1 adenylate cyclase (adcy1), previously thought to be specific for neuronal tissue, is a member of the family of enzymes that catalyses the formation of camp. in this study, we characterized the expression and role of adcy1 in the kidney. methods: expression of adcy1 was studied by rt-pcr, northern blotting and in situ hybridization. the role of adcy1 in podocytes was investigated by analyzing adcy1 knockout mice (adcy1-/-). results and conclusion: adcy1 is expressed in the kidney specifically by podocytes. in the kidney, adcy1 does not have a critical role in normal physiological functioning as kidney histology and function are normal in adcy1-/-mice. however, albumin overload resulted in severe albuminuria in adcy1-/-mice, whereas wild-type control mice showed only mild albumin leakage to urine. in conclusion, we have identified adcy1 as a novel podocyte signaling protein that seems to have a role in compensatory physiological processes in the glomerulus. copyright (c) 2010 s. karger ag, basel
enzymology	hybridization between divergent species can be analyzed to elucidate expression patterns of distinct parental characteristics, as well as to provide information about the extent of reproductive isolation between species. a known hybrid cross between two rattlesnakes with highly divergent venom phenotypes provided the opportunity to examine occurrence of parental venom characteristics in the f-1 hybrids as well as ontogenetic shifts in the expression of these characters as the hybrids aged. although venom phenotypes of adult rattlesnake venoms are known for many species, the effect of hybridization on phenotype inheritance is not well understood, and effects of hybridization on venom ontogeny have not yet been investigated. the current study investigates both phenomena resulting from the hybridization of a male snake with type i degradative venom, crotalus oreganus helleri (southern pacific rattlesnake), and a female snake with type ii highly toxic venom, crotalus scutulatus scutulatus (mojave rattlesnake). sds-page, enzymology, western blot and reversed phase hplc (rp-hplc) were used to characterize the venom of the c. o. helleri male, the c. s. scutulatus female and their two hybrid offspring as they aged. in general, crotalus o. helleri x c s. scutulatus hybrid venoms appeared to exhibit overlapping parental venom profiles, and several different enzyme activity patterns. both hybrids expressed c. o. helleri father-specific myotoxins as well as c. s. scutulatus mother -specific mojave toxin. snake venom metalloprotease activity displayed apparent sex -influenced expression patterns, while hybrid serine protease activities were intermediate to parental activities. the c. s. scutulatus x c. o. helleri hybrid male 's venom profile provided the strongest evidence that type i and type ii venom characteristics are expressed simultaneously in hybrid venoms, as this snake contained distinctive characteristics of both parental species. however, the possibility of sex -influenced development of metalloprotease activity, as seen in the ontogenetic shifts of the hybrid female, may influence the levels of expression of both type i and type ii characteristics in hybrid venoms. ultimately, the chronological analysis of this known hybrid system reveals the most distinct characteristics that can be used in determining successful hybridization between snakes that follow the type i-type ii trend in rattlesnake venom composition, namely the presence of metalloprotease activity and mojave toxin.

human_metabolism	in healthy subjects some tissues in the human body display metabolic flexibility, by this we mean the ability for the tissue to switch its fuel source between predominantly carbohydrates in the postprandial state and predominantly fats in the fasted state. many of the pathways involved with human metabolism are controlled by insulin and insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type-2 diabetes are characterised by a loss or impairment of metabolic flexibility. in this paper we derive a system of 12 first-order coupled differential equations that describe the transport between and storage in different tissues of the human body. we find steady state solutions to these equations and use these results to nondimensionalise the model. we then solve the model numerically to simulate a healthy balanced meal and a high fat meal and we discuss and compare these results. our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data where we have data available to us and the results show behaviour that agrees with intuition where we currently have no data with which to compare.
human_metabolism	nutrition research is in the process of addressing a series of questions related to the future of diet and health. are all humans the same with respect to their response to diet? if not, humans must be fed differently according to the differences in their genetics and metabolic needs. are those differences self-evident to the individual or their care-givers? if not, methods must be developed to measure the basis of differences between humans. are the current sets of diagnostic biomarkers for disease appropriate and sufficient to distinguish the appropriate diets of humans for optimal metabolic health? if not, metabolites must be measured such that the differences in human metabolism are resolvable before they become diseased. will a small subset of metabolic markers provide an indication of intended and unintended effects of diets that relate to overall metabolism? if not, comprehensive metabolic analyses (metabolomics) must be put in place to ensure that all aspects of health are accurately assessed. inappropriate dietary choices are accelerating the development of chronic metabolic disease and threatening to overwhelm public health 's ability to manage them. nutrition and food sciences will need to collaborate with other scientific disciplines to develop and implement metabolic assessment technologies and to assemble annotated databases of metabolite profiles in humans, thus building the knowledge needed to link metabolism to diet and health. biochemical and physiological research must be guided to define the mechanisms by which diet interacts with metabolism in different individuals. integrating metabolism with the genetic and dietary variables that affect health is the role of nutrition sciences. integrating personal nutritional value with food 's other key values of safety, quality, comfort, delight, convenience and affordability is the role of food science. it is time for these two fields to address a common problem, metabolic health, with coordinated solutions.
molecular_biology	plant virus ecology mainly focuses upon populations and their interactions with host plants within environment. the subject includes interesting insights as many factors which affect the virus behavior, population, virus-vector interactions, biodiversity and host plants genotypes are involved in it. moreover the achievements in the field of molecular ecology by application of recent molecular biology techniques are included which enhance the strength in understanding the economically important virus populations, growth and their world wide spread. virus infection results direct and indirect effect on insect vectors by evolution of changes in their life cycles, health and interacting behaviors that support their spread. similarly, the description of the recent information about how plant viruses disseminate towards the important agro-ecological zones in naturally managed vegetations and which factors play important role in ecological aspects are also included in this review. the modern era of science and technology requires a better understanding about movement of viruses in both directions which has become a highly important issue to levitate such kinds of aspects thus making plant virus ecology an exciting research discipline in future.
northern_blotting	background and aim: the tumor-suppressing role of ras-association domain family 1a (rassf1a) has been described in several systems. in this study, we tested its tumor-suppressing ability and the potential molecular mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) from qidong county. methods: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting were employed to detect the expression of rassf1a in hcc. after establishing stable rassf1a (wild type or mutant) expressing 'qi dong gan ai yan jiu suo' ([qidong institute of liver cancer] qgy)-7703 cell lines, we tested the effects of rassf1a expression on cell growth by cell proliferation rate, cell colony formation, and cell cycle progression. we also tested the effects of rassf1a expression on tumorigenesis in nude mice and on cellular sensitivity to mitomycin treatment. results: the rassf1a transcript was not found in 75% (three of four) of hcc cell lines and 67% (32/48) of hcc primary biopsies. the stepwise regression analyses indicated that the loss of rassf1a expression was more frequent in patients who were hepatitis b virus surface antigen positive (hbsag+) compared to those who were hbsag(-), both in tumor and corresponding non-cancerous tissues. the wild-type (wt)-rassf1a expression in the qgy-7703 cell line resulted in fewer and smaller clones, decreased xenograft tumor volume and weight, and g(1)/s arrest in vitro and in vivo. the wt-rassf1a expression also decreased the cyclin d1 protein expression, which appeared to be at the level of post-transcriptional control. in addition, the wt-rassf1a expression increased cell growth inhibition and the percentage of cells with sub-g(1) dna content when the cells were treated with mitomycin. conclusion: rassf1a is a tumor suppressor in hcc. the loss of rassf1a expression may be related to hbsag+ in hepatocarcinogenesis. its inactivation may play an important role in the development of hcc.
polymerase_chain_reaction	we explored the expression and function of mir-181d (microrna-181d) in human pancreatic cancer. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to probe mir-181d expression in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and human pancreatic carcinoma. pancreatic cancer cell lines, panc-1 and aspc-1 cells, were engineered to stably downregulate endogenous mir-181d through lentiviral transduction. the mechanistic effects of mir-181d downregulation on pancreatic cancer development were tested by proliferation, migration, fluorouracil chemosensitivity assays in vitro, and explant assay in vivo. possible mir-181d downstream gene, nkain2 (na+/k+ transporting atpase interacting 2), was tested by dual-luciferase activity assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. functional involvement of nkain2 in mir-181d-regulated pancreatic cancer development was tested by small interfering rna-mediated nkain2 knockdown in mir-181d-downregulated panc-1 and aspc-1 cells. mir-181d was upregulated in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and human pancreatic carcinoma. lentivirus-induced mir-181d downregulation decreased pancreatic cancer proliferation, migration, and fluorouracil resistance in vitro and inhibited the growth of cancer explant in vivo. nkain2 was directly targeted by mir-181d in pancreatic cancer. small interfering rna-mediated nkain2 knockdown reversed the inhibition of mir-181d downregulation on pancreatic cancer development. mir-181d is aberrantly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. inhibiting mir-181d may suppress pancreatic cancer development, possibly through the inverse regulation on nkain2.
cell_biology	tcl/rhoj is a cdc42-related rho gtpase with reported activities in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis, metastatic melanoma, and corneal epithelial cells; however, less is known about how it is inherently regulated in comparison to its closest homologues tc10 and cdc42. tcl has an n-terminal extension of 18 amino acids in comparison to cdc42, but the function of this amino acid sequence has not been elucidated. a truncation mutant lacking the n terminus (n) was found to alter tcl plasma membrane localization and nucleotide binding, and additional truncation and point mutants mapped the alterations of tcl biochemistry to amino acids 17-20. interestingly, whereas the tcl n mutant clearly influenced nucleotide exchange, deletion of the n terminus from its closest homologue, tc10, did not have a similar effect. chimeras of tcl and tc10 revealed amino acids 121-129 of tcl contributed to the differences in nucleotide loading. together, these results identify amino acids within the n terminus and a loop region distal to the nucleotide binding pocket of tcl capable of allosterically regulating nucleotide exchange and thus influence membrane association of the protein.
human_metabolism	blue mussels (mytilus edulis) accumulate and biotransform arsenic (as) to a larger variety of arsenicals than most seafood. eight volunteers ingested a test meal consisting of 150 g blue mussel (680) mu g as), followed by 72 h with an identical, low as controlled diet and full urine sampling. we provide a complete speciation, with individual patterns, of urinary as excretion. total as (tas) urinary excretion was 328 +/- 47 mu g, whereof arsenobetaine (ab) and dimethylarsinate (dma) accounted for 66% and 21%, respectively. fifteen minor urinary arsenicals were quantified with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icpms) coupled to reverse-phase, anion and cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). thio-arsenicals and non-thio minor arsenicals (including inorganic as (ias) and methylarsonate (ma)) contributed 10% and 7% of the total sum of species excretion, respectively, but there were large individual differences in the excretion patterns. apparently, formation of thio-arsenicals was negatively correlated to ab formation and excretion, possibly indicating a metabolic interrelationship. the results may be of toxicological relevance since dma and ma have been classified as possibly carcinogenic, and six of the excreted as species were thio-arsenicals which recently have been recognized as toxic, while ias toxicity is well known.

human_metabolism	monitoring human metabolism is of crucial importance for personalized medicine. the aim of the present work is to design an interface circuit to realize an integrated platform for the detection of endogenous and exogenous metabolites for implantable applications. cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry are the most common methods for metabolite detection. we propose a cmos circuit to implement these two methods in a multi- target detection scheme.
genetics	particle markov chain monte carlo (pmcmc) is a stochastic algorithm designed to generate samples from a probability distribution, when the density of the distribution does not admit a closed form expression. pmcmc is most commonly used to sample from the bayesian posterior distribution in state-space models (ssms), a class of probabilistic models used in numerous scientific applications. nevertheless, this task is prohibitive when dealing with complex ssms with massive data, due to the high computational cost of pmcmc and its poor performance when the posterior exhibits multi -modality. this paper aims to address both issues by: 1) proposing a novel pmcmc algorithm (denoted ppmcmc), which uses multiple markov chains (instead of the one used by pmcmc) to improve sampling efficiency for multi-modal posteriors, 2) introducing custom, parallel hardware architectures, which are tailored for pmcmc and ppmcmc. the architectures are implemented on field programmable gate arrays (fpgas), a type of hardware accelerator with massive parallelization capabilities. the new algorithm and the two fpga architectures are evaluated using a large-scale case study from genetics. results indicate that ppmcmc achieves 1.96x higher sampling efficiency than pmcmc when using sequential cpu implementations. the fpga architecture of pmcmc is 12.1x and 10.1x faster than state-of-the-art, parallel cpu and gpu implementations of pmcmc and up to 53x more energy efficient; the fpga architecture of ppmcmc increases these speedups to 34.9x and 41.8x respectively and is 173x more power efficient, bringing previously intractable ssm-based data analyses within reach.

genetics	background: inferring the ancestry of each region of admixed individuals' genomes is useful in studies ranging from disease gene mapping to speciation genetics. current methods require high-coverage genotype data and phased reference panels, and are therefore inappropriate for many data sets. we present a software application, ad-libs, that uses a hidden markov model to infer ancestry across hybrid genomes without requiring variant calling or phasing. this approach is useful for non-model organisms and in cases of low-coverage data, such as ancient dna. results: we demonstrate the utility of ad-libs with synthetic data. we then use ad-libs to infer ancestry in two published data sets: european human genomes with neanderthal ancestry and brown bear genomes with polar bear ancestry. ad-libs correctly infers 87-91% of ancestry in simulations and produces ancestry maps that agree with published results and global ancestry estimates in humans. in brown bears, we find more polar bear ancestry than has been published previously, using both ad-libs and an existing software application for local ancestry inference, hapmix. we validate ad-libs polar bear ancestry maps by recovering a geographic signal within bears that mirrors what is seen in snp data. finally, we demonstrate that ad-libs is more effective than hapmix at inferring ancestry when preexisting phased reference data are unavailable and genomes are sequenced to low coverage. conclusions: ad-libs is an effective tool for ancestry inference that can be used even when few individuals are available for comparison or when genomes are sequenced to low coverage. ad-libs is therefore likely to be useful in studies of non-model or ancient organisms that lack large amounts of genomic dna. ad-libs can therefore expand the range of studies in which admixture mapping is a viable tool.
human_metabolism	the analysis of the effect of drugs in insulin aggregation is interesting due to its influence on human metabolism. we present a method to analyse the effect of an antiretroviral drug (azt) on the insulin aggregation, based on the principal components analysis of the infrared spectra recorded in the process. this method allows the analysis of the conformational changes involved in the aggregation, providing a time value associated with the aggregates formation. the analysis was performed using zn-free insulin in buffered solution at 1.72 mm concentration. the aggregation was monitored in situ by ftir at 37 degrees c and the dependence of the concentration of azt was considered, contemplating three concentration levels of azt. the interaction between azt and insulin was proved by (hnmr)-h-1 spectroscopy. the aggregation states were characterised by solubility tests and microscope imaging. a comparative analysis of time aggregation led observing that the process was delayed when the concentration of azt was lower than 1.72 mm, while it accelerated at equal or higher concentrations. this dependence was related to the concentration of the monomeric species in the medium. the analysis was performed in serum to evaluate the influence of serum proteins in the phenomena, concluding that azt binds to insulin before than to serum proteins.

molecular_biology	genomic dna is dynamically associated with protein factors and folded to form chromatin fibers. the 3-dimensional (3d) configuration of the chromatin will enable the distal genetic elements to come into close proximity, allowing transcriptional regulation. noncoding rna can mediate the 3d structure of chromatin. chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (chia-pet) is a valuable and powerful technique in molecular biology which allows the study of unbiased, genome-wide de novo chromatin interactions with paired-end tags. here, we describe the standard version of chia-pet and a multiplex chia-pet version.
molecular_biology	two keggin-type polyoxometalates (poms) containing glycine, (hgly)(3)pw12o40 and (hgly)(4)siw12o40, were synthesized and evaluated as mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors. the spectrophotometric method results showed that both (hgly)(3)pw12o40 and (hgly)(4)siw12o40 could strongly inhibit the diphenolase activity of the tyrosinase and that their inhibition mechanisms were reversible. their half-inhibition concentration values were estimated to be 1.55 and 1.39mmol/l, respectively. the inhibition kinetics analysis by lineweaver-burk plots indicated that (hgly)(3)pw12o40 was an uncompetitive inhibitor with k-is=0.046mmol/l, whereas (hgly)(4)siw12o40 was a noncompetitive inhibitor with k-i=k-is=2.17mmol/l. this study may help to extend the application of poms in the fields of medicine and food preservation.

genetics	the theme of the free availability of genetic information is, by its nature, the heart of attention in most areas of investigation. from biology to medicine, from philosophy to law, from theology to biotechnology there is n't an area of science that cannot be said to be interested in the subject, nor has not, in recent years, tried to deepen it.
enzymology	pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen. it colonizes different tissues by the utilization of diverse mechanisms. one of these may involve the breakdown of the host cell membrane through the sequential action of hemolytic phospholipase c and phosphorylcholine phosphatase (pchp). the action of hemolytic phospholipase c on phosphatidylcholine produces phosphorylcholine, which is hydrolyzed to choline (cho) and inorganic phosphate by pchp. the available biochemical data on this enzyme demonstrate the involvement of two cho-binding sites in the catalytic cycle and in enzyme regulation. the crystal structure of p. aeruginosa pchp has been determined. it folds into three structural domains. the first domain harbors all the residues involved in catalysis and is well conserved among the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of proteins. the second domain is characteristic of pchp and is involved in the recognition of the cho moiety of the substrate. the third domain stabilizes the relative position of the other two. fortuitously, the crystal structure of pchp captures molecules of bistris (2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol) at the active site and at an additional site. this represents two catalytically relevant complexes with just one or two inhibitory bistris molecules and provides the basis of the pchp function and regulation. site-directed mutagenesis along with biochemical experiments corroborates the structural observations and demonstrates the interplay between different sites for cho recognition and inhibition. the structural comparison of pchp with other phosphatases of the haloacid dehalogenase family provides a three-dimensional picture of the conserved catalytic cycle and the structural basis for the recognition of the diverse substrate molecules.

northern_blotting	agroinfiltration was tested as a method of inoculation of chrysanthemum plants with chrysanthemum stunt viroid (csvd). binary vectors harboring dimeric csvd sequences in sense and antisense orientations were constructed, and agrobacterium transfected with these binary vectors was infiltrated into chrysanthemum leaves. northern blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that local infection was established within 7 days and systemic infection within 20 days. csvd polarities showed no difference in infectivity. this study showed that agroinfiltration of chrysanthemum plants is an easy, rapid, and cost-effective method for csvd inoculation.

human_metabolism	currently, metals are widely used for load-bearing application due to their combination of high mechanical strength and fracture toughness. however, most conventional metallic materials generally remain in human body permanently, bringing long-term endothelial dysfunction. the corrosion products are also considered potentially harmful to tissues of the human body. in recent years, magnesium (mg) alloys had caused significant attention due to their outstanding advantages. mg alloys have mechanical properties similar to bone which avoid stress shielding. they are also biocompatibly essential to the human metabolism as a cofactor for many enzymes. in addition, the corrosion product of mg is likely to be physiologically beneficial. most importantly, they are perfectly biodegradable in the body fluid. no material could match perfectly every requirement for a given application. for mg alloys, the extremely low corrosion resistance in chloride containing environments limits their applications. interactions between biological environments and biomedical materials take place on the material surface, and the biological response from living tissues to these extrinsic biomaterials depends on the surface properties. therefore, surface modification to form a hard, biocompatible and corrosion resistant modified layer has recently become an interesting topic in biomaterials. this paper reviews the current research and development status of plasma surface modification technologies of mg alloy for biomedical materials. the unique advantage of plasma modification is that the surface properties and biocompatibility can be enhanced selectively while excellent bulk properties remain unchanged. this paper discusses the characteristic of different methods. finally, the scientific challenges are proposed based on our researches and the works done by other groups.

southern_blotting	prevalence estimates for fragile x syndrome vary considerably. this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to provide an accurate prevalence estimate for this disorder using primary publications in pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library. data were pooled using bayesian fixed-effects and random-effects models. primary analyses assessed the frequency of the full mutation and premutation in males and females in the total population (no bias against individuals with intellectual disability) and in female carriers of the premutation in normal populations (biased against individuals with intellectual disability), based on diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or southern blotting. a sensitivity analysis included studies using any diagnostic testing method and conference abstracts. sixty-eight recorded observations provided data for the primary (56 observations) and sensitivity (12 observations) analysis. using the random-effects model, frequency of the full mutation was 1.4 (95% ci: 0.1-3.1) per 10,000 males and 0.9 (95% ci: 0.0-2.9) per 10,000 females (1:7,143 and 1:11,111, respectively) in the total population. the premutation frequency was 11.7 (95% ci: 6.0-18.7) per 10,000 males and 34.4 (95% ci: 6.3-83.3) per 10,000 for females (1:855 and 1:291, respectively) in the total population. the prevalence of female carriers of the premutation in the normal population was 34.4 (95% ci: 8.9-60.3) per 10,000, or 1:291. sensitivity analyses resulted in similar prevalence estimates but with wider heterogeneity. prevalence estimates for the full mutation from this meta-analysis are lower than those in previous reviews of fragile x syndrome epidemiological data.

immunology	the importance of neuro-immune interactions in both physiological and pathophysiological states cannot be overstated. as our appreciation for the neuroimmune nature of the brain and spinal cord grows, so does our need to extend the spatial and temporal resolution of our molecular analysis techniques. current imaging technologies applied to investigate the actions of the neuroimmune system in both health and disease states have been adapted from the fields of immunology and neuroscience. while these classical techniques have provided immense insight into the function of the cns, they are however, inherently limited. thus, the development of innovative methods which overcome these limitations are crucial for imaging and quantifying acute and chronic neuroimmune responses. therefore, this review aims to convey emerging novel and complementary imaging technologies in a form accessible to medical scientists engaging in neuroimmune research.

northern_blotting	mesangial re-modeling and mesangial cell (mc) migration are features of several glomerular diseases including mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. in vitro investigations have recently identified adam-15, a multidomain adamalysin, as central to the migration of mc. the current study used array technology to investigate the expression of other genes in migrating cells and identified pleiotrophin (ptn), platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide chain, colony stimulating factor, and four members of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha superfamily as major genes that were upregulated. transcriptional induction of ptn was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting and induction of the protein by western blotting and immunohistochemical localization. ptn was observed associated with mesangial 'hillocks' in confluent mc cultures. in contrast, in models of migration, migrating cells had the highest expression of cell-associated ptn. ptn protein was less evident, however, in the conditioned medium of mcs. treatment of mc with heparanase removed ptn from the cells suggesting that its localization was owing to an association with heparan sulfates on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. this is the first description of the expression of ptn by human mcs and the data suggest that it is rapidly induced in cells that are triggered to migrate. the result of this induction is currently under investigation.
immunology	introduction: c1q play an important role in clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cell debris. impaired clearance leads to exposure of c1 native antigen and development of anti-c1q antibody formation. anti-c1q antibody is well studied in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). significance of anti-c1q ab in indian sle patients and their clinical manifestations is not clear. aim: the aim of this study was to investigate associations between anti-c1q antibody and clinical as well as serological markers of sle. materials and methods: retrospective study of sle patients fulfilling either american college of rheumatology (acr) 1990 or systemic lupus international collaborating clinics (slicc) 2012 classification criteria were recruited from inpatients and outpatients services of the clinical immunology and rheumatology department, christian medical college at vellore, india between march 2013 and january 2015. anti-c1q antibody was assayed by elisa (demeditec diagnostics gmbh, germany). logistic regression analysis was performed to find the association of anti-c1q antibodies with serological and clinical parameters in sle including lupus nephritis (ln). results: sixty nine patients (54.76%) out of 126 sle patients had ln. anti-c1q levels were higher in patients with ln as compared to those without (p<0.05). anti-c1q antibody was also significantly associated with positive c1q immunofluorescence staining in renal biopsy specimens (p<0.05). overall, renal systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (sledai) {or 1.35 (1.08-1.69)}, low c4 {or 3.11 (1.04-9.26)} and mucocutaneous manifestation {or 4.72 (1.38-16.05)} were independently associated with anti-c1q levels in serum. conclusion: renal sledai, low c4 and mucocutaneous manifestations were independently associated with raised anti c1q antibody in sle patients.
human_metabolism	structured triglycerides (stg) are introduced for clinical purpose by a recently registered lipid emulsion, in which long-chain fatty acids and medium-chain fatty acids are randomly attached to the same glycerol molecule. studies in animals showed an improvement in nitrogen balance. studies in patients demonstrate an improvement or at least equivalent effects on the nitrogen balance, compared with lct or a physical mixture of mct and lct. in most of the studies serum triglycerides, and free fatty acid concentrations are lower indicating a faster clearance from the blood; beta-oh-butyrate concentrations are higher but do not reach toxic levels, or influence the serum ph value. no modulatory effects on the immune system by stg can be demonstrated. hypotheses are discussed of the influence of lipids on protein metabolism. the recently introduced stg open the door for really new structured triglycerides in which on-demand specific fatty acids can be linked to a specific position at the glycerol molecule, with the objective of realising specific clinical effects.

human_metabolism	magnesium (mg) is naturally found in bone tissue and is essential to human metabolism. it is well known that mg ion improved bone-like apatite nucleation and growth. in this study, mg ions were ion exchanged onto poly acrylic acid (paa) thin film containing the carboxyl groups deposited on the commercially pure titanium (cp-ti) surface using a plasma polymerization at discharge power 50 w for 5 min. surface morphology and chemical composition of all samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem), x-ray diffraction (xrd), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). bioactivity of the mg ion exchanged cp-ti samples was evaluated by immersing in simulated body fluid (sbf) and mc3t3-e1 cell proliferation. the bone-like apatite forming ability was significantly influenced by mg ion concentrations. mg ion promotes bone-like apatite nucleation and growth on cp-ti surface in sbf solution and improves mc3t3-e1 cell proliferation. it is therefore expected that cp-ti and ti alloys having a high biocompatibility can be obtained by ion exchanging the mg ion after paa plasma modified ti surface.

enzymology	covalently interstrand cross-linked dna is an interesting tool to study dna binding proteins that locally open up the dna duplex by flipping single bases out of the dna helix or melting whole stretches of base pairs to perform their function. the ideal dna cross-link to study protein-dna interactions should be specific and easy to synthesize, be stable during protein binding experiments, have a short covalent linker to avoid steric hindrance of protein binding, and should be available as a mimic for both a/t and g/c base pairs to cover all possible binding specificities. several covalent interstrand cross-links have been described in the literature, but most of them fall short of at least one of the above criteria. we developed an efficient method to site-specifically and reversibly cross-link thionucleoside base pairs in synthetic duplex oligodeoxynucleotides by bisalkylation with 1,2-diiodoethane resulting in an ethylene-bridged base pair. both linked a/t and g/c base pair analogs can conveniently be prepared which allows studying any base pair-opening enzyme regardless of its sequence specificity. the cross-link is stable in the absence of reducing agents but the linker can be quickly and tracelessly removed by the addition of thiol reagents like dithiothreitol. this property makes the cross-linking reaction fully reversible and allows for a switching of the linked base pair from locked to unlocked during biochemical experiments. using the dna methyltransferase from thermus aquaticus (m. taqi) as example, we demonstrate that the presented cross-linked dna with an ethylene-linked a/t base pair analog at the target position is a useful tool to determine the base-flipping equilibrium constant of a base-flipping enzyme which lies mostly on the extrahelical side for m. taqi.
enzymology	this study was performed to culture and preliminarily identify the primordial germ cells (pgcs) isolated from the genital ridge of the mongolian sheep fetus. the growth characteristics of the sheep pgcs were detected in different culture systems such as culture media, resources, and state and passages of feeder cells. the obtained embryonic germ (eg) cells were identified by morphology, enzymology, and immunofluorescence. the results showed that the sheep eg cell colonies were ridgy, typically nest like, and compact, and had regular edges. alkaline phosphatase staining reaction was weakly positive. eg cells expressed kit, rex-1, nanog, and oct-4. immunofluorescence detection was weakly positive for oct3/4, whereas positive for ssea-1, ssea-3, ssea-4, tra-1-61, and tra-1-80.
cell_biology	despite the considerable progress in the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) therapy, relapse or progression to a richter syndrome still appears. thus, a more targeted therapeutic option is required. this can be achieved by increasing the concentration of the cytostatic drug in the tumour while reducing its systemic toxicity. in the continuous effort toward the development of more efficient therapeutics, in the current study we report rituximab conjugated gold nanoparticles for cll treatment. the formation of rituximab-nanoconjugates was proved by physico-chemical characterization (uv-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential and dynamic light scattering) and their intracellular internalization was assessed by dark field and transmission electron microscopy. the therapeutic effect of the newly-designed drugs was investigated by cell counting and mit assays. results showed that the effect of our drug-nanocarrier is superior compared to that of the drug alone, data confirmed by state-of-the-art analyses of internalization, cell biology (flow cytometry, apoptosis and autophagy assay), genomics (rt-pcr for ms4a1) and proteomics (confocal microscopy and western blotting for cd20). the present work demonstrates that rituximab nanoconjugates can get an efficient trans-membrane delivery inside cll cells, being validated as real-potential therapeutics with increased efficacy compared to the drug alone.
immunology	mucosal immunity at the intestinal level is constantly challenged by the presence of external food and microbial antigens and must be kept under strict control to avoid the rise of aberrant inflammation. among cells of the innate immunity, macrophages expressing the chemokine receptor cx3cr1 are strategically located near the gut epithelial barrier. these cells contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10; however, their role in the control of full blown inflammation and tissue injury is controversial. in this study we investigated mice proficient or deficient for the expression of the cx3cr1 receptor in a model of dextran sulphate sodium (dss) induced acute colitis. we found that ko mice (cx3cr1(gfp/gfp)) had a more severe disease compared to wt mice (cx3cr1(gfp/+)), both in terms of histological examination of colonic tissues and leukocyte infiltration, with an expansion of macrophages and cd4-th17 lymphocytes. the expression of several inflammatory mediators (il-1 beta, il-6, ifn gamma, inos) was also significantly upregulated in ko mice, despite higher il-10 production. overall, our study demonstrates that macrophages expressing a functional cx3cr1 receptor have an important and non-redundant role in controlling the abnormal intestinal inflammation that may lead to tissue damage.

cell_biology	natural killer (nk)-cells are major players in the fight against viral infections and transformed cells, but there is increasing evidence attributing a disease-promoting role to nk-cells. cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment shape nk-cell maturation, function, and effector responses. many cytokines signal via the janus kinase (jak)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) pathway that is also frequently altered and constitutively active in a broad range of tumor cells. as a consequence, there are currently major efforts to develop therapeutic strategies to target this pathway. therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the role and contributions of jak-stat molecules in nk-cell biology-only this knowledge will allow us to predict effects of jak-stat inhibition for nk-cell functions and to successfully apply precision medicine. we will review the current knowledge on the role of jak-stat signaling for nk-cell functions and discuss conditions involved in the switch from nk-cell tumor surveillance to disease promotion.
immunology	neoantigen is a patient-specific tumor antigen resulted from mutations during oncogenesis. emerging data suggested that immune responsiveness against neoantigens correlated with the success of clinical tumor immunotherapies. nowadays, the majority of studies on neoantigens have focused on mhc class i restricted antigens recognized by cd8+ t cells. with improved understanding of the underlying principles of tumor biology and immunology, increasing emphasis has been put on cd4+ t cells and mhc class ii restricted antigens. mhc class ii restricted neoantigen has the potential to be a promising target of tumor immunotherapy, although the limited comprehension and technical difficulties need to be overcome before being applied into clinical practice. this review discussed the immunologic mechanism, screening technique, clinical application, limitations and prospectives of mhc class ii restricted neoantigens in tumor immunotherapy. cd (c) 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
immunology	characterizing the immune response to pneumococcal proteins is critical in understanding this bacterium 's epidemiology and vaccinology. probing a custom-designed proteome microarray with sera from 35 healthy us adults revealed a continuous distribution of igg affinities for 2,190 potential antigens from the species-wide pangenome. reproducibly elevated igg binding was elicited by 208 ""antibody binding targets"" (abts), which included 109 variants of the diverse pneumococcal surface proteins a and c (pspa and pspc) and zinc metalloprotease a and b (zmpa and zmpb) proteins. functional analysis found abts were enriched inmotifs for secretion and cell surface association, with extensive representation of cell wall synthesis machinery, adhesins, transporter solute-binding proteins, and degradative enzymes. abts were associated with stronger evidence for evolving under positive selection, although this varied between functional categories, as did rates of diversification through recombination. particularly rapid variation was observed at some immunogenic accessory loci, including a phage protein and a phase-variable glycosyltransferase ubiquitous among the diverse set of genomic islands encoding the serine-rich psrp glycoprotein. nevertheless, many antigens were conserved in the core genome, and strains' antigenic profiles were generally stable. no strong evidence was found for any epistasis between antigens driving population dynamics, or redundancy between functionally similar accessory abts, or age stratification of antigen profiles. these results highlight the paradox of why substantial variation is observed in only a subset of epitopes. this result may indicate only some interactions between immunoglobulins and abts clear pneumococcal colonization or that acquired immunity to pneumococci is an accumulation of individually weak responses to abts evolving under different levels of functional constraint.
human_metabolism	this research is a framework of a big project aimed to the knowledge of human metabolism in hemodialysis patients. for reaching high sensitivity and obtaining accurate values for elements at very low concentrations instrumental neutron activation analysis (inaa) was used for its characteristics to be a primary analytical method and because it does not require any chemical-physical pretreatment. the samples analyzed (160) are representative of groups of homogeneous population and specific matrices (hemodialysis fluids and whole human blood). the irradiation was performed in the rotating rack (lazy susan) of the triga mark ii reactor of the r.c. casaccia-enea at a neutron flux of 2.6 x 10(12) n cm(-2) s(-1) with an irradiation time of 12 h. the results on the hemodialysis fluids report the values and the behavior of selected trace elements: the levels of br and na show a decrease between the pre- and post-dialysis whereas fe, k and zn an increase. the other elements such as cs, rb and se seem to keep constant between the two phases. similar data are found for the whole human blood for the same selected elements. finally, exploiting the inaa peculiarity it has been investigated the levels of trace and ultra-trace elements interesting from a toxicological (hg, ni, sb) and nutritional (co, cr) point of view and seldom determined due to their analytical implications. finally, a chemiometric investigation performed through dendrogram trees, canonical discriminant analysis and principal component analysis, has evidenced the similar effects of the hf, hdf and bic-treatments on the investigated fluids respect to the capd dialysis.
molecular_biology	biomineralogy is an inherently interdisciplinary pursuit. this largely stems from the fact that techniques used to investigate a given (bio)mineral should ideally be married with techniques that provide insight into the biological mechanisms that form that mineral (and vice versa). we observe two broad challenges that inhibit a fluent exchange of ideas and information between mineralogists/materials scientists and biologists. first, the smorgasbord of emerging and rapidly evolving techniques available to mineralogists and biologists alike make it difficult not only for an expert to remain contemporary, but can be bewildering to the non-expert. second, to truly integrate and relate a specific biological insight into the genesis of a biomineral, with the effect that insight has on the properties of the mineral itself, is not trivial. we propose that an evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) approach can not only address this challenge, it can also provide deep insight into how the rich diversity of metazoan mineralised structures evolved. while an evo-devo approach to biomineralogy has previously been employed by some groups, recent exciting methodological developments available to the molecular biologist now make this strategy even more attractive. in this short review we aim to outline our perception of the role that evo-devo can play within the field of biomineralogy, taking as a case study the past achievements, recent insights and some future research directions associated with gastropod shell formation.

molecular_biology	the intervertebral disc (ivd) is a joint unique in structure and functions. lying between adjacent vertebrae, it provides both the primary support and the elasticity required for the spine to move stably. various aspects of the ivd have long been studied by researchers seeking a better understanding of its dynamics, aging, and subsequent disorders. in this article, we review the surgical anatomy, imaging modalities, and molecular biology of the lumbar ivd. clin. anat. 30:251-266, 2017.

enzymology	vitamin b-6 is a generic term referring to pyridoxine. pyridoxamine, pyridoxal and their related phosphorylated forms. pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is the catalytically active form of vitamin b-6, and acts as cofactor in more than 140 different enzyme reactions. in animals, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is recycled from food and from degraded b-6-enzymes in a ""salvage pathway"", which essentially involves two ubiquitous enzymes: an atp-dependent pyridoxal kinase and an fmn-dependent pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase. once it is made, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is targeted to the dozens of different apo-b-6 enzymes that are being synthesized in the cell. the mechanism and regulation of the salvage pathway and the mechanism of addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to the apo-b-6-enzymes are poorly understood and represent a very challenging research field. pyridoxal kinase and pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase play kinetic roles in regulating the level of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate formation. deficiency of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate due to inborn defects of these enzymes seems to be involved in several neurological pathologies. in addition, inhibition of pyridoxal kinase activity by several pharmaceutical and natural compounds is known to lead to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate deficiency. understanding the exact role of vitamin b-6 in these pathologies requires a better knowledge on the metabolism and homeostasis of the vitamin. this article summarizes the current knowledge on structural, kinetic and regulation features of the two enzymes involved in the plp salvage pathway. we also discuss the proposal that newly formed plp may be transferred from either enzyme to apo-b-6-enzymes by direct channeling, an efficient, exclusive, and protected means of delivery of the highly reactive plp. this new perspective may lead to novel and interesting findings, as well as serve as a model system for the study of macromolecular channeling. this article is part of a special issue entitled: pyridoxal phosphate enzymology.

genetics	the goal for using genetic information derived from embryo samples is to gain insight into the reproductive biology of adult white sturgeon, acipenser transmontanus richardson. the relationship between egg development stages on the extraction of quality dna was determined, and subsequent genotype data were used to infer contributing spawner numbers. white sturgeon dna was present in extractions from all stages; however, pre-gastrulation stage embryos generally failed to amplify sufficient genetic loci for analysis. using experimentally created families, multivariate anova and maximum-likelihood sibship methods estimated the presence of 10 contributing parents from 11 actual adult spawners. it was observed that unidentified half-sibling relationships (offspring sharing one parent) caused error for inferring parent numbers. genetic methods estimated 13-40 parents potentially contributed to a collection of wild-caught embryos, with variable numbers of parents inferred from separate spawning events (varying from 8 to 24). egg source material provides a means to enhance the accuracy of annual spawning population size estimates, which is important for informing habitat restoration, harvest and water management decisions and recovery planning.
genetics	quantitative genetics theory predicts adaptive evolution to be constrained along evolutionary lines of least resistance. in theory, hybridization and subsequent interspecific gene flow may, however, rapidly change the evolutionary constraints of a population and eventually change its evolutionary potential, but empirical evidence is still scarce. using closely related species pairs of lake victoria cichlids sampled from four different islands with different levels of interspecific gene flow, we tested for potential effects of introgressive hybridization on phenotypic evolution in wild populations. we found that these effects differed among our study species. constraints measured as the eccentricity of phenotypic variance-covariance matrices declined significantly with increasing gene flow in the less abundant species for matrices that have a diverged line of least resistance. in contrast, we find no such decline for the more abundant species. overall our results suggest that hybridization can change the underlying phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, potentially increasing the adaptive potential of such populations.
northern_blotting	plants employ rna silencing as a natural defense mechanism against viruses. as a counter-defense, viruses encode silencing suppressor proteins (ssps) that suppress rna silencing. most, but not all, the p0 proteins encoded by poleroviruses have been identified as ssp. in this study, we demonstrated that cotton leafroll dwarf virus (clrdv, genus polerovirus) p0 protein suppressed local silencing that was induced by sense or inverted repeat transgenes in agrobacterium co-infiltration assay in nicotiana benthamiana plants. a clrdv full-length infectious cdna clone that is able to infect n. benthamiana through agrobacterium-mediated inoculation also inhibited local silencing in co-infiltration assays, suggesting that the p0 protein exhibits similar rna silencing suppression activity when expressed from the full-length viral genome. on the other hand, the p0 protein did not efficiently inhibit the spread of systemic silencing signals. moreover, northern blotting indicated that the p0 protein inhibits the generation of secondary but not primary small interfering rnas. the study of clrdv p0 suppression activity may contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of cotton blue disease by clrdv infection.

immunology	objective: the objective of this study was to determine the contribution of lymphatic tissue to heterotopic ossification (ho). background: ho is the pathologic development of ectopic bone within soft tissues often following severe trauma. characterization of the tissue niche supporting ho is critical to identifying therapies directed against this condition. lymphangiogenesis is upregulated during incidents of trauma, thereby coincident with the niche supportive of ho. we hypothesized that lymphatic tissues play a critical role in ho formation. methods: mice underwent hindlimb achilles' tendon transection and dorsal burn injury (burn/tenotomy) to induce ho. the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were excised ipsilateral to the tenotomy site. flow cytometry and immunostaining were used to quantify and localize lymphoendothelium. microct was used to quantify ho. results: enrichment of mature lymphatic tissues was noted 2 weeks after injury at the tendon transection sites when compared with the contralateral, intact tendon based on lyve1+ tubules (10.9% vs 0.8%, p < 0.05). excision of the inguinal and popliteal nodes with draining popliteal lymphatic vessel significantly decreased the presence of mature lymphoendothelium 2 weeks after injury (10.9% vs 3.3%, p < 0.05). bone-cartilage-stromal progenitor cells (cd105+/alphav+/tie2-/cd45-/cd90-/bp1-) were also significantly decreased after lymph node excision (10.2% vs 0.5%, p < 0.05). a significant decrease was noted in the volume of de novo hopresent within the soft tissues (0.12 mm(3) vs 0.02 mm(3)). conclusion: these findings suggest that lymphatic vessels are intimately linked with the de novo formation bone within soft tissues following trauma, and their presence may facilitate bone formation.
genetics	background: rare conditions can be catastrophic for families and the implications for public health can be substantial. our study compared basic surveillance through active medical record review with a linked administrative data file to assess the number of cases of two rare conditions, fragile x syndrome (fxs) and muscular dystrophy (md) in a population. methods: two methods of data collection were used to collect information from five counties comprising two standard metropolitan statistical areas of south carolina. the passive system relied mostly on health claims data using icd-9 cm diagnostic codes. the active system relied on a nurse abstracting records from a list of all licensed physicians with specialties in neurology, orthopedics, and genetics. results: there were 141 fxs cases and 348 md cases that met the case definitions using active surveillance. additional cases were found for both conditions but they were determined to not be true cases. after linking the actively collected md and fxs cases to passive datasets, we found that the estimated total numbers of cases were similar to using capture-recapture analysis; the positive predictive values for cases identified in the passive system were 56.6% for md and 75.7% for fxs. conclusions: applying capture-recapture methods to passively collected surveillance data for rare health conditions produced an estimate of the number of true cases that was similar to that obtained through active data collection.
genetics	the role of the intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in the maintenance of host health and development of metabolic disease has gained significant attention over the past decade. mechanistic insight revealing causality, however, is scarce. work by ussar and co-workers demonstrates that a complex interaction between microbiota, host genetics and environmental factors is involved in metabolic disease development in mice. in addition, perry and coworkers show that the microbial metabolite acetate augments insulin resistance in rats. these studies underscore an important role of the microbiota in the development of obesity and symptoms of type 2 diabetes in rodents. if causality can be demonstrated in humans, development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools that target the gut microbiota will have high potential.
northern_blotting	potato is one of the main targets for genetic improvement by gene transfer. the aim of the present study was to establish a robust protocol for the genetic transformation of three dihaploid and four economically important cultivars of potato using agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the in vivo screenable reporter gene for green fluorescent protein (gfp) and the marker gene for neomycin phosphotransferase (nptii). stem and leaf explants were used for transformation by agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba4404 carrying the binary vector phb2892. kanamycin selection, visual screening of gfp by epifluorescent microscopy, pcr amplification of nptii and gfp genes, as well as rt-pcr and southern blotting of gfp and northern blotting of nptii, were used for transgenic plant selection, identification and analysis. genetic transformation was optimized for the best performing genotypes with a mean number of shoots expressing gfp per explant of 13 and 2 (dihaploid line 178/10 and cv. 'baltica', respectively). the nptii marker and gfp reporter genes permitted selection and excellent visual screening of transgenic tissues and plants. they also revealed the effects of antibiotic selection on organogenesis and transformation frequency, and the identification of escapes and chimeras in all potato genotypes. silencing of the gfp transgene that may represent site-specific inactivation during cell differentiation, occurred in some transgenic shoots of tetraploid cultivars and in specific chimeric clones of the dihaploid line 178/10. the regeneration of escapes could be attributed to either the protection of non-transformed cells by neighbouring transgenic cells, or the persistence of agrobacterium cells in plant tissues after co-cultivation.
molecular_biology	background: arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as model organism in plant biology. although not of agronomic significance, it offers important advantages for basic research in genetics and molecular biology including the availability of a large number of mutants and genetically modified lines. however, arabidopsis seed longevity is limited and seeds stored for more than 10 years usually show a very low capacity for germination. results: the influence of ultrasonic stimulation was investigated on the germination of a. thaliana l. seeds. all experiments have been performed using a frequency of 45 khz at constant temperature ( 24 degrees c). no germination rate differences were observed when using freshly collected seeds. however, using artificially deteriorated seeds, our results show that short ultrasonic stimulation (<1 min) significantly increased germination. ultrasonic stimulation application of 30 s is the optimal treatment. a significant increase in the germination rate was also verified in naturally aged seeds after ultrasonic stimulation. scanning electron microscopy observations showed an increase in the presence of pores in the seed coat after sonication that may be the cause, at least in part, of the increase in germination. the ultrasound treated seeds developed normally to mature fertile plants. conclusions: ultrasound technology can be used to enhance the germination process of old arabidopsis seeds without negatively affecting seedling development. this effect seems to be, at least in part, due to the opening of pores in the seed coat. the use of ultrasonic stimulation in arabidopsis seeds may contribute to the recovering of long time stored lines.
polymerase_chain_reaction	disease has an effect on crop yields, causing significant losses. as the worldwide demand for agricultural products increases, there is a need to pursue the development of new methods to protect crops from disease. one mechanism of plant protection is through the activation of the plant immune system. by exogenous application, 'plant activator molecules' with elicitor properties can be used to activate the plant immune system. these defence-inducing molecules represent a powerful and often environmentally friendly tool to fight pathogens. we show that the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (dca) induces defence in arabidopsis and reduces the proliferation of two bacterial phytopathogens: erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. we describe the global defence response triggered by this new plant activator in arabidopsis at the transcriptional level. several induced genes were selected for further analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. we describe the kinetics of their induction and show that abiotic stress, such as moderate drought or nitrogen limitation, does not impede dca induction of defence. finally, we investigate the role in the activation of defence by this bile acid of the salicylic acid biosynthesis gene sid2, of the receptor-like kinase family genes wak1-3 and of the nadph oxidase-encoding rbohd gene. altogether, we show that dca constitutes a promising molecule for plant protection which can induce complementary lines of defence, such as callose deposition, reactive oxygen species accumulation and the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling pathways.
immunology	background: tick-borne diseases greatly impact human and animal health worldwide, and vaccines are an environmentally friendly alternative to acaricides for their control. recent results have suggested that aquaporin (aqp) water channels have a key function during tick feeding and development, and constitute good candidate antigens for the control of tick infestations. methods: here we describe the effect of vaccination with the ixodes ricinus aqp1 (iraqp) and a tick aqp conserved region (coaqp) on i. ricinus tick larval mortality, feeding and molting. results: we demonstrated that vaccination with iraqp and coaqp had an efficacy of 32% and 80%, respectively on the control of i. ricinus larvae by considering the cumulative effect on reducing tick survival and molting. conclusions: the effect of the aqp vaccines on larval survival and molting is essential to reduce tick infestations, and extended previous results on the effect of r. microplus aqp1 on the control of cattle tick infestations. these results supports that aqp, and particularly coaqp, might be a candidate protective antigen for the control of different tick species.

northern_blotting	micrornas (mirs) have emerged as important clinical biomarkers with both diagnostic and prognostic value for relevant diseases, such as cancer. mirs pose unique challenges for detection and are currently detected by northern blotting, real-time pcr, and microarray techniques. these expensive, complicated, and time-consuming techniques are not feasible for on-site mir determination. in this study, amperometric magnetobiosensors involving rna-binding viral protein p19 as a selective biorecognition element were developed for mir quantification. the p19-based magnetosensors were able to detect 0.4 fmol of a synthetic target and endogenous mir-21 (selected as a model for its role in a wide variety of cancers) in only 2 h in total rna extracted from cancer cells and human breast-tumor specimens without pcr amplification and sample preprocessing. these results open up formidable perspectives for the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers and for drug-discovery programs.
northern_blotting	abiotic stresses, especially salinity and drought, are major limiting factors for plant growth and crop productivity. in an attempt to develop salt and drought tolerant tomato, a dna cassette containing tobacco osmotin gene driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter was transferred to tomato (solanum lycopersicum) via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. putative t0 transgenic plants were screened by pcr analysis. the selected transformants were evaluated for salt and drought stress tolerance by physiological analysis at t1 and t2 generations. integration of the osmotin gene in transgenic t1 plants was verified by southern blot hybridization. transgenic expression of the osmotin gene was verified by rt-pcr and northern blotting in t1 plants. t1 progenies from both transformed and untransformed plants were tested for salt and drought tolerance by subjecting them to different levels of nacl stress and by withholding water supply, respectively. results from different physiological tests demonstrated enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses in transgenic plants harboring the osmotin gene as compared to the wild-type plants. the transgenic lines showed significantly higher relative water content, chlorophyll content, proline content, and leaf expansion than the wild-type plants under stress conditions. the present investigation clearly shows that overexpression of osmotin gene enhances salt and drought stress tolerance in transgenic tomato plants.
enzymology	although developments in liquid dispensers have made the use of 1536-well plates for high-throughput screening (hts) standard, there is still a gap in dispenser technology for performing matrix experiments with several components. experiments such as those performed during assay development and enzymological studies are therefore still performed by manual pipetting in lower-density plates. we have evaluated a new dispenser, the certus liquid dispenser (gyger fluidics gmbh, switzerland), that is capable of flexible dispensing in 1536-well format, with a dead volume of less than 200 mu l. taking advantage of the precision of the dispenser for volumes down to 50 nl, we have created concentration gradients on plates by dispensing different volumes of reagent and then backfilling with buffer. using this method and the flexibility of the dispenser software, we have performed several multidimensional experiments varying two to three components, including an assay development for an hts, a mode of inhibition study, and a cofactor optimization, in which we determined 32 k-m values. overall, the flexibility of the plate layout for multiple components, the accuracy to dispense volumes ranging 2 log orders, and minimal reagent usage enable this dispenser for complex biochemical experiments.
northern_blotting	the effect of frequent protein malnutrition on liver function has not been intensively examined. thus, the effects of alternating 5 days of a protein and amino acid-free diet followed by 5 days of a complete diet repeated three times (3 pfd-cd) on female mouse liver were examined. the expression of carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), fatty acid synthase (fas), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and glutathione s-transferase p1 (gstp1) in liver were assessed by proteomics, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. the activities of liver gsts, glutathione reductase (gr) and catalase (cat), as well as serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (sgot) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (sgpt) were also tested. additionally, oxidative damage was examined by measuring of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation. liver histology was examined by light and electron microscopy. compared with control mice, 3 pfd-cd increased the content of fas protein (+90%) and fas mrna (+30%), while the levels of caiii and caiii mrnas were decreased (-48% and -64%, respectively). in addition, 3 pfd-cd did not significantly change the content of gstp1 but produced an increase in its mrna level (+20%), while it decreased the activities of both cat (-66%) and gsts (-26%). after 3 pfd-cd, liver protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation were increased by +55% and +95%, respectively. in serum, 3 pfd-cd increased the activities of both sgot (+30%) and sgpt (+61%). in addition, 3 pfd-cd showed a histological pattern characteristic of hepatic damage. all together, these data suggest that frequent dietary amino acid deprivation causes hepatic metabolic and ultrastructural changes in a fashion similar to precancerous or cancerous conditions.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective. to determine the presence of human papillomavirus (hpv) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in the larynx without the bias of other sublocations, and to describe the different serotypes of hpv and their impact on overall and disease-free survival after 10-year follow-up. study design. retrospective case series with chart review of ear, nose, and throat oncologic database. setting. academic tertiary care hospital. subjects. a total of 123 samples of larynx squamous cell carcinoma were included, only from the glottis and treated only with surgery between 1977 and 2005. methods. dna extraction was carried out by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent visualization was performed in low-density arrays. results were compared with histologic, clinicopathologic, and survival parameters, with a 10-year follow-up. results. hpv dna was detected in 22.76% (n = 28) of the samples. eleven genotypes were detected, 2 of which had never been described in the larynx (hpv43 and hpv62). no increasing trend of hpv was observed over time. hpv presence did not correlate with better survival during the follow-up. smoking was proven as an independent factor in relation to the presence of hpv. conclusion. hpv may represent a notable factor in the development of a subset of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma without significant influence on overall and disease-free survival. more studies, including oncogene transcription proteins, would be necessary to draw more relevant conclusions about the relevance of hpv infection in the larynx.
cell_biology	satellite cells, which are resident in hypoxic niches in the tissue. hypoxia has been recognized as a key factor to maintain stem cells in an undifferentiated state. herein we report that hypoxia plays a fundamental role also in activating myogenesis. in particular, we found that the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1 alpha under hypoxia, in murine skeletal myoblasts, leads to activation of myod through the noncanonical wnt/beta-catenin pathway. moreover, chemical inhibition of hif-1 alpha activity significantly reduces differentiation, thus confirming its crucial role in the process. furthermore, hypoxia-preconditioned myoblasts, once induced to differentiate under normoxic conditions, tend to form hypertrophic myotubes. these results support the notion that hypoxia plays a pivotal role in activating the regeneration process by directly inducing myogenesis through hif-1 alpha. although preliminary, these findings may suggest new perspective for novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of several muscle diseases.-cirillo, f., resmini, g., ghiroldi, a., piccoli, m., bergante, s., tettamanti, g., anastasia, l. activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha promotes myogenesis through the noncanonical wnt pathway, leading to hypertrophic myotubes.
immunology	rheumatic heart disease represents a leading cause of mortality caused by group a streptococcus (gas) infections transmitted through the respiratory route. although gas infections can be treated with antibiotics these are often inadequate. an efficacious gas vaccine holds more promise, with intranasal vaccination especially attractive, as it mimics the natural route of infections and should be able to induce mucosal iga and systemic igg immunity. nanoparticles were prepared by either encapsulating or coating lipopeptide-based vaccine candidate (lcp-1) on the surface of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga). in vitro study showed that encapsulation of lcp-1 vaccine into nanoparticles improved uptake and maturations of antigen-presenting cells. the immunogenicity of lipopeptide incorporated plga-based nanoparticles was compared with peptides co-administered with mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin b in mice upon intranasal administration. higher levels of j14-specific salivary mucosal iga and systemic antibody igg titres were observed for groups immunized with encapsulated lcp-1 compared to lcp-1 coated nanoparticles or free lcp-1. systemic antibodies obtained from lcp-1 encapsulated plga nps inhibited the growth of bacteria in six different gas strains. our results show that plga-based lipopeptide delivery is a promising approach for rational design of a simple, effective and patient friendly intranasal gas vaccine resulting in mucosal iga response.

southern_blotting	chilli, an important commercial crop, is recalcitrant to in vitro regeneration. in the present study, an attempt has been made to optimize the in vitro regeneration of two chilli local cultivars, viz., g4 and lca334, and transform g4 with a transcription factor dreb1a under the control of a desiccation inducible promoter rd29a, known to impart desiccation tolerance, using binary vector pcambia 2301. different phytohormones and their concentrations in ms medium were evaluated for in vitro response; 0.25 mg l-1 zeatin and 2 mg l-1 phenyl acetic acid (paa) supported the highest regeneration rate (37.86%). among the explants, cotyledonary leaf exhibited a higher (51%) regeneration response compared to that of hypocotyls (24.73%), and genotype g4 had better (33.80%) regeneration rate compared to lca334. rooting of the shoots was the highest in ms medium with 2 mg l-1 indole butyric acid (iba) compared to other hormones. the presence of transgene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and southern blotting. the acclimatized transformants were grown in pots and screened for drought tolerance. some of the transformants showed improved tolerance to drought by lower wilting compared to the control plants. the transformation and regeneration protocol described in the present study may help in optimization of transformation of chilli for agronomic traits of interest.
northern_blotting	shmirs are pri-mirna-based rna interference triggers from which exogenous sirnas are expressed in cells to silence target genes. these reagents are very promising tools in rnai in vivo applications due to their good activity profile and lower toxicity than observed for other vector-based reagents such as shrnas. in this study, using high-resolution northern blotting and small rna sequencing, we investigated the precision with which rnases drosha and dicer process shmirs. the fidelity of sirna release from the commonly used pri-mirna shuttles was found to depend on both the sirna insert and the pri-mir scaffold. then, we searched for specific factors that may affect the precision of sirna release and found that both the structural features of shmir hairpins and the nucleotide sequence at drosha and dicer processing sites contribute to cleavage site selection and cleavage precision. an analysis of multiple shrna intermediates generated from several reagents revealed the complexity of shmir processing by drosha and demonstrated that dicer selects substrates for further processing. aside from providing new basic knowledge regarding the specificity of nucleases involved in mirna biogenesis, our results facilitate the rational design of more efficient genetic reagents for rnai technology.

southern_blotting	recent findings have shown that amniotic fluid (af) could be a putative new source of multipotent stem cells (sc). we investigated whether these human sc could efficiently differentiate into myogenic lineage in vitro and integrate in vivo skeletal muscle in severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice. c/kit immunomagnetic-sorted af (af c/kit+) sc were characterized by immunocytochemistry and southern blotting for myogenic markers (desmin, myod). in vitro, af c/kit+ sc phenotypic conversion into myogenic cells was assayed by myogenic-specific induction media. af c/kit+ sc without ex vivo manipulation were transplanted into the tibialis anterior (ta) of (scid) mice. acquisition of a myogenic-like phenotype (desmin, myod) in af c/kit+ sc was observed after culture in myogenic-specific induction media. in vivo, transplanted af c/kit+ sc showed an engraftment in the skeletal muscle of scid mice, but with unexpected tubular glandular tissue-like differentiation. importantly, no immuno-rejection, inflammatory response or tumorigenicity of these cells was found. within these experimental conditions, af c/kit+ sc were able to differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro, but not in vivo after their transplantation into the skeletal muscle of scid mice. because af c/kit+ sc survived and differentiated into tubular gland-like cells after their transplantation in the ta, an ex vivo engagement in myogenic pathway prior their transplantation could favor their differentiation into myogenic cells in vivo.
genetics	connectivity between populations influences both their dynamics and the genetic structuring of species. in this study, we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with long-distance dispersal, the edible common sea urchin paracentrotus lividus, focusing mainly on the adriatic-ionian basins (central mediterranean). we applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics, based on 1,122 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) obtained from 2b-rad in 275 samples, with lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal. we detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal adriatic-ionian area, whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the western mediterranean (france and tunisia). this result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset. lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight adriatic-ionian locations, supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of p.lividus populations in this area. a peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published p.lividus cytochrome b (cytb) sequences, the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences. the comparison with studies conducted using nuclear markers on other species with similar pelagic larval durations in the same adriatic-ionian locations indicates species-specific differences in genetic connectivity patterns and warns against generalizing single-species results to the entire community of rocky shore habitats.
immunology	the social and economic burden of allergic rhinitis (ar) is increasing, with significant effects on the quality of life of patients suffering from ar. therefore, physicians require evidence-based guidelines regarding the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and proper management management of patients with ar. the korean academy of asthma, allergy and clinical immunology developed new clinical guidelines for the appropriate management of ar, especially in korean patients. for the core questions (i.e. questions that most practitioners were curious about), several experts in the field of allergology, pediatrics, and otorhinolaryngology developed a set of practical guidelines based on a systematic review of the literature. furthermore, we determined the level of evidence associated with the recommendations for each answer. in this article, we suggest 15 answers for core questions about the medical treatment of ar.
enzymology	to establish a non-radioactive, cell-free detection system for protein n-myristoylation, metabolic labeling in a cell-free protein synthesis system using bioorthogonal myristic acid analogues was performed. after cu(i)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (cuaac) with a biotin tag, the tagged proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and blotted on a polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) membrane, and then protein n-myristoylation was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) using horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated streptavidin. the results showed that metabolic labeling in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system using an azide analogue of myristic acid followed by cuaac with alkynyl biotin was the most effective strategy for cell-free detection of protein n-myristoylation. to determine whether the newly developed detection method can be applied for the detection of novel n-myristoylated proteins from complementary dna (cdna) resources, four candidate cdna clones were selected from a human cdna resource and their susceptibility to protein n-myristoylation was evaluated using the newly developed strategy. as a result, the products of three cdna clones were found to be novel n-myristoylated protein, and myristoylation-dependent specific intracellular localization was observed for two novel n-myristoylated proteins. thus, the metabolic labeling in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system using bioorthogonal azide analogue of myristic acid was an effective strategy to identify novel n-myristoylated proteins from cdna resources.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: phthalates, which are commonly used to render plastics into soft and flexible materials, have also been determined as developmental and reproductive toxicants in human and animals. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of mono-(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (mehp) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (dehp) oral administrations on maturation of mouse oocytes, apoptosis and gene transcription levels. materials and methods: in this experimental study, immature oocytes recovered from naval medical research institute (nmri) mouse strain (6-8 weeks), were divided into seven different experimental and control groups. control group oocytes were retrieved from mice that received only normal saline. the experimental groups i, ii or iii oocytes were retrieved from mice treated with 50, 100 or 200 mu l dehp (2.56 mu m) solution, respectively. the experimental groups iv, v or vi oocytes were retrieved from mouse exposed to 50, 100 or 200 mu l mehp (2.56 mu m) solution, respectively. fertilization and embryonic development were carried out in omm and t6 medium. apoptosis was assessed by annexin v-fitc/dead cell apoptosis kit, with pi staining. in addition, the mrna levels of pou5f1, ccna1 and asah1 were examined in oocytes. finally, mouse embryo at early blastocyst stage was stained with acridine-orange (ao) and ethidium-bromide (eb), in order to access their viability. results: the proportion of oocytes that progressed up to metaphase ii (mii) and 2-cells embryo formation stage was significantly decreased by exposure to mehp or dehp, in a dose-dependent manner. annexin v and pi positive oocytes showed greater quantity in the treated mice than control. quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) revealed that expression levels of pou5f1, asah1 and ccna1 were significantly lower in the treated mouse oocytes than control. the total cell count for blastocyst developed from the treated mouse oocytes was lower than the controls. conclusion: these results indicate that oral administration of mehp and dehp could negatively affect mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and development in vivo, suggesting that phthalates could be risk factors for mammalians' reproductive health. additionally, phthalate-induced changes in pou5f1, asah1 and ccna1 transcription level could explain in part, the reduced developmental ability of mouse-treated oocytes.
northern_blotting	successful detection of very small rnas (tiny rna, similar to 14 nt in length) by northern blotting is dependent on improved northern blot protocols that combine chemical crosslinking of rna with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)- carbodiimide (edc) to positively charged membranes, the use of native polyacrylamide gels, and the development of highly sensitive and specific probes modified with locked nucleic acids (lna). in this protocol, we show that northern blot detection of tiny rnas with 5'-digoxigenin-labeled dna/lna mixmer probes is a highly sensitive and specific method and, in our hands, more sensitive than using a corresponding dna/lna mixmer probe with a 5'-p-32-end label.
southern_blotting	several bacterial isolates were recovered from surface-sterilized root nodules of arachis hypogaea l. (peanut) plants growing in soils from cordoba, argentina. the 16s rdna sequences of seven fast-growing strains were obtained and the phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the phylum proteobacteria, class gammaproteobacteria, and included pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., and klebsiella spp. after storage, these strains became unable to induce nodule formation in arachis hypogaea l. plants, but they enhanced plant yield. when the isolates were co-inoculated with an infective bradyrhizobium strain, they were even found colonizing pre-formed nodules. analysis of symbiotic genes showed that the nifh gene was only detected for the klebsiella-like isolates and the nodc gene could not be amplified by pcr or be detected by southern blotting in any of the isolates. the results obtained support the idea that these isolates are opportunistic bacteria able to colonize nodules induced by rhizobia.

northern_blotting	this study presents the isolation and characterization of a novel nonsymbiotic hb gene from sessile oak (quercus petraea) seedlings, herein designated qphb1. the cellular and tissue expression of qphb1 was analysed by northern blotting and in situ hybridization. the encoded protein was predicted to consist of 161 amino acid residues, and shares 71 and 51% amino acid sequence identity with the arabidopsis class 1 and 2 nonsymbiotic hb, respectively. northern blot analysis revealed that qphb1 was strongly expressed in roots. spatial expression analysis of qphb1 in the root apical region of sessile oak by in situ hybridization indicated that transcripts were mostly abundant in protoxylem cell initials, some cortical cells and the protoderm. in addition, when comparing the expression profile of qphb1 in sessile and pedunculate oak (quercus robur), two species with contrasted hypoxia tolerance, the transcript level of qphb1 rose early in the most flood-tolerant species, pedunculate oak, during root submergence. the spatial-temporal expression of qphb1 suggests that this gene could participate in perception and signalling during hypoxia.
polymerase_chain_reaction	introducing an animal into a new location could be hazardous in the form of disease transmission, especially with respect to infections that are often overlooked. such introduced infectious agents, including parasitic ones, then pose potential danger to the native animal population. within the conservation program, the european bison was introduced into many european countries. however, this largest european herbivore was recognized as a new host for an invasive parasitic nematode, ashworthius sidemi, in poland in 1998. since then, the prevalence of this non-native parasite in poland has increased not only in bison but also in other wild ruminants. in 2011 five european bison individuals were transported from poland to the czech republic. in the current study, we examined the gastrointestinal tracts of two european bison and two red deer culled in the z. idlov game reserve. a. sidemi was identified in all investigated animals using both morphological and molecular methods; infection intensity was higher in bison than in deer. our findings represent the first record of this invasive parasite in european bison at the czech territory. the results of this study indicate changes in epidemiological patterns of ashworthius infections in the climatic condition of central europe as well as the need to verify the reliability of ashworthiosis intravital diagnostics. one can expect a. sidemi to spread gradually in the czech republic and colonize other native ruminant hosts.
northern_blotting	cholangiocarcinoma (cc) is an intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma with a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. sarcomatous change/epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt) of cc frequently leads to aggressive intrahepatic spread and metastasis. the aim of this study was to identify the genetic alterations and gene expression pattern that might be associated with the sarcomatous change in cc. previously, we established 4 human cc cell lines (sck, jck1, cho-ck, and choi-ck). in the present study, we characterized a typical sarcomatoid phenotype of sck, and classified the other cell lines according to tumor cell differentiation (a poorly differentiated jck, a moderately differentiated cho-ck, and a well differentiated choi-ck cells), both morphologically and immunocytologically. we further analyzed the genetic alterations of two tumor suppressor genes (p53 and fhit) and the expression of fas/fasl gene, well known cc-related receptor and its ligand, in these four cc cell lines. the deletion mutation of p53 was found in the sarcomatoid sck cells. these cells expressed much less fas/fasl mrnas than did the other ordinary cc cells. we further characterize the gene expression pattern that is involved in the sarcomatous progression of cc, using cdna microarrays that contained 18,688 genes. comparison of the expression patterns between the sarcomatoid sck cells and the differentiated choi-ck cells enabled us to identify 260 genes and 247 genes that were significantly over-expressed and under-expressed, respectively. northern blotting of the 14 randomly selected genes verified the microarray data, including the differential expressions of the lgals1, tgfbi, ces1, ldhb, uchl1, asph, vdac1, vil2, ccnd2, s100p, calb1, mal2, gpx1, and anxa8 mrnas. immunohistochemistry also revealed in part the differential expressions of these gene proteins. these results suggest that those genetic and gene expression alterations may be relevant to the sarcomatous change/emt in cc cells.
enzymology	staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that relies on a large repertoire of secreted and cell wall-associated proteins for pathogenesis. consequently, the ability of the organism to cause disease is absolutely dependent on its ability to synthesize and successfully secrete these proteins. in this study, we investigate the role of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (ppiases) on the activity of the s. aureus secreted virulence factor nuclease (nuc). we identify a staphylococcal cyclophilin-type ppiase (ppib) that is required for optimal activity of nuc. disruption of ppib results in decreased nuclease activity in culture supernatants; however, the levels of nuc protein are not altered, suggesting that the decrease in activity results from misfolding of nuc in the absence of ppib. we go on to demonstrate that ppib exhibits ppiase activity in vitro, is localized to the bacterial cytosol, and directly interacts with nuc in vitro to accelerate the rate of nuc refolding. finally, we demonstrate an additional role for ppib in s. aureus hemolysis and demonstrate that the s. aureus parvulin-type ppiase prsa also plays a role in the activity of secreted virulence factors. the deletion of prsa leads to a decrease in secreted protease and phospholipase activity, similar to that observed in other gram-positive pathogens. together, these results demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that ppiases play an important role in the secretion of virulence factors in s. aureus. importance staphylococcus aureus is a highly dangerous bacterial pathogen capable of causing a variety of infections throughout the human body. the ability of s. aureus to cause disease is largely due to an extensive repertoire of secreted and cell wall-associated proteins, including adhesins, toxins, exoenzymes, and superantigens. these virulence factors, once produced, are typically transported across the cell membrane by the secretory (sec) system in a denatured state. consequently, once outside the cell, they must refold into their active form. this step often requires the assistance of bacterial folding proteins, such as ppiases. in this work, we investigate the role of ppiases in s. aureus and uncover a cyclophilin-type enzyme that assists in the folding/refolding of staphylococcal nuclease.
immunology	a great part of our knowledge on mammalian immunology has been established in laboratory settings. the use of inbred mouse strains enabled controlled studies of immune cell and molecule functions in defined settings. these studies were usually performed in specific-pathogen free (spf) environments providing standardized conditions. in contrast, mammalians including humans living in their natural habitat are continuously facing pathogen encounters throughout their life. the influences of environmental conditions on the signatures of the immune system and on experimental outcomes are yet not well defined. thus, the transferability of results obtained in current experimental systems to the physiological human situation has always been a matter of debate. studies elucidating the diversity of wild immunology imprintings in detail and comparing it with those of clean lab mice are sparse. here, we applied multidimensional mass cytometry to dissect phenotypic and functional differences between distinct groups of laboratory and pet shop mice as a source for wild mice. for this purpose, we developed a 31-antibody panel for murine leukocyte subsets identification and a 35-antibody panel assessing various cytokines. established murine leukocyte populations were easily identified and diverse immune signatures indicative of numerous pathogen encounters were classified particularly in pet shop mice and to a lesser extent in quarantine and non-spf mice as compared to spf mice. in addition, unsupervised analysis identified distinct clusters that associated strongly with the degree of pathogenic priming, including increased frequencies of activated nk cells and antigen-experienced b- and t-cell subsets. our study unravels the complexity of immune signatures altered under physiological pathogen challenges and highlights the importance of carefully adapting laboratory settings for immunological studies in mice, including drug and therapy testing.

genetics	genetic counselors are trained health care professionals who effectively integrate both psychosocial counseling and information-giving into their practice. preparing genetic counseling students for clinical practice is a challenging task, particularly when helping them develop effective and active counseling skills. resistance to incorporating these skills may stem from decreased confidence, fear of causing harm or a lack of clarity of psycho-social goals. the author reflects on the personal challenges experienced in teaching genetic counselling students to work with psychological and social complexity, and proposes a genetic counseling adaptation continuum model and methodology to guide students in the use of advanced counseling skills.
southern_blotting	three putative terpenoid udp-glycosyltransferase (ugt) genes, designated csugt1, csugt2, and csugt3, were isolated and characterized in 'valencia' sweet orange (citrus sinensis l. osbeck). csugt1 consisted of 1493 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 492 amino acids, csugt2 consisted of 1727 nucleotides encoding 504 amino acids, and csugt3 consisted of 1705 nucleotides encoding 468 amino acids. csugt3 had a 145 bp intron at 730-874, whereas csugt1 and csugt2 had none. the three deduced glycosyltransferase proteins had a highly conserved plant secondary product glycosyltransferase motif in the c terminus. phylogenetic analysis showed that csugt1 and csugt3 were classified into group l of glycosyltransferase family 1, and csugt2 was classified into group d. through southern blotting analysis, csugt1 was found to have two copies in the sweet orange genome, whereas csugt2 and csugt3 had at least seven and nine copies, respectively. csugt1, csugt2, and csugt3 were constitutively expressed in leaf, flower, and fruit tissues. the results facilitate further investigation of the function of terpenoid glycosyltransferases in citrus and the biosynthesis of terpenoid glycosides in vitro.
genetics	innovations in clinical genetics have increased diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of inherited genetic conditions (igcs). this has led to an increased number of families seeking genetic testing and / or genetic counselling and increased the clinical load for genetic counsellors (gcs). keeping pace with biomedical discoveries, interventions are required to support families to understand, communicate and cope with their inherited genetic condition. the socio-psychological research in genomics (spring) collaborative have developed a new intervention, based on multi-family discussion groups (mfdgs), to support families affected by igcs and train gcs in its delivery. a potential challenge to implementing the intervention was whether gcs were willing and able to undergo the training to deliver the mfdg. in analysing three multi-perspective interviews with gcs, this paper evaluates the training received. findings suggests that mfdgs are a potential valuable resource in supporting families to communicate genetic risk information and can enhance family function and emotional well-being. furthermore, we demonstrate that it is feasible to train gcs in the delivery of the intervention and that it has the potential to be integrated into clinical practice. its longer term implementation into routine clinical practice however relies on changes in both organisation of clinical genetics services and genetic counsellors' professional development.
molecular_biology	the present study focuses on cryptosporidium infections of foals in brazil. a total of 92 animals of different breeds from 11 farms in the vicinity of aracatuba in the state of sao paulo, were examined. according to pcr targeting the 18s rrna gene, cryptosporidium sp. dna was detected in 21.7% (20/92) of foals. good quality 18s rrna, actin, hsp70 and gp60 genes npcr amplicons were obtained from five fecal samples. pcr amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the gp60 sporozoite surface glycoprotein gene revealed c parvum genotypes iiaal8g3r1, liaal5g2r1. interestingly, we also detected in two foals a gp60 genotype related to the human parasite c. hominis.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the objective of this study was to assess the effect of dietary probiotics on rumen fermentation and the bacterial community in dairy calves. twelve holstein calves were randomly allocated to three treatments: a basal diet, the basal diet supplemented with lactobacillus plantarum gf103 (lb) or basal diet supplemented with a mixture of lactobacillus plantarum gf103 and bacillus subtilis b27 (lbs). a milk replacer was fed to calves from 8days of age. a starter and alfalfa hay was offered ad libitum from 21 and 28days of age, respectively, and the orts were weighted daily. the ruminal fluid was sampled at 56 and 83days of age to determine the rumen fermentation characteristics. the bacterial community was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and the number of certain bacteria was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the ratio of total dry matter intake to average body wieght was higher in the control (p<0.05). the dgge fingerprint of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was affected by the blended probiotics at 83days of age. the number of ruminococcus albus was lower in the lb and lbs treatment (p<0.05). oral administration of the probiotics affected the rumen bacterial community and the numbers of cellulolytic bacteria decreased.
immunology	immunotherapy has recently emerged as the fourth pillar of cancer treatment, joining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. while early immunotherapies focused on accelerating t-cell activity, current immune-checkpoint inhibitors take the brakes off the anti-tumor immune responses. successful clinical trials with pd-1 monoclonal antibodies and other immune-checkpoint inhibitors have opened new avenues in cancer immunology. however, the failure of a large subset of cancer patients to respond to these new immunotherapies has led to intensified research on combination therapies and predictive biomarkers. here we summarize the development of pd-1-blockade immunotherapy and current issues in its clinical use.
enzymology	fe-s cluster biogenesis is an essential pathway coordinated by a network of protein-protein interactions whose functions include desulfurase activity, substrate delivery, electron transfer and product transfer. in an effort to understand the intricacies of the pathway, we have developed an in vitro assay to follow the ferredoxin role in electron transfer during fe-s cluster assembly. previously, assays have relied upon the non-physiological reducing agents dithionite and dithiothreitol to assess function. we have addressed this shortcoming by using electron transfer between nadph and ferredoxin-nadp-reductase to reduce ferredoxin. our results show that this trio of electron transfer partners are sufficient to sustain the reaction in in vitro studies, albeit with a rate slower compared with dtt-mediated cluster assembly. we also show that, despite overlapping with the cyay protein in binding to iscs, fdx does not interfere with the inhibitory activity of this protein. we suggest explanations for these observations which have important consequences for understanding the mechanism of cluster formation. cofactor-dependent proteins: evolution, chemical diversity and bio-applications.

genetics	type 2 diabetes (t2d) is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). we have previously described that haploinsufficiency of nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (ncoa5) is a genetic defect linking glucose intolerance to hcc. here we report identification and characterization of a single nucleotide variation (t445a) in ncoa5, causing an amino acid thr to ala substitution, in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues derived from patients with concurrent hcc and t2d. by using tet-on inducible expression cells, we show that ectopic expression of ncoa5wt suppressed proliferation of hcc cells via induction of gm arrest, while ectopic expression of ncoa5t445a had a significantly lesser effect compared to ectopic expression of ncoa5wt. furthermore, ectopic expression of ncoa5wt increased the occurrence of dna damage and cell senescence, whereas expression of ncoa5t445a partly lost this activity. xenograft tumor model analysis demonstrated that ectopic ncoa5wt expression reduced hcc tumor growth and the t445a variation impairs its tumor growth inhibitory function. collectively, our data show that the t445a variation impairs the ability of ncoa5 to inhibit growth of hcc, suggesting that this variation may have potential to increase susceptibility to hcc comorbid with t2d.

cell_biology	the aim of this study was to develop a novel protocol for generating large populations of fully mature and functional human mast cells (hmc) from cd34(+) hematopoietic stem cells which require less culturing time than previously reported methods. cd34(+) cells isolated from fresh human buffy coats were sequentially cultured with different combinations of scf, il-6, il-3, il-9 and il-4 under selected culturing conditions and time periods. cells were then harvested for immunohistochemical characterization of morphological phenotypes and were functionally characterized by assessing their responses to ige-dependent and -independent stimuli by measuring the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. moreover, the pharmacological profiles of several classes of anti-inflammatory drugs in inhibiting the activation of these hmc were also characterized. we have developed a novel protocol that can generate large homogenous populations of mature and functional hmc in 6 weeks. these cells expressed both tryptase and chymase and were activated by anti-ige, cationic peptides and calcium ionophores. moreover, ige-dependent activation of these cells was significantly inhibited by anti-inflammatory drugs. the morphological and functional characteristics of these mast cells resembled those of mctc type or connective tissue-type hmc. our protocol represents a novel time-saving and economical approach for generating large numbers of primary hmc for functional studies of mast cell biology and for profiling novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents with mast cell-inhibitory properties in humans.
human_metabolism	the family of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas), which can be found in most lipid classes, includes n-3 pufas essential for mammals and whose deficiency is associated with multiple diseases. because of their multiple physiological actions, n-3 pufas play a crucial role in normal human metabolism as well as maintenance of a healthy status, with clinical effects that are not limited to the cardiovascular system but also include maternal and offspring health, growth and development, immune system disorders, cancer, cognitive function and psychological status. multiple health organisations and scientific societies recommend increasing food-derived n-3 pufa intake and also suggest that patients with documented coronary heart disease receive a minimum of 1000 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. the preventive and therapeutic effects of n-3 pufas appear to be largely dependent on the dosages employed and the characteristics of selected patients. so, in the era of personalised medicine, the time has come to move from generic advice to increase n-3 pufa intake to a more evidence-based approach characterised by tailored indications to n-3 pufa dietary or supplement consumption. this approach will require evaluation on a case-to-case basis the potential usefulness of n-3 pufas, taking into consideration their 'pleiotropic effects', the optimal dose for any given indication in relation to international guidelines, potential interactions with background therapy, possible side effects, differences in genetics and dietary response to supplementation, and the cost: benefit ratio, which is likely to vary as a function of differences in the range of fish intake in the diet.

polymerase_chain_reaction	fresh (frozen/thawed) muscle samples from four 2-12-year-old roe deer (capreolus capreolus) from the sondrio province in north-eastern italy were examined under a dissecting microscope, and about 180 sarcocysts were isolated and identified to morphological type in wet mounts by light microscopy (lm). seventy-seven of these sarcocysts were subsequently examined by molecular methods, comprising polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of the partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i gene (cox1) of all isolates, as well as pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of the complete18s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene of two isolates of each species found. by lm, three major sarcocyst types were recognised: spindle-shaped sarcocysts, 0.5-3 mm long, either with no clearly recognisable protrusions (thin-walled) or with finger-like protrusions (thick-walled); and slender, thread-like sarcocysts, 2-3 mm long, with hair-like protrusions. sequencing of cox1 revealed that the sarcocysts belonged to four different species. those with no visible protrusions either belonged to sarcocystis gracilis (n = 24) or to a sarcocystis taeniata-like species (n = 19), whereas those with finger- and hair-like protrusions belonged to sarcocystis silva (n = 27) and sarcocystis capreolicanis (n = 7), respectively. the 19 cox1 sequences of the s. taeniata-like species, comprising five haplotypes, differed from each other at 0-16 of 1038 nucleotide positions (98.5-100% identity). they differed from 25 previous cox1 sequences of s. taeniata from moose and sika deer (with 98.0-100% intraspecific identity), at 33-43 nucleotide positions (95.9-96.8% interspecific identity), and there were 20 fixed nucleotide differences between the two populations. in the phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 sequences, the two populations formed two separate monophyletic clusters. the s. taeniata-like species in roe deer was therefore considered to represent a separate species, which was named sarcocystis linearis n. sp. at the 18s rrna gene, however, the two species could not be clearly separated from each other. thus, there was considerable intraspecific sequence variation in the 18s rrna gene of s. linearis (98.1-99.9% identity between 24 sequences), which was similar both in magnitude and nature to the variation previously found in this gene of s. taeniata. the new 18s rrna gene sequences of s. linearis shared an identity of 97.9-99.6% with those of s. taeniata (overlap between intra- and interspecific identity), and in the phylogenetic tree, sequences of the two species were interspersed. by scanning electron microscopy (sem), the sarcocysts of s. linearis were found to possess regularly spaced, thin and narrow ribbon-like cyst wall protrusions (about 2.8-3.2 mu m long, 0.3-0.4 mu m wide and about 0.02-0.03 mu m thick), terminating in a plate-like structure of the same thickness but with an elliptic outline (about 0.3-0.4 mu m wide and 0.7-0.9 mu m long). the terminal plates were connected in the middle with the band-like portion of the protrusions like the board of a seesaw (tilting board). the terminal plates of adjacent protrusions were neatly arranged in a hexagonal pattern resembling tiles on a roof. together, they formed an outer roof-like layer facing the surrounding cytoplasm of the host cell and completely covering the band-like proximal portion of the protrusions, which overlapped and were stacked in three to four layers close to the cyst surface. the sarcocyst morphology of s. linearis was consistent with that of an unnamed sarcocystis sp. in roe deer previously found by transmission electron microscopy in several countries, including italy. a few sarcocysts of s. gracilis and s. silva were also examined by sem, confirming the presence of regularly distributed, short knob-like protrusions in s. gracilis (as seen in previous sem studies) and revealing tightly packed, erect 6-7-mu m-long villus-like protrusions having regularly distributed round depressions on their surface in s. silva. the sequencing of cox1 of 7, 24 and 27 new isolates of s. capreolicanis, s. gracilis and s. silva, respectively, recovered 7, 11 and 10 new haplotypes from each of the three species and expanded our knowledge on the intraspecific sequence variation at this marker. similarly, the study revealed a more extensive intragenomic sequence variation at the 18s rrna gene of s. capreolicanis and s. silva than known from previous studies and confirmed a near absence of such variation in the 18s rrna gene of s. gracilis.
northern_blotting	endothelial cell dysfunction (ecd) is a common feature of chronic renal failure (crf). defective nitric oxide ( no) generation due to decreased endothelial no synthase ( enos) activity is a crucial parameter characterizing ecd. l-arginine is the sole precursor for no biosynthesis. among several transporters that mediate l-arginine uptake, cationic amino-acid transporter-1 (cat-1) acts as the specific arginine transporter for enos. our hypothesis implies that cat-1 is a major determinant of enos activity in crf. we studied glomerular and aortic arginine uptake, cat-1, and cat-2 messenger ribonucleic acid ( mrna) expression, and cat-1 protein in: ( a) rats 6 weeks following 5/6 nephrectomy ( crf), (b) sham-operated animals, and ( c) rats with crf treated orally with either atorvastatin or arginine in drinking water (modalities which have been shown to enhance enos activity and improve endothelial function). both glomerular and aortic arginine transport were significantly decreased in crf. treatment with either arginine or atorvastatin abolished the decrease in arginine uptake in crf rats. using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting, we found a significant increase in glomerular and aortic cat-1 mrna expression in crf. western blotting revealed that cat-1 protein was decreased in crf, but remained intact following arginine and atorvastatin administration. renal and systemic arginine uptake is attenuated in crf, through modulation of cat-1 protein. these findings provide a possible novel mechanism to enos inactivation and endothelial dysfunction in uremia.
human_metabolism	we report on a case of repeated mdpv consumptions that resulted in severe psychosis and agitation prompting the concomitant abuse of benzodiazepines. a 27-year-old man was found irresponsive in his apartment and was brought to the emergency department (ed) of a local hospital. when in ed, he rapidly recovered and self-reported to have recently injected some doses of mdpv that he had bought in the internet. he left the hospital without medical cares. 15 days after, he was again admitted to the same ed due to severe agitation, delirium and hallucinations, and reported the use of mdpv and pharmaceutical drugs during the preceding week. he was sedated with diazepam and chlorpromazine. urine samples collected in both occasions were sent for testing using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (lc-hrms) and liquid chromatography-high resolution multiple mass spectrometry (lc-hrms/ms) on an orbitrap. the lc-hrms analysis revealed the presence of mdpv and its phase i and phase ii metabolites (demethylenyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-methyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-methyl-oxo-mdpv, demethylenyl-hydroxy-alkyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-methyl-hydroxy alkyl-mdpv, demethylenyl-oxo-mdpv and their corresponding glucuronides), alprazolam and alprazolam metabolite at the first ed admission; at the time of the second ed access, the same mdpv metabolites, alprazolam, temazepam, and chlordiazepoxide were detected together with diazepam and metabolites. lc-hrms/ms was use to determine the following concentrations, respectively on his first and second admission: mdpv 55 ng/ml, alprazolam 114 ng/ml, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam 104 ng/ml; mdpv 35 ng/ml, alprazolam 10.4 ng/ml, alpha -hydroxyalprazolam 13 ng/ml; chlordiazepoxide 13 ng/ml, temazepam 170 ng/ml, diazepam 1.3 ng/ml, nordiazepam 61.5, oxazepam 115 ng/ml. the toxicological findings corroborated the referred concomitant use of multiple pharmaceutical drugs and benzodiazepines. confirmation of previous hypothesis on human metabolism of mdpv could be inferred by the analysis of urine.

molecular_biology	work on standardising methods in the field of animal species differentiation has been intensified in germany in recent years, not least due to the horsemeat scandal in 2013. even though there are now hardly ever any positive findings any more in examinations to detect horse elements in foods such as lasagne, animal species differentiation altogether ranks high in detecting adulteration of foods. this article therefore summarises the current status of analysis techniques in germany with a focus on standardisation. it has been established by the working group ""biochemical and molecular biological analytics"" of the lebensmittelchemische gesellschaft (food chemistry society within the german chemical society) with support of experts in the working group ""molecular biology techniques for differentiating plant and animal species"" [ 64 of the german food and feed code - lfgbi and the ""immunology and molecular biology"" task force of the food hygiene and food of animal origin working group (alts), both from germany.
enzymology	the access to kinetic parameters of lipolytic enzyme adsorption onto lipids is essential for a better understanding of interfacial enzymology and lipase-lipid interactions. the interfacial adsorption of dog gastric lipase (dgl) was monitored as a function of ph and surface pressure (pi), independently from the catalytic activity, using non-hydrolysable 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (dlpc) monomolecular films. the acid-stable dgl, which initiates fat digestion in the stomach, was then selected because its adsorption kinetics onto hydrophobic solid surfaces were already studied. this gastric lipase was therefore used as a model enzyme to validate both experimental and theoretical approaches. results show that the adsorption process of dgl at the lipid/water interface depends on a ph-dependent adsorption equilibrium coefficient which is optimum at ph 5.0 (k-ads = 1.7 +/- 0.05 x 10(8) m-1). k-ads values further allowed an indirect estimation of the molar fraction (phi(e'(%)), mol%) as well as the molecular area (a(e')) of dgl adsorbed onto dlpc monolayer. based on these data, a model for dgl adsorption onto dlpc monolayer at ph 5.0 is proposed for a surface pressure range of 15-25 mn m(-1).

enzymology	a novel lyase activity enzyme is characterized for the first time: hmg-coa lyase-like1 (er-chl), which is a close homolog of mitochondrial hmg-coa lyase (mhl). initial data show that there are nine mature transcripts for the novel gene hmgcll1, although none of them has all its exons. the most abundant transcript is called ""variant b,"" and it lacks exons 2 and 3. moreover, a three-dimensional model of the novel enzyme is proposed. colocalization studies show a dual location of the er-chl in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and cytosol, but not in mitochondria or peroxisomes. furthermore, the dissociation experiment suggests that it is a nonendoplasmic reticulum integral membrane protein. the kinetic parameters of er-chl indicate that it has a lower v-max and a higher substrate affinity than mhl. protein expression and lyase activity were found in several tissues, and were particularly strong in lung and kidney. the occurrence of er-chl in brain is surprising, as mhl has not been found there. although mhl activity is clearly associated with energy metabolism, the results suggest that er-chl is more closely related to another metabolic function, mostly at the pulmonary and brain level.-arnedo, m., s. menao, b. puisac, m. e. teresa-rodrigo, m. c. gil-rodriguez, e. lopez-vinas, p. gomez-puertas, n. casals, c. h. casale, f. g. hegardt, and j. pie. characterization of a novel hmg-coa lyase enzyme with a dual location in endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. j. lipid res. 2012. 53: 2046-2056.
southern_blotting	endogenous non-retroviral rna like sequences (nrvss) have been discovered in the genome of a wide range of eukaryotes. these are considered as fossil rna viral elements integrated into host genomes by as-yet-known mechanisms, and in many cases, those fossils are estimated to be millions-of-years-old. it is likely that the number of nrvs records will increase rapidly due to the growing availability of whole-genome sequences for many kinds of eukaryotes. discovery of the novel nrvss and understanding of their phylogenetic relationship with modern viral relatives provide important information on deep evolutionary history of rna virus-host interactions. in this chapter, therefore, the common strategies for the identification and characterization of endogenous nrvss from plants, insects, and fungi are described.
polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: to identify the effects of interleukin (il) -13 on retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells and the il -13 level in aqueous humor of age-related macular degeneration (amd) patients. methods: il -13 levels in aqueous humor specimens from amd patients were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). arpe-19 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml il -13 for 12, 24, and 48h. the cell proliferaton was evaluated by the mts method. the mrna and protein levels of alpha-sma and zo-1 were evaluated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) and western blot respectively. the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta)and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) were assessed by elisa. results: il -13 levels in the aqueous humor of patients with amd were significantly higher than those in the control (167.33 +/- 17.64 vs 27.12 +/- 5.65 pg/ml; p<0.01). in vitro, il -13 of high concentrations (10, 15, and 20 ng/ml) inhibited arpe-19 cell proliferation. a-sma mrna in arpe-19 cell were increased (1.017 +/- 0.112 vs 1.476 +/- 0.168; p<0.001) and zo-1 decreased (1.051 +/- 0.136 vs 0.702 +/- 0.069; p<0.001) after treated with 10 ng/ml il -13 for 48h. the protein expression of a-sma and zo-1 also showed the same tendency (a-sma: p=0.038; zo-1: p=0.008). il -13 significantly reduced the level of tnf-a (44.7 +/- 01.67 vs 31.79 +/- 3.53 pg/ml; p=0.005) at 48h, but the level of tgf-i32 was significantly increased from 34.44 +/- 2.92 to 57.61 +/- 6.31 pg/ml at 24h (p=0.004) and from 61.26 +/- 1.11 to 86.91 +/- 3.59 pg/ml at 48h (p<0.001). while expressions of vegf did n't change after il -13 treatment. conclusion: il -13 in vitro inhibit arpe-19 cell proliferation and expression in the aqueous may be associated with amd.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the objective of this study was to measure the effect of selection for tolerance on the severity of the aleutian disease (ad) lesions in mink. sensitivity and specificity of antibody detection in the blood by counter-immunoelectrophoresis (ciep) relative to the presence of aleutian mink disease virus (amdv) in the spleen by pcr in naturally infected farmed mink were also estimated. carcasses of 680 sero-positive (ciep-p) black mink from 28 farms in nova scotia, canada, and from 132 sero-negative (ciep-n) mink from 14 of these farms were collected at pelting time. a total of 116 of the ciep-p mink were from three farms where animals have been selected for tolerating ad for almost 20 years. the severity of the ad lesions was assessed by histopathological examination of kidneys, lungs, heart, brain and liver on a scale of 0 to 4. sensitivity and specificity of ciep relative to pcr were 0.97 and 0.85, respectively, and 16.5% of ciep-n mink were pcr positive, which could be one of the reasons for the failure of virus eradication by ciep in canada. the ciep-n and tolerant ciep-p animals had 9.39 and 6.23 greater odds of showing lower lesion severity, respectively, than the ciep-p animals (p < 0.01). the ciep-n mink had a slightly higher chance (p = 0.07) of showing lower lesion severity (odds ratio 1.51) compared with tolerant ciepp mink. the results suggested that tolerant mink had significantly reduced severity of ad lesions despite having anti-viral antibodies and carrying the virus.

enzymology	in vitro metabolism of tanzisertib [(1s, 4r)-4-(9-((s)tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)-8-(2,4,6-trifluorophenylamino)- 9h-purin-2-ylamino) cyclohexanol], a potent, selective c-jun amino-terminal kinase (jnk) inhibitor, was investigated in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes over 4 h. the extent of metabolism of [c-14] tanzisertib was variable, with <10% metabolized in dog and human,75% metabolized in rat and mouse. primary metabolic pathways in human and dog hepatocytes, were direct glucuronidation and oxidation of cyclohexanol to a keto metabolite, which was subsequently reduced to parent or cis-isomer, followed by glucuronidation. rat and mouse produced oxidative metabolites and cis-isomer, including direct glucuronides and sulfates of tanzisertib and cis-isomer. enzymology of oxido-reductive pathways revealed that human aldo-keto reductases akr1c1, 1c2, 1c3 and 1c4 were responsible for oxido-reduction of tanzisertib, cc-418424 and keto tanzisertib. characterizations of enzyme kinetics revealed that akr1c4 had a high affinity for reduction of keto tanzisertib to tanzisertib compared to other isoforms. these results demonstrate unique stereoselectivity of the reductive properties documented by human akr1c enzymes for the same substrate. characterization of ugt isoenzymes in glucuronidation of tanzisertib and cc-418424 revealed that, tanzisertib glucuronide was catalyzed by: ugt1a1, 1a4, 1a10 and 2b4, while cc-418424 glucuronidation was catalyzed by ugt2b4 and 2b7.
genetics	understanding howhost dynamics, including variations of population size and dispersal, may affect the epidemiology of infectious diseases through ecological and evolutionary processes is an active research area. here we focus on a bank vole (myodes glareolus) metapopulation surveyed in finland between 2005 and 2009. bank vole is the reservoir of puumala hantavirus (puuv), the agent of nephropathia epidemica (ne, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptom) in humans. m. glareolus populations experience multiannual density fluctuations that may influence the level of genetic diversity maintained in bank voles, puuv prevalence and ne occurrence. we examine bank vole metapopulation genetics at presumably neutral markers and immunerelated genes involved in susceptibility to puuv (tnf-promoter, tlr4, tlr7 and mx2 gene) to investigate the links between population dynamics, microevolutionary processes and puuv epidemiology. we show that genetic drift slightly and transiently affects neutral and adaptive genetic variability within the metapopulation. gene flow seems to counterbalance its effects during the multiannual density fluctuations. the low abundance phase may therefore be too short to impact genetic variation in the host, and consequently viral genetic diversity. environmental heterogeneity does not seem to affect vole gene flow, which might explain the absence of spatial structure previously detected in puuv in this area. besides, our results suggest the role of vole dispersal on puuv circulation through sex-specific and density-dependent movements. we find little evidence of selection acting on immune-related genes within this metapopulation. footprint of positive selection is detected at tlr-4 gene in 2008 only. we observe marginally significant associations between mx2 genotype and puuv genogroups. these results show that neutral processes seem to be the main factors affecting the evolution of these immune-related genes at a contemporary scale, although the relative effects of neutral and adaptive forces could vary temporally with density fluctuations. immune related gene polymorphism may in turn partly influence puuv epidemiology in this metapopulation.

southern_blotting	high levels of homologous recombination are induced during meiosis. this meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed formation of dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) by a conserved meiosis-specific protein, spoil. meiotic dsbs are not formed at random along chromosomes but are formed in clusters known as recombination hot spots. to understand the regulation of this initiation step of meiotic recombination, determining the timing and location of meiotic dsbs is essential. in this chapter, we describe a method to detect genome-wide meiotic dsbs by using a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern blotting.
immunology	acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is characterized by the proliferation of immature myeloid lineage blasts. due to its heterogeneity and to the high rate of acquired drug resistance and relapse, new treatment strategies are needed. here, we demonstrate that ifn promotes aml blasts to act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. treatment with ifn drove aml blasts toward a more differentiated state, wherein they showed increased expression of the m1-related markers hla-dr and cd86, as well as of fcri, which mediates effector responses to therapeutic antibodies. importantly, ifn was able to up-regulate cd38, the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab. because the antigen (cd38) and effector receptor (fcri) were both simultaneously up-regulated on the aml blasts, we tested whether ifn treatment of the aml cell lines thp-1 and mv4-11 could stimulate them to target one another after the addition of daratumumab. results showed that ifn significantly increased daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured both by cr-51 release and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. we also found that the combination of ifn and activation of fcr led to the release of granzyme b by aml cells. finally, using a murine nsg model of subcutaneous aml, we found that treatment with ifn plus daratumumab significantly attenuated tumor growth. taken together, these studies show a novel mechanism of daratumumab-mediated killing and a possible new therapeutic strategy for aml.
immunology	purpose of review the anca-associated vasculitides are a group of small vessel vasculitides characterized by autoantibodies recognizing the neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens pr3 and mpo. we examine the current clinical and molecular immunology understanding of anca-associated vasculitides and discuss the current needs in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these rare diseases. recent findings the majority of efforts to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases have focused on dissecting neutrophil biology because the neutrophil is the primary expressor of anca autoantigens. however, a number of important genetic, clinical, and cellular biology observations suggest that attempts to understand the pathogenesis of anca vasculitides should move away from emphasis on the role of the neutrophil and instead re-focus on the potential role of other immune cell mediators. summary whether or not neutrophils are the key determinant of anca-associated vasculitis pathogenesis should be revisited in detail. a neutrophil-centric view of the pathogenesis of these diseases cannot fully account for important genetic, clinical, and cellular biology observations that implicate important and under-appreciated roles for monocytes and t cells. refocusing on these findings will likely lead to new discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the identification of clinically useful biomarkers for disease activity.
northern_blotting	endothelin-1 (et-1) is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. we investigated the effects of et-1 on intracellular calcium transient and its mechanisms. neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared and calcium transient was measured using fura-2. treatment with et-1 for 48 h prolonged calcium transient decay. in the presence of thapsigargin, et-1 did not alter calcium transient decay. on the other hand, the prolonged calcium transient decay was maintained even when sodium was removed from the bath solution. these results indicate that et-1-induced prolongation of calcium transient decay is mainly due to the suppression of calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not inhibition of the sodium/calcium exchanger. northern blotting analysis revealed that sarcoplasmic reticulum atpase (serca2) mrna was decreased in et-1-treated cardiomyocytes, and that this decrease was inhibited by bq-123 but not by bq-788. moreover, pretreatment with chelerythrine partially restored the et-1-induced decrease in serca2 mrna, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate markedly reduced serca2 gene expression. real-time rt-pcr analysis showed abundant eta receptor gene expression in cardiomyocytes. et-1 reduces serca2 gene expression through the eta receptor and pkc pathway, and prolongs intracellular calcium transient decay. specific inhibition of the eta receptor may be a possible therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac performance.
cell_biology	proteomic studies have facilitated the identification of proteins associated with the detergent-resistant membrane (drm) fraction in a variety of cell types. here, we have undertaken label-free quantitative (lfq) proteomic profiling of the proteins associated with detergent-resistant plasma and internal membranes from resting and activated platelets. one hundred forty-one proteins were identified and raw data is available via proteomexchange with identifier pxd002554. the proteins identified include a myriad of important platelet signaling and trafficking proteins including rap1b, src, snap-23, syntaxin-11, and members of the previously unattributed ragulator complex. mean lfq intensities calculated across three technical replicates for the three biological donors revealed that several important platelet signaling proteins altered their detergent solubility upon activation, including gpib alpha, gpib beta, src, and 14-3-3 zeta. altered detergent solubility for gpib zeta, following activation using a variety of platelet agonists, was confirmed by immunoblotting and further coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gpib alpha forms a complex with 14-3-3 zeta that shifts into drms following activation. taken together, proteomic profiling of platelet drms allowed greater insight in the complex biology of both drms and platelets and will be a useful subproteome to study platelet-related disease. all ms data have been deposited in the proteomexchange with identifier pxd002554 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/pxd002554).
northern_blotting	rna interference (rnai) is a powerful tool for functional gene analysis, which has been successfully used to down-regulate the levels of specific target genes. in this study a microrna 159a-based binary vector was constructed which can be used for hprna expression. hairpin (hp) rna expression cassettes carrying the gene sequences are typically constructed on binary plasmid and delivered into plant cells by agrobacteriurn-mediated genetic transformation. this system allows simple insertion of 21- nt target gene sequences into microrna backbone, to facilitate the processing of microrna hprna by the endogenous machinery of host, thereby producing artificial microrna carrying the sequence of target gene(s). the functionality of new vector system was tested by silencing viral gene in transgenic plants. strong down regulation of viral gene was observed in virus infected tobacco plants transformed with pamir(159) vector. the processing of amirna leading to viral-specific sirna was confirmed by northern blotting. this vector system provides an important addition to the plant molecular biologists' toolbox, which will significantly facilitate the use of rnai technology for analyses of various gene functions in plant cells.
molecular_biology	pancreatic lipase is a potential therapeutic target to treat diet-induced obesity in humans, as obesity-related diseases continue to be a global problem. despite intensive research on finding potential inhibitors, very few compounds have been introduced to clinical studies. in this work, new chemical scaffold 1h-indene-(1,3,5,6)-tetrol was proposed using knowledge-based approach, and 36 inhibitors were derived by modifying its functional groups at different positions in scaffold. to explore binding affinity and interactions of ligands with protein, cdocker and autodock programs were used for molecular docking studies. analyzing results of rigid and flexible docking algorithms, inhibitors c_12, c_24, and c_36 were selected based on different properties and high predicted binding affinities for further analysis. these three inhibitors have different moieties placed at different functional groups in scaffold, and to characterize structural rationales for inhibitory activities of compounds, molecular dynamics simulations were performed (500 nsec). it has been shown through simulations that two structural fragments (indene and indole) in inhibitor can be treated as isosteric structures and their position at binding cleft can be replaced by each other. taking into account these information, two lines of inhibitors can further be developed, each line based on a different core scaffold, that is, indene/indole.

enzymology	few studies have examined the effect of black tea (camellia sinensis) theaflavins on obesity-related tart gets. pancreatic lipase (pl) plays a central role in fat metabolism and is a validated target for weight loss. we compared the inhibitory efficacy of individual theaflavins and explored the underlying mechanism. theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (tfdig), theaflavin-3'-gallate, theaflavin-3-gallate, and theaflavin inhibited pl with ic50 of 1.9, 4.2, 3.0, and >10 mu mol/l. the presence and location of the galloyl ester moiety were essential for inhibitory potency. tfdig exhibited mixed inhibition with respect to substrate concentration. in silico modeling showed that theaflavins bind to asn263 and asp206, which form a pocket adjacent to the active site, and galloyl-containing theaflavins are then predicted to perturb the protonation of his264. these data provide a putative mechanism to explain the anti-obesity effects of tea.

molecular_biology	objective: to review contemporary knowledge of the hcg molecule, its isoforms and the importance of glycosylation. biologic variants and glycoforms of hcg have different biological activities and functions related to the control of menstrual cycle, conception, gestation as well as gynaecologic and non-gynaecologic malignancies. design: a review. setting: department of obstetrics and gynaecology, university hospital olomouc. methods: to present own experience and an overview of recent literature in molecular biology, clinical biochemistry and clinical practice. conclusion: recent knowledge of the role of hcg glycosylation in physiologic and pathologic events in female organism will provide a better understanding of regulation of processes like ovulation (co-operation of pituitary hcg with lh), implantation and hemochorial placentation (invasivity of hyperglycosylated hcg). some biologic variants and isoforms of hcg are important for the prediction of certain pathologies of pregnancy, prenatal screening of inborn errors (free beta hcg) as well as in the treatment of infertility.
northern_blotting	myocardial ischemic preconditioning up-regulated protein 1 (mipu1) was cloned in our laboratory. male wistar rats were subjected to left anterior coronary artery ligation and sham-operation and sacrificed at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 d or 5 d after ligation. expression of mipu1 mrna and protein were assessed by northern blotting, real-time quantitative rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and western blotting. expression of mipu1 was up-regulated at 3 h and lasted to 12 h with a peak at 6 h. mipu1 mrna and protein signals express in the endothelium and myocardium in normal and infarcted heart, mainly in infarcted zone. fluorescent immunocytochemistry showed that mipu1 protein was localized to the nuclei of h9c2 myogenic cells and was upregulated after the cells being exposed to h2o2. these observations indicates that mipu1 may play a role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and protecting the myogenic cells from being injured by ischemia-reperfusion or oxidation stress.
polymerase_chain_reaction	insect cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (cyps or p450s) play an important role in detoxifying insecticides leading to resistance in insect populations. a polyphagous pest, spodoptera litura, has developed resistance to a wide range of insecticides. in the present study, a novel p450 gene, cyp321b1, was cloned from s. litura. the function of cyp321b1 was assessed using rna interference (rnai) and monitoring resistance levels for three commonly used insecticides, including chlorpyrifos, beta-cypermethrin and methomyl. the full-length complementary dna sequence of cyp321b1 is 1814 bp long with an open reading frame of 1488 bp encoding 495 amino acid residues. quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses during larval and pupal development indicated that cyp321b1 expression was highest in the midgut of fifth-instar larvae, followed by fat body and cuticle. the expression of cyp321b1 in the midgut was up-regulated by chlorpyrifos, beta-cypermethrin and methomyl with both lethal concentration at 15% (lc15) (50, 100 and 150 mu g/ml, respectively) and 50%(lc50) dosages (100, 200 and 300 mu g/ml, respectively). addition of piperonyl butoxide (pbo) significantly increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos, beta-cypermethrin and methomyl to s. litura, suggesting a marked synergism of the three insecticides with pbo and p450-mediated detoxification. rnai-mediated silencing of cyp321b1 further increased mortality by 25.6% and 38.9% when the fifth-instar larvae were exposed to chlorpyrifos and beta-cypermethrin, respectively, at the lc50 dose levels. the results demonstrate that cyp321b1 might play an important role in chlorpyrifos and beta-cypermethrin detoxification in s. litura.
genetics	sydney rock oysters saccostrea glomerata are among the most important estuarine species on the eastern coast of australia and also the basis of a major aquaculture industry. the industry now largely relies on sydney rock oysters that have been selectively bred for fast growth and disease resistance. selectively bred s. glomerata are currently farmed in estuaries that also sustain wild populations of sydney rock oysters, providing the opportunity for interbreeding. this has led to concern that gene flow from farmed, selectively bred oysters could alter the genetic variability of wild oyster populations. here, we use next-generation genotype-by-sequencing to test for genetic introgression between wild and farmed, selectively bred (b2 line) sydney rock oysters from 2 sites in the georges river, nsw. strong genetic partitioning was identified between the wild and selectively bred populations. there was no evidence of gene flow in the form of introgression, even though selectively bred b2 oysters have been farmed in the georges river since the early 1990s. contrary to our expectations, we also found significantly higher levels of genetic diversity and heterozygosity in the selectively bred population relative to the wild population. the relatively low level of genetic diversity that we detected in wild oysters may be particularly relevant to the adaptive capacity of this species in the wild.
cell_biology	under the microscope, eukaryotic animal cells can adopt a variety of different shapes and sizes. these cells also move and deform, and the physical mechanisms driving these movements and shape changes are important in fundamental cell biology, tissue mechanics, as well as disease biology. this article reviews some of the basic mechanical concepts in cells, emphasizing continuum mechanics description of cytoskeletal networks and hydrodynamic flows across the cell membrane. we discuss how cells can generate movement and shape changes by controlling mass fluxes at the cell boundary. these mass fluxes can come from polymerization/depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton, as well as osmotic and hydraulic pressure-driven flow of water across the cell membrane. by combining hydraulic pressure control with force balance conditions at the cell surface, we discuss a quantitative mechanism of cell shape and volume control. the broad consequences of this model on cell mechanosensation and tissue mechanics are outlined.
immunology	to date, the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) and the union for international cancer control (uicc) tumor, nodes, metastasis (tnm) classification represents the standard system for evaluation of prognosis in solid tumors. however, the clinical outcome can be significantly different in patients with the same tnm stage. therefore, many efforts have been made aiming to define new prognostic parameters. indeed, analyses conducted in large cohorts of colorectal cancer patients emphasized the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, leading to the development of a prognostic score referred to as ""immunoscore"". in this commentary, we recapitulate the study by gabrielson and colleagues, recently published in cancer immunology research, addressing the role of intratumoral cd3(+) and cd8(+) t cells as well as as prognostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma. the authors demonstrate that immunoscore represents a valuable prognostic marker in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have undergone primary tumor resection, supporting its application in a tumor setting other than colorectal cancer.
enzymology	radical s-adenosylmethionine (adomet) enzymes comprise a large superfamily of proteins that engage in a diverse series of biochemical transformations through generation of the highly reactive 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate. recent advances into the biosynthesis of unique iron-sulfur (fes)-containing cofactors such as the h-cluster in [fefe]-hydrogenase, the femo-co in nitrogenase, as well as the iron-guanylylpyridinol (fegp) cofactor in [fe]-hydrogenase have implicated new roles for radical adomet enzymes in the biosynthesis of complex inorganic cofactors. radical adomet enzymes in conjunction with scaffold proteins engage in modifying ubiquitous fes precursors into unique clusters, through novel amino acid decomposition and sulfur insertion reactions. the ability of radical adomet enzymes to modify common metal centers to unusual metal cofactors may provide important clues into the stepwise evolution of these and other complex bioinorganic catalysts. this article is part of a special issue entitled: radical sam enzymes and radical enzymology.

enzymology	the h355a, h355k, h80a, and h80k mutant enzymes of the arge-encoded n-acetyl-l-ornithine deacetylase (arge) from escherichia coli were prepared, however, only the h355a enzyme was found to be soluble. kinetic analysis of the co(ii)-loaded h355a exhibited activity levels that were 380-fold less than co(ii)-loaded wt arge. electronic absorption spectra of co(ii)-loaded h355a-arge indicate that the bound co(ii) ion resides in a distorted, five-coordinate environment and isothermal titration calorimetry (itc) data for zn(ii) binding to the h355a enzyme provided a dissociation constant (k-d) of 39 mu m. a three-dimensional homology model of arge was generated using the x-ray crystal structure of the dape-encoded n-succinyl-l, l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (dape) from haemophilus influenzae confirming the assignment of h355 as well as h80 as active site ligands.
genetics	tandem repeats are often associated with important chromosomal landmarks, such as centromeres, telomeres, subtelomeric, and other heterochromatic regions, and can be good candidates for molecular cytogenetic markers. tandem repeats present in many plant species demonstrate dramatic differences in unit length, proportion in the genome, and chromosomal organization. members of genus allium with their large genomes represent a challenging task for current genetics. using the next generation sequencing data, molecular, and cytogenetic methods, we discovered two tandemly organized repeats in the allium fistulosum genome (2n = 2c = 16), hat58 and cat36. together, these repeats comprise 0.25% of the bunching onion genome with 160,000 copies/1 c of hat58 and 93,000 copies/1 c of cat36. fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and c-banding showed that hat58 and cat36 associated with the interstitial and pericentromeric heterochromatin of the a. fistulosum chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 8. fish with hat58 and cat36 performed on a. cepa (2n = 2c = 16) and a. wakegi (2n = 2c = 16), a natural allodiploid hybrid between a. fistulosum and a. cepa, revealed that these repeats are species specific and produced specific hybridization patterns only on a. fistulosum chromosomes. thus, the markers can be used in interspecific breeding programs for monitoring of alien genetic material. we applied non-denaturing fish that allowed detection of the repeat bearing chromosomes within 3 h. a polymorphism of the hat58 chromosome location was observed. this finding suggests that the rapid evolution of the hat58 repeat is still ongoing.
genetics	nitrogen levels can modulate the effectiveness of clubroot resistance in an isolate- and host-specific manner. while the same qtl were detected under high and low nitrogen, their effects were altered. clubroot, caused by plasmodiophora brassicae, is one of the most damaging diseases of oilseed rape and is known to be affected by nitrogen fertilization. however, the genetic factors involved in clubroot resistance have not been characterized under nitrogen-limiting conditions. this study aimed to assess the variability of clubroot resistance under different nitrogen levels and to characterize the impact of nitrogen supply on genetic resistance factors. linkage analyses and a genome-wide association study were conducted to detect qtl for clubroot resistance and evaluate their sensitivity to nitrogen. the clubroot response of a set of 92 diverse oilseed rape accessions and 108 lines derived from a cross between 'darmor-bzh' (resistant) and 'yudal' (susceptible) was studied in the greenhouse under high- and low-nitrogen conditions, following inoculation with the p. brassicae isolates eh and k92-16. resistance to each isolate was controlled by a major qtl and a few small-effects qtl. while the same qtl were detected under both high and low nitrogen, their effects were altered. clubroot resistance to isolate eh, but not k92-16, was greater under a low-n supply versus a high-n supply. new sources of resistance were found among the oilseed rape accessions under both low and high-n conditions. the results are discussed relative to the literature and from a crop improvement perspective.
immunology	to summarize the principal findings on risk and protective factors for childhood asthma, we retrieved systematic reviews on these topics in children (aged 1 to 18 years), up to january 2016, through medline, embase, cinahl, scopus, and cdsr. a total of 227 studies were searched from databases. among those, 41 systematic reviews (srs) were included: 9 focused on prenatal factors, 5 on perinatal factors, and 27 on postnatal factors. of these 41 srs, 83% had good methodological quality, as determined by the assess systematic reviews tool. after reviewing all evidence, parental asthma, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke, and prematurity (particularly very preterm birth) are well-established risk factors for childhood asthma. current findings do suggest mild-to-moderate causal effects of certain modifiable behaviors or exposures during pregnancy (maternal weight gain or obesity, maternal use of antibiotics or paracetamol, and maternal stress), the perinatal period (birth by caesarean delivery), or postnatal life (severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, overweight or obesity, indoor exposure to mold or fungi, and outdoor air pollution) on childhood asthma, but this suggestive evidence must be confirmed in interventional studies or (if interventions are not feasible) well-designed prospective studies.

northern_blotting	activation of the akt (serine-threonine kinase) pathway is a common feature in glioblastoma cells. downstream factors of the akt pathway are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cellular migration and angiogenesis. micro-rnas (mirnas) are highly conserved small non-coding rnas that block targeted mrna expression at the post-transcriptional level. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the akt pathway in regulating mirna. the changes of mirna expression profile in human glioblastome u251 cells after akt small interfering rna transfection were examined by a microarray, and confirmed by northern blotting. down-regulation of akt expression by sirna decreased the activity of akt pathway in u251 cells. interruption of akt pathway suppressed the expression of nf-kappa b and c-myc, furthermore, the expression of a set of mirnas was also changed after akt sirna transfection. there are putative binding sites of nf-kappa b and c-myc in the promoters of several up-regulated mirnas, indicating these transcription factors may also be involved in the regulation of mirna expression, thus affecting the activity of akt pathway in tumorigenesis. we provide new components of the regulatory function of akt pathway to better understand the regulatory network mediated by downstream transcription factors. the understanding of the regulatory function of akt pathway is crucial in tailored therapy of gliomas.
cell_biology	purpose of reviewprimary cilia have become important organelles implicated in embryonic development, organogenesis, health, and diseases. although many studies in cell biology have focused on changes in ciliary length or ciliogenesis, the most common readout for evaluating ciliary function is intracellular calcium.recent findingsrecent tools have allowed us to examine intracellular calcium in more precise locations, that is, the cilioplasm and cytoplasm. advances in calcium imaging have also allowed us to identify which cilia respond to particular stimuli. furthermore, direct electrophysiological measurement of ionic currents within a cilium has provided a wealth of information for understanding the sensory roles of primary cilia.summarycalcium imaging and direct measurement of calcium currents demonstrate that primary cilia are sensory organelles that house several types of functional calcium channels. although intracellular calcium now allows a functional readout for primary cilia, discussions on the relative contributions of the several channel types have just begun. perhaps, all of these calcium channels are required and necessary to differentiate stimuli in different microenvironments.
northern_blotting	effects in the liver of fatal intoxication with the binary toxin ricin are unclear. we report a robust neutrophil influx into the liver of c57bl/6 mice after lethal parenteral ricin challenge, occurring in peri-portal and centro-lobular hepatic areas within 2 h, followed by the abrupt disappearance of hepatic macrophages/kupffer cells. chemokine profiles determined by microarray, ribonuclease protection assays, northern blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed rapid (2 h) upregulation and persistence of those for neutrophils (cxcl1/kc, cxcl2/mip-2) and monocytes (ccl2/mcp-1). red blood cell pooling (8-12 h), loss of hepatocyte glycogen (8-48 h) associated with progressive hypoglycemia, fibrin deposition (24-48 h), and death (72-96 h) followed. monoclonal antibody to ricin a chain, administered intravenously, blunted hypoglycemia, and abrogated death. this outcome was observed when anti-ricin antibody was given before toxin exposure as well as when administered approximately 10 h after toxin exposure. targeting antibody to specific amino-acid sequences on the ricin a chain (hael and qxxwxxa) was critical to the therapeutic effect. re-emergence of liver macrophages/kupffer cells and replenishment of glycogen in previously depleted hepatocytes preceded full recovery of the host. these data identify critical events for liver injury and healing in ricin intoxication, as well as a new means and specific targets for post- exposure therapeutic intervention.
polymerase_chain_reaction	bluetongue virus (btv) is a member of the genus orbivirus within the family reoviridae and causes a non-contagious, insect-transmitted disease in domestic and wild ruminants, mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and some species of deer. virus infection can trigger the changes of the cellular microrna (mirna) expression profile, which play important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. here, we employed deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular mirnas were differentially expressed in primary sheep testicular (st) cells infected with btv. a total of 25 known mirnas and 240 novel mirna candidates that were differentially expressed in btv-infected and uninfected st cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes were annotated, respectively. nine differentially expressed mirnas and their mrna targets were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. targets prediction and functional analysis of these regulated mirnas revealed significant enrichment for several signaling pathways including mapk, pi3k-akt, endocytosis, hippo, nf-kb, viral carcinogenesis, foxo, and jak-stat signaling pathways. this study provides a valuable basis for further investigation on the roles of mirnas in btv replication and pathogenesis.

cell_biology	aging affects numerous aspects of cell biology, but the senescence-associated changes in the stress response are only beginning to emerge. to obtain mechanistic insights into these events, we examined the formation of canonical and non-canonical stress granules (sgs) in the cytoplasm. sg generation is a key event after exposure to physiological or environmental stressors. it requires the sg-nucleating proteins g3bp1 and tia-1/tiar and stress-related signaling events. to analyze sg formation, we used two independent models of somatic cell aging. in both model systems, cellular senescence impaired the assembly of two sg classes: (i) it compromised the formation of canonical sgs, and (ii) skewed the production of non-canonical sgs. we dissected the mechanisms underlying these senescence-dependent changes in granule biogenesis and identified several specific targets that were modulated by aging. thus, we demonstrate a depletion of g3bp1 and tia-1/fiar in senescent cells and show that the loss of g3bp1 contributed to impaired sg formation. we further reveal that aging reduced sp1 levels; this transcription factor regulated g3bp1 and tia-1/fiar abundance. the assembly of canonical sgs relies on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor elf2 alpha. we show that senescence can cause elf2 alpha hyperphosphorylation. crep is a subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and critical to reverse the stress-dependent phosphorylation of elf2a. we demonstrate that the loss of crep correlated with the aging-related hyperphosphorylation of elf2 alpha. together, we have identified significant changes in the stress response of aging cells and provide mechanistic insights. based on our work, we propose that the decline in sg formation can provide a new biomarker to evaluate cellular aging.

cell_biology	maximizing the benefit of human pluripotent stem cells (hpscs) for research, disease modeling, pharmaceutical and clinical applications requires robust methods for the large-scale production of functional cell types, including cardiomyocytes. here we demonstrate that the temporal manipulation of wnt, tgf-beta, and shh signaling pathways leads to highly efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation of single-cell passaged hpsc lines in both static suspension and stirred suspension bioreactor systems. employing this strategy resulted in similar to 100% beating spheroids, consistently containing >80% cardiac troponin t-positive cells after 15 days of culture, validated in multiple hpsc lines. we also report on a variation of this protocol for use with cell lines not currently adapted to single-cell passaging, the success of which has been verified in 42 hpsc lines. cardiomyocytes generated using these protocols express lineage-specific markers and show expected electrophysiological functionalities. our protocol presents a simple, efficient and robust platform for the large-scale production of human cardiomyocytes.
genetics	background: this study reports on the analysis of the application and diagnostic predictability of the revised 2014 icbd criteria in an unselected cohort of uk patients, and the ensuing organ associations and patterns of disease. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted using a database of electronic medical records. three categories were recognised: clinically defined bd, incomplete bd and rejected diagnoses of bd. we applied the isg 1990 and icbd 2014 classification criteria to these subgroups to validate diagnostic accuracy against the multidisciplinary assessment. results: between 2012 and 2015, 281 patients underwent initial assessment at an urban tertiary care centre: 190 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bd, 7 with an incomplete diagnosis, and 84 with a rejected diagnosis. icbd 2014 demonstrated an estimated sensitivity of 97.89% (95% ci: 94.70 to 99.42) and positive likelihood ratio of 1.21 (1.10 to 1.28). the strongest independent predictors were: central nervous lesions (or = 10.57, 95% ci: 1.34 to 83.30); genital ulceration (or = 9.05, 95% ci: 3.35 to 24.47); erythema nodosum (or = 6.59, 95% ci: 2.35 to 18. 51); retinal vasculitis (or = 6.25, 95% ci: 1.47 to 26.60); anterior uveitis (or = 6.16, 95% ci: 2.37 to 16.02); posterior uveitis (or = 4.82, 95% ci: 1.25 to 18.59). conclusions: the icbd 2014 criteria were more sensitive at picking up cases than isg 1990 using the multidisciplinary assessment as the gold standard. icbd may over-diagnose bd in a uk population. patients who have an incomplete form of bd represent a distinct group that should not be given an early diagnostic label. behcet 's disease is a complex disease that is best diagnosed by multidisciplinary clinical assessment. patients in the uk differ in their clinical presentation and genetic susceptibility from the original descriptions. this study also highlights an incomplete group of behcet 's patients that are less well defined by their clinical presentation.
polymerase_chain_reaction	representing an important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (n2o) emission from cultivated land is a hot topic in current climate change research. this study examined the influences of nitrogen fertilisation, temperature and soil moisture on the ammonia monooxygenase subunit a (amoa) gene copy numbers and n2o emission characteristics. the experimental observation of n2o fluxes was based on the static chamber-gas chromatographic method. the ammonia-oxidising bacteria (aob) and ammonia-oxidising archaea (aoa) gene copy numbers in different periods were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the results indicated that rain-fed potato field was a n2o source, and the average annual n2o emission was approximately 0.46 +/- 0.06 kgn(2)o-n/ha/year. n2o emissions increased significantly with increase in fertilisation, temperatures below 19.6 a degrees c and soil volumetric water content under 15%. crop rotation appreciably decreases n2o emissions by 34.4 to 52.4% compared to continuous cropping in rain-fed potato fields. the significant correlation between n2o fluxes and aob copy numbers implied that n2o emissions were primarily controlled by aob in rain-fed potato fields. the research has important theoretical and practical value for understanding n2o emissions from rain-fed dry farmland fields.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the processes of yeast selection for using as wine fermentation starters have revealed a great phenotypic diversity both at interspecific and intraspecific level, which is explained by a corresponding genetic variation among different yeast isolates. thus, the mechanisms involved in promoting these genetic changes are the main engine generating yeast biodiversity. currently, an important task to understand biodiversity, population structure and evolutionary history of wine yeasts is the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in yeast adaptation to wine fermentation, and on remodeling the genomic features of wine yeast, unconsciously selected since the advent of winemaking. moreover, the availability of rapid and simple molecular techniques that show genetic polymorphisms at species and strain levels have enabled the study of yeast diversity during wine fermentation. this review will summarize the mechanisms involved in generating genetic polymorphisms in yeasts, the molecular methods used to unveil genetic variation, and the utility of these polymorphisms to differentiate strains, populations, and species in order to infer the evolutionary history and the adaptive evolution of wine yeasts, and to identify their influence on their biotechnological and sensorial properties.
genetics	genetic variation lays the foundation for diversity and enables humans to adapt to changing environments. the order of the nucleotides adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine on the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) molecules of the nuclear chromosomes and mitochondrial dna (mtdna) plays an important role in normal cell division, tissue development, and reproduction but is susceptible to alteration from a large number of random, inherited, or environmental events. variations can range from a change in a single nucleotide to duplication of entire chromosomes. single nucleotide polymorphisms are the major source of human heterogeneity. other variations that can alter phenotypes and adversely impact growth, development, and health include copy number variations, aneuploidies, and structural alterations such as deletions, translocations, inversions, duplications, insertions, or mutations in mtdna. in addition, dna rearrangements in somatic cells underlie the uncontrolled cell growth found in cancer. this article explores the mechanisms by which variations in dna arise and the impact those changes can have on human health.
southern_blotting	two sisters with inherited, severe platelet dysfunction associated with p2y(12) deficiency displayed a single base pair deletion in their p2y(12) genes (378delc), resulting in a frame-shift and premature truncation of the protein. gl, the son of one of them, displayed mild platelet dysfunction and normal p2y(12) sequence. we hypothesized that the abnormal platelet phenotype of gl is due to haploinsufficiency of his p2y(12) gene. we analyzed genomic dna from the family by southern blotting and real-time (rt) pcr. southern blotting results demonstrated that gl has a single p2y(12) allele, inherited from his father. rt-pcr revealed that gl, his mother and aunt have one single intact p2y(12) allele, while his father has two p2y(12) alleles. the single gl p2y(12) allele contains normal sequence, while his mother and aunt have the 378delc allele. the results of this study support our hypothesis and illustrate the platelet phenotype associated with p2y(12) haploinsufficiency.
northern_blotting	an amphioxus cdna, amphigm2ap, encoding gm2 activator protein was isolated from the gut cdna library of branchiostoma belcheri. it is 907 by long, and its longest open reading frame codes for a precursor protein consisting of 242 amino acid residues with a signal peptide of 14 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence includes a conserved domain typical of gm2aps between residues 53 and 224, a single n-linked glycosylation site at position 65 and 8 conserved cysteines. phylogenetic analysis showed that amphigm2ap forms a club together with invertebrate gm2aps, indicating that amphigm2ap is evolutionarily closely related to invertebrate gm2aps rather than vertebrate ones. both northern blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry analyses revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern of amphigm2ap in adult amphioxus with the strongest expression in the digestive system, which is in contrast to the widespread expression pattern of human, mouse and sheep gm2ap genes. it is suggested that amphigm2ap is possibly involved in the take-in of digested food components like lipid molecules.
polymerase_chain_reaction	pectinolytic bacteria from the genus dickeya (former erwinia chrysanthemi), belonging to dickeya dianthicola and dickeya solani species, are causative agents of blackleg and soft rot diseases in europe. recently, d. solani have been isolated most frequently from potato plants with the symptoms of blackleg and soft rot. d. solani strains were shown to cause more severe disease symptoms on potato plants than d. dianthicola especially at the higher temperature. they are also able to develop blackleg disease from lower inoculum levels. in the presented study we not only compared phenotypic features of fifteen d. solani strains isolated in countries having different climatic conditions, poland, finland and israel, but also we examined three d. dianthicola strains. the comparison was performed to determine the influence of the strain origin and the temperature of incubation on the ability of the strains to macerate potato tissue and on their major virulence factors such as: pectinolytic, cellulolytic and proteolytic activities, siderophore production and motility. polish d. solani strains showed higher activities of cell wall degrading enzymes than the finnish and israeli strains at all the tested temperatures: 18, 27, 37 a degrees c. this observation is correlated with the higher ability of polish d. solani strains to cause soft rot. in addition, d. solani strains exhibited higher activity of the above mentioned enzymes and caused more severe potato tuber maceration in laboratory tests than the tested d. dianthicola strains. the collected results indicate that although d. solani strains from different climatic conditions have identical pulse field gel electrophoresis (pfge) profiles in addition to the same fingerprint profiles obtained by the repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep, eric and box repetitive sequences), they differ in the examined phenotypic features, especially in the activities of pectinolytic, cellulolytic and proteolytic enzymes and their capacity to macerate potato tuber tissue.
cell_biology	signaling mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases i and 2 (erk1/2) is involved in numerous cellular processes. mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (mek1/2) catalyze the phosphorylation of erk1/2, converting it into an active kinase that regulates the expression of numerous genes and cellular processes. inhibitors of mek1/2 have demonstrated preclinical and clinical efficacy in certain cancers and types of cardiomyopathy. we report the synthesis of a novel, allosteric, macrocyclic mek1/2 inhibitor that potently inhibits eric1/2 activity in cultured cells and tissues of mice after systemic administration. mice with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by a lamin a/c gene mutation have abnormally increased cardiac erk1/2 activity. in these mice, this novel mek1/2 inhibitor is well tolerated, improves left ventricular systolic function, decreases left ventricular fibrosis, has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle structure and pathology and prolongs survival. the novel mek1/2 inhibitor described herein may therefore find clinical utility in the treatment of this rare cardiomyopathy, other types of cardiomyopathy and cancers in humans.

genetics	soybean seed oil typically contains 18-20% oleic acid. increasing the content of oleic acid is beneficial for health and biodiesel production. mutations in fad2-1 genes have been reported to increase seed oleic acid content. a subset of 1,037 mutant families from a mutagenized soybean cultivar (cv.) forrest population was screened using reverse genetics (tilling) to identify mutations within fad2 genes. although no fad2 mutants were identified using gel-based tilling, four fad2-1a and one fad2-1b mutants were identified to have high seed oleic acid content using forward genetic screening and subsequent target sequencing. tilling has been successfully used as a non-transgenic reverse genetic approach to identify mutations in genes controlling important agronomic traits. however, this technique presents limitations in traits such as oil composition due to gene copy number and similarities within the soybean genome. in soybean, fad2 are present as two copies, fad2-1 and fad2-2. two fad2-1 members: fad2-1a and fad2-1b; and three fad2-2 members: fad2-2a, fad2-2b, and fad2-2c have been reported. syntenic, phylogenetic, and in silico analysis revealed two additional members constituting the fad2 gene family: gmfad2-2d and gmfad2-2e, located on chromosomes 09 and 15, respectively. they are presumed to have diverged from other fad2-2 members localized on chromosomes 19 (gmfad2-2a and gmfad2-2b) and 03 (gmfad2-2c). this work discusses alternative solutions to the limitations of gel-based tilling in functional genomics due to high copy number and multiple paralogs of the fad2 gene family in soybean.
northern_blotting	background: micrornas (mirnas) are small non-coding rnas that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. sequential cleavage of mirna precursors results in a similar to 22 nucleotide duplex of which one strand, the mature mirna, is typically loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex (risc) while the passenger strand is degraded. very little is known about how genetic variation might affect mirna biogenesis and function. results: we re-sequenced the mir1-1, mir1-2, mir133a1, mir133a2, and mir133b genes, that encode the cardiac-enriched mirnas, mir-1 and mir-133, in 120 individuals with familial atrial fibrillation and identified 10 variants, including a novel 79t >c mir133a2 substitution. this variant lies within the duplex at the 3' end of the mature strand, mir-133a-3p, and is predicted to prevent base-pairing and weaken thermostability at this site, favoring incorporation of the passenger strand, mir-133a-5p, into risc. genomic dna fragments containing mir-133a-2 precursor sequences with 79t and 79c alleles were transfected into hela cells. on northern blotting the 79t allele showed strong expression of mir-133a-3p with weak expression of mir-133a-5p. in contrast, the 79c allele had no effect on mir-133a-3p but there was a significant increase (mean 3.6-fold) in mir-133a-5p levels. deep sequencing of small rna libraries prepared from normal human and murine atria confirmed that nearly all the mature mir-133a was comprised of mir-133a-3p and that levels of mir-133a-5p were very low. a number of isomirs with variations at 5' and 3' ends were identified for both mir-133a-3p and mir-133a-5p, with 2 predominant mir-133a-3p isomirs and one predominant mir-133a-5p isomir. bioinformatics analyses indicate that the major mir-133a-3p and 5p isomirs have numerous predicted target mrnas, only a few of which are in common. conclusions: multiple mir-133a isomirs with potential different mrna target profiles are present in the atrium in humans and mice. we identified a human 79t >c mir133a2 variant that alters mirna processing and results in accumulation of the mir-133a-5p strand that is usually degraded.
polymerase_chain_reaction	chlamydia suis infections are endemic in domestic pigs in europe and can lead to conjunctivitis, pneumonia, enteritis and reproductive failure. currently, the knowledge on the zoonotic potential of c.suis is limited. moreover, the last decades, porcine tetracycline resistant c.suis strains have been isolated, which interfere with treatment of chlamydial infections. in this study, the presence of c.suis was examined on nine belgian pig farms, using chlamydia culture and a c.suis specific real-time pcr in both pigs and farmers. in addition to diagnosis for c.suis, the farmers' samples were examined using a chlamydia trachomatis pcr. additionally, the chlamydia isolates were tested for the presence of the tet(c) resistance gene. c. dna was demonstrated in pigs on all farms, and eight of nine farmers were positive in at least one anatomical site. none of the farmers tested positive for c. trachomatis. chlamydia suis isolates were obtained from pigs of eight farms. nine porcine c.suis isolates possessing a tet(c) gene were retrieved, originating from three farms. moreover, c.suis isolates were identified in three human samples, including one pharyngeal and two rectal samples. these findings suggest further research on the zoonotic transfer of c.suis from pigs to humans is needed.
southern_blotting	using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), the cdna encoding a new isoform of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (bmef2) was cloned from the brain of the strain ""liangguang 2"" of bombyx mori. the open reading frame (orf) of the new isoform shows 12 nucleotides absence of (gcactcacaaag) and three nucleotides mutation to the former bmef2 (genbank no. ab121093). thus, we named it bmef2b (genbank no. ef100967). using the swiss-model prediction server, the 3-d structure of bmef2b was modeled. there are two -turns and three -helixes predicted in bmef2b, with the pattern of -. the bmef2b mrna was detected not only in the central nervous system (cns), including brain, suboesophageal ganglion (sg), thoracic ganglion (tg), and abdominal ganglion (ag), but in the non-neural tissues, such as the midgut (mg), fat body (fb), and epidermis (ep), muscle (ms) and ovary (ov). bmef2b mrna content in the brain was measured using the combined method of quantitative rt-pcr and southern blotting, which kept consistently high from larvae to adults.
enzymology	in cells, an appreciable part of enzymes is associated with lipid membranes. academic experimental studies of the function of membrane enzymes (e.g., pla(2) representing a prototype for interfacial enzymology) are often focused on the enzyme-vesicle interaction or, more specifically, on conversion of lipid forming the external leaflet of the vesicle membrane. the corresponding kinetics are complicated by many factors inherent to the interfacial physics and chemistry. the understanding of the relative role of such factors and how they should be quantitatively described is still limited. here, we present the mean-field kinetic equations, taking the formation of rafts in the membrane and the product-induced membrane strain into account, and analyze various scenarios of lipid conversion. in particular, we scrutinize the conditions when the kinetics may exhibit a transition from a relatively long latency period to a steady-state regime with fast nearly constant reaction rate. specifically, we discuss the likely role of the pore formation in the external lipid layer in this transition. the latter effect may be caused by the product-induced tensile strain in this layer.

human_metabolism	modern high-throughput techniques offer immense opportunities to investigate whole-systems behavior, such as those underlying human diseases. however, the complexity of the data presents challenges in interpretation, and new avenues are needed to address the complexity of both diseases and data. constraint-based modeling is one formalism applied in systems biology. it relies on a genome-scale reconstruction that captures extensive biochemical knowledge regarding an organism. the human genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is increasingly used to understand normal cellular and disease states because metabolism is an important factor in many human diseases. the application of human genome-scale reconstruction ranges from mere querying of the model as a knowledge base to studies that take advantage of the model 's topology and, most notably, to functional predictions based on cell-and condition-specific metabolic models built based on omics data. an increasing number and diversity of biomedical questions are being addressed using constraint-based modeling and metabolic models. one of the most successful biomedical applications to date is cancer metabolism, but constraint-based modeling also holds great potential for inborn errors of metabolism or obesity. in addition, it offers great prospects for individualized approaches to diagnostics and the design of disease prevention and intervention strategies. metabolic models support this endeavor by providing easy access to complex high-throughput datasets. personalized metabolic models have been introduced. finally, constraint-based modeling can be used to model whole-body metabolism, which will enable the elucidation of metabolic interactions between organs and disturbances of these interactions as either causes or consequence of metabolic diseases. this chapter introduces constraint-based modeling and describes some of its contributions to systems biomedicine.
human_metabolism	in pediatric age and particularly in newborn infants the drug efficacy and safety are influenced by the growth and development on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (adme). thanks to the fast development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, the drug therapy promises to be adapted to the genetic profile of the individual, reducing considerably the side effects of drugs and increasing their efficacy. interindividual variability in drug response is well known in both adults and children. such a variability is multifactorial considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. drug distribution in the neonate is influenced by a variety of age-dependent factors as a total body water content and distribution variations, role of drug transporters, blood/tissue protein binding, blood and tissue ph and perfusion. the development of enzymes involved in human metabolism were classified in 3 categories: 1) those expressed during the whole or part of the fetal period, but silenced or expressed at low levels within 1-2 years after birth; 2) those expressed at relatively constant levels throughout fetal development, but increased to some extent postnatally; and 3) those whose onset of expression can occur in the third trimester, but substantial increase is noted in the first 1-2 years after birth. besides this intrinsic aspects influencing pharmacokinetics during the neonatal period there are other important events such as inborn or acquired diseases, environment and finally pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. thousands of deaths every years are caused by fatal drug reactions; among the potential causes there are not only the severity of the disease being treated, drug interactions, nutritional status, renal and liver functions, but also the inherited differences in drug metabolism and genetic polymorphism. adverse drug reactions (adrs) among pediatric patients have been shown to be three times more frequent than in adults. on august 2010 the national institute of child health and human development (nichd) addressed patient safety issues in the nicu, recognizing that to understand and prevent adverse events, systematic research and education in safety issues needed. from all these concepts in terms of adme, pharmacogenetics (relative to a single gene) and pharmacogenomics (relative to many genes) it is becoming more evident the perspective of the new concept of individualized medicine. the goal of this should be to identify which group of patients responds positively, which patients are nonresponders and who experiences adverse reaction for the same drug and dose. the interindividual variability in response to any drug is mostly dependent on dna sequence variations across the human genome, the haplotype map (hapmap). at present there is still a big distance beween the knowledge in genetic and the practical application to model the drug profile to the genetic/genomic profile of the single patient. in the neonatal period the effects of growth in the pharmacodynamic, processes can help optimizing the dosage of neonatal frequently used medicines, thereby, minimizing their toxicity and increasing their efficacy. it should be useful to create accurate dosage adjustments according to the week of development.
human_metabolism	traditionally, the choice of which candidate compounds to take forward into development has been based on pre-clinical data. however, lack of predictivity of the human clinical situation in the models used has led to poor decision-making, and the later in the development process that such mistakes are realised, the more costly and time-consuming it is to correct them. furthermore, compounds that may have made perfectly good drugs, have been dropped due to poor pharmacokinetics; in animal models. accelerator mass spectrometry (ams) is an ultra-sensitive detection technique that can be used to quantify carbon-14. by administering very small amounts of (14)c-labelled compounds, ams can be used to obtain human clinical data very early in the drug development process. such studies: a) can be helpful in understanding human pharmacokinetics using microdosing; b) can provide early human metabolism information, to validate the choice of animal species used in pre-clinical safety testing and identify unique or disproportionate human metabolites during phase 1; and c) can provide fundamental human pharmacokinetic data, including absolute bioavailability, by facilitating a scientifically optimal and cost-effective study design. the provision of these clinical insights at the earliest possible opportunity can lead to improved decision-making, and therefore can reduce the time and cost involved in the drug development process.
molecular_biology	prophenoloxidase (propo) cascade is a principal defense system in crustaceans, which consists of a variety of pattern recognition proteins (lipopolysaccharide and beta-glucan-binding protein [beta-gbp], beta-gbp, and beta-glucan recognition protein), proteases (serine protease), and protease inhibitors (alpha 2-macroglobulin and pacifastin) to regulate the protection mechanism in crustaceans. in the prophneoloxidase pathway, the protein-protein interactions (ppis) and other immune-related analyses still have not been reported. moreover, the structural features of propo cascade proteins have not yet been reported, hence we constructed the three-dimensional structural features for all propo pathway proteins. their ppis were studied through an in silico approach. laminarin has been identified as a triggering activator and it showed energetic binding with homology modeled beta-gbp and activated the beta-gbp, followed by the protein-protein complex formation leading to phenoloxidase synthesis. these findings provided a novel view of the propo mechanism and enhanced our knowledge of the innate immune system in crustaceans via computation. in conclusion, we propose a combined experimental and computational approach to analyze the mechanism of propo cascade proteins.

genetics	blepharospasm (sometimes called ""benign essential blepharospasm,"" beb) is one of the most common focal dystonias. it involves involuntary eyelid spasms, eye closure, and increased blinking. despite the success of botulinum toxin injections and, in some cases, pharmacologic or surgical interventions, beb treatments are not completely efficacious and only symptomatic. we could develop principled strategies for preventing and reversing the disease if we knew the pathogenesis of primary beb. the objective of this study was to develop a conceptual framework and dynamic circuit hypothesis for the pathogenesis of beb. the framework extends our overarching theory for the multifactorial pathogenesis of focal dystonias (peterson et al., 2010) to incorporate a two-hit rodent model specifically of beb (schicatano et al., 1997). we incorporate in the framework three features critical to cranial motor control: (1) the joint influence of motor cortical regions and direct descending projections from one of the basal ganglia output nuclei, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, on brainstem motor nuclei, (2) nested loops composed of the trigeminal blink reflex arc and the long sensorimotor loop fromtrigeminal nucleus through thalamus to somatosensory cortex back through basal ganglia to the same brainstem nuclei modulating the reflex arc, and (3) abnormalities in the basal ganglia dopamine system that provide a sensorimotor learning substrate which, when combined with patterns of increased blinking, leads to abnormal sensorimotor mappings manifest as beb. the framework explains experimental data on the trigeminal reflex blink excitability (trbe) from schicatano et al. and makes predictions that can be tested in new experimental animal models based on emerging genetics in dystonia, including the recently characterized striatal-specific d1r dopamine transduction alterations caused by the gnal mutation. more broadly, the model will provide a guide for future efforts to mechanistically link multiple factors in the pathogenesis of beb and facilitate simulations of how exogenous manipulations of the pathogenic factors could ultimately be used to prevent and reverse the disorder.
southern_blotting	the popular view that plant mitochondrial genome evolves slowly in sequence has been recently challenged by the extraordinarily high substitution rates of mtdna documented mainly from several angiosperm genera, but high substitution rate acceleration accompanied with great length variation has been very rarely reported in plant mitochondrial genes. here, we studied evolution of the mitochondrial rps3 gene that encodes the ribosomal small subunit protein 3 and found a dramatically high variation in both length and sequence of an exon region of it in conifer ii. a sequence comparison between cdna and genomic dna showed that there are no rna editing sites in the conifer ii rps3 gene. southern blotting analyses of the total dna and mtdna, together with the real-time pcr analysis, showed that rps3 exists as a single mitochondrial locus in gymnosperms. it is very likely that the conifer ii rps3 gene has experienced retroprocessing, i.e., the re-integration of its cdna into the mitochondrial genome, followed by an evolutionary acceleration due to the intron loss. in addition, the phylogenetic analysis of rps3 supports the sister relationship between conifers and gnetales. in particular, the monophyly of conifer ii is strongly supported by the shared loss of two rps3 introns. our results also indicate that the mitochondrial gene tree would be affected in topology when the ""edited"" paralogs are analyzed together with their genomic sequences.

molecular_biology	no-mediated alternative pathway plays an important role in protecting wheat seedlings against drought stress through dissipating excessive reducing equivalents generated by photosynthesis. alternative pathway (ap) has been proven to be involved in responses to various stresses. however, the mechanisms of ap in defense response to drought stress are still lacking. the aims of this work are to investigate the role of ap in drought tolerance and how ap is induced under drought stress using two wheat cultivars with different drought tolerance. our results showed that longchun22 cultivar is more tolerant to drought than 98sn146 cultivar. seedlings exposed to drought led to a significant increase in ap, and it increased more in longchun22. furthermore, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (fv/fm, i broken vertical bar psii, qp) decreased significantly in drought-treated seedlings, especially in 98sn146, indicating that photoinhibition occurred under drought stress. pretreatment with sham, the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle activity and photosynthetic efficiency were further inhibited in drought-treated seedlings, resulting in more serious oxidative damage as indicated by higher levels of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide. moreover, no modulated ap under drought stress by increasing aox1a expression and pyruvate content. taken together, these results indicate that no-mediated ap is involved in optimizing photosynthesis under drought stress by avoiding the over-reduction of photosynthetic electron transport chain, thus reducing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in wheat leaves.
immunology	c1q is the target recognition sequence of the classical complement pathway and a major link that connects innate and acquired immunity. in this study, a c1qdc homolog, hcc1qdc5, from the triangle-shell pearl mussel (hyriopsis cumingii) was identified. the complete nucleotide sequence of hcc1qdc5 cdna consists of a 5'-untranslated terminal region (utr) of 123 bp, a 3'-utr of 105 bp with a poly(a) tail, and an open reading frame (orf) of 1344 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 447 amino acids. hcc1qdc5 contains a signal peptide and three typical c1q domains. the hcc1qdc5 gene was expressed in all tested tissues, with the highest expression in the. mantle. staphylococcus aureus or vibrio parahaemolyticus infection increased the mrna transcript levels of hcc1qdc5 in the hepatopancreas and mantle. the recombinant hcc1qdc5 protein could bind to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as to different pamps (lps and pgn). rnai results showed that hcc1qdc5 was involved in v. parahaemolyticus-induced hctnf and hcwap expression. the combined results demonstrated that hcc1qdc5 participates in the innate immunity of h. cumingii.

polymerase_chain_reaction	understanding pathogenic variation in plant pathogen populations is key for the development and use of host resistance for managing verticillium wilt diseases. a highly virulent defoliating (d) pathotype in verticillium dahliae has previously been shown to occur only in one clonal lineage (lineage 1a). by contrast, no clear association has yet been shown for race 1 with clonal lineages. race 1 carries the effector gene ave1 and is avirulent on hosts that carry resistance gene ve1 or its homologues. the hypothesis tested was that race 1 arose once in a single clonal lineage, which might be expected if v. dahliae acquired ave1 by horizontal gene transfer from plants, as hypothesized previously. in a diverse sample of 195 v. dahliae isolates from nine clonal lineages, all race 1 isolates were present only in lineage 2a. conversely, all lineage 2a isolates displayed the race 1 phenotype. moreover, 900-bp nucleotide sequences from ave1 were identical among 27 lineage 2a isolates and identical to sequences from other v. dahliae race 1 isolates in genbank. the finding of race 1 in a single clonal lineage, with identical ave1 sequences, is consistent with the hypothesis that race 1 arose once in v. dahliae. molecular markers and virulence assays also confirmed the well-established finding that the d pathotype is found only in lineage 1a. pathogenicity assays indicated that cotton and olive isolates of the d pathotype (lineage 1a) were highly virulent on cotton and olive, but had low virulence on tomato.
enzymology	progesterone, estrogens, androgens and glucocorticoids are involved in pregnancy from implantation to parturition. their biosynthesis and their metabolism result from complex pathways involving the fetus, the placenta and the mother. the absence of expression of some steroidogenic enzymes as cyp17 in placenta and in adrenal fetal zone and the better determination of the onset and variation of others especially hsd3b2 during the pregnancy explain the production of the steroid hormones. moreover the consequences of some disorders of steroidogenesis (especially aromatase, por, cyp11a1 and 21-hydroxylase deficiencies) in fetus and mother during the pregnancy have permit to elucidate these complex pathways. this better knowledge of steroid hormones production associated with their dosages in maternal plasma/urine or amniotic fluid using new specific assays as lc-ms ms could facilitate the follow-up of normal and pathological pregnancies. moreover, these advances should be a basis to evaluate the impact of multiple pathologies of the pregnancy and pharmacologic and xenobiotic consequences on their metabolism.

immunology	background: adding a long-acting beta(2)-agonist (laba) to inhaled corticosteroids (ics) using a fixed-dose combination (fdc) inhaler is the uk guideline recommendation for children aged more than 4 years with uncontrolled asthma. the evidence of benefit of adding an fdc inhaler over a separate laba inhaler is limited. objective: the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a laba added as an fdc inhaler, and as a separate inhaler, in children with uncontrolled asthma. methods: two uk primary care databases were used to create a matched cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period. we included children prescribed their first step-up from ics monotherapy. two cohorts were formed for children receiving an add-on laba as an fdc inhaler, or a separate laba inhaler. matching variables and confounders were identified by comparing characteristics during a baseline year of follow-up. outcomes were examined during the subsequent year. the primary outcome was an adjusted odds ratio for overall asthma control (defined as follows: no asthma-related hospital admission or emergency room visit, prescription for oral corticosteroids or antibiotic with evidence of respiratory consultation, and <= 2 puffs of short-acting bagonist daily). results: the final study consisted of 1330 children in each cohort (mean age 9 years; 59% male). in the separate icsdlaba cohort, the odds of achieving overall asthma control were lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.91]; p =.001) compared with the fdc cohort. conclusion: the study demonstrates a small but significant benefit in achieving asthma control from an add-on laba as an fdc, compared with a separate inhaler and this supports current guideline recommendations.

cell_biology	the packaging of eukaryotic dna into nucleosomes, and the organisation of these nucleosomes into chromatin, plays a critical role in regulating all dna-associated processes. chromodomain helicase dna-binding protein 1 (chd1) is an atp-dependent chromatin remodelling protein that is conserved throughout eukaryotes and has an ability to assemble and organise nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo. this activity is involved in the regulation of transcription and is implicated in mammalian development and stem cell biology. chd1 is classically depicted as possessing a pair of tandem chromodomains that directly precede a core catalytic helicase-like domain that is then followed by a sant-slide dna-binding domain. here, we have identified an additional conserved domain c-terminal to the sant-slide domain and determined its structure by multidimensional heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy. we have termed this domain the chd1 helical c-terminal (chct) domain as it is comprised of five a-helices arranged in a variant helical bundle topology. chct has a conserved, positively charged surface and is able to bind dna and nucleosomes. in addition, we have identified another group of proteins, the as yet uncharacterised c17orf64 proteins, as also containing a conserved chct domain. our data provide new structural insights into the chd1 enzyme family.

enzymology	using a large-scale ""genomic enzymology"" approach, we (i) assigned novel atp-dependent four-carbon acid sugar kinase functions to members of the duf1537 protein family (domain of unknown function; pfam families pf07005 and pf17042) and (ii) discovered novel catabolic pathways for d-threonate, l-threonate, and d-erythronate. the experimentally determined ligand specificities of several solute binding proteins (sbps) for trap (tripartite atp-independent permease) transporters for four-carbon acids, including d-erythronate and l-erythronate, were used to constrain the substrates for the catabolic pathways that degrade the sbp ligands to intermediates in central carbon metabolism. sequence similarity networks and genome neighborhood networks were used to identify the enzyme components of the pathways. conserved genome neighborhoods encoded sbps as well as permease components of the trap transporters, members of the duf1537 family, and a member of the 4-hydroxy-l-threonine 4-phosphate dehydrogenase (pdxa) oxidative decarboxylase, class ii aldolase, or ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, large subunit (rubisco) superfamily. because the characterized substrates of members of the pdxa, class ii aldolase, and rubisco superfamilies are phosphorylated, we postulated that the members of the duf1537 family are novel atp-dependent kinases that participate in catabolic pathways for four-carbon acid sugars. we determined that (i) the duf1537/pdxa pair participates in a pathway for the conversion of d-threonate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and co2 and (ii) the duf1537/class ii aldolase pair participates in pathways for the conversion of d-erythronate and l-threonate (epimers at carbon-3) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and co2. the physiological importance of these pathways was demonstrated in vivo by phenotypic and genetic analyses.
molecular_biology	a powerful double-hairpin molecular beacon (dhmb) was developed for cancer-related kras gene detection based on the one-to-two stoichiometry. during target dna detection, dhmb can execute signal transduction even if no any exogenous element is involved. unlike the conventional molecular beacon based on the one-to-one interaction, one target dna not only hybridizes with one dhmb and opens its hairpin but also promotes the interaction between two dhmbs, causing the separation of two fluorophores from quenchers. this leads to an enhanced fluorescence signal. as a result, the target kras gene is able to be detected within a wide dynamic range from 0.05 to 200 nm with the detection limit of 50 pm, indicating a dramatic improvement compared with traditional molecular beacons. moreover, the point mutations existing in target dnas can be easily screened. the potential application for target species in real samples was indicated by the analysis of pcr amplicons of dnas from the dna extracted from sw620 cell. besides becoming a promising candidate probe for molecular biology research and clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases, the dhmb is expected to provide a significant insight into the design of dna probe-based homogenous sensing systems.
human_metabolism	the human population continues to grow exponentially in the fast developing and most populated countries, whereas in western europe it is getting older and older each year. this inevitably raises the demand for better and more efficient medical services without increasing the economic burden in the same proportion. to meet these requirements, improvement of medical diagnosis is certainly a key aspect to consider. therefore, we need powerful analytical methodologies able to go deeper and further in the characterization of human metabolism and identification of disease biomarkers and endogenous molecules in body fluids and tissues. the ultimate goal is to have a reliable and early medical diagnosis, mitigating the disease complications as much as possible. microextraction techniques (mets) represent a key step in these analytical methodologies by providing samples in the suitable volumes and purification levels necessary for the characterization of the target analytes. in this aspect, solid-phase microextraction (spme) and, more recently, microextraction by packed sorbent (meps), are powerful sample preparation techniques, characterized by their reduced time of analysis, low solvent consumption, and broad application. moreover, as miniaturized techniques, they can be easily automatized to have a high-throughput performance in the clinical environment. in this review, we explore some of the most interesting meps and spme applications, focusing on recent trends and applications to medical diagnostic, particularly the in vivo and near real time applications.
genetics	purpose of review to outline the roles of sr-b1 and pdzk1 in hepatic selective hdl cholesterol uptake and reverse cholesterol transport and the consequences for atherosclerosis development. recent findings much of our understanding of the physiological roles of sr-b1 and pdzk1 in hdl metabolism and atherosclerosis comes from studies of genetically manipulated mice. these show sr-b1 and pdzk1 play key roles in hdl metabolism and protection against atherosclerosis. the recent identification of rare loss of function mutations in the human scarb1 gene verifies that it plays similar roles in hdl metabolism in humans. other rare mutations in both the human scarb1 and pdzk1 genes remain to be characterized but may have potentially devastating consequences to sr-b1 function. summary identification of carriers of rare mutations in human scarb1 and pdzk1 that impair the function of their gene products and characterization of the effects of these mutations on hdl cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis will add to our understanding of the importance of hdl function and cholesterol flux, as opposed to hdl-cholesterol levels, per se, for protection against cardiovascular disease.
molecular_biology	background: hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna sequence data from thousands of samples are present in the public sequence databases. no publicly available, up-to-date, multiple sequence alignments, containing full-length and subgenomic fragments per genotype, are available. such alignments are useful in many analysis applications, including data-mining and phylogenetic analyses. results: by issuing a query, all hbv sequence data from the genbank public database was downloaded (67,893 sequences). full-length and subgenomic sequences, which were genotyped by the submitters (30,852 sequences), were placed into a multiple sequence alignment, for each genotype (genotype a: 5868 sequences, b: 4630, c: 7820, d: 8300, e: 2043, f: 985, g: 189, h: 108, i: 23), according to the results of offline blast searches against a custom reference library of full-length sequences. further curation was performed to improve the alignment. conclusions: the algorithm described in this paper generates, for each of the nine hbv genotypes, multiple sequence alignments, which contain full-length and subgenomic fragments. the alignments can be updated as new sequences become available in the online public sequence databases. the alignments are available at http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/alignments.
enzymology	a major challenge in enzymology is the need to correlate the dynamic properties of enzymes with, and understand the impact on, their catalytic cycles. this is especially the case with large, multicenter enzymes such as the nitric oxide synthases (noss), where the importance of dynamics has been inferred from a variety of structural, single-molecule, and ensemble spectroscopic approaches but where motions have not been correlated experimentally with mechanistic steps in the reaction cycle. here we take such an approach. using time-resolved spectroscopy employing absorbance and forster resonance energy transfer (fret) and exploiting the properties of a flavin analogue (5-deazaflavin mononucleotide (5-dfmn)) and isotopically labeled nicotinamide coenzymes, we correlate the timing of cam structural changes when bound to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnos) with the nnos catalytic cycle. we show that remodeling of cam occurs early in the electron transfer sequence (fad reduction), not at later points in the reaction cycle (e.g., fmn reduction). conformational changes are tightly correlated with fad reduction kinetics and reflect a transient ""opening"" and then ""closure"" of the bound cam molecule. we infer that displacement of the c-terminal tail on binding nadph and subsequent fad reduction are the likely triggers of conformational change. by combining the use of cofactor/coenzyme analogues and time resolved fret/absorbance spectrophotometry, we show how the reaction cycles of complex enzymes can be simplified, enabling a detailed study of the relationship between protein dynamics and reaction cycle chemistry-an approach that can also be used with other complex multicenter enzymes.
southern_blotting	background: oxidative stress (os) may be involved in the neurodegenerative process in alzheimer 's disease (ad). telomeres, the repeated sequences that cap chromosome ends, undergo shortening with each cell division, are sensitive to os, and serve as markers of a cell 's replicative history. telomere length shortening has been reported to relate to os with aging process and aging-associated diseases, but the telomeric changes were not always identical, especially in change of telomere length distribution and subtelomeric methylation. the involvement of an os-associated telomere change in the pathogenesis of ad has been discussed for decades, and the telomere length and telomerase activity were analyzed. however, other telomeric factors, such as the telomere distribution and subtelomeric methylation status, have not yet been analyzed. objective: the subtelomeric methylation status as well as the telomere length were studied in ad with an antioxidant vitamin in terms of os. methods: we measured urinary 8-iso-pgf2 alpha, a lipid-peroxidation product as an os marker, and methylated and non-methylated telomere lengths in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by southern blotting in ad patients before and after vitamin e treatment. results: the level of urinary 8-iso-pgf2 alpha was found to have increased in ad. middle-ranged telomeres (4.4-9.4 kb) increased and the shortest telomeres (<4.4 kb) decreased in ad patients. telomeres were more methylated in both long telomeres and in short telomeres in ad compared with the control. the oral administration of the antioxidant vitamin e in 400 mg/day for 6 months in ad patients partly reversed ad-associated alterations in os marker levels. conclusions: ad patients showed an elevated os marker level, and vitamin e lowered the os level. in comparison with controls, ad patients showed shorter telomere lengths. cells with short and long telomeres bore relatively hypermethylated subtelomeres in ad patients. aging-associated accumulation of cells bearing short telomeres was not observed in ad. these results imply that long telomeres with hypomethylation tend to shorten faster, and cells bearing short telomeres with hypomethylation tend to more easily enter into a senescent state under elevated os stress in ad. however, no significant effect on the altered telomeric profiles in ad patients could be detected after a 6-month administration of vitamin e. copyright (c) 2011 s. karger ag, basel
polymerase_chain_reaction	phenytoin, a voltage-gated sodium channel (na-v channel) antagonist, reportedly inhibits arginine vasopressin (avp) release from an isolated rat neurohypophysis. so far, it is uncertain whether phenytoin has a direct action on ectopic avp-producing neuroendocrine tumors. we studied the effect of phenytoin on the release of copeptin, the c-terminal fragment of pro-avp, and expression of avp gene in the human small cell lung cancer cell line lu-165. cells were maintained in rpmi1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were used within the fifth passage. copeptin was detected using a new sandwich immunoassay, and avp mrna levels were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. treatment with phenytoin at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml, but not at 5 or 10 mu g/ml, had an inhibitory effect on copeptin levels in the medium at 48 h. at the same concentration, avp mrna levels in lu-165 cells also decreased. although a sodium challenge with added sodium at 20 meq/l increased copeptin levels in the medium, a sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 and 20 meq/l had no effect on avp mrna levels. phenytoin at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml suppressed copeptin levels in the medium under the sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 and 20 meq/l. phenytoin at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml also decreased avp mrna levels in lu-165 cells under the sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 meq/l, but not at 20 meq/l. among five tested nav channel subunits, na-v 1.3 was highly expressed in lu-165 cells. however, phenytoin significantly decreased na-v 1.3 mrna levels under the sodium challenge with added sodium at 10 and 20 meq/l. these results suggest that lu-165 cells are sensitive to phenytoin and sodium to control of avp release and its gene expression. phenytoin might have a direct action on ectopic avp-producing tumors, suggesting the importance of nav channels in avp-producing neuroendocrine tumors.
southern_blotting	the aim of this study was to characterize and determine the inter-serovar exchange of ampc beta-lactamase conferring plasmids isolated from humans, pigs and the swine environment. plasmids isolated from a total of 21 antimicrobial resistant (amr) salmonella isolates representing human clinical cases (n = 6), pigs (n = 6) and the swine farm environment (n = 9) were characterized by replicon typing and restriction digestion, inter-serovar transferability by conjugation, and presence of ampc beta-lactamase enzyme encoding gene bla(cmy-2) by southern hybridization. based on replicon typing, the majority (17/21, 81%) of the plasmids belonged to the i1-i gamma inc group and were between 70 and 103 kb. the potential for inter-serovar plasmid transfer was further confirmed by the pcr detection of amr genes on the plasmids isolated from trans-conjugants. plasmids from salmonella serovars anatum, ouakam, johannesburg and typhimurium isolated from the same cohort of pigs and their environment and s. heidelberg from a single human clinical isolate had identical plasmids based on digestion with multiple restriction enzymes (ecori, hindiii and psti) and southern blotting. we demonstrated likely horizontal inter-serovar exchange of plasmid-encoding ampc beta-lactamases resistance among mdr salmonella serotypes isolated from pigs, swine farm environment and clinical human cases. this study provides valuable information on the role of the swine farm environment and by extension other livestock farm environments, as a potential reservoir of resistant bacterial strains that potentially transmit resistance determinants to livestock, in this case, swine, humans and possibly other hosts by horizontal exchange of plasmids.

molecular_biology	glycated hemoglobin (hb a(1c)) determination by multicapillary zone electrophoresis (mze) can additionally be used to detect hb a(2), hb f and most common hemoglobin (hb) variants. we assessed the effectiveness of this method for detecting -thalassemia (-thal), -thalassemia (-thal) and most common hb variants. moreover, hb f/hb a(2) is evaluated as an index for discriminating between - and -thal traits. the theoretical -thalassemia major (-tm) birth rate in our healthcare area is calculated and contrasted with real data. a mze technique was used for hb a(1c) measurements in 27,724 patients. previous criteria for carrier detection were established and subsequently confirmed by molecular biology techniques. positive predictive value (ppv) was 100.0%. the prevalence of -thal trait (including -thal) was 0.34%. the most prevalent mutations (estimated per 100,000 population) were hbb: c.118c>t (57.7%), hbb: c.93-21g>a (50.5%), hbb: c.92+1g>a (43.3%), hbb: c.92+6t>c (32.5%) and hbb: c.20dela (18.0%) for -thalassemias, and hb s (hbb: c.20a>t) (32.5%) and hb j-baltimore (hbb:c.3880t>a) (28.9%) for hb variants. we found a paradoxical result between the theoretical -tm birth rate and real data. we calculated an optimal hb f/hb a(2) index cutoff of 0.71 for discriminating between - and -thal traits. this method is highly cost-effective for detecting -thalassemias and common hb variants. prevalence results match previous data for the spanish population. heterogeneity of mutations in spain has markedly increased as a consequence of migration. the hb f/hb a(2) index cutoff could be used to predict -thal trait.
polymerase_chain_reaction	effective disease management of crops is crucial to sustain food security and safeguard potential losses in crop production that worth billions of dollars. the key to success in plant disease management is having the ability to detect the causal pathogen(s) early and accurately. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been a gold standard in nucleic acid-based diagnostics. apart from pcr, within the last decade, the development of a technique called ""loop-mediated isothermal amplification"" or lamp has facilitated the development of hundreds of simple assays for plant disease diagnostics. there are now more than 200 lamp publications per year, of which 20% identify plant disease pathogens. among them, lamp assays are available for pathogen detection of 50 plant viruses, 20 bacterial plant diseases, 7 fungal plant diseases and several phytoplasmas. here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of all lamp assays available for detecting plant diseases, including various detection chemistries used. we also discuss how to avoid pitfalls when developing lamp assays. finally, we offer perspectives of the applications of lamp in plant disease management, addressing the questions as to which extent the assays are helpful and whether they should be used outside the laboratory. this review will be a ""handbook"" for researchers developing lamp assays for plant disease diagnostics.
cell_biology	regenerative medicine strategies for the restoration of functional tissue have evolved from the concept of ex vivo creation of engineered tissue toward the broader concept of in vivo induction of functional tissue reconstruction. multidisciplinary approaches are being investigated to achieve this goal using evolutionarily conserved principles of stem cell biology, developmental biology and immunology, current methods of engineering and medicine. this evolution from ex vivo tissue engineering to the manipulation of fundamental in vivo tenets of development and regeneration has the potential to capitalize upon the incredibly complex and only partially understood ability of cells to adapt, proliferate, self-organize and differentiate into functional tissue.
polymerase_chain_reaction	objective:although increasing evidence has shown that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play an important regulatory role in pluripotency and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, little is known about the role of lncrna in maxillary sinus membrane stem cells (msmscs). the goal of this study was to investigate the expression profile and function of lncrnas on osteogenic differentiation of msmscs.materials and methods:by using lncrna microarray, we identify a novel osteogenesis differentiation-related lncrna of msmscs (lncrna-modr). the functional role of lncrna-modr in regulating osteogenesis was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and alizarin red staining. bioinformatic analyses of the predicted target genes (gene ontology, pathway, and network analysis) were applied for further study of lncrna-modr.results:we show that lncrna-modr is gradually upregulated during osteogenic differentiation. lncrna-modr overexpression upregulated, whereas lncrna-modr silencing decreased the expression of the osteogenic key marker, runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx2). in-depth analyses showed that lncrna-modr acts as a molecular sponge for microrna-454 (mir-454) and that prevents runx2 from mi-454-mediated suppression.conclusion:the lncrnas act as a competing endogenous rna to sequester microrna-454 (mir-454), leading to heightened runx2 expression and thus promotes osteogenesis of msmscs.
molecular_biology	objective: the objective of this study was to construct a recombinant vector expressing sirna targetedly inhibiting aquaporin 3 (aqp3), and to evaluate the effects of aqp3 inhibition on the proliferation and invasion of xwlc-05 human lung cancer cells. methods: we obtained human aqp3 sequence from the genbank and established the recombinant vector expressing sirna targeting aqp3. after the transfection of the recombinant vectors, the expression of aqp3 was determined by rt-pcr and western blot. the mts assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay were conducted to detect the proliferation, cell cycle process, apoptosis and invasion of xvvlc-05 cells. then the activity of metal matrix proteinase (mmp) 2 was determined by gelatin zymography. tumor formation in vivo experiments were also conducted in nude mice. results: rna interference (rnai) of aqp3 substantially suppressed the xwlc-05 cell proliferation and invasion, blocked the cell cycle progressing and promoted cell apoptosis. in addition, the activity of mmp2 was remarkably attenuated in rnai group. aqp3 rnai did not affect the tumor formation rate in nude mice but reduced the tumor growth. conclusion: the inhibition of aqp3 retarded the growth and invasiveness of xwlc-05 lung cancer cells and decreased the activity of mmp2.

immunology	background adenoid hypertrophy is one of the main causes of upper airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnoea (osa) in children. studies have shown that administration of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray significantly improved oxygen saturation in children with sleep-disordered breathing. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray on oxygen saturation measured through nocturnal pulse oximetry and quality of life in children with sleep-disordered breathing due to adenoid hypertrophy. materials and methods eighty children suspected of having sleep-disordered breathing due to adenoid hypertrophy, whose parents were not willing for surgery (adenoidectomy) were enrolled in a non-controlled clinical trial. quality of life questionnaire was distributed pre-and post-interventional and the symptoms were scored depending on its frequency of occurrence. pre-and post-intervention x-ray nasopharynx taken. pre-and post-intervention nocturnal oxygen saturation monitoring was done and oxygen desaturation index (odi) as well as desaturation events were recorded. data was analysed using paired student t-test and wilcoxon 's signed rank tests. results out of the 80 study population, 43 were males (53.8 %) and 37 were females (46.2%). age distribution of the population ranged from 3 to 10 years with a mean age of 6.2 years. the study showed a strong positive correlation between grade of adenoid size and odi (r -0.790; p < 0.001). all the pulse oximetric parameters improved significantly after drug administration (p < 0.001). there was a significant improvement in the quality of life of these children after the treatment. conclusion the study revealed mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray therapy leads to significant reduction in adenoid size and gives symptomatic relief for children with sleep disordered breathing. it can be recommended as the prime medical treatment modality for children with sleep disordered breathing, as it substantially reduced the morbidity and health care utilisation by these children.
enzymology	the composting of organic material is dependent on microbial activity. however, the dynamics of the microbial community during the composting process remain obscure. here, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rdna amplicons in a chicken manure-based compost was applied to characterize the components of the microbial community during the composting process. in addition, the activity of key microbial enzymes was monitored. arcobacter spp. and marinospirillum spp. were the dominant species prior to composting, whereas thermotogae spp. became more strongly represented as the composting process proceeded. bacillus and cohnella spp. were featured at various phases. correlation analysis showed that the diversity of the microbial community was positively correlated with the compost ph, its total nitrogen level, its carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and the activity of protease, and negatively correlated with its organic carbon content and seed germination indices.

enzymology	a short, robust, and expedient synthesis of various aryl alpha-l-arabinofuranosides using a trichloroacetimidate precursor is described. the procedure is compatible with a range of phenols with varying pka values and may be amenable for preparing a wide range of other glycosides.
human_metabolism	we discuss a human metabolism system using the theory of stochastic differential equations (sdes) with reflecting boundary conditions. we investigate the distribution of the process determined by the sdes. the relation between the deterministic model introduced by nordberg and kjellstrom and our stochastic model is considered. numerical computations are also given.
southern_blotting	glutathione peroxidase (gpx) and glutathione reductase (gr) are key enzymes in the antioxidant defense systems of living organisms and protect organisms from environmental stresses. to investigate the mechanism of resistance to heat stress in the red alga gracilaria lemaneiformis, the cdna sequences encoding glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase of two strains (wild type and heat-tolerant cultivar 981) of g. lemaneiformis were successfully cloned using reverse transcription pcr and rapid amplification cdna ends techniques. cdna encoding gpx has 930 nucleotides with an open reading frame (orf) of 750 nucleotides, encoding 249 amino acid residues. cdna encoding gr was 1,572 nucleotides with a 1,416-nucleotide orf encoding 471 amino acids. no introns existed in genomic dna of gpx and gr of g. lemaneiformis. southern blotting indicated that there was only one copy of gpx and gr in both strains. under heat stress, bioactivity and mrna transcription levels of both gpx and gr were upregulated in cultivar 981 compared to those in the wild type. these results indicate that both gpx and gr may play important roles in the ability of g. lemaneiformis to resist high temperatures.
cell_biology	polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) are vital for normal growth and development and physiological function of various tissues in humans. pufas have immunomodulatory actions in addition to their ability to modulate inflammation, vascular reactivity, neurotransmission and stem cell biology. pufas and their metabolites possess both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that underlie their actions and involvement in several diseases. aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), possesses both cyclo-oxygenase (cox) and lipoxygenase (lox) inhibitory action and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory lipoxin a4 {(called as epi-lipoxin a4, aspirin-triggered lipoxins (atls))}. in addition, at low doses aspirin may not interfere with the production of prostacyclin (pgi2). both lipoxin a4 and pgi2 have vasodilator, platelet anti-aggregator and anti-inflammatory actions that may underlie the beneficial actions of aspirin. paradoxically, other nsaids may not have the same actions as that of aspirin on pufa metabolism. similar anti-inflammatory compounds are formed from eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) by the action of aspirin termed as resolvins (from epa and dha) and protectins and maresins from dha. pufas: arachidonic acid (aa), epa and dha and their various products modulate not only inflammation and immune response but also possess actions on various genes, nuclear factors, cyclic amp and gmp, g-protein coupled receptors (gprs), hypothalamic neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines and enzymes, and interact with nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide to regulate their formation and action and to form new compounds that have several biological actions. these pleiotropic actions of pufas and their metabolites may explain their ability to play a role in several physiological actions and diseases. the big challenge is to harness these actions to prevent and manage clinical conditions.

cell_biology	lysosomal storage disorders (lsds) are inherited diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and often showing a neurodegenerative course. there is no cure to treat the central nervous system in lsds. moreover, the mechanisms driving neuronal degeneration in these pathological conditions remain largely unknown. by studying mouse models of lsds, we found that neurodegeneration develops progressively with profound alterations in presynaptic structure and function. in these models, impaired lysosomal activity causes massive perikaryal accumulation of insoluble -synuclein and increased proteasomal degradation of cysteine string protein (csp). as a result, the availability of both -synuclein and csp at nerve terminals strongly decreases, thus inhibiting soluble nsf attachment receptor (snare) complex assembly and synaptic vesicle recycling. aberrant presynaptic snare phenotype is recapitulated in mice with genetic ablation of one allele of both csp and -synuclein. the overexpression of csp in the brain of a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type iiia, a severe form of lsd, efficiently re-established snare complex assembly, thereby ameliorating presynaptic function, attenuating neurodegenerative signs, and prolonging survival. our data show that neurodegenerative processes associated with lysosomal dysfunction may be presynaptically initiated by a concomitant reduction in -synuclein and csp levels at nerve terminals. they also demonstrate that neurodegeneration in lsds can be slowed down by re-establishing presynaptic functions, thus identifying synapse maintenance as a novel potentially druggable target for brain treatment in lsds.
molecular_biology	avian paramyxoviruses (apmvs) have been reported from a wide variety of avian species around the world. avian paramyxoviruses are economically significant because of the huge mortality and morbidity associated with it. twelve different serotypes of apmv have been reported till date. avian paramyxoviruses belong to the family paramyxoviridae under genus avulavirus. newcastle disease virus (apmv-1) is the most characterized members among the apmv serotypes. complete genome sequence of all twelve apmv serotypes has been published recently. in recent years, apmv-1 has attracted the virologists for its oncolytic activity and its use as a vaccine vector for both animals and humans. the recombinant apmv-based vaccine offers a pertinent choice for the construction of live attenuated vaccine due to its minimum recombination frequency, modular nature of transcription and lack of dna phase during its replication. although insufficient data are available regarding other apmv serotypes, our understanding about the apmv biology is expanding rapidly because of the availability of modern molecular biology tools and high-throughput complete genome sequencing.
molecular_biology	electrochemical monitoring-on-chip (e-moc)-based approach for rapid assessment of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infection in the presence of cocaine (coc) and specific drugs namely i.e., tenofovir (tef), rimcazole (ra) is demonstrated here, for the first time, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis). an in-vitro primary human astrocytes (ha) model was developed using a cultureware chip (cc, used for e-moc) for hiv-infection, coc exposure and treatment with anti-hiv drug i.e., tef, and coc antagonist i.e., ra. the charge transfer resistance (r-ct) value of each cc well varies with respect to infection and treatment demonstrated highly responsive sensitivity of developed chip. the results of e-moc, a proof-of-the concept, suggested that hiv-infection progression due to coc ingestion and therapeutic effects of highly specific drugs are measurable on the basis of cell electrophysiology. though, this work needs various molecular biology-based optimizations to promote this technology as an analytical tool for the rapid assessment of hiv-infection in a patient to manage hiv diseases for timely diagnosis. the presented study is based on using cns cells and efforts are being made to perform this method using peripheral cells such as monocytes derived dendritic cells.

human_metabolism	the high resolution, accurate mass, and fast scanning features of the orbitrap(tm) mass spectrometer, combined with the separation power of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography were applied for the first time to study the metabolic profiles of several organic flame retardants (frs) present in indoor dust. to mimic real-life exposure, in vitro cultured hepg2 human hepatocyte cell lines were exposed simultaneously to various frs in an indoor dust extract for 24 h. target parent frs, hexabromocyclododecanes (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hbcds), tris-2-chloroethyl phosphate (tcep), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (tcipp), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (tdcipp), were separated in a single run for the first time using alternating positive and negative heated esi source. further metabolite separation and identification was achieved using full scan (70,000 full width at half maximum (fwhm)), accurate mass (up to 1 ppm) spectrometry. structural confirmation was performed via all ion fragmentation (aif) spectra using the optional higher collisional dissociation (hcd) cell and ms/ms analysis. first insights into human metabolism of hbcds revealed several hydroxylated and debrominated phase i metabolites, in addition to conjugated phase ii glucuronides. furthermore, various hydroxylated, oxidized, and conjugated metabolites of chlorinated phosphorous frs were identified, leading to the suggestion of alpha-oxidation as a significant metabolic pathway for these compounds.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the present study was designed to investigate the relationship among epigenetic changes in wnt antagonists, histone h4k20mel and the expression of tumor-suppressor genes in acute leukemia (al) to better understand the pathogenesis of leukemia. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) was performed to detect messenger rna (mrna) expression levels of wnt antagonists (wnt5a, hdpr1, dkk1 and dkk3) in patients with al and in normal controls; pyrophosphate sequencing was performed to detect the methylation status of the wnt5a promoter; and western blotting was performed to detect the overall expression levels of wnt5a protein and histone h4k20mel in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and in normal controls. the relationship between wnt5a protein expression and histone h4k20mel was analyzed. chromatin immunoprecipitation-qpcr (chip-qpcr) was performed to investigate the recruitment of h4k20mel and set8 to the wnt5a promoter and coding regions. our results demonstrated that the expression levels of wnt antagonists were generally low in aml, but showed differential expression in acute lymphocytic leukemia (all). in most cases of aml, methylation of the wnt5a promoter was observed and wnt5a protein expression was low. in some cases of aml, the overall level of h4k20mel protein was higher than that in normal controls. in addition, wnt5a expression was positively correlated with h4k20mel expression and was unrelated to the methylation status of its promoter. moreover, h4k20mel and set8 were enriched in the wnt5a promoter region and coding region. by contrast, wnt5a expression was unrelated to h4k20mel expression in normal controls. moreover, we observed that the methylation of wnt antagonists was often found in patients with al, particularly those with aml, whereas the extent of methylation was variable in all patients. wnt5a expression was positively correlated with the enrichment of h4k20mel and set8 at the wnt5a promoter and coding regions. h4k20mel increased wnt5a expression by promoting transcription initiation and elongation.
human_metabolism	this article we discuss the categories work, politics, education and human emancipation in marx and lukacs. as from the work category, we will seek to understand the policy, training and human emancipation as foundations necessary to the formation of social being. starting from the ontological leap produced by work category, historically-checks the implementation of the conditions and possibilities for the development of other fundamental complex to the formation of social being. through the removal of natural barriers, lukacs, in the wake of marx, demonstrates how the double transformation mediated by work in the human metabolism with nature, occurs in the training materials / social / historical human, becoming the basis of all its social praxis therefore their emancipation. we will also discuss about ""antisocial character"" private property and the state, therefore the policy to uncover the origin of social problems and its essence. politics is, according to marx, one half activity, historically dated and instrumental. it 's something that has to be overcome. this conception of politics, and the state, rejects the understanding that it is a dimension of human and social permanently and structurally.
molecular_biology	porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) causes acute enteric disease and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. previously we have demonstrated that pdcov infection suppresses the production of interferon-beta (ifn-beta), while the detailed mechanisms are poorly understood. here, we demonstrate that nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) of pdcov, the 3c-like protease, significantly inhibits sendai virus (sev)-induced ifn-beta production by targeting the nf-kappa b essential modulator (nemo), confirmed by the diminished function of nemo cleaved by pdcov. the pdcov nsp5 cleavage site in the nemo protein was identified as glutamine 231, and was identical to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nsp5 cleavage site, revealing the likelihood of a common target in nemo for coronaviruses. furthermore, this cleavage impaired the ability of nemo to activate the ifn response and downstream signaling. taken together, our findings reveal pdcov nsp5 to be a newly identified ifn antagonist and enhance the understanding of immune evasion by deltacoronaviruses.
molecular_biology	prostate cancer is the most common cancer of men in the uk and accounts for a quarter of all new cases. although treatment of localised cancer can be successful, there is no cure for patients presenting with invasive prostate cancer and there are less treatment options. they are generally treated with androgen ablation therapies but eventually the tumours become hormone resistant and patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc) for which there are no further successful or curative treatments. this highlights the need for new treatment strategies. in order to prevent prostate cancer recurrence and treatment resistance, all the cell populations in a heterogeneous prostate tumour must be targeted, including the rare cancer stem cell (csc) population. the ets transcription factor family members are now recognised as a common feature in multiple cancers including prostate cancer; with aberrant expression, loss of tumour suppressor function, inactivating mutations and the formation of fusion genes observed. most notably, the tmprss2-erg gene fusion is present in approximately 50% of prostate cancers and in prostate cscs. however, the role of other ets transcription factors in prostate cancer is less well understood. this review will describe the prostate epithelial cell hierarchy and discuss the evidence behind prostate cscs and their inherent resistance to conventional cancer therapies. the known and proposed roles of the ets family of transcription factors in prostate epithelial cell differentiation and regulation of the csc phenotype will be discussed, as well as how they might be targeted for therapy.

enzymology	cofactor-free oxidases and oxygenases promote and control the reactivity of o-2 with limited chemical tools at their disposal. their mechanism of action is not completely understood and structural information is not available for any of the reaction intermediates. near-atomic resolution crystallography supported by incrystallo raman spectroscopy and qm/mm calculations showed unambiguously that the archetypical cofactor-free uricase catalyzes uric acid degradation via a c5(s)-(hydro)peroxide intermediate. low x-ray doses break specifically the intermediate c5oo(h) bond at 100k, thus releasing o-2 insitu, which is trapped above the substrate radical. the dose-dependent rate of bond rupture followed by combined crystallographic and raman analysis indicates that ionizing radiation kick-starts both peroxide decomposition and its regeneration. peroxidation can be explained by a mechanism in which the substrate radical recombines with superoxide transiently produced in the active site.
human_metabolism	tilapia are generally known to be warm water fish widely distributed across the tropics. in particular, the maternal mouth brooding tilapia of the genera saroterodon and oreochromis have successfully adapted to a wide range of water bodies because of their plastic feeding habits and wide tolerance to varying environmental conditions (trewavas 1982). the nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus occurs in almost all rivers and lakes of ethiopia. it is the most important commercial fish, constituting over 60% of the commercial catch of the capture fishery in the country (reyntjens & wudineh 1998). investigations on the fatty acid composition and lipid quality of fishes have been well documented mainly from marine and freshwater systems of the temperate regions (puustinen et al. 1985, ahlgren et al. 1994, 1996). most studies can be broadly examined either from an ecological point of view or in relation to human health. from the medical point of view, two of the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa), eicosapentaenoic acid (epa, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha, 22:6 omega 3) common in fish and fish oil have several biochemical effects on human metabolism. fish oil rich in epa and dha can lower blood lipid and reduce the risk of getting coronary heart disease (mediorus et al. 2007). from an ecological view point, it is important to know the origin of these important pufa in fish and other animals at higher trophic levels. information on the transfer of fatty acids from the lower trophic levels beginning from the phyto-plankton can be obtained by quantifying the levels of important fatty acids across the food chain. these fatty acids can serve as biomarkers to elucidate the transfer and conversion of individual fatty acids (napolitano 1999). marine fish have been reported to have higher pufa content than their freshwater counterparts (napolitano 1999); however, ahlgren et al. (1994) and references therein think that the difference between marine and freshwater fish is related to other factors, such as feeding and type of fish, rather than the difference in salinity. in our earlier work we also found that tropical fish can be equally important to temperate fish in terms of pufa content (zenebe et al. 1998a). data on the fatty acid content of tropical fish are scarce and are mostly limited to fish from south america (clement & lovell 1994, andrade et al. 1995). in our earlier study we reported the fatty acid composition of o. niloticus collected from the rift valley lakes located at lower altitudes (zenebe et al. 1998a, 1998b). in this study i report the fatty acid composition of the same fish taken mainly from the highland lakes located outside the rift system of ethiopia. this information will provide broad comparisons and more comprehensive data on the fatty acid contents of o. niloticus collected from the wild in ethiopian lakes
polymerase_chain_reaction	background: the effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. this study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting. results: pedv rna was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (inf) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr). virus shedding in inf pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral rna levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (lb) became pedv positive after the first movement of study personnel from the inf group. however, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (mb) and high biosecurity (hb) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. viral rna was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (ppe) of lb personnel. in addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from mb personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. all swabs of fomite from the hb study personnel were negative. conclusions: these results indicate that indirect pedv transmission through contaminated ppe occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. biosecurity procedures such as changing ppe, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of pedv transmission between groups of pigs.
genetics	intimate partner violence (ipv) is a major health concern in the united states (acog 2013). the world health organization (who) describes ipv as any physical, sexual, psychological harm by a current or former intimate partner (who 2016). due to the psychosocial depth and nature of discussions within genetic counseling sessions, patients may disclose and/or discuss ipv as it relates to sexual well-being, reproductive and overall health. this study aims to assess the role for ipv screening, counseling and intervention in genetic counseling practice by investigating the incidence, experiences and attitudes about ipv among genetic counseling patients. patients receiving genetic counseling at an urban metropolitan hospital were anonymously surveyed about experiences and perspectives on ipv as a topic of discussion during genetic counseling sessions. among 60 eligible patients, 50 completed the survey (49 females, 1 male, of which, 5 identified as lgbt) ages 20 to 66. the incidence of ipv in this group was 16.0 % (n = 8). majority of participants had never been asked about ipv by a healthcare provider (n = 32; 64.0%), would have felt comfortable answering questions about ipv by their healthcare provider (n = 34; 68.0%), and would have felt comfortable answering questions about ipv by their genetic counselor (n = 39; 78.0%). perspectives from all participants, notably those with ipv history, provided insights to the role of genetic counselors in areas for ipv screening and counseling training.
polymerase_chain_reaction	numerous patients with anorectal malformations (arms) continue to experience fecal incontinence and constipation following surgical procedures. one of the most important factors that influences defecation is the striated muscle complex (smc). wnt signaling regulates the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, which serve an important role in muscle development. therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of wnt3a protein (by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis) and mrna [by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr)] in the smc of arm model rats that were exposed to ethylenethiourea. immunostaining revealed that the expression of wnt3a exhibits space-and time-dependent changes in the developing smc of arm model rat embryos. immunohistochemistry demonstrated that on embryonic day 17 (e17), wnt3a-positive cells were observed in the smc in normal embryos, and expression levels gradually increased as the rat embryos developed. similar changes in wnt3a protein expression were detected in arm model rat embryos; however, the expression of wnt3a was significantly reduced compared with the normal rat embryos. western blotting and rt-qpcr also revealed lower expression levels of wnt3a protein and mrna, respectively, in the smc of arms model rat embryos compared with normal rat embryos. these data revealed that the expression of wnt3a in arm embryos was notably reduced, indicating a potential role for wnt3a in the maldevelopment of the smc in patients with arms.
human_metabolism	purpose of review galactose - a key source of energy and a crucial structural element in complex molecules - is particularly important for early human development. however, galactose metabolism might be important not only for fetal and neonatal development but also for adulthood, as evidenced by the inherited disorders of galactose metabolism. the purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence of galactose metabolism in health and disease. recent findings the biological importance of galactose goes beyond its importance as a nutrient and a metabolite. galactose has been selected by evolutionary pressure to exert also a crucial structural role in macromolecules. additionally, galactose has recently been reported as beneficial in a number of diseases, particularly in those affecting the brain. summary galactose is crucial for human metabolism, with an established role in energy delivery and galactosylation of complex molecules, and evidence for other roles is emerging.
southern_blotting	background: expansion of gaa trinucleotide repeats is the molecular basis of friedreich 's ataxia (frda). precise detection of the gaa expansion repeat in frataxin gene has always been a challenge. different molecular methods have been suggested for detection of gaa expansion, including; short-pcr, long-pcr, triplet repeat primed-pcr (tp-pcr) and southern blotting. the aim of study was to evaluate two pcr-based methods, tp-pcr and long-pcr, and to explore the use of tp-pcr accompanying with long-pcr for accurate genotyping of frda patients. methods: blood samples were collected from six iranian patients suspected to frda, who referred to the department of medical genetics at tehran university of medical sciences during the year 2014. for one of these patients' four asymptomatic members of the family were also recruited for the analysis. dna extraction was performed by two different methods. tp-pcr and long-pcr were carried out in all samples. the type of this study is assessment / investigation of methods. results: using a combination of the above methods, the genotypes of all samples were confirmed as five homozygous mutants (expanded gaa repeats), two heterozygous and three homozygous normal (normal repeat size). the results obtained by tp-pcr are consistent with long-pcr results. conclusion: the presence or absence of expanded alleles can be identified correctly by tp-pcr. performing long-pcr and fluorescent-long-pcr enables accurate genotyping in all samples. this approach is highly reliable. it could be successfully used for detection of gaa expansion repeats.
human_metabolism	there are several ways to detect proteins on cells. one quite frequently used method is flow cytometry. this method needs fluorescently labeled antibodies that can attach selectively to the protein to be investigated for flow cytometric detection. flow cytometry scans individual cells, virtually without their surrounding liquid, and can scan many cells in a very short time. because of this advantage of flow cytometry, it was adapted to investigate transport proteins on normal and cancerous human cells and cell lines. these transport proteins play important roles in human metabolism. absorption in the intestine, excretion at the kidney, protection of the cns compartment and the fetus from xenobiotics, and other vital functions depend on these transporters. however, several transporters are overexpressed in cancer cells. these overexpressed transporters pump out anticancer drugs from the cells and prevent their curative effects. the detection and quantitation of these types of transporters in cancer cells is important for this reason. here, we review literature on flow cytometric detection of the three most studied transporters: p-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein.
enzymology	the membrane-anchored myelin enzyme 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (cnpase) was discovered in the early 1960s and has since then troubled scientists with its peculiar catalytic activity and high expression levels in the central nervous system. despite decades of research, the actual physiological relevance of cnpase has only recently begun to unravel. in addition to a role in myelination, cnpase is also involved in local adenosine production in traumatic brain injury and possibly has a regulatory function in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. although research focusing on the cnpase phosphodiesterase activity has been helpful, several open questions concerning the protein function in vivo remain unanswered. this review is focused on past research on cnpase, especially in the fields of structural biology and enzymology, and outlines the current understanding regarding the biochemical and physiological significance of cnpase, providing ideas and directions for future research.
molecular_biology	we report a danio rerio transposon named drtrt, for d. rerio transposon related to tc1. the complete sequence of the drtrt transposon is 1,563 base pairs (bp) in length, and its transposase putatively encodes a 338-amino acid protein that harbors a dd37e motif in its catalytic domain. we present evidence based on searches of publicly available genomes that trt elements commonly occur in vertebrates and protozoa. phylogenetic and functional domain comparisons confirm that trt constitutes a new subfamily within the tc1 family. hallmark features of having no premature termination codons within the transposase, the presence of all expected functional domains, and its occurrence in the bony fish transcriptome suggest that trt might have current or recent activity in these species. further analysis showed that the activity of trt elements in these species might have arisen about between 4 and 19 ma. interestingly, our results also implied that the widespread distribution of trt among fishes, frog, and snakes is the result of multiple independent ht events, probably from bony fishes to snakes or frog. finally, the mechanisms underlying horizontal transfer of trt elements are discussed.
molecular_biology	the objective of the present study was to characterize the pattern of gene expression at the last stage of ovarian maturation in chlamys farreri. dynamic transcriptomic analysis of ovaries was performed at four time points prior to ovulation, using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform. a total of 174,928 unigenes were obtained, among which 42,534 were annotated according to bioinformatics databases, such as nt, nr, swiss-prot, kog, go, and kegg. results from the transcriptome analysis revealed a time-dependent pattern of global transcriptional responses. when compared to the 0 d library, 99, 152, and 3248 differently expressed genes (degs) were obtained in the 3, 10, and 21 d libraries, respectively. those three libraries shared only 10 degs, the majority of which were time-specific. pairwise comparisons of each profile demonstrated that degs were related to hormone metabolism and receptors, cell division, gametogenesis, and vitellogenesis pathways. notably, when adjacent sampling time point groups were compared, the only deg throughout the experimental period was related to the g protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. the present study provides the first dynamic transcriptomic analysis of c. farreri for evaluation of the molecular basis of gonadal maturation.

immunology	alzheimer 's disease patients display neuropathological lesions, including the accumulation of amyloid-beta (a beta) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles. although the mechanisms causing the neurodegenerative process are largely unknown, increasing evidence highlights a critical role of immunity in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease. in the present study, we investigated the role of regulatory t cells (tregs) on alzheimer 's disease progression. first, we explored the effect of tregs (cd4(+)cd25(+) t cells) and teffs (cd4(+)cd25(-) t cells) in an adoptive transfer model. systemic transplantation of purified tregs into 3xtg-ad mice improved cognitive function and reduced deposition of a beta plaques. in contrast, adoptive transfer of teffs diminished behavioral function and cytokine production. next, we transiently depleted treg population using an anti-cd25 antibody (pc61). depletion of tregs for four months resulted in a marked aggravation of the spatial learning deficits of six-month-old 3xtg-ad mice. additionally, it resulted in decreasing glucose metabolism, as assessed by positron emission tomography (pet) with f-18-2 fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([f-18] fdg) neuroimaging. importantly, the deposition of a beta plaques and microglia/macrophage was increased in the hippocampal ca1 and ca3 regions of the treg depleted 3xtg-ad compared to the vehicle-treated 3xtg-ad group. our finding suggested that systemic treg administration ameliorates disease progression and could be an effective alzheimer 's disease treatment.
cell_biology	background: in periodontal therapy enamel matrix derivative (emd) has been successfully used for tissue regeneration by altering activity of various cells involved in periodontal regeneration. studies have focused primarily on clinical parameters and outcome. effects of emd on oral epithelial cells are of crucial importance in order to understand the biology of regeneration. aims of this study are to investigate proliferative and cytotoxic effects of emd on oral epithelial cells and their possible influences on epithelial barrier function. methods: scc-25 cells, a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, and primary keratinocytes were either treated with emd dissolved in culture medium or added to wells/inserts precoated with emd. cells were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 hours. proliferation rate was analyzed measuring the 5bromo-2'-deoxyuridine nucleotide uptake. cytotoxic effects of emd treatment were sampled by lactate dehydrogenase release. alterations of the epithelial barrier function induced by emd were investigated by analysis of transepithelial electrical resistance (ter). results: statistically significant inhibitory effects of both malignant and primary cell proliferation could be demonstrated by precoating culture plate wells with emd. no cytotoxic effects caused by emd were detected. precoating of inserts with emd induced a significant increase of ter and barrier function. conclusions: this investigation compares applying emd in solution to cells with precoating of wells with emd. when precoating of wells was used solely, inhibition of cell proliferation was evident. precoating may represent more suitable clinical usage. furthermore, prelayering emd induced an increase of ter of primary cells. these results suggest emd may enhance barrier function.
immunology	complement is the major humoral component of the innate immune system. it recognizes pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, and initiates the immune response in coordination with innate and adaptive immunity. when activated, the complement system unleashes powerful cytotoxic and inflammatory mechanisms, and thus its tight control is crucial to prevent damage to host tissues and allow restoration of immune homeostasis. factor h is the major soluble inhibitor of complement, where its binding to self markers (i.e., particular glycan structures) prevents complement activation and amplification on host surfaces. not surprisingly, mutations and polymorphisms that affect recognition of self by factor h are associated with diseases of complement dysregulation, such as age-related macular degeneration and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome. in addition, pathogens (i.e., non-self) and cancer cells (i.e., altered-self) can hijack factor h to evade the immune response. here we review recent (and not so recent) literature on the structure and function of factor h, including the emerging roles of this protein in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases and cancer.
northern_blotting	this protocol describes how to perform northern blot analyses to detect micrornas and their precursors with single-nucleotide resolution, which is crucial for analyzing individual length variants and for evaluating relative quantities of unique micrornas in cells. northern blot analysis consists of resolving rnas by gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring and fixing to nylon membranes as well as detecting by hybridization with radioactive probes. earlier efforts to improve this method focused mainly on altering the sensitivity of short rna detection. we have enhanced the resolution of the northern blot technique by optimizing the electrophoresis step. we have also investigated other steps of the procedure with the goal of enhancing the resolution of rnas; herein, we present several recommendations to do so. our protocol is applicable to analyses of all kinds of endogenous and exogenous rnas, falling within length ranges of 20-30 and 50-70 nt, corresponding to microrna and pre-microrna lengths, respectively.
immunology	increasing evidence suggests that regular physical exercise suppresses chronic inflammation. however, the potential inhibitory effects of swimming on dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced chronic colitis, and its underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. in this study, rats were orally administered dss to induce chronic colitis, and subsequently treated with or without swimming exercise. a 7-week swimming program (1 or 1.5 hours per day, 5 days per week) ameliorated dss-caused colon shortening, colon barrier disruption, spleen enlargement, serum ldh release, and reduction of body weight gain. swimming for 1.5 hours per day afforded greater protection than 1 hour per day. swimming ameliorated dss-induced decrease in crypt depth, and increases in myeloperoxidase activity, infiltration of ly6g(+) neutrophils and tnf-alpha- and ifn-gamma-expressing cd3(+) t cells, as well as fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin. swimming inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and decreased the protein expression of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa b p65 and cyclooxygenase 2, whereas it elevated interleukin-10 levels. swimming impeded the generation of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide; however, it boosted glutathione levels, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. additionally, swimming decreased caspase-3 activity and expression of apoptosis-inducing factor, cytochrome c, bax, and cleaved-caspase- 3, but increased bcl-2 levels. overall, these results suggest that swimming exerts beneficial effects on dss-induced chronic colitis by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.
human_metabolism	one hundred and eighty eight volatile organic compounds (vocs) were identified from dust emission, dust headspace, and in air sampling in a residence by sampling on tenax ta followed by thermal desorption and hrgc/ms. of these, 83 compounds were found in dust headspace. aliphatic aldehydes (c4-8) and octane were major contributors to headspace gas chromatograms while the total ion current response for desorbed vocs (120-degrees-c) was dominated by n-alkanes (c7-16), n- and branched alkanals (c4-10) and alkanoic acids (c2-c14). many of the identified vocs could be products of microbial or human metabolism. dust volatiles resulting from desorption were compared to dust headspace voc analyses and found to be comparable considering the temperature difference. a method for determination of total voc (tvoc-dust) emission at 120-degrees-c, was developed. variation in desorption tvoc analyses was mainly due to sample heterogeneity.
cell_biology	the cell lineage tracing system has been used predominantly in developmental biology studies. the use of cre recombinase allows for the activation of the reporter in a specific cell line and all progeny. here, we used the cell lineage tracing technique to demonstrate that chondrocytes directly transform into osteoblasts and osteocytes during long bone and mandibular condyle development using two kinds of cre, col10a1-cre and aggrecan-cre(ert2) (agg-cre(ert2)), crossed with rosa26(tdtomato). both col10 and aggrecan are well-recognized markers for chondrocytes. on this basis, we developed a new method-cell lineage tracing in conjunction with fluorescent immunohistochemistry-to define cell fate by analyzing the expression of specific cell markers. runx2 (a marker for early-stage osteogenic cells) and dentin matrix protein1 (dmp1; a marker for late-stage osteogenic cells) were used to identify chondrocyte-derived bone cells and their differentiation status. this combination not only broadens the application of cell lineage tracing, but also simplifies the generation of compound mice. more importantly, the number, location, and differentiation statuses of parent cell progeny are displayed simultaneously, providing more information than cell lineage tracing alone. in conclusion, the co-application of cell lineage tracing techniques and immunofluorescence is a powerful tool for investigating cell biology in vivo.
northern_blotting	embryo implantation is a complex initial step in establishment of a successful pregnancy. many mrnas have been shown to be differentially expressed in the rat uterus during embryo implantation. however, the expression profiles of micrornas (mirnas), a key post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases are still unknown. here, an mirna microarray was used to examine differential expression of mirnas in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases. twenty-eight mirnas were up-regulated and 29 mirnas were down-regulated at least twofold during the receptive phase in rat uterus; these results were confirmed by northern blotting. mir-29a was only highly expressed in rat uterus during the implantation period, and activation of delayed implantation and artificial decidualization enhanced the mir-29a level. further investigation revealed that both the pro-apoptotic factor genes bak1 and bmf and the anti-apoptotic factor gene bcl-w are targets of mir-29a. there was weak binding between mir-29a and the 3 utr of the anti-apoptotic factor gene mcl1. over-expression of mir-29a inhibited the late apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells, which may be due to the stronger binding capacity between mir-29a and the 3 utr of pro-apoptotic factors than that between mir-29a and the 3 utr of anti-apoptotic factors. collectively, mir-29a plays an important role during embryo implantation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. mir-29a may predominantly bind pro-apoptotic factors, leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis.
enzymology	valproic acid (vpa) is a simple branched medium-chain fatty acid with expanding therapeutic applications beyond its prime anticonvulsant properties. aims: (1) to resolve the underlying basis for the interference of valproate with the isoleucine degradative pathway and (2) to shed new light on the enzymology of the beta-oxidation pathway of valproate. methods: urine organic acids were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. in vitro studies were performed with heterologously expressed human 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase (mhbd) and fibroblasts from controls and a patient with mhbd deficiency using 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa and 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa as substrates. the respective enzymatic activities were measured using optimized hplc procedures. short-chain enoyl-coa hydratase (echs1) immunoprecipitation in a human liver homogenate was performed and hydratase activity was measured in the supernatants by hplc, using crotonyl-coa and delta(2(e))-valproyl-coa as substrates. results: patients on valproate therapy had a moderately increased urinary excretion of the isoleucine metabolite 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid. mhbd was found to convert 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa into 3-ketovalproyl-coa. mhbd activity in control fibroblasts was comparable using both 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa and 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa as substrates. in fibroblasts of a patient with mhbd deficiency, there was no detectable mhbd activity when 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa was used as substrate. samples with immunoprecipitated crotonase had no detectable hydratase activity using both crotonyl-coa and delta(2(e))-valproyl-coa as substrates. discussion: this work demonstrates for the first time, that mhbd is the unique enzyme responsible for the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyvalproyl-coa. furthermore, we show that crotonase is the major, if not the single hydratase involved in vpa beta-oxidation, next to its role in isoleucine catabolism.

northern_blotting	gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels that are associated with embryonic development and neural signaling. innexins, invertebrate gap junction proteins, have been identified in drosophila and caenorhabditis. here, we report the isolation and characterization of two novel members of the insect innexin family, bm inx2 and bm inx4, from embryos of the silkworm, bombyx mori, during the germ-band formation stage. bm inx2 is a single copy gene with one exon, while bm inx4 is a single copy gene with four exons and three introns. the predicted proteins show structural similarities with other innexin family members, including four transmembrane (tm) domains, two extracellular loops (els), one cytoplasmic loop (cl), and typical conserved amino acids. bm inx2 is phylogenetically orthologous to the other insect inx2 genes, but bm inx4 is not orthologous to any known innexin including dm inx4. interestingly, northern blotting and in situ hybridization showed that bm inx2 was variously expressed across all developmental stages and in various tissues, with high expression seen in the nervous system at the time of embryogenesis. in contrast, bm inx4 was transiently expressed at the germ-band formation stage of embryogenesis, and was specifically expressed in the ovary and testis during the larval and pupal stages. the isolation and characterization of these novel genes should form the basis for further study of the functional events that occur during development and neuronal communication in b. mori.

northern_blotting	background: the mda-7/il-24 receptor belongs to the type 11 cytokine receptor family, and its two heterodimeric receptors are il-22r1/il-20r2 and il-20r1/il-20r2. mda-7/il-24 receptor expression in liver cancer cell lines has not yet been described. this information may be helpful for further clinical gene therapy. methods: with normal skin total rna as template, the cdna sequences of il-20r1, il-20r2 and il-22r were amplified by rt-pcr. total rna was extracted from cultured liver cancer cell lines and a normal liver cell line, then detected by northern blotting, and the expression of mda-7/il-24 receptors was analyzed. results: plc/prf/5 and smmc-7721 expressed il-20r1; bel-7402, hep3b, hepg2, and plc/prf/5 expressed il20r2; and hepg2 and plc/prf/5 expressed il-22r. only hepg2 expressed the il-22r/il-20r2 receptor complex. plc/prf/5 completely expressed both heterodimeric receptors. huh-7, qgy-7701 and wrl-68 did not express the il-24 receptor. conclusion: complete mda-7/il-24 receptors are seldom expressed in liver cancer cell lines.
polymerase_chain_reaction	thioredoxin peroxidases (tpxs) play an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis and in protecting organisms from the accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ros). in this study, we isolated the thioredoxin peroxidase-3 gene of schistosoma japonicum, sjtpx-3. the open reading frame (orf) of sjtpx-3 was 663 bp encoding 220 amino acids with a molecular weight of 24.99 kda and an isoelectric point of 6.20. quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that sjtpx-3 was expressed in all different stages of the parasites, with highest expression in 35-day-old worms. the orf of sjtpx-3 was subcloned into pet-32a (+) vectors and expressed in escherichia coli. recombinant sjtpx-3 (rsjtpx-3) was expressed as a soluble protein with good antigenicity, as demonstrated by western blotting. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that sjtpx-3 was mainly localized on the tegument of the parasites. mice vaccinated with rsjtpx-3 had a 37.02% (p < 0.05) reduction in worm burden and 56.52% (p < 0.05) reduction in liver egg production compared with control, unvaccinated mice. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis demonstrated that rsjtpx-3 could induce high levels of anti-rsjtpx-3-specific igg, igg1, and igg2a antibodies. characteristic th1 and th2 immune response cytokines were detected by flow cytometry and were increased by rsjtpx-3. taken together, these results suggest that sjtpx-3 is an antioxidant enzyme responsible for protecting s. japonicum from oxidative stress. rsjtpx-3 may represent a potential vaccine candidate and/or new drug target for patients with schistosomiasis.
human_metabolism	science is beginning to understand how genetic variation and epigenetic events alter requirements for, and responses to, nutrients (nutrigenomics). at the same time, methods for profiling almost all of the products of metabolism in a single sample of blood or urine are being developed (metabolomics). relations between diet and nutrigenomic and metabolomic profiles and between those profiles and health have become important components of research that could change clinical practice in nutrition. most nutrition studies assume that all persons have average dietary requirements, and the studies often do not plan for a large subset of subjects who differ in requirements for a nutrient. large variances in responses that occur when such a population exists can result in statistical analyses that argue for a null effect. if nutrition studies could better identify responders and differentiate them from nonresponders on the basis of nutrigenomic or metabolomic profiles, the sensitivity to detect differences between groups could be greatly increased, and the resulting dietary recommendations could be appropriately targeted. it is not certain that nutrition will be the clinical specialty primarily responsible for nutrigenomics or metabolomics, because other disciplines currently dominate the development of portions of these fields. however, nutrition scientists' depth of understanding of human metabolism can be used to establish a role in the research and clinical programs that will arise from nutrigenomic and metabolomic profiling. investments made today in training programs and in research methods could ensure a new foundation for clinical nutrition in the future.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the animal selection with favourable phenotypes of the past has been, currently, replaced by the genotype selection on quantitative traits, assisted by the expanding molecular techniques in the context of livestock improvement. in this study, the c. 112t>c polymorphism in exon ii of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) gene was investigated in karagouniko and chios sheep breeds by using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp), and possible associations with milk traits were examined. in total, 125 blood dna samples were isolated for pcr-rflp analysis and the respective 217 milk samples' composition profile was obtained. the goodness of fit test to hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe) for beta-lg genotypes was estimated and associations found between beta-lg genotypes and raw milk composition. two alleles and three genotypes were observed (aa, ab and bb) in both breeds, and chios breed significantly deviated (p <= 0.05) from hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe). conclusively, linear mixed model analysis on samples, from both breeds collectively, showed significant effects of beta-lg genotype on lactose percentage and somatic cell count (scc), lactation stage on daily milk yield and protein, while the breed effect was significant only on daily milk yield.
southern_blotting	two germinating seed transformation methods i.e., scarifying and puncturing methods, were used to transfer the bar gene into an inbred maize line. we generated transgenic glufosinate-tolerant maize plants, and conducted a comparison of the two transformation methods. we used the plasmid pcambar.chi.11 as the donor and germinating maize seeds as the recipients. the germinating seeds were subjected to puncture or scarifying treatment after being soaked in water for 12 h. the injured seeds were co-cultivated with agrobacterium for 24 h and then sown in the experimental plots. putative transgenic maize plants were selected by basta tolerance screening and pcr detection, and were further confirmed by southern blotting. following glufosinate tolerance assay and molecular detection of transgenic lines of the transgenic seedling (t-0), first generation of transgenic seedling (t-1) and second generation of transgenic seedling (t-2), we have confirmed that the bar gene was stably inherited and expressed. the pcr amplification result for t-2 transgenic plants showed that the genetic segregation ratio of the bar gene followed the 3:1 ratio of a single dominant mendelian factor. the study proved that both the germinating seed treatment approaches are rapid and simple plant transformation methods. in particular, the application of the puncture method can expand the tissue culture free transformation to dicotyledonous plants.

genetics	although metagenomics is a relatively new scientific trend, it has managed to become popular in many countries, including russia, over its 20-year history. this division of molecular genetics studies ecosystem-extracted nucleic acids (dna and rna), which contain full information about the microbial community of a habitat. owing to metagenomic methods, soil microbiology has undertaken to study not only known cultivated types of microorganisms but also noncultivated forms, the biological properties of which can be suggested exclusively from the genetic information coded in their dna. it turns out that such ""phantom"" types constitute the overwhelming majority within soil microbial communities; to all appearances, they actively participate in ensuring soil fertility, and, hence, in the opinion of the authors of this paper, study of them is topical for both basic research and agricultural practice. the development of metagenomic technologies will help understand biological phenomena determined by close plant-microbe interactions, such as increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and protecting them against phytopathogens. however, the introduction of new methods has always presented difficulties; in metagenomics, they are associated with the acquisition, storage, and bioinformational analysis of a huge array of genetic information.
immunology	background: the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, encoded by slc10a1, was identified as a functional receptor for hepatitis b virus (hbv). the objective of this study was to determine if there was an association of the ser267phe variant (rs2296651) with hbv infection status in moroccan patients. methods: using a taqman 5' allelic discrimination assay, the ser267phe variant was genotyped in 286 chronic hepatitis b patients, 135 individuals with spontaneous clearance from hbv infection and 109 healthy controls negative for hepatitis b serological markers. results: in this cohort, we detected only wild-type genotype (s267s) in all groups. this polymorphism was not associated with the hbv infection status in moroccan patients. conclusions: the s267f variant is absent among moroccans regardless of chronic hbv infection status.
molecular_biology	mammalian cell cultures are the preferred expression systems for the production of biopharmaceuticals requiring posttranslational processing. usually, cell cultures are cultivated in medium supplemented with serum, which supports cell proliferation, viability, and productivity. however, due to scientific and regulatory concerns, serum-free conditions are required in recombinant protein production. cell lines that are intended for commercial recombinant protein production have to adapt to serum- or protein-free conditions early in their development. this is a labor- and time-consuming process because of the specific cell requirements related to their adaptation in new microenvironment. in the present study, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell line producing glycosylated recombinant human erythropoietin (rhepo) was adapted for growth and rhepo production in serum- and protein-free conditions. the physiology, growth parameters, and morphology of the cho cells and rhepo biosynthesis and structure were closely monitored during the adaptation process to avoid unwanted selection of cell subpopulations. the results showed that the cho cells were successfully adapted to suspension growth and rhepo production in the protein-free conditions and that the structure of rhepo remained nearly unchanged. in addition, during rhepo production in the protein-free suspension conditions, the agitation rate seem to be significant for optimal process performance in contrast to the initial cell concentration, evaluated through evolutionary operation method.

polymerase_chain_reaction	irrigation water has been recognized as an important microbial risk factor for fruits and vegetables in many production areas, but there is still a lack of information about how the microbiological quality of different irrigation water sources and climatic conditions influence the safety of vegetables produced in brazil. this study evaluated the distribution of generic e. coli and the prevalence of e. coil o157:h7 in two different water sources (ponds and streams bordering farmlands and urban areas) used for irrigation and on commercially produced lettuces in southern brazil. we also evaluated the effect of agricultural factors and meteorological conditions in the potential contamination of water and produce samples. a longitudinal study was conducted on four farms during a year (july 2014 to august 2015). the results showed generic e. coli prevalence of 84.8% and 38.3% in irrigation water samples and on lettuces, respectively, indicating irrigation water as an important source of contamination of lettuces. no significant differences were detected in the counts of e. coli between the two different surface water sources. the climatic conditions, particularly rainfall and environmental temperature, have influenced the high concentration of e. coil. the highest loads of e. coil in irrigation water and on lettuces were found during the warmest time of the year. e. coli o157:h7 was detected by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) in 13 water samples but only 4 were confirmed by isolation in culture media.

northern_blotting	northern blotting analysis is a classical method for analysis of the size and steady-state level of a specific rna in a complex sample. in short, the rna is size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred by blotting onto a membrane to which the rna is covalently bound. then, the membrane is analysed by hybridization to one or more specific probes that are labelled for subsequent detection. northern blotting is relatively simple to perform, inexpensive, and not plagued by artefacts. recent developments of hybridization membranes and buffers have resulted in increased sensitivity closing the gap to the more laborious nuclease protection experiments.
northern_blotting	knowledge of molecular mechanism(s) implicated in smokeless tobacco (st) associated oral carcinogenesis is meager. in an attempt to identify genes that are modulated by st, we recently reported establishment of an oral epithelial cell culture. amol iii from oral hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis of a khaini consumer. herein we aimed to identify novel molecular targets of st (khaini) in amol iii cells using differential display. fourteen novel differentially expressed genes (12 upregulated and 2 downregulated) were identified. these differentially expressed cdnas were amplified. cloned. sequenced and confirmed by reverse northern blotting. mainly these genes are components of transcriptional machinery. cell-cell adhesion. signaling, growth and transformation processes. the important novel molecular targets identified included activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule (alcani). cdp-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyl transferase (phosphatidylinositol synthase). cdipt an important enzyme in phosphatidyl inositol biosynthesis, ribosomal protein (rps23), kiaa0121 and growth and transformation factor. e2ig5. semi-quantitative rtpcr analysis of these five genes confirmed over-expression of these genes in oral pre-malignant lesions (opls) and oral squamous cell carcinomas (osccs) of st consumers underscoring their biological relevance in st-associated oral tumorigenesis. in depth studies are warranted to determine the functional significance of alcam and cdipt in oral carcinogenesis.

polymerase_chain_reaction	aim: to investigate the effect of htra1 on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of human retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) cells in the light injured model, as well as the expression of the apoptosis related molecules. methods: the human rpe cell line arpe-19 was exposed to blue light to establish the light injured model. the cells were transfected with htra1 sirna to knockdown htra1 expression. subsequent expression of htra1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) and western blot, respectively. changes in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (cck-8), transwell assay and flow cytometry respectively, as well as changes in the mrna and protein levels of bax, caspase-3 and bcl-2 expression. results: htra1 was highly expressed in arpe-19 cells after blue light irradiation. knockdown of htra1 expression inhibited the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of the blue-light-irradiated arpe-19 cells (p<0.05). bax and caspase-3 expression were significantly reduced both at mrna and protein levels (p<0.05) after sirna treatment. bcl-2 expression significantly increased in blue-light irradiated arpe-19 cells after sirna interference (p<0.05). conclusion: silence of htra1 may inhibit the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of arpe-19 cells in light injured model. moreover, htra1 suppression in blue-light irradiated arpe-19 cells may ameliorate cell apoptosis through down-regulation of bax and caspase-3, and up regulation of bcl-2 expression.
immunology	background adrenaline auto-injectors (aai) should be provided to individuals considered to be at high risk of anaphylaxis. there is some evidence that the rate of aai prescription is increasing, but the true extent has not been previously quantified. aim to estimate the trends in annual gp-issued prescriptions for aai among uk children between 2000 and 2012. design and setting retrospective cohort study using data from primary care practices that contributed to the health improvement network (thin) database. method children and young people aged between 0-17 years of age with a prescription for aais were identified, and annual aai device prescription rates were estimated using stata (version 12). results a total of 1.06 million uk children were identified, providing 5.1 million person years of follow-up data. overall, 23 837 children were deemed high risk by their gps, and were prescribed 98 737 aai devices. this equates to 4.67 children (95% confidence interval [ci] = 4.66 to 4.69), and 19.4 (95% ci = 19.2 to 19.5) devices per 1000 person years. between 2000 and 2012, there has been a 355% increase in the number of children prescribed devices, and a 506% increase in the total number of aai devices prescribed per 1000 person years in the uk. the number of devices issued per high-risk child during this period has also increased by 33%. conclusion the number of children being prescribed aai devices and the number of devices being prescribed in uk primary care between 2000 and 2012 has significantly increased. a discussion to promote rational prescribing of aais in the nhs is needed.
southern_blotting	horizontal gene transfer may occur between distantly related bacteria, thus leading to genetic plasticity and in some cases to acquisition of novel resistance traits. proteus mirabilis is an enterobacterial species responsible for human infections that may express various acquired beta-lactam resistance genes, including different classes of carbapenemase genes. here we report a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate (strain 1091) displaying resistance to penicillin, including temocillin, together with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems and susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. using biochemical tests, significant carbapenem hydrolysis was detected in p. mirabilis 1091. since pcr failed to detect acquired carbapenemase genes commonly found in enterobacteriaceae, we used a whole- genome sequencing approach that revealed the presence of bla(oxa- 58) class d carbapenemase gene, so far identified only in acinetobacter species. this gene was located on a 3.1-kb element coharboring a bla(ampc)- like gene. remarkably, these two genes were bracketed by putative xerc-xerd binding sites and inserted at a xerc-xerd site located between the terminase-like small- and large-subunit genes of a bacteriophage. increased expression of the two bla genes resulted from a 6-time tandem amplification of the element as revealed by southern blotting. this is the first isolation of a clinical p. mirabilis strain producing oxa-58, a class d carbapenemase, and the first description of a xerc-xerd-dependent insertion of antibiotic resistance genes within a bacteriophage. this study revealed a new role for the xerc-xerd recombinase in bacteriophage biology.
enzymology	the reaction mechanism of arylmalonate decarboxylase is investigated using density functional theory calculations. this enzyme catalyzes the asymmetric decarboxylation of prochiral disubstituted malonic acids to yield the corresponding enantiopure carboxylic acids. the quantum chemical cluster approach is employed, and two different models of the active site are designed: a small one to study the mechanism and characterize the stationary points and a large one to study the enantioselectivity. the reactions of both a-methyl-a-phenylmalonate and a-methyl-a-vinylmalonate are considered, and different substrate binding modes are assessed. the calculations overall give strong support to the suggested mechanism in which decarboxylation of the substrate first takes place, followed by a stereoselective protonation by a cysteine residue. the enediolate intermediate and the transition states are stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds that make up the dioxyanion hole, resulting in feasible energy barriers. it is further demonstrated that the enantioselectivity in the case of a-methyl-a-phenylmalonate substrate is dictated already in the substrate binding, because only one binding mode is energetically accessible, whereas in the case of the smaller a-methyl-a-vinylmalonate substrate, both the binding and the following transition states contribute to the enantioselectivity.
polymerase_chain_reaction	the formation of the primary shell is a vital process in marine bivalves. ocean acidification largely influences shell formation. it has been reported that enzymes involved in phenol oxidation, such as tyrosinase and phenoloxidases, participate in the formation of the periostracum. in the present study, we cloned a tyrosinase gene from crassostrea angulata named ca-tyra1, and its potential function in early larval shell biogenesis was investigated. the ca-tyra1 gene has a full-length cdna of 2430 bp in size, with an open reading frame of 1896 bp in size, which encodes a 631-amino acid protein that includes a 24-amino acid putative signal peptide. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) analysis revealed that ca-tyra1 transcription mainly occurs at the trochophore stage, and the ca-tyra1 mrna levels in the 3000 ppm treatment group were significantly upregulated in the early d-veliger larvae. wmish and electron scanning microscopy analyses showed that the expression of ca-tyra1 occurs at the gastrula stage, thereby sustaining the early d-veliger larvae, and the shape of its signal is saddle-like, similar to that observed under an electron scanning microscope. furthermore, the rna interference has shown that the treatment group has a higher deformity rate than that of the control, thereby indicating that ca-tyra1 participates in the biogenesis of the primary shell. in conclusion, and our results indicate that ca-tyra1 plays a vital role in the formation of the larval shell and participates in the response to larval shell damages in crassostrea angulata that were induced by ocean acidification.

human_metabolism	this research, that is a framework of a big project regarding the knowledge of human metabolism in patients affected by renal disease, is aimed to assess the levels of some selected essential (co. fe. k, na, rb, se and zn) and non-essential elements (br cr, cs, fig, ni and sb) in different biological matrices such as whole blood, serum and urine, of three italian sub-populations. the analytical methodology involved is the instrumental neutron activation analysis (inaa), a primary analytical technique: the samples (totally 144) were irradiated in the triga nuclear reactor at the r.c.-casaccia enea for 12 h at a neutron flux of 2.6 x 10(12) n x cm(-2) x s(-1). the results show a similar distribution for essential elements whereas quite different for non-essential elements. the statistical treatment has evidenced no differences among the samples grouping the subpopulations into unique one. in this way, the levels found can be considered ""reference values"" in the investigated matrices.

immunology	the ocular surface is constantly exposed to environmental irritants, allergens and pathogens, against which it can mount a prompt immune response to preserve its integrity. but to avoid unnecessary inflammation, the ocular surface 's mucosal immune system must also discriminate between harmless and potentially dangerous antigens, a seemingly complicated task. despite its unique features, the ocular surface is a mucosal lining, and as such, it shares some homeostatic and pathophysiological mechanisms with other mucosal surfaces. the purpose of this review is to explore the mucosal homeostatic immune function of the ocular surface in both the healthy and diseased states, with a special focus on mucosal immunology concepts. the information discussed in this review has been retrieved by pubmed searches for literature published from january 1981 to october 2016.
human_metabolism	outer membrane proteins are structurally distinct from those that reside in the inner membrane and play important roles in bacterial pathogenicity and human metabolism. x-ray crystallography studies on 40 different outer membrane proteins have revealed that the transmembrane portion of these proteins can be constructed from either -sheets or less commonly from -helices. the most common architecture is the -barrel, which can be formed from either a single anti-parallel sheet, fused at both ends to form a barrel or from multiple peptide chains. outer membrane proteins exhibit considerable rigidity and stability, making their study through x-ray crystallography particularly tractable. as the number of structures of outer membrane proteins increases a more rational approach to their crystallization can be made. herein we analyse the crystallization data from 53 outer membrane proteins and compare the results to those obtained for inner membrane proteins. a targeted sparse matrix screen for outer membrane protein crystallization is presented based on the present analysis.
enzymology	the widespread use of phosphorothioate esters as agricultural pesticides, chemical weapons and mechanistic probes in enzymology has sparked interest in the reactivity of these thio-substituted analogues of phosphate esters. in this brief account, we summarize the recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms of hydrolysis (and solvolysis in methanol) of phosphorothioates containing a sulfur atom in the bridging and/or non-bridging position. a small number of highly efficient catalytic systems containing the metal ions la(iii), pd(ii), cu(ii) and zn(ii) have been developed to promote the degradation of the various classes of phosphorothioate esters. the mechanisms of the base promoted solvolytic reactions in water and methanol and those of the metal catalyzed cleavage are presented, as well as a discussion of the energetics of the catalytic processes and other salient features. the aim of this review is to provide the reader with a-contemporary physical organic description of phosphorothioate ester cleavage. this article is part of a special issue entitled: chemistry and mechanism of phosphatases, diesterases and triesterases.

human_metabolism	background: n,n-diethyl-m-toluamide (deet) is a widely used insect repellent in the united states. objectives: to assess exposure to deet in a representative sample of persons 6 years and older in the u.s. general population from the 2007-2010 national health and nutrition examination survey. methods: we analyzed 5348 urine samples by using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution high -performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. we used regression models to examine associations of various demographic parameters with urinary concentrations of deet biomarkers. results: we detected deet in -3% of samples and at concentration ranges (>0.08 mu g/l-45.1 mu g/l) much lower than those of 3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid (dcba) (>0.48 mu g/l-30,400 mu g/l) and n,n-diethyl-3-hydroxymethylbenzamide (dhmb) (>0.09 mu g/l-332 g/l). dcba was the most frequently detected metabolite (similar to 84%). regardless of survey cycle and the person 's race/ethnicity or income, adjusted geometric mean concentrations of dcba were higher in may-sep than in oct-apr. furthermore, non-hispanic whites in the warm season were more likely than in the colder months [adjusted odds ratio (or) = 10.83; 95% confidence interval (ci), 3.28-35.79j and more likely than non-hispanic blacks (or = 3.45; 95% ci, 1.51-7.87) to have dcba concentrations above the 95th percentile. conclusions: the general u.s. population, including school-age children, is exposed to deet. however, reliance on deet as the sole urinary biomarker would likely underestimate the prevalence of exposure. instead, oxidative metabolites of deet are the most adequate exposure biomarkers. differences by season of the year based on demographic variables including race/ethnicity likely reflect different lifestyle uses of deet-containing products. published by elsevier ltd
northern_blotting	exposure of watermelon fruit to ethylene leads to acute placental-tissue softening and watersoaking. mrna differential display strategy was utilized to isolate and characterize genes associated with development of the disorder. watermelon fruit were harvested at the full-ripe stage and exposed to 50 mu ll-1 ethylene for 12 h, and 1, 3, and 6 d at 20 degrees c. dna-free total rna (0.2 mu g) isolated from fruit treated with air or ethylene for 12 h was reverse transcribed using three different one-base-anchored oligo dt primers. high stringency pcr was performed using eight different 13-mer arbitrary primers in combination with the fluorescent-labeled one-base-anchored oligo dt primers. the pcr fluorescent-labeled products were separated-on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and differentially expressed bands were isolated. confirmation of true positive bands was performed by reverse northern blotting. comparison of mrna profiles of ethylene- and air-treated fruit revealed that 78 genes were differentially expressed, of which 15 partial cdnas were isolated and characterized. blast search results revealed significant homologies to ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway genes, lipid-metabolizing enzymes, proteins involved in plant defense responses, radical scavenging enzymes, exonucleases, and expansins. northern blot analysis of rna isolated from air- and ethylene-treated fruit stored for 1, 3, and 6d revealed an ethylene-dependent expression pattern of all corresponding genes. the data indicate that ethylene treatment of watermelon fruit results in a rapid up-regulation of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes.

enzymology	plastids are complex organelles that are integrated into the plant host cell where they differentiate and divide in tune with plant differentiation and development. in line with their prokaryotic origin, plastid division involves both evolutionary conserved proteins and proteins of eukaryotic origin where the host has acquired control over the process. the plastid division apparatus is spatially separated between the stromal and the cytosolic space but where clear coordination mechanisms exist between the two machineries. our knowledge of the plastid division process has increased dramatically during the past decade and recent findings have not only shed light on plastid division enzymology and the formation of plastid division complexes but also on the integration of the division process into a multicellular context. this review summarises our current knowledge of plastid division with an emphasis on biochemical features, the functional assembly of protein complexes and regulatory features of the overall process.
genetics	improving the accuracy of phenotyping through the use of advanced psychometric tools will increase the power to find significant associations with genetic variants and expand the range of possible hypotheses that can be tested on a genome-wide scale. multivariate methods, such as structural equation modeling (sem), are valuable in the phenotypic analysis of psychiatric and substance use phenotypes, but these methods have not been integrated into standard genome-wide association analyses because fitting a sem at each single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) along the genome was hitherto considered to be too computationally demanding. by developing a method that can efficiently fit sems, it is possible to expand the set of models that can be tested. this is particularly necessary in psychiatric and behavioral genetics, where the statistical methods are often handicapped by phenotypes with large components of stochastic variance. due to the enormous amount of data that genome-wide scans produce, the statistical methods used to analyze the data are relatively elementary and do not directly correspond with the rich theoretical development, and lack the potential to test more complex hypotheses about the measurement of, and interaction between, comorbid traits. in this paper, we present a method to test the association of a snp with multiple phenotypes or a latent construct on a genome-wide basis using a diagonally weighted least squares (dwls) estimator for four common sems: a one-factor model, a one-factor residuals model, a two-factor model, and a latent growth model. we demonstrate that the dwls parameters and p-values strongly correspond with the more traditional full information maximum likelihood parameters and p-values. we also present the timing of simulations and power analyses and a comparison with and existing multivariate gwas software package.
northern_blotting	to gain insight into the comparative function in stress response of hsps in insects, three hsp cdnas were cloned from the fat body of the beet armyworm spodoptera exigua (lepidoptera, noctuidae). sexhsp70, sexhsp74 and sexhsp83 cdnas encoding the protein of 667, 685 and 717 amino acids, with the pi of 5.52, 5.75 and 5.02, respectively. northern blotting revealed that all three sexhsp mrnas are expressed in the fat body, mid-gut, spermary and tracheae. sexhsp70, sexhsp74and sexhsp83 mrnas were expressed in the fat body and whole body at different levels during different developmental stages. the three sexhsp transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body on the first day of fifth instar larvae, on the fourth and seventh days of the pupa stage, and in the whole body on the initial stages of larvae. under heat and cold shock conditions, sexhsp70 and sexhsp83 mainly functioned during heat shock and cooling and sexhsp83 also had a function in the recovery stage. sexhsp74 had important functions in short-term heat shock and recovery, as well as long-term cooling. the results revealed that long-term shocking can affect sexhsp74 and sexhsp83 expression and long-term cooling can influence sexhsp83 expression during the recovery stage. published by elsevier inc.
human_metabolism	the antioxidant activities of crude extract and its derived soluble fractions from the flower of sophora viciifolia were evaluated in five different test systems (dpph, abts, frap, reducing power and inhibition of lipid peroxidant models) for the first time. the ethylacetate soluble fraction exhibited the highest antioxidant effect. correlation analysis suggested that the flavonoids might be the major contributors for the high antioxidant activity of this flower. in addition, 11 compounds were isolated from this flower, and the antioxidant capacities of 5 flavonoids were evaluated by dpph assay. compound 3 (luteolin) had a significant dpph radical-scavenging activity, and was also present at the highest concentration (5.56 mg/g dry sample), implying an important role of 3 for the antioxidant activity of this flower. the study suggests that the flower of s. viciifolia can provide valuable functional ingredients and can be used for the prevention of diseases related to various oxidant by-products of human metabolism.

molecular_biology	gene promoters have variable repartition of agct nucleotides according to some probabilistic behaviours essentially depending on their position in a string. the paper aims to provide a model for this configuration. with this model we derive non-uniform confidence bounds for those probability distributions in the strings. a uniform bound deriving from previous works in wu and zhao [inference of trends in time series. j r stat soc b. 2007; 69: 391-410] is more demanding for the model. a data-based study allows to clarify our suggestions and open the way for applications in molecular biology.
southern_blotting	beckwith-wiedemann syndrome (bws) and silver-russell syndrome (srs) are caused by imprinting defects on chromosome 11p15.5. standard diagnostic tests for these syndromes include methylation analysis of the differential methylated regions of the h19 and kcnq1ot1 genes. traditionally this has been conducted by southern blot analysis. pcr-based methods greatly improve the turn around time of the test and require less dna. one of the newly emerging techniques for snp genotyping and mutation scanning, high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis, has been shown to be also applicable for methylation analysis. we tested methylation-sensitive hrm analysis as a method for the detection of methylation defects in a group of 16 bws and srs patients with known methylation status (determined previously by southern blotting), as well as 45 normal controls. hrm analysis was able to detect all methylation aberrations in the patients and appeared to be more sensitive than southern blotting. variation in normal controls is minimal and the presence of snps in the amplified fragment does not influence the outcome of the test. we conclude that methylation-sensitive hrm analysis is a robust, fast, sensitive and cost effective method for methylation analysis in bws and srs.
northern_blotting	the mrna differential display technique was used to identify genes from habanero pepper (capsicum chinense jacq.) seedlings whose expression is modified systemically by infection with the oomycete phytophthora capsici l. experiments with different oligonucleotide primer combinations revealed that no single gene was synthesised de nova. instead, the quantitative accumulation of multiple transcripts was found. from these transcripts, levels of a nitrate reductase (capsicum chinense nitrate reductase, ccnr), which has a high percentage of identity with other solanaceae nrs, showed a consistent increase a few hours after inoculation (hai) with p capsici. reverse northern blotting revealed the existence of basal levels of ccnr transcripts in different adult tissues; however, systemic levels rose dramatically after spraying seedlings with salicylic acid (sa) and ethephon (et) but not with methyl jasmonate (meja). both p capsici and defence phytohormones (dp) also modified nr enzymatic activity (nitrite:nad(+) oxidoreductase; ec 1.7.1.1) with similar kinetics. because the application of dp induced and activated the ccnr differentially, it is possible that the activity of ccnr is related to a specific host defence response.

genetics	we aimed to identify whether the use of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (hct) impacts outcomes for multiple myeloma patients with gains of chromosome 1q (+1q). we retrospectively identified 95 patients, 21% having+1q. for patients with+1q, the overall response rate to induction was 85%, with 40% havingvgpr and 20% achieving a cr, similar to non+1q patients (p=.64). the median pfs from diagnosis with+1q was 2.1 years (95% ci: 1.2-not reached (nr)) vs 4.3 years (95% ci: 3.3 yrs-nr) without+1q (p=.003). median os from diagnosis was 4.4 years (95% ci: 2.9-nr) vs not reached, respectively (p=.005). on molecular analysis using the foundation one heme assay, the most common mutations seen in+1q patients included tp53 (38%) and kras (25%). overall, gain of 1q portends worse pfs and os which was not negated by auto hct. such patients will likely require additional therapy to improve their survival.
genetics	male breast carcinomas (mbcs) are rare neoplasms that account for 0.1% of all male cancers. still, there are 2000 new cases of mcb diagnosed annually in the united states. because of its rarity, data regarding the etiology, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of mbc are limited. mbc shares some similarities with female breast carcinoma (fbc). this review will address the important clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features, genetics, management, and prognosis of mbc.
cell_biology	liver transplantation has been accepted as a useful therapeutic approach for patients with end-stage liver disease. however, the mismatch between the great demand for liver transplants and the number of available donor organs underscores the urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies for patients with acute and chronic liver failure. the rapidly growing knowledge on stem cell biology has opened new avenues toward stem cell-based therapy for liver disease. as stem cells have capacity for high proliferation and multipotent differentiation, the characteristics of stem cells fit the cell therapy. several types of cells have been investigated as possible sources of liver regeneration: mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, liver progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and bone marrow mononuclear cells. in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that these cells have great potential as candidates of stem cell therapy. we reviewed the reports on clinical trials of cell therapy for liver disease that have been recently undertaken using mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow mononuclear cells, and liver progenitor cells. these reports have heterogeneity of description of trial design, types of infused cells, patient population, and efficacy of therapies. we addressed these reports from these viewpoints and clarified their significance. we hope that this review article will provide a perspective on the available approaches based on stem cell-based therapy for liver disease.
molecular_biology	the aim of this study was to detect the is900 region of mycobacterium aoium subsp. paratuberculosis (map) in bovine milk samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and conventional pcr, and to study the agreement between these tests. a total of 121 bovine milk samples were collected from herds considered positive for map, from the state of pernambuco, brazil. map dna was detected in 20 samples (16.5%) using conventional pcr and in 34 samples (28.1%) using qpcr. map dna was detected in all of the 6 animal farms studied. moderate agreement was found between qpcr and conventional pcr results, where the sensitivity and specificity of conventional pcr in relation to qpcr were 50% and 96.6%, respectively. thus, the is900 region of map was found in bovine milk samples from the state of pernambuco. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of map dna found in bovine milk in northeast brazil. we also demonstrated the qpcr technique is more sensitive than conventional pcr with respect to detection of map in milk samples.

human_metabolism	n-[(1s)-1-(aminocarbonyl)-2-methylpropyl]-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1h-indazole-3-carboxamide (ab-chminaca) is a recently introduced synthetic cannabinoid. at present, no information is available about in vitro or in vivo human metabolism of ab-chminaca. therefore, biomonitoring studies to screen ab-chminaca consumption lack any information about the potential biomarkers (e.g.metabolites) to target. to bridge this gap, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of ab-chminaca using human liver microsomes (hlms). formation of ab-chminaca metabolites was monitored using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. twenty-six metabolites of ab-chminaca were detected including seven mono-hydroxylated and six di-hydroxylated metabolites and a metabolite resulting from n-dealkylation of ab-chminaca, all produced by cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes. two carboxylated metabolites, likely produced by amidase enzymes, and five glucuronidated metabolites were also formed. five mono-hydroxylated and one carboxylated metabolite were likely the major metabolites detected. the involvement of individual cyps in the formation of ab-chminaca metabolites was tested using a panel of seven human recombinant cyps (rcyps). all the hydroxylated ab-chminaca metabolites produced by hlms were also produced by the rcyps tested, among which rcyp3a4 was the most active enzyme. most of the in vitro metabolites of ab-chminaca were also present in urine obtained from an ab-chminaca user, therefore showing the reliability of the results obtained using the in vitro metabolism experiments conducted to predict ab-chminaca in vivo metabolism. the ab-chminaca metabolites to target in biomonitoring studies using urine samples are now reliably identified and can be used for routine analysis. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
enzymology	single-molecule experimental methods have provided new insights into biomolecular function, dynamic disorder, and transient states that are all invisible to conventional measurements. a novel, nonfluorescent single-molecule technique involves attaching single molecules to single-walled carbon nanotube field-effective transistors (swnt fets). these ultrasensitive electronic devices provide long-duration, label-free monitoring of biomolecules and their dynamic motions. however, generalization of the swnt fet technique first requires design rules that can predict the success and applicability of these devices. here, we report on the transduction mechanism linking enzymatic processivity to electrical signal generation by a swnt fet. the interaction between swnt fets and the enzyme lysozyme was systematically dissected using eight different lysozyme variants synthesized by protein engineering. the data prove that effective signal generation can be accomplished using a single charged amino acid, when appropriately located, providing a foundation to widely apply swnt fet sensitivity to other biomolecular systems.
southern_blotting	tobacco bright yellow-2 (by-2) cells, one of the best characterized cell lines is an attractive expression system for heterologous protein expression. however, the expression of foreign proteins is currently hampered by their low yield, which is partially the result of proteolytic degradation. human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (hg-csf) is a hematopoietic cytokine. recombinant hg-csf is successfully being used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer patients. here, we describe a simple strategy for producing biologically active hg-csf in tobacco by-2 cells, localized in the apoplast of by-2 cells, as well as targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (er). er targeting significantly enhanced recombinant production which scaled to 17.89 mg/l from 4.19 mg/l when expressed in the apoplasts. southern blotting confirmed the stable integration of hg-csf in the by-2 nuclear genome, and the expression of hg-csf was analysed by western blotting. total soluble protein containing hg-csf isolated from positive calli showed proliferative potential when tested on hl-60 cell lines by mtt assay. we also report the potential of a fluorescence-activated cell sorting approach for an efficient sorting of the hg-csf-expressing cell lines, which will enable the generation of homogenous high-producing cell lines.
cell_biology	several previous studies outlined the importance of the histone h2a deubiquitinase mysm1 in the regulation of stem cell quiescence and haematopoiesis. in this study we investigated the role of mysm1 in t-cell development. using mouse models that allow conditional mysm1 ablation at late stages of thymic development, we found that mysm1 is intricately involved in the maintenance, activation and survival of cd8(+) t cells. mysm1 ablation resulted in a twofold reduction in cd8(+) t-cell numbers, and also led to a hyperactivated cd8(+) t-cell state accompanied by impaired proliferation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production after ex vivo stimulation. these phenotypes coincided with an increased apoptosis and preferential up-regulation of p53 tumour suppressor protein in cd8(+) t cells. lastly, we examined a model of experimental cerebral malaria, in which pathology is critically dependent on cd8(+) t cells. in the mice conditionally deleted for mysm1 in the t-cell compartment, cd8(+) t-cell numbers remained reduced following infection, both in the periphery and in the brain, and the mice displayed improved survival after parasite challenge. collectively, our data identify mysm1 as a novel factor for cd8(+) t cells in the immune system, increasing our understanding of the role of histone h2a deubiquitinases in cytotoxic t-cell biology.
enzymology	in the complex formed between the calcium cation (ca2+) and a deprotonated hishis dipeptide, the complex adopts a charge solvation (cs) structure. ca2+% a weak binding main group metal cation, interacts with the oxygens of the peptide carbonyl moiety and the deprotonated c-terminus. in contrast, the much stronger binding ni2+ cation deprotonates the peptide nitrogen and induces an iminolate (im) ligand structure in the [ni(hishis-h)](+) complex ion. the combination of infrared multiple-photon dissociation (irmpd) spectroscopy and quantum chemistry evidence these two representative binding motifs. the iminolate coordination pattern identified and characterized in the [ni(hishis-h)](+) complex serves as a model case for nickel complexes of poly-histidyl-domains and is thereby also of interest to better understand the fundamentals of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as well as of ni co-factor chemistry in enzymology.

genetics	rich ecotype collections are used for several plant models to unravel the molecular causes of phenotypic differences, and to investigate the effects of environmental adaption and acclimation. for the model moss physcomitrella patens collections of accessions are available, and have been used for phylogenetic and taxonomic studies, for example, but few have been investigated further for phenotypic differences. here, we focus on the reute accession and provide expression profiling and comparative developmental data for several stages of sporophyte development, as well as information on genetic variation via genomic sequencing. we analysed cross-technology and cross-laboratory data to define a confident set of 15 mature sporophyte-specific genes. we find that the standard laboratory strain gransden produces fewer sporophytes than reute or villersexel, although gametangia develop with the same time course and do not show evident morphological differences. reute exhibits less genetic variation relative to gransden than villersexel, yet we found variation between gransden and reute in the expression profiles of several genes, as well as variation hot spots and genes that appear to evolve under positive darwinian selection. we analyzed expression differences between the ecotypes for selected candidate genes in the gras transcription factor family, the chalcone synthase family and in genes involved in cell wall modification that are potentially related to phenotypic differences. we confirm that reute is a p.patens ecotype, and suggest its use for reverse-genetics studies that involve progression through the life cycle and multiple generations.
molecular_biology	3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-mst) was a novel hydrogen sulfide (h2s)-synthesizing enzyme that may be involved in cyanide degradation and in thiosulfate biosynthesis. over recent years, considerable attention has been focused on the biochemistry and molecular biology of h2s-synthesizing enzyme. in contrast, there have been few concerted attempts to investigate the changes in the expression of the h2s-synthesizing enzymes with disease states. to investigate the changes of 3-mst after traumatic brain injury (tbi) and its possible role, mice tbi model was established by controlled cortical impact system, and the expression and cellular localization of 3-mst after tbi was investigated in the present study. western blot analysis revealed that 3-mst was present in normal mice brain cortex. it gradually increased, reached a peak on the first day after tbi, and then reached a valley on the third day. importantly, 3-mst was colocalized with neuron. in addition, western blot detection showed that the first day post injury was also the autophagic peak indicated by the elevated expression of lc3. importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of 3-mst was partly colabeled by lc3. however, there was no colocalization of 3-mst with propidium iodide (cell death marker) and lc3 positive cells were partly colocalized with propidium iodide. these data suggested that 3-mst was mainly located in living neurons and may be implicated in the autophagy of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after tbi.
human_metabolism	pige and pixe techniques were employed to the study of elemental constituents of some traditional medicinal plants generally used in curing many diseases and ailments in southwestern nigeria. analyses were also carried out on commonly edible vegetables of medicinal and pharmacological importance. pige measurements were carried out using 3.5-mev collimated protons from the 7 mv cn van-de-graaff accelerator of infn, lnl, legnaro (padova), italy, whereas the pixe measurements were carried out using 1.8 mev from the 2.5 mv an 2000 van-de-graaff accelerator of the same laboratory. the results show that many of the medicinal plants contain elements of cardinal importance in human metabolism. the results from the vegetables also show the presence of vital elements that are needed for growth and development. in addition, some of the toxic elements, which include as, cd, hg, and so forth, were not detected. however, some of the recipes contain trace amounts of pb at very low concentrations. this calls for proper control of dose rates in some samples to prevent the attendant negative cumulative effects.
molecular_biology	objective. to conduct a replication study and meta-analysis involving the study of mtdna variants in the radiographic progression of oa in different cohorts worldwide, including cohort hip and cohort knee (check), the oa initiative and a cohort from spain. methods. the influence of the haplogroups in the rate of radiographic progression at 96 months in 431 subjects from check was assessed in terms of kellgren and lawrence (kl) grade. progression was defined as a change from kl >= 1 at baseline to any higher grade during the follow-up. extended cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the influence of mtdna variants in the rate of radiographic knee oa progression. a subsequent meta-analysis of 1603 subjects following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines was conducted to combine the data of individual studies. a sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the stability of the results. results. check subjects carrying the haplogroup t showed the lowest rate of radiographic knee oa progression [hazard ratio (hr) 0.645 (95% ci 0.419, 0.978); p < 0.05]. when pooled, subjects within the superhaplogroup jt showed the same trend [hr 0.707 (95% ci 0.501, 0.965); p < 0.05]. bmi [hr 1.046 (95% ci 1.018, 1.073); p < 0.05] and bilateral oa [hr 2.266 (95% ci 1.733, 2.954); p < 0.05] at baseline are risk factors for radiographic knee oa progression as well. in the meta-analysis there was a reduced rate of radiographic progression in subjects with haplogroup t [hr 0.612 (95% ci 0.454, 0.824); p = 0.001] or in the superhaplogroup jt [hr 0.765 (95% ci 0.624, 0.938); p = 0.009]. sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were robust. conclusion. the mtdna variants in the superhaplogroup jt associate with a reduced rate of radiographic oa progression. the mtdna polymorphisms in the superhaplogroup jt emerge as potential complementary genetic biomarkers for disease progression.
cell_biology	nfkb1, a component of the canonical nf-kappa b pathway, was recently reported to be mutated in a limited number of cvid patients. cvid-associated mutations in nfkb2 (non-canonical pathway) have previously been shown to impair nk cell cytotoxic activity. although a biological function of nfkb1 in non-human nk cells has been reported, the role of nficb1 mutations for human nk cell biology and disease has not been investigated yet. we decided therefore to evaluate the role of monoallelic nfkb1 mutations in human nk cell maturation and functions. we show that nfkb1 mutated nk cells present impaired maturation, defective cytotoxicity and reduced ifn-gamma production upon in vitro stimulation. furthermore, human il-2 activated nfkb1 mutated ni(cells fail to up regulate the expression of the activating marker nkp44 and show reduced proliferative capacity. these data suggest that nfkb1 plays an essential novel role for human nk cell maturation and effector functions.

genetics	species range limits often fluctuate in space and time in response to variation in environmental factors and to gradual niche evolution due to changes in adaptive traits. we used genome-wide data to investigate evolutionary divergence and species range limits in a generalist and highly dispersive fish species that shows an unusually wide distribution across arid and semi-arid regions of australia. we generated ddrad data (18,979 filtered snps and 1.725 million bp of sequences) for samples from 27 localities spanning the native range of golden perch, macquaria ambigua (teleostei; percichthyidae). our analytical framework uses population genomics to assess connectivity and population structure using model based and model-free approaches, phylogenetics to clarify evolutionary relationships, and a coalescent-based bayesian species delimitation method to assess statistical support of inferred species boundaries. addressing uncertainties regarding range limits and taxonomy is particularly relevant for this iconic australian species because of the intensive stocking activities undertaken to support its recreational fishery and its predicted range shifts associated with ongoing climate change. strong population genomic, phylogenetic, and coalescent species delimitation support was obtained for three separately evolving metapopulation lineages, each lineage should be considered a distinct cryptic species of golden perch. their range limits match the climate-determined boundaries of main river basins, despite the ability of golden perch to cross drainage divides. we also identified cases suggestive of anthropogenic hybridization between lineages due to stocking of this recreationally important fish, as well as a potential hybrid zone with a temporally stable pattern of admixture. our work informs on the consequences of aridification in the evolution of aquatic organisms, a topic poorly represented in the literature. it also shows that genome-scale data can substantially improve and rectify inferences about taxonomy, hybridization and conservation management previously proposed by detailed genetic studies.

polymerase_chain_reaction	hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm and is one of the most common human cancers. recently, long non-coding rnas have been demonstrated to participate in pathogenesis of many diseases including the progression in several cancers. in this study, we found that the long non-coding rna colon cancer-associated transcript 1 was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (p < 0.05), and high colon cancer-associated transcript 1 expression level was positively associated with tumor volume (p < 0.05) and american joint committee on cancer stage (p < 0.05) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. luciferase reporter assays and rna-pulldown assays showed that colon cancer-associated transcript 1 is a target of mir-490-3p. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis indicated that colon cancer-associated transcript 1 regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 expression as a competing endogenous rna by sponging mir-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. furthermore, colon cancer-associated transcript 1 silencing decreased hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation and invasion and overexpression promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. these data demonstrated that the colon cancer-associated transcript 1/mir-490-3p/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 regulatory pathway promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. inhibition of colon cancer-associated transcript 1 expression may be a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
human_metabolism	a direct structural identification, and quantitative assessment below the 50 nmol/ml level, of the full pattern of renally excreted metabolites is made possible by c-13 nmr measurements of untreated urine samples when stable isotope-labelled (c-13) drug analogues are administered to humans. the full potential of the new ex vivo nmr approach is exemplified by a study, for a group of volunteers, of s-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine metabolism. the metabolic sulphoxidation pathway fo s-caroxymethyl-l-cysteine in man, accepted so far, needs to be profoundly revised on the basis of the c-13 nmr results.
northern_blotting	cell-to-cell trafficking through different cellular layers is a key process for various rnas including those of plant viruses and viroids, but the regulatory mechanisms involved are still not fully elucidated and good model systems are important. here, we analyse the function of a simple rna motif (termed 'loop19') in potato spindle tuber viroid (pstvd) which is required for trafficking in nicotiana benthamiana leaves. northern blotting, reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that unlike wild-type pstvd, which was present in the nuclei in all cell types, the trafficking-defective loop19 mutants were visible only in the nuclei of upper epidermal and palisade mesophyll cells, which shows that pstvd loop19 plays a role in mediating rna trafficking from palisade to spongy mesophyll cells in n. benthamiana leaves. our findings and approaches have broad implications for studying the rna motifs mediating trafficking of rnas across specific cellular boundaries in other biological systems.
northern_blotting	wu d, peng f, zhang b, ingram aj, kelly dj, gilbert re, gao b, kumar s, krepinsky jc. egfr-plc gamma 1 signaling mediates high glucose-induced pkc beta 1-akt activation and collagen i upregulation in mesangial cells. am j physiol renal physiol 297: f822-f834, 2009. first published july 15, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00054.2009.-glomerular matrix accumulation is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. we have recently shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) transactivation mediates high glucose (hg)-induced collagen i upregulation through pi3k-pkc beta 1-akt signaling in mesangial cells (mc). phospholipase c gamma 1 (plc gamma 1) interacts with activated growth factor receptors and activates classic pkc isoforms. we thus studied its role in hg-induced collagen i upregulation in mc. primary rat mc were treated with hg (30 mm) or mannitol as osmotic control. protein kinase activation was assessed by western blotting and collagen i upregulation by northern blotting. diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin. hg treatment for 1 h led to plc gamma 1 membrane translocation and y783 phosphorylation, both indicative of its activation. mannitol was without effect. plc gamma 1 y783 phosphorylation was also seen in cortex and glomeruli of diabetic rats. hg induced a physical association between egfr and plc gamma 1 as identified by coimmuno-precipitation. plc gamma 1 activation required egfr kinase activity since it was prevented by the egfr inhibitor ag1478 or overexpression of kinase-inactive egfr (k721a). phosphoinositide-3-oh kinase inhibition also prevented plc gamma 1 activation. hg-induced akt s473 phosphorylation, effected by pkc beta 1, was inhibited by the plc gamma inhibitor u73122. plc gamma 1 inhibition or downregulation by small interference rna also prevented hg-induced collagen i upregulation. our results indicate that egfr-plc gamma 1 signaling mediates hg-induced pkc beta 1-akt activation and subsequent collagen i upregulation in mc. inhibition of egfr or plc gamma 1 may provide attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.
enzymology	historically, the study of proteins has relied heavily on characterizing the activity of a single purified protein isolated from other cellular components. this classic approach allowed scientists to unambiguously define the intrinsic kinetic and chemical properties of that protein. the ultimate hope was to extrapolate this information toward understanding how the enzyme or receptor behaves within its native cellular context. these types of detailed in vitro analyses were necessary to reduce the innate complexities of measuring the singular activity and biochemical properties of a specific enzyme without interference from other enzymes and potential competing substrates. however, recent developments in fields encompassing cell biology, molecular imaging, and chemical biology now provide the unique chemical tools and instrumentation to study protein structure, function, and regulation in their native cellular environment. these advancements provide the foundation for a new field, coined physiological enzymology, which quantifies the function and regulation of enzymes and proteins at the cellular level. in this special edition, we explore the area of physiological enzymology and protein function through a series of review articles that focus on the tools and techniques used to measure the cellular activity of proteins inside living cells. this article is part of a special issue entitled: physiological enzymology and protein functions.

polymerase_chain_reaction	we conducted a prospective study to assess the prognostic impact of selected copy number variations (cnvs) in stage ii-iii microsatellite stable (mss) colon cancer. a total of 401 patients were included from 01/2004 to 01/2009. the cnvs in 8 selected target genes, dcc/18q, egfr/7p, tp53/17p, blk/8p, myc/8q, apc/5q, erbb2/17q and stk6/20q, were detected using a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction of short fluorescent fragment (qmpsf) method. the primary end-point was the impact of the cnvs on the 4-year disease-free survival (dfs). the recurrence rate at 4 years was 20.9%, corresponding to 14% stage ii patients versus 31% stage iii patients (p<0.0001). the 4-year dfs was significantly decreased in patients with a loss at dcc/18q (p = 0.012) and a gain at erbb2/17q (p = 0.041). the multivariate analysis demonstrated that stage iii, a loss at dcc/18q and a gain at erbb2/17q were independent factors associated with dfs. a combination of dcc/18q and erbb2/17q was also associated with relapse, with the hazard ratio increasing from 1 to 2.4 (95% confidence interval (ci), 1.5-4.1) and 3.1 (95% ci, 1.2-8.4) in the presence of 0, 1 or 2 alterations, respectively (p = 0.0013). cnvs in dcc/18q and erbb2/17q are significantly associated with dfs in stage ii-iii mss colon cancer.
southern_blotting	resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (bscs) in enterobacteriaceae in companion animals has become a great concern for public health. to estimate the dissemination of bsc-resistant bacteria between dog and human, we examined the bsc-resistance determinants of and genetic similarities between 69 bsc-resistant escherichia coli isolates derived from canine rectal swabs (n = 28) and human clinical samples (n = 41). some e. coli isolates possessed bla(tem-1b) (14 canine and 16 human isolates), bla(ctx-m-2) (6 human isolates), bla(ctx-m-14) (3 canine and 14 human isolates), bla(ctx-m-27) (1 canine and 15 human isolates), and bla(cmy-2) (11 canine and 3 human isolates). the possession of ctx-m-type beta-lactamases was significantly more frequent in human isolates, whereas cmy-2 was more common in canine isolates. bacterial typing methods (phylogenetic typing, o-antigen serotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) showed little clonal relationship between canine isolates and human isolates. plasmid analysis and southern blotting indicated that the plasmids encoding cmy-2 were similar among canine and human isolates. based on the differences in the major beta-lactamase and the divergence of bacterial types between canine and human isolates, it seems that clonal dissemination of bsc-resistant e. coli between canines and humans is limited. the similarity of the cmy-2-encoding plasmid suggests that plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase gene transmission plays a role in interspecies diffusion of bsc-resistant e. coli between dog and human.

human_metabolism	scope: xanthohumol (xn) is a bioactive prenylflavonoid from hops. a single-dose pharmacokinetic (pk) study was conducted in men (n = 24) and women (n = 24) to determine dose-concentration relationships. methods and results: subjects received a single oral dose of 20, 60, or 180 mg xn. blood was collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. plasma levels of xn and its metabolites, isoxanthohumol (ix), 8-prenylnaringenin (8pn), and 6-prenylnaringenin (6pn) were measured by lc-ms/ms. xanthohumol (xn) and ix conjugates were dominant circulating flavonoids among all subjects. levels of 8pn and 6pn were undetectable in most subjects. the xn pk profile showed peak concentrations around 1 h and between 4-5 h after ingestion. the maximum xn concentrations (c-max) were 33 +/- 7 mg/l, 48 +/- 11 mg/l, and 120 +/- 24 mg/l for the 20, 60, and 180 mg dose, respectively. using noncompartmental modeling, the area under the curves (auc(0 ->infinity)) for xn were 92 +/- 68 h x mu g/l, 323 +/- 160 h x mu g/l, and 863 +/- 388 h x mu g/l for the 20, 60, and 180 mg dose, respectively. the mean half-life of xn was 20 h for the 60 and 18 h for the 180 mg dose. conclusion: xn has a distinct biphasic absorption pattern with xn and ix conjugates being the major circulating metabolites.
molecular_biology	the rhizobia are collectively comprised of gram negative soil bacteria that have the ability to form symbiotic nitrogen-fixing root and/or stem nodules in association with leguminous plants. the taxonomy of these bacteria is continually in a state of flux, in large part due to rapid development of refined molecular biology techniques. the isolation and characterization of new, and often different, legumes-nodulating bacteria on a variety of plant hosts has resulted in the naming of many new rhizobial species. here we update the taxonomy of the legume-nodulating bacteria and describe newly identified rhizobia capable of nodulating edible legumes and legume trees. in 1990, there was only one bacterial species that was known to nodulate common bean worldwide (rhizobium leguminosarum sv. phaseoli), one species that nodulated faba bean (rhizobium leguminosarum sv. viciae), and two species that nodulated soybean (bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhizobium fredii). today, nearly 14, 11, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3 and 2 species have been defined that are capable of nodulating common bean, soybean, cowpea, chickpea, peanut, lentils, faba bean and pea, respectively. the recent use of whole genome based taxonomy (genomotaxonomy) will surely change how we define this important group of bacteria. the identification of several rhizobial species that are able to nodulate and fix nitrogen with edible legumes may enhance the production of these crops and can compensate for worldwide deficiencies in human nutritional needs in the future.
human_metabolism	the analytical methodology for speciation of metals and metalloids associated with alkyl groups and biomacromolecules is critically reviewed. alkylated metals and metalloids are not only known to be produced by microbial methylation within most anaerobic compartments in the environment, but also in the course of enzymatic transformations during human metabolism. because of the toxicological relevance of these compounds present in trace to ultratrace concentrations, firm species identification and exact quantification are essential. while many instrumental techniques coupling chromatography (gc, hplc, ce, ge) with plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms) are available for quantification, methods used for structural identification often suffer from inadequate sensitivity (ei-ms, esi-ms, maldi-ms, ft-icrms). other problems encountered are sample derivatisation artefacts, lack of suitable standards for quantification, lack of equilibrium between spikes and sample, and the integrity of metal-protein association during separation, in particular during sds-page. selected application examples with respect to mercury and arsenic speciation will be discussed critically.
genetics	we report the discovery of the largest fern genome in tmesipteris obliqua (1c = 150.61 pg), a species belonging to the whisk-fern family, psilotaceae. its genome size estimated by flow cytometry is comparable with the largest genome so far reported for any eukaryote, in the monocot paris japonica (melanthiaceae; 1c = 152.23 pg). the addition of this new record doubles the range of genome size values so far encountered in ferns from 97.2-fold (0.77-74.84 pg/1c) to 196-fold (0.77-150.61 pg/1c). this finding emphasizes the importance of filling taxonomic gaps in our knowledge to uncover the full extent of genome size diversity across the different lineages of land plants.
enzymology	polyextremophilic organisms, such as haloalkaliphiles have focused attention due to their hydrolytic enzymes. the halophilic microorganisms include heterotrophic and methanogenic archaea; photosynthetic, lithotrophic, and heterotrophic bacteria; and photosynthetic and heterotrophic eukaryotes. halophiles and haloalkaliphiles are distributed throughout in hypersaline environments, natural hypersaline brines in arid, coastal, and even deep sea locations, as well as in man-made salterns. the microbes possess range of the biocatalysts which allow them to sustain under the prevailing extreme conditions. among the enzymes, proteases, carbohydrases, and peroxidases are the most cited candidates. the proteases widely occur in microbial world and play significant role in the processing and maintenance of large number of membrane proteins under the cellular conditions. besides, the proteases are among the commercially most viable enzymes and dominate the worldwide enzyme market. the proteases of halophilic and haloalkaliphilic bacteria from the marine sources appear to have significant role in the detergent industries, ripening of the salted fish, fish sauces and marinades, modifying fish protein concentrations, dehairing and deskinning, non aqueous enzymology and asymmetric catalysis. in the present chapter, the proteases from the halophilic and haloalkaliphilic bacteria have been reviewed with respect to their occurrence and biochemical properties.
polymerase_chain_reaction	cytomegalovirus (cmv) is the most frequent cause of congenital infection worldwide, with an estimated incidence in developed countries of 0.6-0.7% of all live births. the burden of disease related to congenital cmv in substantial, as it is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss and an important cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities in children. despite its clinical significance, congenital cmv infection often goes undetected because the majority of infected infants are asymptomatic at birth and screening programs have not been substantially implemented. other than behavioral measures, effective interventions aimed at the prevention of maternal infection and of mother-to-child transmission are lacking. due to a convergence of recent advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in infants with congenital cmv, though, the field likely will be changing rapidly over just the next few years. specifically, a highly-sensitive screening test with high throughput potential has been developed, and treatment of infants symptomatically infected with congenital cmv has proven to be well-tolerated and effective in improving long-term hearing and neurodevelopmental outcomes. this review highlights the clinical importance of congenital cmv infection, the developments in laboratory diagnostics, and the benefits of antiviral therapy. it also identifies the global efforts still required in the prevention of maternal infection and in the optimization of antiviral therapy to further reduce the burden of congenital cmv disease.
genetics	purpose: to describe the genotypes distribution of orientia tsutsugamushi, in guangzhou, and explore differences in clinical and laboratory features among genotypes. method: we collected blood or eschar samples of all scrub typhus cases reported in 2013 from 10 district hospitals positive for pcr. we further tested the pcr-positive samples for dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. we collected the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data by questionnaire and medical records. result: a total of 589 samples were tested and 40 were pcr positive. four genotypes were identified: karp (52.2%), kato (22.5%), gilliam (12.5%), and ta763 (7.5%). two new strains (zcx90 and chx5 strain) were previously unidentified in guangzhou. gilliam type cases were more likely to have continuous fever (60.0%). only kato genotype cases presented with splenomegaly. for laboratory features, kato group had higher level of white blood cell count (16.44 x 10(12)/l) than normal range and other groups. total bilirubin and direct bilirubin in gilliam group (10.10 mu m and 3.05 mu m, respectively) were both lower than other groups and normal value. conclusion: continuous fever and splenomegaly may be the distinctive symptom of gilliam and kato genotype cases, respectively. karp genotype remained dominant in guangzhou, but attention should be paid to the emergence of new types or variation of existing genotypes.
northern_blotting	rice stripe virus (rsv) often causes severe rice yield loss in temperate regions of east asia. although the correlation of small interfering rnas (sirnas) with transgenic virus resistance of plants using rna interference (rnai) is known for decades, no systematical research has been done on the profiling of sirnas from a genomic scale. our research is aiming to systematically study the rnai impact in rsv-resistant transgenic rice, which was generated by introducing an inverted repeat construct that targets rsv nucleocapsid protein (ncp) gene. in this paper, three independent rsv-resistant transgenic rice lines were generated, their stable integration of the t-dna fragment and the expression of sirnas were confirmed by southern blotting and northern blotting analyses, and the majority of sirnas were in lengths of 21, 22, and 24 nucleotides (nt), which have validated a connection between the presence of the rsv ncp homologous sirnas and the rsv resistance in those transgenic rice lines. in one of these transgenic lines (t4-b1), the t-dna fragment was found to have been inserted at chromosome 1 of the rice genome, substituting the rice genome fragment from 32 158 773 to 32 158 787 nt. bioinformatics analysis of small rna-seq data on the t4-b1 line also confirmed the large population of ncp-derived sirnas in transgenic plants, and the rsv-infected library (t4-b1-v) possessed more sirnas than its mock inoculated libraries (t4-b1-vf), these results indicating the inverted repeat construct and rsv could introduce abundance of sirnas in transgenic rice. moreover, a varied expression level of specific sirnas was found among different segments of the ncp gene template, about 47% of ncp-derived sirnas reads aligned with the fragment from 594 to 832 nt (239 nt in length) in ncp gene (969 nt in length) in the t4-b1-v, indicating a potential usage of hotspot regions for rnai silencing in future research. in conclusion, as the first study to address the sirna profile in rsv-resistant transgenic plant using next generation sequencing (ngs) technique, we confirmed that the massive abundance of sirna derived from the inverted repeat of ncp is the major reason for rsv-resistance.
cell_biology	a predictive framework for the evolution of stem cell biology in 3-d is currently lacking. in this study we propose deep image informatics of the nuclear biology of stem cells to elucidate how 3-d biomaterials steer stem cell lineage phenotypes. the approach is based on high content imaging informatics to capture minute variations in the 3-d spatial organization of splicing factor sc-35 in the nucleoplasm as a marker to classify emergent cell phenotypes of human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs). the cells were cultured in varied 3-d culture systems including hydrogels, electrospun mats and salt leached scaffolds. the approach encompasses high resolution 3-d imaging of sc-35 domains and high content image analysis (hcia) to compute quantitative 3-d nuclear metrics for sc-35 organization in single cells in concert with machine learning approaches to construct a predictive cell-state classification model. our findings indicate that hmscs cultured in collagen hydrogels and induced to differentiate into osteogenic or adipogenic lineages could be classified into the three lineages (stem, adipogenic, osteogenic) with >= 80% precision and sensitivity, within 72 h. using this framework, the augmentation of osteogenesis by scaffold design exerted by porogen leached scaffolds was also profiled within 72 h with similar to 80% high sensitivity. furthermore, by employing 3-d sc-35 organizational metrics, differential osteogenesis induced by novel electrospun fibrous polymer mats incorporating decellularized matrix could also be elucidated and predictably modeled at just 3 days with high precision. we demonstrate that 3-d sc-35 organizational metrics can be applied to model the stem cell state in 3-d scaffolds. we propose that this methodology can robustly discern minute changes in stem cell states within complex 3-d architectures and map single cell biological readouts that are critical to assessing population level cell heterogeneity. statement of significance the sustained development and validation of bioactive materials relies on technologies that can sensitively discern cell response dynamics to biomaterials, while capturing cell-to-cell heterogeneity and preserving cellular native phenotypes. in this study, we illustrate the application of a novel high content image informatics platform to classify emergent human mesenchymal stem cell (hmsc) phenotypes in a diverse range of 3-d biomaterial scaffolds with high sensitivity and precision, and track cell responses to varied external stimuli. a major in silico innovation is the proposed image profiling technology based on unique three dimensional textural signatures of a mechanoreporter protein within the nuclei of stem cells cultured in 3-d scaffolds. this technology will accelerate the pace of high-fidelity biomaterial screening.

human_metabolism	background: the human 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, comprising e1o, e2o, and e3 components, catalyzes conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-coa. results: human e1o generates both a thiamin-enamine-derived radical and the reactive oxygen species, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. conclusion: human e1o produces reactive oxygen species at a rate of <1% of succinyl-coa under physiological conditions. significance: this work presents the novel discovery that the 5-carboxyl group affects enzymatic reactivity of 2-oxoglutarate. herein are reported unique properties of the human 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (ogdhc), a rate-limiting enzyme in the krebs (citric acid) cycle. (a) functionally competent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (e1o-h) and dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase components have been expressed according to kinetic and spectroscopic evidence. (b) a stable free radical, consistent with the c2-(c2-hydroxy)--carboxypropylidene thiamin diphosphate (thdp) cation radical was detected by electron spin resonance upon reaction of the e1o-h with 2-oxoglutarate (og) by itself or when assembled from individual components into ogdhc. (c) an unusual stability of the e1o-h-bound c2-(2-hydroxy)--carboxypropylidene thiamin diphosphate (the thdp-enamine/c2-carbanion, the first postdecarboxylation intermediate) was observed, probably stabilized by the 5-carboxyl group of og, not reported before. (d) the reaction of og with the e1o-h gave rise to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (reactive oxygen species (ros)). (e) the relatively stable enzyme-bound enamine is the likely substrate for oxidation by o-2, leading to the superoxide anion radical (in d) and the radical (in b). (f) the specific activity assessed for ros formation compared with the nadh (overall complex) activity, as well as the fraction of radical intermediate occupying active centers of e1o-h are consistent with each other and indicate that radical/ros formation is an off-pathway side reaction comprising less than 1% of the on-pathway reactivity. however, the nearly ubiquitous presence of ogdhc in human tissues, including the brain, makes these findings of considerable importance in human metabolism and perhaps disease.
genetics	background: newcastle disease (nd) and avian influenza subtype h9n2 (h9n2 ai) are two of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses in the global poultry industry. vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control the spread of nd virus (ndv) and h9n2 ai virus (aiv), but the antigenic differences between the current circulating strains and the vaccine strains might account for recent nd and h9n2 ai outbreaks in vaccinated poultry flocks. methods: we developed an inactivated bivalent h9n2 and ndv vaccine based on the current prevalent strains of h9n2 aiv and ndv in china and evaluated its efficacy in chickens in this study. results: the results indicated that the inactivated bivalent vaccine could induce a fast antibody response in vaccinated chickens. the hemagglutination inhibition (hi) titer in the sera increased rapidly, and the highest hi titer was observed at 4 weeks post-vaccination (wpv) with a mean titre of 8.6 log(2) for ndv and 9.5 log(2) for h9n2. up until 15 wpv, hi titers were still detectable at a high level of over 6 log(2). the immunized chickens showed no signs of disease after challenge at 3 wpv with the prevalent strains of ndv and h9n2 aiv isolated in 2012-2014. moreover, viral shedding was completely inhibited in vaccinated chickens after challenge with h9n2 aiv and inhibited by at least 90% with ndv compared to the controls at 5dpc. conclusions: our findings suggest that the inactivated ndv and h9n2 vaccine induces a fast and strong antibody response in vaccinated chickens and is efficacious in poultry against ndvs and h9n2 aivs.
human_metabolism	a novel hypothesis-free multivariate screening methodology for the study of human exercise metabolism in blood serum is presented. serum gas chromatography/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( gc/tofms) data was processed using hierarchical multivariate curve resolution ( h-mcr), and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis ( opls-da) was used to model the systematic variation related to the acute effect of strenuous exercise. potential metabolic biomarkers were identified using data base comparisons. extensive validation was carried out including predictive h-mcr, 7-fold full cross-validation, and predictions for the opls-da model, variable permutation for highlighting interesting metabolites, and pairwise t tests for examining the significance of metabolites. the concentration changes of potential biomarkers were verified in the raw gc/tofms data. in total, 420 potential metabolites were resolved in the serum samples. on the basis of the relative concentrations of the 420 resolved metabolites, a valid multivariate model for the difference between pre- and postexercise subjects was obtained. a total of 34 metabolites were highlighted as potential biomarkers, all statistically significant ( p< 8.1e-05). as an example, two potential markers were identified as glycerol and asparagine. the concentration changes for these two metabolites were also verified in the raw gc/tofms data. the strategy was shown to facilitate interpretation and validation of metabolic interactions in human serum as well as revealing the identity of potential markers for known or novel mechanisms of human exercise physiology. the multivariate way of addressing metabolism studies can help to increase the understanding of the integrative biology behind, as well as unravel new mechanistic explanations in relation to, exercise physiology.
molecular_biology	the use of the ligninolytic fungi trametes versicolor for the degradation of micropollutants has been widely studied. however, few studies have addressed the treatment of real wastewater containing pharmaceutically active compounds (phac) under non-sterile conditions. the main drawback of performing such treatments is the difficulty for the inoculated fungus to successfully compete with the other microorganisms growing in the bioreactor. id the present study, several fungal treatments were performed under non-sterile conditions in continuous operational mode with two types of real wastewater effluent, namely, a reverse osmosis concentrate (roc) from a wastewater treatment plant and a veterinary hospital wastewater (vhw). in all cases, the setup consisted of two parallel reactors: one inoculated with t. versicolor and one non-inoculated, which was used as the control. the main objective of this work was to correlate the operational conditions and traditional monitoring parameters, such as laccase activity, with phac removal and the composition of the microbial communities developed inside the bioreactors. for that purpose a variety of biochemical and molecular biology analyses were performed: phospholipid fatty acids analysis (plfa), quantitative pcr (qpcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) followed by sequencing. the results show that many indigenous fungi (and not only bacteria, which were the focus of the majority of previously published research) can successfully compete with the inoculated fungi (i.e., trichoderma asperellum overtook t. versicolor in the roc treatment). we also showed that the wastewater origin and the operational conditions had a stronger impact on the diversity of microbial communities developed in the bioreactors than the inoculation or not with t. versicolor.

polymerase_chain_reaction	objective: potassium channels of the atp-sensitive family (k-atp channel) are inhibited by increase in intracellular atp. electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that the kinetics and pharmacological properties of kat? channels vary among different tissues, suggesting structurally and functionally distinct types. there are studies showing human periodontal ligament (pdl) cells respond to mechanical stress by increasing atp release, which participates in bone resorption or bone homeostasis. so, in this study we investigated the existence of kat? channel subunit and their single channel properties in human periodontal ligaments. materials & method: the human pdl cells were isolated from healthy erupted third molar. for patch clamp experiments, human pdl fibroblasts were seeded on 3.5 cm plastic dishes. the inside-out patch clamp recordings were performed under voltage clamp mode. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was conducted to identify the channel subunits. all pair-wise comparisons were performed by paired t-test. a p value < 0.05 was considered significant. results: we observed mrna transcripts for kir6.1, kir6.2 and sur2b subuits in the human pdl cells. in inside-out patch mode, the single channel conductance was 163 ps at symmetrical k+ concentration of 140 mm and inward rectification was seen in atp-free bath solution. the reversal potential of the currents was found to be 0 mv at symmetrical concentration (140 mm) of k+ in bath solution. the single channel currents were almost blocked by adding 5 mm atp in the bath solution. however, the currents were not blocked by 100 mu m glibenclamide, a subunit specific k-atp channel blocker. conclusions: these results indicate that human pdl cells express k-atp channels subunit including sur2b and kir6.1 and kir6.2 which are sensitive to atp but insensitive to glibenclamide.

human_metabolism	since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor over 6 million years ago, human metabolism has changed dramatically. this change includes adaptations to a high-quality diet, the evolution of an energetically expensive brain, dramatic increases in endurance abilities, and capacity for energy storage in white adipose tissue. human metabolism continues to evolve in modern human populations in response to local environmental and cultural selective forces. understanding the nature of these selective forces and the physiological responses during human evolution is a compelling challenge for evolutionary biologists. the complex genetic architecture surrounding metabolic phenotypes indicates that selection probably altered allelic frequencies across many loci in populations experiencing adaptive metabolic change to fit their environment. a recent analysis supports this hypothesis, finding that classic selective sweeps at single loci were rare during the past 250 000 years of human evolution. detection of selective signatures at multiple loci, as well as exploration of physiological adaptation to environment in humans, will require cross-disciplinary collaboration, including the incorporation of biological pathway analysis. this review explores the thrifty genotype hypothesis, high-altitude adaptation, cold-resistance adaptation, and genetic evidence surrounding these proposed metabolic adaptations in an attempt to clarify current challenges and avenues for future progress.
human_metabolism	high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy is a very powerful tool for the structural identification of xenobiotic metabolites ill complex biological matrices such as plasma, urine and bile. however, these fluids are dominated by thousands of signals resulting from endogenous metabolites and it is advantageous when investigating drug metabolites in such matrices to simplify the spectra by including a separation step in the experiment by directly-coupling hplc and nmr. naproxen (6-methoxy-alpha -methyl-2-naphthyl acetic acid) is administered as the s-enantiomer and is metabolised in vivo to form its demethylated metabolite which is subsequently conjugated with beta -d-glucuronic acid as well as with sulfate. naproxen is also metabolised by phase ii metabolism directly to form a glycine conjugate as well as a glucuronic acid conjugate at the carboxyl group. in the present investigation, the metabolism of naproxen was investigated in urine samples with a very simple sample preparation using a combination of directly-coupled hplc-h-1 nmr spectroscopy and hplc-mass spectrometry (ms). a buffer system was developed which allows the same chromatographic method to be used for the hplc-nmr as well as the hplc-ms analysis. the combination of these methods is complementary in information content since the nmr spectra provide evidence to distinguish isomers such as the type of glucuronides formed, and the hplc-ms data allow identification of molecules containing nmr-silent fragments such as occur in the sulfate ester.

molecular_biology	twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathways have been well-characterized in bacteria and chloroplasts. genes encoding a tatc protein are found in almost all plant mitochondrial genomes but to date these have not been extensively investigated. for the first time it could be demonstrated that this mitochondrial-encoded tatc is a functional gene that is translated into a protein in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. a tatb-like subunit localized to the inner membrane was also identified that is nuclear-encoded and is essential for plant growth and development, indicating that plants potentially require a tat pathway for mitochondrial biogenesis.
genetics	this special feature results from the symposium 'ants 2016: ant interactions with their biotic environments' held in munich in may 2016 and deals with the interactions between ants and other insects, plants, microbes and fungi, studied at micro- and macroevolutionary levels with a wide range of approaches, from field ecology to next-generation sequencing, chemical ecology and molecular genetics. in this paper, we review key aspects of these biotic interactions to provide background information for the papers of this special feature. after listing the major types of biotic interactions that ants engage in, we present a brief overview of ant/ant communication, ant/plant interactions, ant/fungus symbioses, and recent insights about ants and their endosymbionts. using a large molecular clock-dated formicidae phylogeny, we map the evolutionary origins of different ant clades' interactions with plants, fungi and hemiptera. ants' biotic interactions provide ideal systems to address fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions about mutualism, coevolution, adaptation and animal communication.
genetics	background: differences in genetics and receptor expression (phenotypes) of invasive ductal breast cancer (idc) impact on prognosis and treatment response. immunohistochemistry (ihc), the most used technique for idc phenotyping, has some limitations including its invasiveness. we explored the possibility of contrast-enhanced positron emission tomography magnetic resonance (ce-fdg pet/mr) to discriminate idc phenotypes. methods: 21 idc patients with ihc assessment of oestrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), human epidermal growth factor-2 (her2), and antigen ki-67 (ki67) underwent ce-fdg pet/mr. magnetic resonance-perfusion biomarkers, apparent diffusion coefficient (adc), and standard uptake value (suv) were compared with ihc markers and phenotypes, using a student 's t-test and one-way anova. results: er/pr - tumours demonstrated higher kep(mean) and suvmax than er or pr+ tumours. her2 - tumours displayed higher adc(mean), kep(mean), and suvmax than her2+tumours. only adc(mean) discriminated ki6714% tumours. pet/mr biomarkers correlated with ihc phenotype in 13 out of 21 patients (62%; p = 0.001). conclusions: positron emission tomography magnetic resonance might non-invasively help discriminate idc phenotypes, helping to optimise individual therapy options.
northern_blotting	carcinogenesis is driven by an accumulation of mutations and genetic lesions, which leads to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. however, the molecular mechanisms by which the expression of these genes was regulated in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. in this study, we investigated the regulatory effects of microrna and methylation on the expression of k-ras, tp53 and pten genes in pancreatic cancer cells. the protein and mirna levels were measured by western blotting and northern blotting, respectively. xenograft pancreatic tumor models were established by inoculating bxpc-1, capan-2, and panc-1 tumor cells into athymic nu/nu mice. a disparate level of kras, p53, pten, dnmts, and dicer 1 proteins as well as let-7i, mir-22, mir-143, and mir-29b mirna was observed in bxpc-1, capan-2, and panc-1 cells. knockdown of dicer 1 expression in bxpc-3 and panc-1 cells resulted in significant increases in kras, p53, pten, and dnmts protein levels and significant decreases in mir-22, mir-143, let-7i, and mir-29b expression. knockdown of dicer 1 expression in capan-2 cells significantly increased p53 and pten expression, while significantly decreased mir-22 and mir-143 expression, but had no effects on pten. dnmts, let-7i, and mir-29b expression. knockdown of dicer 1 expression significantly inhibited xenograft bxpc-3 tumor growth, but promoted xenograft panc-1 tumor growth. in contrast, knockdown of dicer 1 expression had no effect on xenograft capan-2 tumor growth. our study suggested that different pancreatic cancer cell lines exhibited obvious discrepancies in gene expression profiles, implying that different molecular mechanisms are involved in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer subclasses. our study highlighted the importance of personalized therapy.

polymerase_chain_reaction	the melanocortin 1 receptor (mcir) gene is a candidate functional gene that controls the pigment production in melanocytes. the aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms and investigate the effect of the mcir gene on plumage coloration in duck breeds, including korean native ducks. initially, 34 individuals from seven duck breeds were sequenced, obtaining 12 polymorphisms. five single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the coding region were non-synonymous, with mutations corresponding to amino acid changes. among these, four snps were geno-typed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 264 individuals from same seven duck breeds. fisher 's exact test was conducted to identify possible relationships between the mcir gene polymorphisms and plumage color variations. four non-synonymous snps, c.52a>g (p.lys18glu), and c.376 a>g (p.ile126val), c.409g>a (p.ala137thr) and c.649c>t (p.arg217cys), were associated with the two deduced genotypes (i.e., e/e and e+ /e+) based on plumage color phenotypes. in addition, we reconstructed mcir gene haplotypes, where the haplotype aagc showed its highest frequency in nageswari duck breed, which presents an extended black phenotype. our results indicate that the identified polymorphisms by this study can be used to explore associations with plumage color variations in asian duck breeds.
southern_blotting	background: struma ovarii (so) is a rare form of ovarian mature teratoma in which thyroid tissue is the predominant element. because of its rarity, the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant so has not been clearly defined. it is believed that malignant transformation of so has similar molecular features with and its prognosis corresponds to that of malignant tumors originating in the thyroid. case presentation: we report 35-year-old woman with bilateral ovarian cysts incidentally detected by ultrasound during the first trimester of pregnancy. four months after delivery of a healthy child without complication she was admitted to the hospital for acute abdominal pain. laparoscopic left adnexectomy was performed initially in a regional hospital; right cystectomy was done later in a specialized clinic. intraoperative frozen section and a final pathology revealed that the cyst from the left ovary was composed of mature teratomatous elements, normal thyroid tissue (>50%) and a non-encapsulated focus of follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc). normal and cancerous thyroid tissues were tested for braf and ras mutations by direct sequencing, and for ret/ptc rearrangements by rt-pcr/southern blotting. a kras codon 12 mutation, the ggt ->gtt transversion, corresponding to the gly ->val amino acid change was identified in the absence of other genetic alterations commonly found in ptc. conclusion: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this mutation is described in a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in struma in the ovarii. this finding provides further evidence that even rare mutations specific for ptc may occur in such tumors. molecular testing may be a useful adjunct to common differential diagnostic methods of thyroid malignancy in so.
immunology	advances in clinical immunology in the past year included the report of practice parameters for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiencies to guide the clinician in the approach to these relatively uncommon disorders. we have learned of new gene defects causing immunodeficiency and of new phenotypes expanding the spectrum of conditions caused by genetic mutations such as a specific regulator of telomere elongation (rtel1) mutation causing isolated natural killer cell deficiency and mutations in ras-associated rab (rab27) resulting in immunodeficiency without albinism. advances in diagnosis included the increasing use of whole-exome sequencing to identify gene defects and the measurement of serum free light chains to identify secondary hypogammaglobulinemias. for several primary immunodeficiencies, improved outcomes have been reported after definitive therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy.
northern_blotting	principles: b-domain deleted human coagulation factor viii cdna (bdd-hfviiicdna) transgenic mice were produced by using sperm mediated gene transfer (smgt). the transcription and expression of human fviii in transgenic mice were also investigated. methods: sperm were isolated from caudae epididymides of male c57bl/6 mice and transfected with linearized rc/rsv-bdd-bfviiicdna plasmid, and subsequently used to fertilize female mice via artificial insemination in vivo. after birth, f0 progeny were identified by pcr and southern blotting for bdd-hfviiicdna transgenic mice. f1 progeny were subsequently derived from a male transgenic f0 mouse and a normal c57bl/6 female mouse. the f1 progeny were then identified as bdd-hfviiicdna transgenic mice by southern blotting. the transcription and expression of bddhfviiicdna in transgenic mice were determined by northern blotting, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. blood was also collected from both f0 and f1 progeny to detect hfvtit:ag and anti-hfviii inhibitors. results: a total of 9 f0 and 8 f1 progeny were delivered, in which 3 f0 and 2 f1 progeny were identified to have bdd-hfviiicdna. the transcription and expression of bdd-hfviiicdna were found to exist in the liver and kidneys of all transgenic mice. hfviii:ag in plasma of the transgenic f0 progeny was 31.95 ng/ml, 23.52 ng/ml and 26.36 ng/ml respectively, whilst the f1 transgenic mice showed results of 18.82 ng/ml and 12.16 ng/ml. anti-hfviii inhibitors were negative in both f0 and f1 progeny. conclusions: human fviii gene transgenic mice can be produced by the smgt technique and express human fviii protein in their bodies.
human_metabolism	previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial species are capable of transforming complex chemical substances. several of these species, native to the human gastrointestinal tract, are active in postmortem decomposition. they have potential to cause biotransformations affecting compound-to-metabolite ratios within the human body, especially after death. investigation of postmortem effects could supply valuable information, especially concerning compound identification and confirmation. the purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens on diazepam and flunitrazepam in reinforced clostridial medium, and to compare bacterial biotransformation products to those of human metabolism. a decrease in diazepam concentration between pre- and post-incubation was observed for samples inoculated with escherichia coli (14.7-20.2%) as well as bacteroides fragilis (13.9-25.7%); however there was no corresponding increase in concentration for the monitored human metabolites. flunitrazepam demonstrated a greater concentration loss when incubated with individual bacterial species as well as mixed culture (79.2-100.0%). samples incubated with bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and mixed culture resulted in nearly complete conversion of flunitrazepam. increased 7-aminoflunitrazepam concentrations accounted for the majority of the conversion; however discrepancies in the mass balance of the reaction suggested the possibility of a minor metabolite that was not monitored in the current analysis. these experiments served as a pilot study and proof of concept that can be adapted and applied to a realm of possibilities. ultimately, this methodology would be ideal to study compounds that are too toxic or lethal for animal and human metabolic investigations. copyright (c) 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd.
cell_biology	an important aim of bone regenerative medicine is to design biomaterials with controlled chemical and topographical features to guide stem cell fate towards osteoblasts without addition of specific osteogenic factors. herein, we find that sprayed bioactive and biocompatible calcium phosphate substrates (cap) with controlled topography induce, in a well-orchestrated manner, wharton 's jelly stem cells (wj-scs) differentiation into osteoblastic lineage without any osteogenic supplements. the resulting wj-scs commitment exhibits features of native bone, through the formation of three-dimensional bone-like nodule with osteocyte-like cells embedded into a mineralized type i collagen. to our knowledge, these results present the first observation of a whole differentiation process from stem cell to osteocyteslike on a synthetic material. this suggests a great potential of sprayed cap and wj-scs in bone tissue engineering. these unique features may facilitate the transition from bench to bedside and the development of successful engineered bone. statement of significance designing materials to direct stem cell fate has a relevant impact on stem cell biology and provides insights facilitating their clinical application in regenerative medicine. inspired by natural bone compositions, a friendly automated spray-assisted system was used to build calcium phosphate substrate (cap). sprayed biomimetic solutions using mild conditions led to the formation of cap with controlled physical properties, good bioactivity and biocompatibility. herein, we show that via optimization of physical properties, cap substrate induce osteogenic differentiation of wharton 's jelly stem cells (wj-scs) without adding osteogenic supplement factors. these results suggest a great potential of sprayed cap and wj-scs in bone tissue engineering and may facilitate the transition from bench to beside and the development of clinically successful engineered bone.

genetics	background bipolar affective disorder (bpd) is a severe mood disorder with a prevalence of similar to 1.5% in the population. the pathogenesis of bpd is poorly understood; however, a strong heritable component has been identified. previous genome-wide association studies have indicated a region on 6q25, coding for the syne1 gene, which increases disease susceptibility. syne1 encodes the synaptic nuclear envelope protein-1, nesprin-1. a brain-specific splice variant of syne1, cpg2 encoding candidate plasticity gene 2, has been identified. the intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism with the strongest genome-wide significant association in bpd, rs9371601, is present in both syne1 and cpg2. methods we screened 937 bpd samples for genetic variation in syne1 exons 14-33, which covers the cpg2 region, using high-resolution melt analysis. in addition, we screened two regions of increased transcriptional activity, one of them proposed to be the cpg2 promoter region. results and conclusion we identified six nonsynonymous and six synonymous variants. we genotyped three rare nonsynonymous variants, rs374866393, rs148346599 and rs200629713, in a total of 1099 bpd samples and 1056 controls. burden analysis of these rare variants did not show a significant association with bpd. however, nine patients are compound heterozygotes for variants in syne1/cpg2, suggesting that rare coding variants may contribute significantly towards the complex genetic architecture underlying bpd. imputation analysis in our own whole-genome sequencing sample of 99 bpd individuals identified an additional eight risk variants in the cpg2 region of syne1. copyright (c) 2017 the author(s). published by wolters kluwer health, inc.
polymerase_chain_reaction	cryptosporidium and giardia are important causes of diarrhoeal illness. adequate knowledge of the molecular diversity and geographical distribution of these parasites and the environmental and climatic variables that influence their prevalence is important for effective control of infection in at-risk populations, yet relatively little is known about the epidemiology of these parasites in africa. cryptosporidium is associated with moderate to severe diarrhoea and increased mortality in african countries and both parasites negatively affect child growth and development. malnutrition and hiv status are also important contributors to the prevalence of cryptosporidium and giardia in african countries. molecular typing of both parasites in humans, domestic animals and wildlife to date indicates a complex picture of both anthroponotic, zoonotic and spill-back transmission cycles that requires further investigation. for cryptosporidium, the only available drug (nitazoxanide) is ineffective in hiv and malnourished individuals and therefore more effective drugs are a high priority. several classes of drugs with good efficacy exist for giardia, but dosing regimens are suboptimal and emerging resistance threatens clinical utility. climate change and population growth are also predicted to increase both malnutrition and the prevalence of these parasites in water sources. dedicated and co-ordinated commitments from african governments involving ""one health"" initiatives with multidisciplinary teams of veterinarians, medical workers, relevant government authorities, and public health specialists working together are essential to control and prevent the burden of disease caused by these parasites.
molecular_biology	the sialidase gene from brevibacterium casei was cloned in pet28a and overexpressed as a histidine-tagged protein in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the histidine-tagged sialidase protein was purified and characterized from the crude cell extracts of isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells using ni-nta agarose chromatography. sds-page using the purified sialidase indicated a single band at 116 kda. this sialidase showed maximum activity at a ph of 5.5 and temperature of 37 degrees c. the kinetic parameters k-m and v-max for the artificial substrate 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetyl-neuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate were 1.69 x 10(-3) mm and 244 mmol.min(-1)center dot mg(-1), respectively. the sialidase may catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids linked by the alpha-(2,3) and alpha-(2,8) linkage of polysialogangliosides, but it does not act on monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (gm1), which offers it a great potential for commercially producing gm1 from polysialogangliosides.
