alzheimer's_disease	the formation of soluble oligomers of amyloid beta 42 and 40 (a beta 42, a beta 40) is the initial event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease (ad). based on previous systematic proline replacement and solid-state nmr, we proposed a toxic dimer structure of a beta 42, a highly aggregative alloform, with a turn at positions 22 and 23, and a hydrophobic core in the c-terminal region. however, in addition to a beta 42, a beta 40 dimers can also contribute to ad progression because of the more abundance of a beta 40 monomer in biological fluids. here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of three dimer models of the toxic-conformation constrained e22p-a beta 40 using l,l-2,6-diaminopimeric acid (dap) or l,l-2,8diaminoazelaic acid (daz) linker at position 30, which is incorporated into the intermolecular parallel beta-sheet region, and dap at position 38 in the c-terminal hydrophobic core. e22p-a3odap-a beta 40 dimer (1) and e22p-a3odaz-a beta 40 dimer (2) existed mainly in oligomeric states even after 2 weeks incubation without forming fibrils, unlike the corresponding monomer. their neurotoxicity toward sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells was very weak. in contrast, e22p-g38dap-a beta 40 dimer (3) formed beta-sheet rich oligomeric aggregates, and exhibited more potent neurotoxicity than the corresponding monomer. ion mobility mass spectrometry suggested that high molecular-weight oligomers (12-24-mer) of 3 form, but not for 1 and 2 after 4 h incubation. these findings indicate that formation of the hydrophobic core at the c-terminus, rather than intermolecular parallel beta-sheet, triggers the formation of toxic a beta oligomers. compound 3 may be a suitable model for studying the etiology of alzheimer 's disease.
parkinson's_disease	in parkinson 's disease, the enhanced beta rhythm is closely associated with akinesia/bradykinesia and rigidity. an increase in beta oscillations (12-35 hz) within the basal ganglia (bg) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e. the lower beta (12-20 hz) and upper beta (21-35 hz). a computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations. simulation results show several findings. the upper beta frequency in the bg originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the bg depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (gpe) and the subthalamic nucleus (stn). there is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the gpe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations. it is shown that increased self-inhibition within the gpe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the gpe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the bg. this work provides an analysis for understanding the mechanism underlying pathological synchronization in neurological diseases.

sprains_and_strains	traumatic ankle injury is a frequent clinical presentation. ankle taping is commonly used in the prophylaxis of sprains and as an adjunct during rehabilitation of ankle injury. the mechanisms behind taping remain unclear however, one possible mechanism is improved proprioception and peroneal reflex responses. this study investigated the peroneal reflex response to rapid inversion (using a trapdoor) with different taping protocols. the dominant leg of 31 healthy subjects was tested in three conditions: no taping; simple prophylactic taping; and circumferential leg taping. a repeated measures anova revealed no statistically significant effect across conditions or trials. the results suggest that neurophysiological responses to sudden inversion are not altered by mechanical or sensory input from taping in normal subjects.
cancer	purpose the aim of this study was to assess the value of dual-time point imaging in pet/ct for detection of biochemically recurrent or persistent prostate cancer, using the prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) ligand [ga-68]psma i&t. methods 240 patients who underwent a [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct in the context of biochemical relapse of prostate cancer were included in this retrospective analysis. imaging consisted of a standard whole-body pet/ct (1 h p.i.), followed by delayed (3 h p.i.) imaging of the abdomen. psa-stratified proportions of positive pet/ct results, standardized uptake values and target-to-background ratios were analyzed, and compared between standard and delayed imaging. results the overall detection rates of [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct were 94.2, 71.8, 58.6, 55.9 and 38.9% for psa levels of >= 2, 1 to < 2, 0.5 to0.2 to < 0.5, and 0.01 to 0.2 ng/ml, respectively. although the target-to-background ratio improved significantly over time (p < 0.0001), the majority (96.6%) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease could already be detected in standard imaging. delayed imaging at 3 h p.i. exclusively identified pathologic findings in 5.4% (10/184) of abnormal [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct scans, and exclusively detected 3.4% (38/1134) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease. [ga-68]psma i&t pet/ct shows high detection rates in patients with prostate-specific antigen persistence or biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. delayed imaging can detect lesions with improved contrast compared to standard imaging. however, the impact on detection rates was limited in this study.
sports_injuries	introduction: patellar dislocation is an emergency. vertical patellar dislocation is rare, often seen in adolescents and mostly due to sports injuries or high-velocity trauma. few cases have been reported in the literature. closed or open reduction under general anesthesia is often needed. we report a case of vertical locked patellar dislocation in a 26-year-old male, which was reduced by a simple closed method under spinal anaesthesia. a literature review regarding the various methods of treatment is also discussed. case presentation: a 26-year-old male experienced a trivial accident while descending stairs, sustaining patellar dislocation. the closed method of reduction was attempted, using a simple technique. reduction was confirmed and postoperative rehabilitation was started. follow-up was uneventful. conclusions: vertical patellar dislocations are encountered rarely in the emergency department. adolescents are not the only victims, and high-velocity trauma is not the essential cause. unnecessary manipulation should be avoided. the closed reduction method is simple, but the surgeon should be prepared for open reduction.
senior_health	objective: to assess the effect of introducing consensus guidelines on avoidable blood transfusions in mwanza region, tanzania. methods: avoidable blood transfusions were determined among 842 blood transfusion recipients in eight hospitals in 1991. in a workshop with senior health workers from the region, consensus guidelines for the prescription of blood transfusions were developed and introduced in the hospitals and after 7 months intervention data were collected on 1042 blood transfusion recipients. the 1991 and 1992 data were compared to estimate the change in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions. results: in blood transfusion recipients aged <5 years there was a significant reduction in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions from 257 (52%) out of 498 to 197 (33%) out of 595 (p<0.001), especially at the peripheral hospitals. for children the proportion decreased from 25 to 17% (p<0.05) and for operated patients the percentage remained at 24%. in pregnant women there was a significant increase in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions from 10 to 27% and in adults from 37 (25%) out of 146 to 121 (50%) out of 242. the improvement in peripheral hospitals was offset by a similar deterioration in the referral hospital, thus no overall reduction was achieved in the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions. conclusion: the development and introduction of consensus guidelines was not sufficient to change prescribing practice. the proportion of avoidable blood transfusions decreased only in hospitals where compliance was maintained through regular clinic meetings and strict supervision by senior medical staff.
multiple_sclerosis	purposemagnetic susceptibility is a physical property of matter that varies depending on chemical composition and abundance of different molecular species. interest is growing in mapping of magnetic susceptibility in the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging techniques, but the influences affecting the mapped values are not fully understood. methodswe performed quantitative susceptibility mapping on 7 tesla (t) multiple echo time gradient recalled echo data and evaluated the trend in 10 regions of the human brain. temporal plots of susceptibility were performed in the caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, insula, red nucleus, substantia nigra, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and fornix. we implemented an existing three compartment signal model and used optimization to fit the experimental result to assess the influences that could be responsible for our findings. resultsthe temporal trend in susceptibility is different for different brain regions, and subsegmentation of specific regions suggests that differences are likely to be attributable to variations in tissue structure and composition. using a signal model, we verified that a nonlinear temporal behavior in experimentally computed susceptibility within imaging voxels may be the result of the heterogeneous composition of tissue properties. conclusionsdecomposition of voxel constituents into meaningful parameters may lead to informative measures that reflect changes in tissue microstructure. magn reson med 77:1946-1958, 2017.

hepatitis_c	hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is currently the most important cause of chronic viral hepatitis in the world and one of the most frequent indications for liver transplantation. hcv uses different strategies to evade the innate and adaptive immune response, and this evasion plays a key role in determining viral persistence. several hcv viral proteins have been described as immune modulators. in this review, we will focus on the effect of hcv nucleocapsid core protein in the function of immune cells and its correlation with the findings observed in hcv chronically infected patients. effects on immune cell function related to both extracellular and intracellular hcv core localization will be considered. this review provides an updated perspective on the mechanisms involved in hcv evasion related to one single hcv protein, which could become a key tool in the development of new antiviral strategies able to control and/or eradicate hcv infection.
weight_loss	the present study aimed to determine the effect of a green tea supplement on anthropometric indices and inflammatory factors in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). in this randomized clinical trial, 45 women with pcos were randomly allocated into two groups receiving green tea tablets or placebo. the period of intervention was 45days. the serum levels of interleukin 6, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor were measured before and after intervention period using the related kits. anthropometric indices also were measured. the mean of body mass index, weight, waist circumference, and body fat percentage in the green tea group were reduced significantly. however, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. also, there was no significant effect on the levels of inflammatory factors. the present results suggest that daily consumption of green tea tablets did not cause any effect on inflammation biomarkers in pcos women. however, it may be effective as a complementary treatment for weight control in these women. copyright (c) 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.
low_testosterone	serum testosterone is reduced in up to 90% of men with cirrhosis, with levels falling as liver disease advances. testosterone is an important anabolic hormone, with effects on muscle, bone, and hematopoiesis. many of the features of advanced liver disease are similar to those seen in hypogonadal men, including sarcopenia, osteoporosis, gynecomastia, and low libido. however, the relative contribution of testosterone deficiency to the symptomatology of advanced liver disease has not been well established. more recently, it has been demonstrated that low testosterone in men with cirrhosis is associated with increased mortality, independent of the classically recognized prognostic factors, such as the model for end-stage liver disease score. only several small clinical trials have examined the role of testosterone therapy in men with cirrhosis, none of which have resolved the issue of whether or not testosterone is beneficial. however, in men with organic hypogonadism due to structural hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis disease, testosterone therapy has been shown to improve muscle mass and bone mineral density, increase hemoglobin, and reduce insulin resistance. despite initial concerns linking testosterone with hepatocellular carcinoma, more recent data suggest that this risk has been overstated. there is, therefore, now a strong rationale to assess the efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy in cirrhosis in well-designed randomized controlled trials.
fungal_infection	near-infrared (nir) hyperspectral imaging system was used to detect five concentration levels of ochratoxin a (ota) in contaminated wheat kernels. the wheat kernels artificially inoculated with two different ota producing penicillium verrucosum strains, two different non-toxigenic p. verrucosum strains, and sterile control wheat kernels were subjected to nir hyperspectral imaging. the acquired three-dimensional data were reshaped into readable two-dimensional data. principal component analysis (pca) was applied to the two dimensional data to identify the key wavelengths which had greater significance in detecting ota contamination in wheat. statistical and histogram features extracted at the key wavelengths were used in the linear, quadratic and mahalanobis statistical discriminant models to differentiate between sterile control, five concentration levels of ota contamination in wheat kernels, and five infection levels of non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels. the classification models differentiated sterile control samples from ota contaminated wheat kernels and non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels with a 100% accuracy. the classification models also differentiated between five concentration levels of ota contaminated wheat kernels and between five infection levels of non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels with a correct classification of more than 98%. the non-ota producing p. verrucosum inoculated wheat kernels and ota contaminated wheat kernels subjected to hyperspectral imaging provided different spectral patterns. crown copyright (c) 2017 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.

parenting	backgroundpractices to facilitate self-determination have not received appropriate attention in research concerning parents with intellectual disabilities (id). likewise, parenting interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities have seldom observed both parent and child behavioural outcomes. methodsthis study evaluated the effectiveness of a parenting intervention embedded with self-determination facilitation practices for two dyads of a parent with intellectual disabilities and their young child. the interventions focused on increasing parents' ability to correctly implement steps of a parenting routine while reducing occurrence of challenging child behaviour. resultsthe results of the study demonstrated two basic effects of correctly completed steps of the parenting routine and a reduction of challenging child behaviour. parents also reported decreased feelings of stress during the routine following completion of the intervention. conclusionsimplications for future research and replication of this pilot study are discussed.
birth_control	the role of secularization in the european fertility decline has been of interest to demographers, who often explore the relationship on a macro-level or by identifying religious affiliation by proxy. however, the relationship has not been thoroughly studied on an individual level utilizing indicators of personal religious conviction and affiliation. the aim of the present article is to examine reproductive practices by religious affiliation in order to understand the impact of secularization on fertility decline. this is accomplished using event history analysis of longitudinal parish register data from sundsvall (1860-1921) where religious affiliation is identified on a family level. reproductive practices are analysed using cohort tfr, descriptive statistics and cox proportional hazard regressions. free-church affiliates had, overall, a higher probability of having another child than did affiliates to the state church. however, these differences decreased over time, and as fertility dropped throughout society free-church affiliates showed the strongest significant reduction in probability of another birth. this indicates that over time, within the free churches, ideas about respectability and restraint came to mean that birth control, in the form of abstinence within marriage, became an important practice in the formation of gendered religious identities - leading to a relatively early decrease in fertility.
heart_disease	an increasing evidence base suggests that low bone mineral density (bmd) and fractures are associated with cardiovascular disease (cvd). we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence of low bmd and fractures as risk factors for future cvd. two independent authors searched major databases from inception to august 1, 2016, for longitudinal studies reporting data on cvd incidence (overall and specific cvd) and bmd status and fractures. the association between low bmd, fractures, and cvd across longitudinal studies was explored by calculating pooled adjusted hazard ratios (hrs)+/- 95% confidence intervals (cis) with a random-effects meta-analysis. twenty-eight studies (18 regarding bmd and 10 fractures) followed a total of 1,107,885 participants for a median of 5 years. taking those with higher bmd as the reference, people with low bmd were at increased risk of developing cvd during follow-up (11 studies; hr=1.33; 95%ci, 1.27 to 1.38; i-2=53%), after adjusting for a median of eight confounders. this finding was confirmed using a decrease in one standard deviation of baseline bmd (9 studies; hr=1.16; 95% ci, 1.09 to 1.24; i-2=69%). the presence of fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing cvd (hr=1.20; 95% ci, 1.06 to 1.37; i-2=91%). regarding specific cvds, low bmd was associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular conditions, and cvd-associated death. fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular conditions and death due to cvd. in conclusion, low bmd and fractures are associated with a small, but significant increased risk of cvd risk and possibly death.

allergies	introduction: the therapeutic use of animals has been debated for decades, and its use explored in a variety of settings and populations. however, there is no uniformity on naming these interventions. evidence based knowledge is essential to implement effective strategies in hospital. this review focused on the use of animal programs for hospitalized patients, and considered the potential risks. methods: the following databases were searched: pubmed, scopus, psychinfo, ebsco animals, proquest, web of science, cinahl, and medline, and prisma guidelines were adhered to. results: out of 432 articles were identified 36 articles suitable for inclusion into the review. data was heterogeneous in terms of age of patient, health issue, animals used and the length of interactions, which made comparison problematic. studies on children, psychiatric and elderly patients were the most common. the animal-intervention programs suggested various benefits such as reducing stress, pain and anxiety. other outcomes considered were changes in vital signs, and nutritional intake. most studies used dogs, but other animals were effectively employed. the major risks outlined were allergies, infections and animal-related accidents. zoonosis was a possible risk, as well as common infections as methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus. the implementation of simple hygiene protocols was effective at minimizing risk. the literature suggested that the benefits outweighed by far the risks. conclusion: the human relationship with animals can be useful and relatively safe for inpatients with various problems. moreover, the implementation of security precautions and the careful selection of patients should minimize the risks, particularly those infection-related. many aspects remain unclear, further studies are required.

menopause	objective: the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator, the pituitary gonadotropes, the ovaries, and the uterus play a crucial role in female fertility. a decline in reproductive performance represents a complex interplay of actions at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. recently, in the field of female reproductive aging attention is drawn to the carbonyl stress theory. advanced glycation end products (ages) contribute directly to protein damage, induce a chain of oxidative stress (os) reactions, and increase inflammatory reactions. here, we highlight some of the mechanisms underlying glycation damage in the ovary. methods: searches of electronic databases were performed. articles relevant to possible role of os, ages, and receptor for age (rage) in aging ovary were summarized in this interpretive literature review. results: follicular microenvironment undergoes an increase in os with aging. data support the role of os in ovulatory dysfunction because ages are well-recognized mediators of increased os. rage and age-modified proteins with activated nuclear factor-kappa b are expressed in human ovarian tissue. it was suggested that accumulation of ages products at the level of the ovarian follicle might trigger early ovarian aging or could be responsible for reduced glucose uptake by granulosa cells, potentially altering follicular growth. moreover, impaired methylglyoxal detoxification causing relevant damage to the ovarian proteome might be one of the mechanisms underlying reproductive aging. conclusions: further investigation of the role for the age-rage axis in the ovarian follicular environment is needed, and results could relate to assisted reproduction technology outcomes and new measures of ovarian reserve.
emergency_contraception	in argentina, campaigns for the recognition of sexual and reproductive rights have sparked opposition through litigation in which the dynamics of legal action have come from self-proclaimed ""pro-life"" ngo5, particularly since 1998, when the conservative ngo portal de belen successfully achieved the banning of emergency contraception through the courts. the activities of these groups, acting as a ""civil arm"" of religion, are focused primarily on obstructing access to legally permissible abortions and bringing about the withdrawal of a number of recognized public policies on sexual and reproductive health, particularly the 2002 national programme for sexual health and responsible procreation. this paper analyzes the litigation strategies of these conservative ngos and how their use of the courts in argentina has changed over the years. it gives examples of efforts in local courts to block individual young women from accessing legal abortion following rape, despite a ruling by the national supreme court of justice in 2012 that no judicial permission is required. in spite of major advances, the renewed influence of the catholic hierarchy in the argentine political scene with the accession of the new pope poses challenges to the work by feminists and women 's movements to extend and consolidate sexual and reproductive rights.

skin_care	a sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was established for the simultaneous determination of thirteen n-nitrosamines (nas) in skin care cosmetics. the cosmetics samples were firstly dispersed by water and subsequently extracted and purified using salting out-acetonitrile homogeneous extraction method. finally, the extracting solution was concentrated by slow nitrogen gas blowing. all of the samples were separated by innowax capillary chromatographic column, and detected by selected ion monitoring (sim) mode of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and quantified by isotope internal standard method. the method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. under the optimized condition, the calibration curves were linear over the selected concentration ranges of 2-500 mu g/l for all the thirteen analytes, with calculated coefficients of determination (r-2) of greater than 0.996. the limits of detection (lods) and the limits of quantitation (loqs) of the method were 3-15 mu g/kg and 10-50 mu g/kg, respectively. recoveries were calculated at three levels of concentration spiked in two kinds of cosmetics (skin care cream and water). the values were found between 93.8% and 121.0% with relative standard deviation (rsd) values of 2.5-7.2% for intra-day precision (n = 6) and 3.3-6.7% for inter-day precision (n = 5). the method was successfully applied to analyze twenty-two cosmetics samples and n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma) was detected in one sample with the concentration of 207 mu g/kg.

myelofibrosis	we evaluated ruxolitinib in 65 patients with myelofibrosis according to age, sex, time of diagnosis, grade of fibrosis, prognostic score risk, janus kinase (jak) status, primary or secondary myelofibrosis, previous treatment, and dosage. outcome measures were response rate, time to response, duration of response, and event-free survival and survival. kaplan and meier curves show a significant difference in event-free survival according to the prognostic score, in favor of patients with low int1 (p = 0.0009). the cox stepwise model confirmed the result, the int2 high-risk score being the most powerful negative independent parameter (0.001), followed by jak (0.008); other parameters, such as diagnosis more than 5 years earlier, grade iii-iv fibrosis, and ruxolitinib dose have a negligible impact. time to response was shorter (p = 0.001) in primary myelofibrosis. in conclusion, ruxolitinib is effective, with a better outcome in patients with a low-int1 risk score. this may suggest considering an earlier administration in the disease course.
hypothyroidism	hypothyroidism is associated with the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but cellular mechanisms have been scarcely analyzed. thyroid hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of bile acids that are endogenous ligands of the farnesoid receptor (fxr alpha), which have been involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. however, the relationship between thyroid hormones and fxr alpha expression in the liver is yet unknown. control (n = 6) and methimazole-induced hypothyroid (n = 6) female rabbits were used to evaluate the amount of lipids and glycogen, vascularization, hepatocytes proliferation, immune cells infiltration, and expression of fxr alpha. student-t or mann-whitney u tests were carried out to determine significant differences. hypothyroidism induced steatosis, glycogen loss, fibrosis, and a minor vascularization in the liver. in contrast, hypothyroidism increased the proliferation of hepatocytes and the infiltration of mast cells, but did not modify the number of immune cells into sinusoids. these changes were associated with a minor anti-fxr alpha immunoreactivity of periportal hepatocytes and pericentral immune cells. our results suggest that hypothyroidism induces a moderate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, alllowing the hepatic regeneration. the fxr alpha may be involved in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in hypothyroid subjects.
headache	gentiana veitchiorum hemsl., gentianaceae, a traditional tibetan medicine, was used for the treatment of liver jaundice with damp-heat pathogen, as well as for headache and chronic pharyngitis. a rapidultra-performance liquid chromatography, photodiode array detector, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed for the fast and accurate identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of g. veitchiorum. in fact, eighteen compounds were detected and identified on the basis of their mass spectra, fragment characteristics and comparison with published data. especially, the ms fragmentation pathways of iridoid glycosides and flavone c-glycosides were illustrated. five compounds among them were quantified by uhplc-pda, including swertiamarin, gentiopicroside, sweroside, isoorientin, and isovitexin. the proposed method was then validated based on the analyses of linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery. the overall recoveries for the five analytes ranged from 96.54% to 100.81%, with rsd from 1.05% to 1.82%. in addition, ten batches of g. veitchiorum from different areas were also analyzed. the developed method was rapid and reliable for both identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of g. veitchiorum, especially for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of iridoid glycosides and flavone c-glycosides.

overactive_bladder	purpose: nocturia is common and bothersome in older adults, especially those who are also incontinent. since nocturnal polyuria is a major contributor, we examined factors associated with nocturnal polyuria in this population to identify those possibly amenable to intervention. materials and methods: we analyzed baseline data from 2 previously completed studies of urge urinary incontinence. the studies involved 284women (mean age +/- sd 72.9 +/- 7.9 years) who also completed 3-day voiding diaries. participants with a nocturnal polyuria index greater than 33% were categorized as having nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal polyuria index nocturnal urinary volume per 24hour urine volume). associations between nocturnal polyuria and various demographic, clinical and sleep related parameters were determined. results: overall 55% of the participants had nocturnal polyuria. multivariable regression analysis revealed that age, body mass index, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, time spent in bed and duration of first uninterrupted sleep were independent correlates of nocturnal polyuria. participants with a larger nocturnal excretion reported a shorter duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void and worse sleep quality despite spending similar time in bed. conclusions: body mass index, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blockers, time in bed and duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void are independently associated with nocturnal polyuria in older women with urge urinary incontinence, and are potentially modifiable. these findings also confirm the association between sleep and nocturnal polyuria. further studies should explore whether interventions to reduce nocturnal polyuria and/or increase the duration of uninterrupted sleep before first awakening to void would help to improve sleep quality in this population and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for sedative hypnotics.
irritable_bowel_syndrome	backgroundsleep disturbances are well-documented among persons with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). difficulty in falling asleep, shorter sleep time, frequent arousal and awakenings, or non-restorative sleep are the most common manifestations. sleep disturbances are also related to a higher risk of having ibs. some researchers have provided evidence of a positive association between poorer subjective sleep quality and increased severity and frequency in gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms in those with ibs. however, findings from studies using objective sleep and activity measures, such as polysomnography and actigraphy, are inconclusive. purposethis systematic review of the literature between 1990 and 2015 evaluates the evidence of sleep disturbances in adults with ibs and their relationship with gi symptoms.
polycythemia_vera	chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml) is a unique disease entity with overlap components of both myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms. cmml is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm characterized by monocytosis, cytopenias, and extramedullary manifestations such as splenomegaly. the disease is rare and has undergone revisions in its classification. we review the recent classification strategies as well as diagnostic criteria, focusing on the new insights into the genetic alterations and unique pathophysiology of the disease. we also discuss the latest molecular characterization of the disease, including how molecular factors affect current prognostic models. finally, we focus on available treatment strategies, with a special emphasis on experimental and forthcoming therapies.
