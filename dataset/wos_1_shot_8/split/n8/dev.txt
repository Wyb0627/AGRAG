fluid_mechanics	there are 0.6-1.9% of us children who were born with congenital heart malformations. clinical and animal studies suggest that abnormal blood flow forces might play a role in causing these malformation, highlighting the importance of understanding the fetal cardiovascular fluid mechanics. we performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of the right ventricles, based on four-dimensional ultrasound scans of three 20-wk-old normal human fetuses, to characterize their flow and energy dynamics. peak intraventricular pressure gradients were found to be 0.2-0.9 mmhg during systole, and 0.1-0.2 mmhg during diastole. diastolic wall shear stresses were found to be around 1 pa, which could elevate to 2-4 pa during systole in the outflow tract. fetal right ventricles have complex flow patterns featuring two interacting diastolic vortex rings, formed during diastolic e wave and a wave. these rings persisted through the end of systole and elevated wall shear stresses in their proximity. they were observed to conserve similar to 25.0% of peak diastolic kinetic energy to be carried over into the subsequent systole. however, this carried-over kinetic energy did not significantly alter the work done by the heart for ejection. thus, while diastolic vortexes played a significant role in determining spatial patterns and magnitudes of diastolic wall shear stresses, they did not have significant influence on systolic ejection. our results can serve as a baseline for future comparison with diseased hearts.
hydraulics	gully erosion represents one of the most significant types of land degradation in the mediterranean areas, giving place to important on- and off-site effects. in this paper, a second-order gully located in sw spain is analyzed. along the gully, 28 cross-sections were established and measured with a leica tcrm1102 laser total station, approximately every 6 months from 2001 to 2007. the sections were located at variable distance, placing them in areas where active erosion was evident. in total, 13 field measurements were carried out, and the geometric characteristics of 28 cross-sections were obtained. morphometric analyses were carried out in both the main gully and a tributary reach by applying an empirical relationship between channel length and eroded volume. morphometric variables of the gully sections were combined into two dimensionless groups, and a morphological similarity between different linear erosion land forms (rills, ephemeral and permanent gullies) was obtained. then, the coefficient of variation of the calculated volumes was used to compare the instability between the main gully and the tributary reach. finally, the hydraulic geometry of the gully was assessed by calibrating three empirical power equations, which relate bankfull discharge with mean flow velocity, cross-sectional depth and width. the hydraulic characterization of the main gully and the tributary reach was investigated for each field survey and a different behavior was detected. the hydraulic analysis also demonstrated that higher values of discharge provide better predictions of flow velocity; the size of the main and tributary gullies affects the discharge-width relationship; and that gully depth is the variable which can be predicted with the highest accuracy.

computer-aided_design	surface passivation is an essential step for atomistic simulations. there can be many possible surface passivation results for a given device model, such as semiconductor devices that consist of si, gaas, or other materials because the bonding directions of the surface atoms may not be unique. based on the structure analysis of the given model, a generation method with structure descriptor (sdg) is proposed for surface passivation. compared with other existing solutions, the sdg method not only provides trimmer results, but also reduces the torsion angle energy of the model, which is preferred in the simulation of atomistic models. the efficiency of this method was validated through test results from several applications.

machine_design	the integrated starter generator replaces the conventional starter and alternator with one electrical machine handling both functions. start/stop functionality, vehicle launch assistance, and higher speed transient power supplementing enhance the vehicle performance at the lower fuel consumption rate. this functionality requires the electrical machine to provide high starting and launch assistant torque in motoring mode and relatively high power capability over the wide speed range for battery charging. the overall cost of the system is the underlining concern and crucial part of the design optimization. this paper focuses on advantages of induction machines (ims) in automotive industry and an approach to design a cost-effective electrical machine for belted starter-alternator applications. design optimization of the im is described to achieve desired performance, including rotor bar count, solid conductor (bar winding) versus stranded winding design, rotor bar shape optimization, and finally performance maps for the electrical machine, including both predicted and measured results. a thermal study of the machine is also presented, as well as the noise, vibration, and harshness (nvh) consideration in the design selection.
thermodynamics	for many years, the traditional process of gardenia yellow pigment extraction has produced wastewater containing significant quantities of geniposidic acid (gsa), a substance that could be put to pharmacological uses if it could be effectively recovered. this study aimed to provide an efficient adsorption material, d08, for recycling gsa. batch experiments showed that adsorption capacity depends on initial concentration and temperature. the maximal adsorption capacity of gsa onto an anionic exchanger reached 310 mg/g. the pk(a) value of gsa was determined to be 4.21. pore diffusion coefficients (d-p) of gsa for 283, 298 and 313 k were 3.274 x 10(-10), 5.069 x 10(-10) and 7.356 x 10(-10) m(2)/s, respectively. recovery efficiency of gsa was achieved to 99.81 %. in comparison with pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order equations, the pdm model demonstrated the best fit to the kinetics data of gsa adsorption. adsorption/desorption experiments proved that d08 offers great adsorption capacity, high adsorption rate and good repeatability. in order to help us to accurately comprehend the mass transfer process, numerical simulation and post-processing to variables c(r, t) and q(r, t) were performed to clarify the adsorption process.
materials_engineering	the mapping of the human genome is an important basis for the development of new medicals and medical treatments. consequently, it has attracted tremendous research funding over the last decade. on june 2011, the materials genome initiative was announced by the us president obama as collaboration on modeling and advanced materials databases. unfortunately, the materials genome was given a rather vague definition in the announcement. however, the materials genome should be defined in analogy with biological genomes and one may then conclude that: at any moment, the performance of a specific material depends on its chemical composition ( inherent property stored in its genome) and its environment ( external interactions-processing-conditions during usage). the materials genome should thus be defined as a set of information encoded in the language of thermodynamics obtained by careful assessment of experimental data and quantum mechanical calculations from which certain conclusions about the material can be drawn. the calphad databases contain the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of a materials system. such databases allow the prediction of materials structure as well as its response to processing and usage conditions, and are major parts of integrated computational materials engineering.

internal_combustion_engine	internal combustion engines were the technology of choice for propulsion and decentral power supply in the last century. due to the high energy density of hydrocarbon based fuels that could so far not be reached by alternative technologies they will keep their leading role in most applications for the next decades. although, its general functionality seems to be unchanged since its invention, the internal combustion engine has gone through substantial developments driven by various challenges. within these, the pollution control has to be named first due to its role as the main driver for engine and aftertreatment development since the discussions on air quality which started 70 years ago. meanwhile, all industrialized countries and most of the emerging countries have more or less stringent regulations for the main harmful exhaust components (hc, co, nox, particulates). the second main challenge to be named is the reduction of co2 emissions. various engine technologies that are currently used to tackle these global trends lead to major impact on the exhaust aftertreatment components. to tackle these challenges the exhaust aftertreatment development has to be understood as integrated, multi-disciplinary and multi-scale design process considering engine design and operation, on board diagnosis and aftertreatment design and operation likewise.
