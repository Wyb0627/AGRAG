computer-aided_design	in order to improve the fault monitoring performance of grounding electrode lines in ultra-high voltage dc (uhvdc) transmission systems, a novel fault monitoring approach based on the high-frequency voltage standing-wave ratio (vswr) is proposed in this paper. the vswr is defined considering a lossless transmission line, and the characteristics of the vswr under different conditions are analyzed. it is shown that the vswr equals 1 when the terminal resistance completely matches the characteristic impedance of the line, and when a short circuit fault occurs on the grounding electrode line, the vswr will be greater than 1. the vswr will approach positive infinity under metallic earth fault conditions, whereas the vswr in non-metallic earth faults will be smaller. based on these analytical results, a fault supervision criterion is formulated. the effectiveness of the proposed vswr-based fault supervision technique is verified with a typical uhvdc project established in power systems computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including dc(pscad/emtdc). simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can reliably identify the grounding electrode line fault and has strong anti-fault resistance capability.
internal_combustion_engine	progressing limits on pollutant emissions oblige ship owners to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. fuel cells may provide a suitable solution, since they are fuel efficient while they emit few hazardous compounds. various choices can be made with regard to the type of fuel cell system and logistic fuel, and it is unclear which have the best prospects for maritime application. an overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. it is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a refuelling interval up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. the expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships. fuel cell combined cycles, hybridisation with auxiliary electricity storage systems and redundancy improvements are identified as topics for further study.

fluid_mechanics	the fluid mechanics of microfluidics is distinctively simpler than the fluid mechanics of macroscopic systems. in macroscopic systems effects such as non-laminar flow, convection, gravity etc. need to be accounted for all of which can usually be neglected in microfluidic systems. still, there exists only a very limited selection of channel cross-sections for which the navier-stokes equation for pressure-driven poiseuille flow can be solved analytically. from these equations, velocity profiles as well as flow rates can be calculated. however, whenever a cross-section is not highly symmetric (rectangular, elliptical or circular) the navier-stokes equation can usually not be solved analytically. in all of these cases, numerical methods are required. however, in many instances it is not necessary to turn to complex numerical solver packages for deriving, e.g., the velocity profile of a more complex microfluidic channel cross-section. in this paper, a simple spreadsheet analysis tool (here: microsoft excel) will be used to implement a simple numerical scheme which allows solving the navier-stokes equation for arbitrary channel cross-sections.
computer-aided_design	isogeometric analysis has been introduced as an alternative to finite element methods in order to simplify the integration of computer-aided design (cad) software and the discretization of variational problems of continuum mechanics. in contrast with the finite element case, the basis functions of isogeometric analysis are often not nodal. as a consequence, there are fat interfaces which can easily lead to an increase in the number of interface variables after a decomposition of the parameter space into subdomains. building on earlier work on the deluxe version of the bddc (balancing domain decomposition by constraints) family of domain decomposition algorithms, several adaptive algorithms are developed in this paper for scalar elliptic problems in an effort to decrease the dimension of the global, coarse component of these preconditioners. numerical experiments provide evidence that this work can be successful, yielding scalable and quasi-optimal adaptive bddc algorithms for isogeometric discretizations.
strength_of_materials	the development of fibre-reinforced polymer (frp) piping with high corrosion resistance and specific properties is an attractive engineering proposition with high potential. advantageous properties make frp piping a potential candidate for replacing metallic piping structure in the oil and gas industry. despite the advantages associated with frp, their application is limited due to, in part, unsatisfactory methods for joining composite subcomponents and inadequate knowledge of failure mechanism under different loading conditions. aim of the present paper is to study the effect of pipe scaling on the strength of adhesively bonded frp pipes. using finite element analysis, a study was performed to investigate dimensional effects on adhesive joint strength based on strength-of-materials and fracture mechanics considerations. results indicate a shift in failure from adhesive to composite material with increasing pipe diameter. the tsai-wu and von mises failure criteria were employed for the strength analysis of composite pipe sections and the adhesive material, respectively. a fracture mechanics approach was used to assess changes from cohesive failure (within adhesive) to interfacial failure (adhesive/frp interface) with increasing pipe diameters.

internal_combustion_engine	decreasing air pollution concentrations from internal combustion engine (ice), especially agricultural machines and transporters, is more interested. the current treatment methods have many disadvantages, such as low treatment efficiency, high cost, and complex operation. therefore, in this study a gas pollution treatment model from ice by using cold-plasma is designed and manufactured to solve above problems. maha emission testers for diesel and gasoline at the center motor vehicle registration 50-06v at hcm city are used for results evaluation. the results show that the treatment efficiency of co, co2, hc and nox are about 97%, 95%, 34% and 22%, respectively. the model is portable 260x400x140mm, 8kg and plugin 110v/50hz or 12 v dc.
materials_engineering	preparing an effective workforce in high technology is the goal of both academic and industry training, and has been the engine that drives innovation and product development in the united states for over a century. during the last 50 years, technician training has comprised a combination of two-year academic programs, internships and apprentice training, and extensive on-the-job training (ojt). recently, and especially in silicon valley, technicians have four-year college degrees, as well as relevant hands-on training. characterization in general, and microscopy in particular, is an essential tool in process development, manufacturing and qa/qc, and failure analysis. training for a broad range of skills and practice is challenging, especially for community colleges. workforce studies (sri/boeing) suggest that even four year colleges often do not provide the relevant training and experience in laboratory skills, especially design of experiments and analysis of data. companies in high-tech further report difficulty in finding skilled labor, especially with industry specific experience. foothill college, in partnership with ucsc, sjsu, and nasa-ames, has developed a microscopy training program embedded in a research laboratory, itself a partnership between university and government, providing hands-on experience in advanced instrumentation, experimental design and problem solving, with real-world context from small business innovators, in an environment called 'the collaboratory'. the program builds on afm-sem training at foothill, and provides affordable training in fe-sem and tem through a cost recovery model. in addition to instrument and engineering training, the collaboratory also supports academic and personal growth through a multiplayer social network of students, faculty, researchers, and innovators.
strength_of_materials	conveyor belt is one of the most common types of continuous handling equipment used for moving rocks of various sizes horizontally or inclined. from researches done in the exploitation of mineral resources and rocks and from the strength of materials calculations in this paper is observed above the conveyor sizing and other elements of the transporter requires knowing how belt traction forces (tensions thereof) varies on the conveyor length. in all cases the operation of the conveyor belt must be provided without engaging the slip phenomenon and limiting its displacement (between sets of rollers) so conveyor can operating at optimum parameters. the materials that make up a conveyor belt can be divided into two categories: materials for coating plates or outer shell and a resistance part, areas with inserts that can be textile and steel cables. because the bands are subjected to tensile efforts and wear phenomena we determine the maximum strength they can operate without going into permanent deformation regime. conveyor belt dimensioning calculations and other elements of a conveyor varies depending on its length and the carrier operating situations. we can see, also, that sizing conveyor belt and other conveyor components require knowledge of how belt traction forces (tensions thereof) varies along the length of the conveyor. the tensions from the conveyor belt will be study for the climb section and for the descend section. it mentions that the specific resistance to motion of the belt on full branch, consisting of resistances due: current material deformation, rotation rollers camps because pressing rubber layer and roll belt and belt bending. since current material strength due to deformation and bending belt represents a large percentage of total specific resistance to motion, it follows that resistance decreases with decreasing displacement belt between rollers and increase with the effort in belt, respectively. this explains that resistance decreases with increasing length of conveyor (especially when its initial stretch is great), and with increasing conveyor tilt too. also, we observe, from the values of forces calculated in the paper, that the resistance to rotation of the roller bearings decreases with increasing load on the roll, hence the values adopted for specific resistance to movement can be more larger on the empty branch than on the full. knowing how to calculate resistances to motion of the belt, you can fix that occur belt efforts through the points made on the contour method, starting point of the drum motor development and ending point of winding it. these movement resistances calculated for empty and full branches are needed to precisely determine the installed power of the conveyor belt.
machine_design	in this work, we designed a visitor counting machine (vcm) in terms of power efficient circuit using family of three different io standards which are lvttl, mobile ddr, hsul_12. these three different io standards are compared with each other on the basis of clock power, logic power, signal power, ios, leakage power and total power consumption to search the most power efficient one. in order to find the most efficient circuitry, we collected the data of power consumption of these three io standards and then compare them. we have analysed our circuitry at different frequencies of 0.1ghz, 1ghz, 10ghz & 100ghz. in our experiment, there is 99.27% power saving when 0.1ghz is used in place of 100ghz using mobile ddr and we also concluded that when we replace lvttl by hsul at 10ghz frequency, power saving of 96.10% is achieved. to design this energy efficient visitor counting machine, we are using verilog as hdl, xilinx ise 14.2 simulator with artix-7 fpga.
thermodynamics	high strain rate(6.2 x 10(4) s(-1)) loading of zk60 magnesium alloy was carried out with radial collapse of a thick-walled cylinder technology. the evolution of precipitates in solution-treated and peak-aged zk60 magnesium alloy during high strain rate deformation was studied by transmission electron microscopy (tem) for the first time. a large number of elongated rod-like phase were precipitated in solution-treated sample after impacting; the rod-like phases in peak-aged sample experienced shortening and thinning, and some of which finally transformed into spherical-like phases, namely the rod-like phases were preliminarily dissolved into the matrix. based on thermodynamics and kinetics analyses, the high strain rate, high density dislocation, high shear stress and adiabatic temperature rise induced by explosive impact process make it possible for precipitates to precipitate and dissolve preliminarily within about 3.1 mu s.

hydraulics	in the spawning environment of salmonids, the quality of the intergravel flow is an essential abiotic requirement for the survival success of incubated embryos. as one of the most frequently investigated anthropogenic environmental impacts, the enhanced mobilization of fine sediments (< 1 mm) and their entry into riverine ecosystems is considered as a major cause for the degradation of a variety of biological processes and habitats, including the spawning habitats of salmonids. in catchments draining crystalline bedrock, however, like the bohemian massif in the northern part of austria, the excessive loading of river channels with coarse sand and fine gravel sediments (d = 1-10 mm) and less cohesive than fines is common as a consequence of altered catchment land use. here, far less understanding exists of the mechanism and the possible implications of coarse sand infiltration on the functioning of the intergravel flow in salmonid redds. to investigate the intergravel flow hydraulics in response to coarse sand infiltration (d-50 = 2 mm) in brown trout spawning redds (salmo trutta fario) under controlled conditions, a laboratory flume experiment with three infiltration scenarios was conducted: (1) no infiltration; (2) segmental infiltration; and (3) full section infiltration. a more than two times drop in the average intergravel flow velocity was documented from scenario 1 (5.85 cms(-1)) to scenario 2 (2.53 cms(-1)) and another clear reduction was seen from scenario 2 (2.53 cms(-1)) to scenario 3 (1.61 cms(-1)). moreover, in scenario 3, a clear reduction of the intergravel flow distance traveled was observed. based on the findings we conclude that future considerations regarding the sustainable catchment management of salmonid fisheries should include programs to reduce not only the excessive entry of fines, but, in the relevant catchments, also the entry of excessive coarse sand into the riverine ecosystem. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
machine_design	machine design is the most perspective field of study in the faculty of mechanical engineering (fme) at the university of west bohemia with regards to the demand for graduates in this field. these days, the main issue of higher education in the czech republic related to machine design is the lack of opportunities for students of machine design to acquire practical knowledge and experience in the field. the problem is that engineering companies offer work experience only to individual students as they try to hire them after graduation. but engineering companies are not motivated enough to contribute to the machine design teaching process by providing knowledge and experience to the majority of students. as this is not going to change soon, universities have to provide real applications to its students instead. currently, there are not enough opportunities for students to acquire practical knowledge in the field during their studies. the required amount of work experience for engineering students in the czech republic is only one week, which is insufficient in comparison with the german system, where internship semesters are a mandatory part of studying at a fachhochschule (university of applied sciences). it is necessary to provide practical information and real applications in class to compensate for the lack of practical experience. fme is concerned in this matter and it has launched the project for enhancement of the teaching process. a new concept of electronic learning materials for machine design was developed as a part of the project. the learning materials were developed by academics in cooperation with local engineering companies to provide students and academics at fme with real design projects reworked for learning purposes. the machine design teaching process is complicated due to the complexity of the mechanical design process, as it has its own particularities which need to be considered while creating learning materials. when describing the mechanical design process, not only the design process itself has to be described. also the production processes, project schedules, economic aspects of the design project, legislative, technical standards and regulations have to be described as well. as these parts of the mechanical design process affect each other, it is important to describe them in the context of the mechanical design process to show the interconnection between them. the electronic form of learning materials was selected as it offers many advantages over the standard printed form. the main reason for selecting the electronic form of learning materials is the ability to work with computer-aided engineering (cae) models. three-dimensional cae models replaced drawing boards in every engineering company several years ago and thus it is important to include cae models in the machine design teaching process. thanks to the technology of exporting cae models to the standard portable document format (pdf) it is possible to modify cae models for learning purposes and use them as a learning tool. cae models can be enhanced with a large amount of information regarding a design project such as manufacturing processes, materials or component functions and can be supplemented by technical drawings, illustrated project descriptions and further information. all the learning material is converted into a single pdf file so that every student can access it anywhere, anytime. versatility and interactivity are the biggest benefits of the new electronic learning materials. the new electronic learning materials can be used when explaining new subject matter to show its application, or as a basis for students' assignments, individual work, teamwork or dissertations. the sample electronic learning materials are being produced and will be made available to students through the courseware of the university of west bohemia. this paper intends to present the learning materials and describe their form, structure and content and their benefits for academics and students of machine design.
hydraulics	among the different processes for producing biodiesel fuel, the use of methanol under conditions near to the critical point is a promissory alternative. the reactive distillation has been proposed to reduce the energy requirements of the esterification step in this process. such reductions are accompanied by reductions in the total annual costs and the environmental impact. however, due to the conditions under which the column should be operated, special care must be taken in the design of the trays and their hydraulic performance. proper design of the trays should prevent operational problems. in this work, a strategy for the mechanical design of sieve trays in a homogeneous reactive distillation column is presented. in the column, oleic acid is esterified with methanol under a pressure of 7 mpa. the designs obtained are tested in terms of hydraulics through cfd simulations. cfd analysis is carried out using ansys fluent software.

internal_combustion_engine	in this paper, several kinds of improved modes for exhaust gas turbocharging (egt) have been investigated on the transient performances, including steam-assisted turbocharging (sat), electronically controlled turbocharging (ect) and supercharger-exhaust gas turbocharging (set). a turbocharged gasoline engine was employed a the study object, which was conducted bench test firstly to get basic data for building and calibrating the simulation model. then, an accurate and reliable gt-power model in steady and transient engine operation was developed. on this basis, the transient processes of four types of engines: egt engine, set engine, sat engine and ect engine were investigated by simulation and comparative analysis. the results show that set, sat and ect can reduce the response time and fuel consumption in acceleration process. the response time of various turbocharging approaches follows the descending sequence of egt, sat, ect and set. at the speed of 2000 r/min (from idling to full load), compared with egt engine, the specific fuel consumption (sfc) of set engine is decreased by 23.3%, while it can be reduced by 38.2% and 36.3% in sat engine and ect engine, respectively. finally, to reveal the improvement potentials of sat and ect, both of them were re-matched with a larger turbine without wastegate. the results indicate that the torque and thermal efficiency of sat and ect engines can be further improved, while the acceleration equilibrium time is increased.

hydraulics	this work presents an application of the forward and inverse predictive modeling methodology of cacuci and ionescu-bujor (2010) in the inverse mode to determine, within a tight a priori specified convergence criterion and overall accuracy, an unknown time-dependent boundary condition (specifically, the time-dependent inlet acid concentration) for a dissolver model case study by using measurements of the state function (specifically, the time-dependent acid concentration) at a specified location (specifically, in the dissolver 's compartment farthest from the inlet). the unknown time-dependent boundary condition is described by 635 unknown discrete scalar parameters. this forward and inverse predictive modeling methodology uses the maximum entropy principle to construct an optimal approximation of the unknown a priori distribution by using the a priori known mean values and uncertainties characterizing the model parameters, along with the computed and experimentally measured model responses and their covariances. this a priori distribution is subsequently combined using bayes' theorem with the likelihood provided by the computational model. the first-order response sensitivities serve as weighting functions in this objective combination of computational and experimental information. the use of the maximum entropy principle enables the forward and inverse predictive modeling of cacuci and ionescu-bujor (2010) to construct an intrinsic regularizing metric for solving any inverse problem. in the present dissolver case study, the unknown time-dependent boundary condition is predicted by the methodology within an a priori selected convergence criterion, without user intervention and/or introduction of arbitrary regularization parameters, as the currently popular procedures need to do. this predictive modeling methodology yields optimally calibrated values for all model parameters, with reduced predicted uncertainties, as well as optimal (best-estimate) predicted values for the model responses (in this case study, the time-dependent acid concentrations in the dissolver 's compartments), also with reduced predicted uncertainties. notably, even though the experimental data pertain solely to the compartment farthest from the inlet (where the data were measured), the application of this predictive modeling methodology actually improves the predicted values and reduces their predicted uncertainties not only in the compartment in which the data were actually measured but also throughout the entire dissolver, including the compartment farthest from the measurements (i.e., at the inlet). this is because this forward and inverse predictive modeling methodology combines and transmits information simultaneously over the entire phase-space, comprising all time steps and spatial locations. these results underscore the importance of this work in presenting the objective resolution (i.e., resolution in the absence of user-defined subjective adjustment of arbitrary regularization parameters) of a time-dependent inverse case study of potential importance to diversion activities associated with proliferation and international safeguards. the results obtained in this work establish confidence in the dissolver model 's accuracy for simulating the acid concentrations required to dissolve used nuclear fuel. in turn, these results will be used to generate source terms for key reprocessing facility components downstream and to support material accountability for nuclear safeguards.
fluid_mechanics	laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale meandering compound channel to investigate the flow patterns at the apex and cross-over sections. an equation in curvilinear co-ordinates was derived from the momentum equation and the flow continuity equation. in this equation, two shear stress terms are ignored due to their negligible contributions such that simple expressions are obtained. several groups of experimental data from the published literature were used to verify this model. comparison of the experimental and predictive results indicates that the proposed method is capable of accurately forecasting the stage discharge in meandering compound channels. finally, the simple analytical solution of this model and the velocity parameter are further discussed.

computer-aided_design	three-dimensional point cloud registration is important in reverse engineering. in this paper, we propose a registration method for large-scale 3d point clouds, which is based on neighborhood constraints of geometrical features. the method consists of initial and exact registration steps.in the process of initial registration, we define a new functon that measures feature similarity by calculating the distance function, and in the process of exact registration, we introduce the angle information that improve the accuracy of iterative closest point algorithm. compared with the traditional feature-based and iterative closest point algorithms, our method significantly reduced the registration time by 11.9 % and has only 1 % of the registration error of the traditional feature-based algorithm. the proposed algorithm can be used to create efficient 3d models for virtual plant reconstruction and computer-aided design, and the registration results can provide a reference for virtual plant reconstruction and growth.
manufacturing_engineering	the purpose of this study is to develop a new method for designing compression sportswear from the viewpoint of force by simulation. applied simulation techniques are 1) skin strain simulation, 2) fabric strain simulation using the anisotropic hyperelastic model, and 3) musculoskeletal simulation. for skin strain simulations, a three dimensional computer graphic (3d-cg) polygon strain was calculated as a skin strain using a 3d-cg model that simulates the human body (cg-human-model). the initial strain and the strain caused by physical exercise were given to the polygon model representing the shape of the sportswear (cg-sportswear-model). for compression sportswear, the strain of the fabric is approximately the same as skin strain, thus the strain of the cg-human-model was given to the cg-sportswear-model. in-plane and out-of-plane forces resulting from the cg-sportswear-model are calculated using anisotropic hyperelastic models. these forces were given to the musculoskeletal simulation as the external forces, and muscle activity required for any given physical exercise (e. g. swimming motion) was calculated. information of forces and muscle activity are very useful in designing compression sportswear. it is believed that this new method for designing compression sportswear based on simulation is a sophisticated technique because this method takes into account not only forces resulting from sportswear but also the effect of these forces on physical exercise.

manufacturing_engineering	the future world of micro and nano dimensions is leading to the generation of a whole new range of products, particularly engineered medical and healthcare diagnostics, industrial, optical telecommunications aerospace applications and textiles. many current manufacturing processes are based on lithographic techniques that have traditionally driven silicon micro ic production but the new drive is for low cost, high precision products with greater functionality based on non-silicon materials such as polymers, ceramics, glass and metals. machining micro and nano structures in non-silicon materials requires new process technologies and these are being developed at new facilities at the manufacturing engineering centre at cardiff university. known as microbridge, the facilities provide an open access micro and nano engineering and manufacturing service to uk industry. this provides a suite of equipment and facilities based on a focused ion beam milling machine, a picosecond laser ablation system and nano imprinting lithograph and which complement an already established range of micro machining equipment.
internal_combustion_engine	a semiempirical reciprocating compressor model was developed to characterize the time response of the pressure within a compressed-natural-gas storage tank. the model assumes isentropic compression in the single-stage compressor that feeds into an isothermal reservoir, i.e. compression heat was assumed to dissipate between the cylinder and the tank. this low-order model utilizes a few key variables such as the compression ratio, the cylinder volume, the tank volume, and the engine speed and yields a reasonable approximation for the pressure inside a tank over time. the natural-gas compressor used to validate the model is a unique automotive internal-combustion engine that was heavily modified to have two distinct modes. in one mode, all engine cylinders fire normally providing locomotion for a natural-gas vehicle. in the other mode, one cylinder of the engine is used to compress low-pressure residential natural gas, in multiple stages, to a standard us compressed-natural-gas vehicle storage tank pressure of 248 bar (3600 lb/in(2) gauge). it was found that the first-order response model closely matches the trend in the tank pressure over time seen in laboratory experiments, with a typical error of less than 5%.
strength_of_materials	the microstructures of metallic materials become extremely refined and their mechanical strengths exhibit considerable anisotropy when subjected to severe plastic deformation by equal channel angular pressing (ecap). the small punch (sp) testing method was employed as a substitute for the standard tension test to assess the anisotropic tensile strength of materials produced by ecap. sp testing is a viable alternative to standard tension tests because ecap samples are usually limited to approximately 10 mm in length in the transverse direction perpendicular to the extrusion (longitudinal) direction of the ecap process and the dimensions of the sp test specimen are 10 mm x 10 mm x 0.5 mm. the sp tests were performed using specimens of over-aged aluminum 2024 alloy subjected to three ecap passes at 150 degrees c and extracted by wire cutting along the longitudinal and transverse axes. the failure surfaces of sp specimens after testing showed that failure was caused by shear deformation and that ecap-processed materials displayed anisotropic strength. based on these results, a method is proposed to assess tensile strength along both the transverse and the longitudinal axes of ecap materials exhibiting anisotropic strength. the validity of the proposed method was verified through a comparison of its performance evaluating plastic flow strength with measurements obtained by tension tests along the longitudinal axis.

hydraulics	in the present work, hydrodynamics and mass-transfer performance of vapor-liquid flow of orthogonal wave tray (owt) column was studied. dry pressure drop, operating range (capacity graph) and overall column efficiency of owt column were investigated using pilot columns. a three-dimensional cfd model was developed within the two-phase eulerian framework to have an insight into the two-phase flow and mass-transfer behavior of owt. the simulated results were compared with experimental data and showed a good agreement. hydrodynamic and mass-transfer behaviors were revealed with the aid of velocity profiles, streamlines, interfacial area density distribution and so on. the effects of vapor/liquid load (f-s factor) on the murphree tray efficiency were also studied. the simulations of owt with different waves showed that the pressure drop, clear liquid height, froth height and murphree tray efficiency increase with the increase of slope, and owt with middle slope tended to have more uniform foam layer. comparison of the liquid-phase component velocity between owt and ripple shows that owt has better performance in froth layer distribution and stability. the mass-transfer data showed that owt not only had almost the same ""peak efficiency"" as sieve tray, but also had higher capacity and stability, it was suitable for capacity expansion.

machine_design	this paper presents an integrated error propagation analysis method to estimate the measurement uncertainty using monte carlo method in order to analyze the measurement accuracy of an h-drive stage with air bearing during high acceleration subjected to the influence of a variety of errors, including straightness errors, thermal errors, deformation errors and air bearing gap change errors caused by acceleration force. firstly, the integrated error propagation model of an h-drive stage is built combined with the effects of the various error sources based on the multi-body system and instrument precision theory. then these errors are identified by experiments and finite element analysis and the influence of each error in six degrees of freedom displacement is obtained. finally, the displacement measurement uncertainty of the stage in the reference coordinate system is evaluated by monte carlo method, within 95% probability, the displacement measurement results and the expanded uncertainty in x and y directions are calculated x=(165.000 +/- 0.064) mm and y=(195.000 +/- 0.054) mm respectively. the proposed method can be used in the error budget of precise machine design and applied in error compensation to improve the measurement and control accuracy of precise machine workpiece stage.

internal_combustion_engine	concerns with environmental impacts of urban mobility have led to the development of alternative solutions, such as battery electric vehicles (bev), highly applicable to certain sectors namely in urban logistics, since bev powertrain characteristics are extremely suited for urban driving context. this research work evaluates the adequacy of bev in urban logistics in lisbon, based on a real-world application. vehicle second-by-second data was collected during regular operation of both the internal combustion engine vehicle (icev) and the bev (for 7 and 3 months respectively). the results demonstrate that bev allows maintaining the same operation patterns, regarding the number of kilometers travelled per day (60 km), recharging time (6 h), and vehicle dynamics (average speed of 16 km/h for icev and 19 km/h for bev). when comparing the energy impacts of shifting to electric mobility, the bev allows reducing vehicle usage energy consumption by 76% and by 57% when considering the energy production stage. the logistics operations performance was not affected by the vehicle technology shift, since the operational requirements of the service were maintained and no issues on electric autonomy and recharging periods were observed, confirming the suitability of this vehicle technology for specific urban logistics applications.

thermodynamics	the hydrophobic drug lamotrigine (ltg) shows low bioavailability after oral administration. work has been performed to improve the aqueous solubility of ltg using the micelles of amphiphilic block copolymers. polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide triblock copolymers (peo-ppo-peo), known as pluronic((r)), have been the subject of current interest due to the versatile structural possibilities of varying peo/ppo ratios. incorporation of ltg in the aqueous micellar solutions of pluronic((r)) f127 was investigated using uv-visible spectroscopy. the shapes and size of the micelles with and without ltg have been ascertained using dynamic light scattering and small angle neutron scattering experiments. results show increase in the pluronic((r)) micellar size with hard sphere radius with the incorporation of ltg. the effect of hydrophilic polymers (peg1500 and f68) on the ltg-incorporated pluronic((r)) f127 micelles was also studied and found inefficient for enhancement of the solubility of ltg. solid forms of ltg-incorporated pluronic((r)) f127 micelles with and without hydrophilic polymers, coded as lpms, were successfully prepared through the thin-film hydration method. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis have been used to ensure the compatibility of the ltg with pluronic((r)) f127 micelles in prepared lpms. all the lpms showed good incorporation efficiency, loading capacity and the sustained release profile of ltg. results showed no specific improvement with the addition of hydrophilic polymers in the studied concentration range.
strength_of_materials	in this work, a model to simulate the superelastic response for shape memory alloy wires and springs subjected to torsional loading is constructed by combining thermodynamics principles along with preisach models. following doraiswamy et al. (2011), a gibbs potential based formulation is employed to separate the thermoelastic response of the shape memory alloys from its dissipative response. the dissipative part is then modeled with a discrete preisach approach. rather than beginning with a full three dimensional model and solving for non-homogeneous shear stresses across the specimen cross-section, a ""strength of materials"" approach that can directly model the torsional response using experimentally measurable quantities such as torque and angle of twist is developed. the model results are verified with experiments performed on shape memory alloy springs at three different temperatures. the model is also used to predict torsion response of shape memory alloy wires at different twists and temperatures using experimental results for only one twist or temperature case respectively. the torsional response for three different wire diameters were predicted using experimental data for one diameter case.

internal_combustion_engine	the internal combustion engine (ice) does not efficiently convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. a majority of this energy is dissipated as heat in the exhaust and coolant. rather than directly improving the efficiency of the engine, efforts are being made to improve the efficiency of the engine indirectly by using a waste heat recovery system. two promising technologies that were found to be useful for this purpose were thermoelectric generators (tegs) and heat pipes. both tegs and heat pipes are solid state, passive, silent, scalable and durable. the use of heat pipes can potentially reduce the thermal resistance and pressure losses in the system as well as temperature regulation of the tegs and increased design flexibility. tegs do have limitations such as low temperature limits and relatively low efficiency. heat pipes do have limitations such as maximum rates of heat transfer and temperature limits. when used in conjunction, these technologies have the potential to create a completely solid state and passive waste heat recovery system.

computer-aided_design	introduction: combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) has not allowed the cure of hiv. the main obstacle to hiv eradication is the existence of quiescent reservoirs. several other limitations of cart have been described, such as strict life-long treatment and high costs, restricting it to western countries, as well as the development of multidrug resistance. given these limitations and the impetus to find a cure, the development of new treatments is necessary.areas covered: in this review, we discuss the current status of several efficient molecules able to suppress hiv gene transcription, including nf-kb and tat inhibitors. we also assess the potential of new proteins belonging to the intriguing ding family, which have been reported to have potential anti-hiv-1 activity by inhibiting hiv gene transcription.expert opinion: targeting hiv-1 gene transcription is an alternative approach, which could overcome cart-related issues, such as the emergence of multidrug resistance. improving cart will rely on the identification and characterization of new actors inhibiting hiv-1 transcription. combining such efforts with the use of new technologies, the development of new models for preclinical studies, and improvement in drug delivery will considerably reduce drug toxicity and thus increase patient adherence.
hydraulics	leaf mass per area (lma) is a primary plant functional trait that represents the cost of constructing a leaf. ultimately, plants modify lma by altering leaf thickness (lt), leaf dry matter content (ldmc), or both. while lma can be modified through both of these constituents, studies of lma have found that there is variation in whether lt or ldmc changes are responsible for lma-and the relationships change depending on the species or functional groups being compared. in this study, we used a phylogenetic framework to determine that evolutionary shifts in lma are driven by lt, and not ldmc, among 45 serengeti grass species. we considered two alternative hypotheses that could result in evolutionary correlation of lma on lt but not ldmc: either (1) lt is more labile than ldmc-and is therefore a less costly means to change lma or (2) ldmc is tightly coupled to a different dimension of leaf variation (e.g., leaf hydraulics), leaving lt as the source of variation in lma. lt was not more labile than ldmc, leading us to conclude that the evolution of lma has been shaped by lt because ldmc is responding to other demands on leaf physiology. we speculate that leaf hydraulics provide this constraint on ldmc. the decoupling of ldmc from lt may allow plants to better optimize resource allocation in ecosystems where gradients in light competition, herbivory, and aridity place competing demands on leaf economics.
strength_of_materials	the nonlinear load-displacement and normal stress distribution in composite sandwich beams made of unidirectional carbon/epoxy facings and pvc foam cores under bending was studied. the carbon/epoxy after an initial linear response exhibits a stiffening nonlinearity in tension and a softening nonlinearity in compression with the longitudinal strength in tension higher than that in compression. the foam core also presents a nonlinear stress-strain response. it was obtained that the load-displacement behaviour of the beam, after an initial linear part, is not linear. this behavior was modeled by an incremental strength of materials nonlinear analysis. the theoretical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. furthermore, it was obtained that the neutral axis of sandwich beams under bending does not pass through the centroid of the cross section, but is displaced toward the tensile side of the beam. experimental results by moire measurements of the in-plane horizontal displacements of the core material corroborated the analytical predictions. these findings imply higher compressive and smaller tensile stresses in the core, than those predicted for facings with identical stress-strain behaviour in tension and compression, and should be taking into consideration in the failure analysis of sandwich beams.
computer-aided_design	the 2-d analytical solution of electrostatic potential and enhanced drain current is modeled for a dual metal surround gate junctionless transistor (dmsgjlt) by solving the poisson equation using the parabolic approximation technique. the gate engineered dmsgjlt produces an increase in the mobility of electrons in the channel. enhancement in drain current of 35 mu a is obtained than single metal jlt for the same dimension. due to that, the gain increases, short channel effects and leakage current decreases. the electrostatic potential, threshold voltage, drain current, transconductance, drain-induced barrier lowering, power and delay predicted by the analytical solution have excellent agreement with the simulation results obtained from technology computer-aided design. the analytical modeling provides useful insight on physics of short channel effects. the inverter circuit is implemented with a dmsgjlt and is compared with that of a single metal device. the noise margin analysis is made for the inverter circuit employing both dual metal and single metal devices. it is found that gate engineering improves the noise margin to a much extend and due to this, the voltage loss is also improved with a dmsgjlt.
internal_combustion_engine	this research paper mainly deals with a comprehensive techno-economic modeling and multi objective optimization of a cchp system for residential application. an internal combustion engine (ice) proposed as the prime power and a combined organic rankine cycle (orc), ejector refrigeration cycle (erc), and domestic water heater (dwh) is considered to recover the wasted heat from the ice through exhaust gas and water jacket. their common working fluids namely r-134a, r-600, r-123, and r-11 are selected in this study. a comprehensive multi-objective optimization is applied to determine the optimal design parameters of the system. two major objective functions, exergy efficiency that should be maximized and total cost rate of the system to be minimized are considered while satisfying several reasonable constraints. the total cost rate as an objective function consists of purchase equipment costs, fuel cost, and environmental impact cost. diesel engine capacity, diesel engine part load, expander inlet pressure, expander extraction pressure, extraction ratio, condenser pressure, and evaporator pressure are selected as decision variables. a developed multi-objective genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool with ability of better optimal results with less computer running time. it is observed that r-11 working fluid is a good candidate from both exergy efficiency and total cost rate point of view. to examine the effect of each decision variable on objective functions, a sensitivity analysis is performed. finally, the ability of the system is studied to meet the cooling, heating, and electricity demand of a detached house with a defined load in tehran.

thermodynamics	gaseous helium is being considered as a cryogen for a variety of high-power density applications. it is capable of reaching operational temperature levels as low as 20 k. this paper presents a time efficient method of designing and modeling a high-temperature superconducting dc cable. the analysis is an extension of a previously presented mathematical model in which the volume element method was used to characterize the fluid flow and heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation through a flexible cable cryostat. a system of ordinary differential equations was formulated using the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. the computational domain consists of volume elements distributed in three dimensions to account for the spatial dependence of the model. the pressure drop of the gaseous helium was calculated based on the darcy-weisbach correlation. additionally, the temperature distribution was solved numerically using adaptive time-stepping. the obtained solutions converge within a timescale on the order of seconds to minutes, and the steady state results along with a transient analysis is discussed.
machine_design	in this paper a design approach for a sensorless controlled, brushless, interior permanent magnet machine is attained. an initial study based on established electrical machine formulas provides the machine 's basic geometrical sizing. the next design stage combines a particle swarm optimisation (pso) search routine with a magneto-static finite element (fe) solver to provide a more in depth optimisation. the optimisation system has been formulated to derive alternative machine design variants, subject to the design constraints, in a computationally efficient manner using as few fe simulations as required. moreover a parallel computing approach has been used for the most computationally intensive processes. the optimisation system objective function aims to find a solution satisfying all the machine 's design requirements including the torque-speed envelope and compatibility with the high-frequency injection based sensorless operation, whilst minimising the machine weight. a holistic approach is presented where a complete machine, including the stator and rotor sub-assemblies are designed accounting for all the required performance measures under the high-frequency injection based sensorless operation. the efficacy of the new approach has been demonstrated on a design case study with consecutive design stages discussed in detail. also, the paper provides conceptual information regarding practical implementation of the proposed optimisation system together with an insight into the definition of the objective function and its influence on the design solutions. furthermore, the calculated results from the optimisation system have been compared with direct fe predictions for the design exemplar showing good correlation.
internal_combustion_engine	this research investigated the effect of guide vanes into the intake runner of a diesel engine run with higher viscous biodiesel to enhance the in-cylinder intake airflow characteristics. first, simulation of an internal combustion engine base model was done. guide vanes of various lengths were developed and imposed into the intake runner to investigate the airflow characteristics. based on the simulation results, five guide vanes models of 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16mm length were constructed and tested on a compression ignition (ci) engine run with biodiesel. according to the experimental results of engine performance and emissions, it was found that guide vanes of 12mm length showed the highest number of improvements with 14mm and 10mm length showed the second and third highest number of improvements, respectively. therefore, this research concluded that guide vanes successfully improved the in-cylinder air flow characteristics to improve the mixing of higher viscous biodiesel with air resulting in better performances of the engines than without vanes.
fluid_mechanics	similar to other renewable energy sources, wind energy is characterized by a low power density. hence, for wind energy to make considerable contributions to the world 's overall energy supply, large wind farms (on- and offshore) consisting of arrays of ever larger wind turbines are being envisioned and built. from a fluid mechanics perspective, wind farms encompass turbulent flow phenomena occurring at many spatial and temporal scales. of particular interest to understanding mean power extraction and fluctuations in wind farms are the scales ranging from 1 to 10 m that comprise the wakes behind individual wind turbines, to motions reaching 100 m to kilometers in scale, inherently associated with the atmospheric boundary layer. in this review, we summarize current understanding of these flow phenomena (particularly mean and second-order statistics) through field studies, wind tunnel experiments, large-eddy simulations, and analytical modeling, emphasizing the most relevant features for wind farm design and operation.
thermodynamics	liquid-liquid equilibrium data for poly vinyl pyrrolidone (pvp) k30+k2hpo4+h2o system were measured at 298.15 k and different ph values (7.54, 8.05, and 9.47). a binodal curve was fitted to the merchuk equation and the tie line compositions were fitted to both the othmer-tobias and bancroft equations. the refractive indices and densities of several homogeneous binary and ternary solutions used for calibration were also measured within a range of 0-30 mass% of pvp and 0-50 mass% of k2hpo4. then, the viscosities, densities, electrical conductivities, and refractive indices of binary (pvp k30+water; potassium phosphate+water) and ternary (pvp k30+potassium phosphate+water) systems were measured and correlated at different ph values. the density data showed a linear variation of the polymer and salt mass fractions. the viscosity data of pvp k30 solutions were correlated as a function of the mass fractions by using a nonlinear equation. the effects of the tie line lengths on the densities and viscosities of the aqueous two-phase systems were represented. also, the modified unifac-nrf is used to calculate the phase equilibria of the mention system. the fitted binary interaction parameters of the model were reported.
computer-aided_design	the topic of this article is the development of an open-source automated design framework for synthetic biology, specifically for the design of artificial gene regulatory networks based on a digital approach. in opposition to other tools, geneda is an open-source online software based on existing tools used in microelectronics that have proven their efficiency over the last 30 years. the complete framework is composed of a computation core directly adapted from an electronic design automation tool, input and output interfaces, a library of elementary parts that can be achieved with gene regulatory networks, and an interface with an electrical circuit simulator. each of these modules is an extension of microelectronics tools and concepts: odin ii, abc, the verilog language, spice simulator, and systemc-ams. geneda is first validated on a benchmark of several combinatorial circuits. the results highlight the importance of the part library. then, this framework is used for the design of a sequential circuit including a biological state machine.

internal_combustion_engine	as part of a two-part life cycle efficiency and greenhouse gas emission analysis for various automotive fuels in the indian context, this paper presents the first part, i.e., tank-to-wheel analysis of various fuel/powertrain configurations for a subcompact passenger car. the tank-to-wheel analysis was applied to 28 fuel/powertrain configurations using fuels such as gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen with various conventional and hybrid electric powertrains. the gasoline equivalent fuel economy and carbon dioxide emission results for individual fuel/powertrain configuration are evaluated and compared. it is found that the split hybrid configuration is best among hybrids as it leads to fuel economy improvement and carbon dioxide emissions reduction by 20-40% over the indian drive cycle. further, the engine efficiency, engine on-off time and regenerative braking energy assessment is done to evaluate the causes for higher energy efficiency of hybrid electric vehicles. the hybridization increases average engine efficiency by 10-60% which includes 19-23% of energy recovered at wheel through regenerative braking over the drive cycle. overall, the tank-to-wheel energy use and efficiency results are evaluated for all fuel/powertrain configurations which show battery electric vehicle, fuel cell vehicles and diesel hybrids are near and long term energy efficient vehicle configurations.

manufacturing_engineering	this paper introduces preliminary developments of an nsf-funded on-going educational project. the project goal is to enhance student technical and professional skills and business knowledge by integrating lean manufacturing education into a traditional manufacturing engineering program. a group of faculty members with complementary background and expertise in engineering and business co-taught a new lean course that attracted student enrollments from five departments across campus. in addition to plant tours, guest lectures' and real-world industrial projects, we particularly designed an innovative and unique experience, lean lego simulation (lls), which has proven valuable for students to better understand lean principles and applications. course survey shows student feedback was overwhelmingly positive. evaluation is also being carried out to measure how well the project is working from the viewpoint of all participants especially faculty collaboration and student achievements.
machine_design	the optimal design of electric machines requires a significant amount of computation time, since the design is usually performed based on finite-element analysis (fea) for better accuracy. for this reason, the development of an optimization algorithm is regarded as a prerequisite to reduce the number of objective function call, which is directly related to computation time. the local search algorithm does not guarantee that the global optimum solution can be searched effectively. therefore, in this paper, we introduce the novel optimization method, search region management (srm), to improve the efficiency of the local search algorithm. srm uses a guided random bit generation based on gray code for the region selection when the local search iterates the optimum search process for a multi-start. in addition, the srm saves and manages the information of previous searched points to prevent overlapping calculation and to increase the effectiveness of the local search during every iteration process. to clarify the effectiveness of the proposed method for electric machine design, it is applied to the optimal design of brushless dc motor coupled with fea minimizing torque ripple.
hydraulics	induced earthquakes often accompany fluid injection, and the seismic hazard they pose threatens various underground engineering projects. models to monitor and control induced seismic hazard with traffic light systems should be probabilistic, forward-looking, and updated as new data arrive. in this study, we propose an induced seismicity test bench to test and rank such models; this test bench can be used for model development, model selection, and ensemble model building. we apply the test bench to data from the basel 2006 and soultz-sous-forets 2004 geothermal stimulation projects, and we assess forecasts from two models: shapiro and smoothed seismicity (sass) and hydraulics and seismics (hysei). these models incorporate a different mix of physics-based elements and stochastic representation of the induced sequences. our results show that neither model is fully superior to the other. generally, hysei forecasts the seismicity rate better after shut-in but is only mediocre at forecasting the spatial distribution. on the other hand, sass forecasts the spatial distribution better and gives better seismicity rate estimates before shut-in. the shut-in phase is a difficult moment for both models in both reservoirs: the models tend to underpredict the seismicity rate around, and shortly after, shut-in.
strength_of_materials	research on the development of an ideal dental composite is still ongoing and is focused more on the filler content and polymerization. silica is an important filler used in several commercial dental composites. at present the silica used in the fabrication of dental composites is synthesized by the classic sol-gel method, using toxic and expensive precursors and chemicals. rice husk is an abundant source of silica and malaysia is a major rice producing country. this study is aimed at extracting spherical nanosilica from rice husk using an environment friendly and inexpensive method, and its inclusion as fillers in dental nanocomposites. spherical nanosilica was extracted from rice husk using a simple precipitation method employing non-toxic chemicals. the dental nanocomposite thus prepared was subjected to flexural strength and modulus tests, which are important tests for predicting the strength of materials. the flexural strength of the dental composite was 82 mpa and the modulus was 6.8 gpa. the results indicate that rice husk, which is an agricultural waste, is a good and inexpensive source of silica to be used as fillers for fabrication of dental nanocomposites with good mechanical properties.
materials_engineering	understanding of metal oxidation is critical to corrosion control, catalysis synthesis, and advanced materials engineering. although, metal oxidation process is rather complicated, different processes, many of them coupled, are involved from the onset of reaction. since first introduced, there has been great success in applying heteroepitaxial theory to the oxide growth on a metal surface as demonstrated in the cu oxidation experiments. in this paper, we review the recent progress in experimental findings on cu oxidation as well as the advances in the theoretical simulations of the cu oxidation process. we focus on the effects of defects such as step edges, present on realistic metal surfaces, on the oxide growth dynamics. we show that the surface steps can change the mass transport of both cu and o atoms during oxide growth, and ultimately lead to the formation of different oxide morphology. we also review the oxidation of cu alloys and explore the effect of a secondary element to the oxide growth on a cu surface. from the review of the work on cu oxidation, we demonstrate the correlation of theoretical simulations at multiple scales with various experimental techniques.

materials_engineering	chitosan-based magnetite nanocomposites were synthesized using a versatile ultrasound assisted in situ method involving one quick step. this synthetic route approach results in the formation of spheroidal nanoparticles (fe3o4) with average diameter between 10 and 24 nm, which were found to be superparamagnetic with saturation magnetization (ms) ranges from 32-57 emu g(-1), depending on the concentration. the incorporation of fe3o4 into chitosan matrix was also confirmed by ftir and tg techniques. this hybrid nanocomposite has the potential application as electrochemical sensors, since the electrochemical signal was excepitionally stable. in addition, the in situ strategy proposed in this work allowed us to synthesize the nanocomposite system in a short time, around 2 min of time-consuming, showing great potential to replace conventional methods. herein, the procedure will permit a further diversity of applications into nanocomposite materials engineering.

manufacturing_engineering	in manufacturing engineering, there are several areas of knowledge focused on the study of manufacturing processes that give rise to products supplied to the processing industries and products to final consumers that can be processed from sheet, wires, rods and beams. in both cases, one of the most widely used manufacturing processes is the ""metal forming"" which is the mechanical process that pieces can be obtained by compression of solid metal in molds using plastic deformation of the material for filling the molds cavities. however, there is a process that can do the same without the need for molds, the so-called incremental sheet forming which consists of drawing the workpiece on a cnc form milling using a small cylindrical punch with a rounded tip. the purpose of this work is to make a study of the process of incremental sheet forming of polymers as a new type of rapid prototyping technology that is based on the process of forming material, different from the existing processes for removing or adding material. the tests were done in a geometry pyramid trunk format, in three subsequent stages and the objective is to evaluate some parameters such as temperature of working and the punch diameter in the final result of the prototype. the material chosen for the study was the pvc because that is present in many studies already done on the subject. tests made with pvc indicated that a variation in 20 degrees c of material working temperature resulted in a significant increase in forming results during the tests.

materials_engineering	bacterial cellulose is a strong and ultrapure form of cellulose produced naturally by several species of the acetobacteraceae. its high strength, purity, and biocompatibility make it of great interest to materials science; however, precise control of its biosynthesis has remained a challenge for biotechnology. here we isolate a strain of komagataeibacter rhaeticus (k. rhaeticus igem) that can produce cellulose at high yields, grow in low-nitrogen conditions, and is highly resistant to toxic chemicals. we achieved external control over its bacterial cellulose production through development of a modular genetic toolkit that enables rational reprogramming of the cell. to further its use as an organism for biotechnology, we sequenced its genome and demonstrate genetic circuits that enable functionalization and patterning of heterologous gene expression within the cellulose matrix. this work lays the foundations for using genetic engineering to produce cellulose-based materials, with numerous applications in basic science, materials engineering, and biotechnology.
hydraulics	chemoheterotrophic denitrification technologies using woodchips as a solid carbon source (i.e., wood chip bioreactors) have been widely trialed for treatment of diffuse-source agricultural nitrogen pollution. there is growing interest in the use of this simple, relatively low-cost biological wastewater treatment option in waters with relatively higher total suspended solids (tss) and chemical oxygen demand (cod) such as aquaculture wastewater. this work: (1) evaluated hydraulic retention time (hrt) impacts on cod/tss removal, and (2) assessed the potential for woodchip clogging under this wastewater chemistry. four pilot-scale woodchip denitrification bioreactors operated for 267 d showed excellent tss removal (>90%) which occurred primarily near the inlet, and that cod removal was maximized at lower hrts (e.g., 56% removal efficiency and 25 g of cod removed per m(3) of bioreactor per data 24 h hrt). however, influent wastewater took progressively longer to move into the woodchips likely due to a combination of (1) woodchip settling, (2) clogging due to removed wastewater solids and/or accumulated bacterial growth, and (3) the pulsed flow system pushing the chips away from the inlet. the bioreactor that received the highest loading rate experienced the most altered hydraulics. statistically significant increases in woodchip p content over time in woodchip bags placed near the bioreactor outlets (0.03 vs 0.10%p2o5) and along the bioreactor floor (0.04 vs. 0.12%p2o5) confirmed wastewater solids were being removed and may pose a concern for subsequent nutrient mineralization and release. nevertheless, the excellent nitrate-nitrogen and tss removal along with notable cod removal indicated woodchip bioreactors are a viable water treatment technology for these types of wastewaters given they are used downstream of a filtration device.

computer-aided_design	sinus augmentation procedure has been demonstrated to be a highly predictable treatment in posterior maxilla atrophy. all the surgical interventions in the maxillary region require deep knowledge of anatomy and possible anatomical variations. in this article, pre-operative and post-operative assessments of sinus cavity as well as novel approaches to deepen our knowledge of the behavior of bone substitute materials are described. the awareness of the patient 's morphologic conditions enables exact planning of invasive surgery and aids to avoid complications. pre-operative radiologic evaluation of the region before sinus lift is advisable both for a planning of the sinus augmentation and for selection and alignment of the optimum placement of implants. on the orthopantomography it is possible to measure the vertical dimension of graft, but not the volume and 3d changes. cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) has become the ""gold standard"" to plan a comprehensive implant treatment and to achieve a post-operative assessment. a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) technique is proposed to produce custom-made block grafts for sinus lift procedure, and a customized cutting guide to accurately place the lateral wall and ease membrane elevation. this procedure allows to reduce intervention time, to precisely adapt the scaffold, to reduce risk of complications and to improve operation quality. recently, a novel approach has been used to deepen our knowledge of the behavior of bsbs: by means of synchrotron micro-tomography (sct). it is a 3-d analyzing method, suitable to examine the dynamic and spatial arrangement of regenerative phenomena in complex anatomical structures such as bone, where tissues with several morphologies (alveolar process, unmineralized extracellular matrix, regenerated vessels, etc.) compete to achieve the final goal of bone regeneration.
fluid_mechanics	in fluid mechanics, a lot of authors have been executing their researches to obtain the analytical solutions of navier-stokes equations, even for 3d case of compressible gas flow or 3d case of non-stationary flow of incompressible fluid. but there is an essential deficiency of non-stationary solutions indeed. we explore the ansatz of derivation of non-stationary solution for the navier-stokes equations in the case of incompressible flow, which was suggested earlier. in general case, such a solution should be obtained from the mixed system of 2 riccati ordinary differential equations (in regard to the time-parameter t). but we find an elegant way to simplify it to the proper analytical presentation of exact solution (such a solution is exponentially decreasing to zero for t going to infinity infinity). also it has to be specified that the solutions that are constructed can be considered as a class of perturbation absorbed exponentially as t going to infinity infinity by the null solution.

thermodynamics	an isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model with a source of dark energy is studied. that source is simulatedwith a viscous relativistic fluidwith minimal causal correction. in this model the restrictions on the parameters coming from the following conditions are analized: (a) energy density without singularities along time, (b) scale factor increasing with time, (c) universe accelerated at present time, (d) state equation for dark energy with ""omega"" bounded and close to -1. it is found that those conditions are satisfied for the following two cases. (i) when the transport coefficient (tau(pi)), associated to the causal correction, is negative, with the additional restriction zeta |tau(pi)| >2/3, where. is the relativistic bulk viscosity coefficient. the state equation is in the ""phantom"" energy sector. (ii) for tau(pi) positive, in the ""k-essence"" sector. it is performed an exact calculation for the case where the equation of state is constant, finding that option (ii) is favored in relation to (i), because in (ii) the entropy is always increasing, while this does no happen in (i).
machine_design	this paper presents the design of a high-performance 14-pole, 12-slot interior permanent magnet synchronous machine with flux barriers inside the stator iron core and fractional-slot concentrated windings. this work focuses on electromagnetic, mechanical and thermal aspects of the machine design. the specific goal of this work was to design an electrical machine, which will have a small size, high power-to-weight ratio, high efficiency, especially at part-load operating points, and high speed capability for traction drive applications. therefore the unconventional stator design is used. the proposed machine design was compared with the conventional one, concerning the magnetic saturation, spectrum of the magneto-motive force and produced torque. to ensure the high speed capability of the motor, the numerical structural analysis of the rotor is shown. temperature behavior inside of the designed motor at steady-state operating point is shown.
fluid_mechanics	demand for green energy production is arising all over the world. a lot of emphasis is laid in making the buildings green. even a small amount of energy savings made contribute to saving the environment. in this study, an idea is proposed and studied to extract power from the high head water in the pipelines of a building. a building of height 15 m is considered for this study. water flowing in the pipe has sufficient energy to run a micro hydro turbine. the feasibility of producing electrical energy from the energy of pipe water is found. the motivation is to find the feasibility of generating power using a low-cost turbine. the experimental setup consists of micro turbine of 135 mm diameter coupled to a 12-v dc generator; leds and resistors are employed to validate the results. the theoretical calculations were presented using the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. the theoretical results are validated using experimental and numerical results using cfd simulation. in addition, exergy analysis has been carried out to quantify the irreversibilities during the process in the system.
fluid_mechanics	finite element simulation of the mixed convection within porous square cavities for darcy-brinkmanforchheimer model has been carried out in the present work. the penalty optimization based galerkin finite element method is used to solve the partial differential equations of heat and fluid flow. bejan 's heatline concept has been employed to visualize the heat flow within the closed cavities based on the motion of the horizontal wall(s) (cases la-id) or vertical wall(s) (cases 2a-2c) involving isothermally hot bottom wall, cold side walls and insulated top wall for various fluids with prandtl number, pr-m = 0.026, 0.7 and 7.2, reynolds number, re = 10-100 and grashof number, gr = 10(3)-10(5). the higher permeability at da(m) >= 10(-3) leads to the enhanced buoyancy convection for all the cases. although the direction of the motion of wall(s) significantly influences the fluid flow field within the enclosure, due to the decoupling between the fluid and thermal fields at the low pe(m) (pe(m) = 0.26 and 2.6), conductive heat transfer occurs as seen from the end-to-end heatlines. it is also found that the overall heat transfer rates at the bottom wall (nu(b)) are identical for the cases 1a-id and cases 2a-2c at pr-m = 0.026, irrespective of gr and re at da(m) = 10(-2). at pr-m = 0.7 and 7.2, the convection dominant heat transfer occurs for all the cases for gr = 10(5), re = 10 and 100 and da(m) = 10(-2). the strong convective circulation cells are observed at pr-m = 0.7 and 7.2 for all the cases. the plume shaped isotherms are also observed along the centerline at pr-m = 7.2, re = 10, gr = 10(5) and da(m) = 10(-2) for all the cases. at pr-m = 7.2, gr = 10(5), da(m) = 10(-2) and. re = 100, the multiple convective heatline cells are observed for the cases la-id. it is observed that, the strengths of fluid and heat circulation cells are less at re = 100 compared to re = 10 for all the cases due to weak buoyancy force at the high re. in order to achieve the high heat transfer rate at the bottom wall (nu(b)) for the mixed convection involving various moving walls, case 2b (a case of the vertically moving wall) is preferred at pr-m = 0.7, re = 100, gr = 10(5) and da(m) = 10(-2). at the high pr-m (pr-m = 7.2, re = 100, gr = 105 and da(m) = 10(-2)), case 2a (a case of the vertically moving wall) is preferred based on the maximum heat transfer rate at the bottom wall (nu(b)).

hydraulics	hydraulic control with switching valves can excite undesirable hydraulic and mechanical oscillations; hence, control performance is inadequate. there are different ways to cope with such oscillations. one way is to change the design or to add some damping elements which improve the attenuation of the oscillations. another way is to actuate the system in an appropriate way - so that almost no unwanted oscillations are excited. this article illustrates that optimal feed-forward control theory can be used to obtain a realisable switching valve command which avoids ongoing oscillations for the case of a fast position step. a system composed of a dual-stroke cylinder with its piston chamber connected to the switching valves by some pipeline and its rod chamber to pre-pressurised accumulators for counterbalancing is modelled as a discrete dynamical system of order 9. the optimal control problem is conditioned such that the resulting valve signals can be approximately realised by the existing switching valves. for this realisation, the so-called ballistic mode of switching valves plays an important role. the theoretical results are tested experimentally on a proper test rig.
hydraulics	neutral beam injection (nbi) is a high-power auxiliary heating system for the east device. we present a thermal shield (ts) structure to protect the neck pipe of the east equatorial port to avoid damage from the nbi beam. since the east port has a big trumpet structure, a straight section, and a small trumpet structure, to accommodate the port structure, a ts concept is put forward including its cooling system. the cooling loops and the sub-branches were designed with interfaces between the inner cooling branches. the heat removal capability is verified by a thermal hydraulics analysis based on ansys code. in particular, fabrication is addressed with technical processing technology, especially for the embedded cooling pipes in the heat sinks. the pipes are checked for leaks after bending and the embedding processing. the assembly activities are demonstrated in the spatial space zones of the port before the engineering installation. it is confirmed that the ts structure is safe and will run feasibly in the east discharge. it is indicated that the ts structure can provide thermal shielding and remove heat for the nbi device in the port region.
computer-aided_design	computer-aided process planning is an important component for linking design and manufacturing in computer-aided design/computer-aided process planning/computer-aided manufacturing integrated manufacturing systems. operation sequencing in computer-aided process planning is one of the most essential tasks. to solve the problem and acquire optimal process plans, operation sequencing is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with various constraints, and a novel modified ant colony optimization algorithm is developed to solve it. to ensure the feasibility of process plans, constrained relationships considered among operations are classified into two categories called precedence constraint relationships and clustering constraint relationships. operation precedence graph based on constrained relationships is formed to get visual representation. to ensure good manufacturing economy, in the mathematical model for optimization, total weighted production cost or weighted resource transformation time related to machine changes, setup changes, tool changes, machines and tools is utilized as the evaluation criterion. to avoid local optimum and enhance global search ability, adaptive updating method and local search mechanism are embedded into the optimization algorithm. case studies of three parts are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the modified ant colony optimization algorithm, and some comparisons between the modified ant colony optimization algorithm and previous genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, tabu search and particle swarm optimization algorithm are discussed. the results show that the modified ant colony optimization algorithm performs well in the operation sequencing problem.
internal_combustion_engine	the paper presents a proof-of-principle study for the simultaneous imaging of temperature and fuel partial density in a realistic diesel spray using tracer-based planar laser-induced fluorescence (tracer-plif). the fluorescence of 1-methylnaphthalene (1-mn) is characterized in a flow cell with respect to temperature and pressure in nitrogen atmosphere at ic engine conditions with excitation at 266 nm. the strong spectral red-shift of 1-mn with increasing temperature is used for two-color-lif. the fuel partial density is determined with only one detection channel. this technique is further applied for investigation of temperature and fuel partial density in a diesel spray studied at 5 mpa and 800 k in an injection chamber. averaged images are presented for a pilot injection revealing a maximum temperature difference between fuel jet and ambience of about 150 k with a maximum fuel partial density of about 220 g/m(3). between 1300 and 1700 mu s after visible start of injection, the mixing temperature increases by up to 50 k and the fuel partial density decreases by about 20 g/m(3) because of gas entrainment. the suitability of the lif technique for single-shot measurements is further demonstrated by studying the cyclic spray variations, which allows for a detailed understanding of mixture formation in ic engine combustion. this enhanced tracer-based lif-technique for the first time allows for a simultaneous quantification of temperature and fuel partial density at elevated temperatures, which are highly relevant for diesel engines.

internal_combustion_engine	the biogas fired tri-generation system for cooling, heating and electricity generation (bcchp + pv) supported by a photovoltaic system (pv) is discussed and analyzed from energetic and ecological effectiveness point of view. analyzed system is based on the internal combustion engine and the adsorption machine. for the evaluation of primary energy savings in the bcchp aided by pv system, the indicators of the total primary energy savings (tpes) and relative primary energy savings apes were defined. also an analysis is carried out of the reduction of greenhouse gases emission. in the ecological potential evaluation, the environmental impact as an indicator of the total greenhouse gasses reduction (tghgr).is taken into account. the presented detailed algorithm for the evaluation of the multigeneration system in the global balance boundary can be applied for the analysis of energy effects (consumption of primary energy) as well as ecological effect (emission of greenhouse gasses) for real data (e.g. hour by hour through the year of operation) taking into account random availability of renewable energy. it allows to take into account a very important factor characterized for renewable energy systems (res) which is the variability or random availability (e.g. in the case of photovoltaic-pv) of primary energy. particularly in the presented work the effects of the analysis and the application of the discusses algorithms have been demonstrated for the hour-by-hour availability of solar radiation and for the daily changing availability of chemical energy of biogas. additionally, the energy and ecological evaluation algorithms have been integrated with the methods offered by exergy analysis. in the case of cogeneration systems there is a problem of the allocation of fuel between useful products (heat and electricity). the commonly applied methods of ""energetic division"" do n't take into account different quality of products generated in the cogeneration unit. moreover, these methods require subjective assumptions and it can lead in some cases to non-physical results of fuel allocation. it is commonly known that exergy losses decide on the amount of consumed energy driving the production process. if in the considered process two or more products are generated these losses should be proportionally allocated between these products. for this reason the correct allocation also should be done with the application of the exergetic allocation, what has been proposed in the algorithm presented in the paper.

fluid_mechanics	purpose: besides ventricular parameters, the design and angular orientation of a prosthetic heart valve induce a specific flow field. the aim of this study was to know the inflow characteristics of a left ventricular model (lvm), investigating the behavior of tricuspid bioprosthetic mitral valves in terms of velocity profiles and related valve aperture areas at the beginning of diastole, under different conditions. methods: 3 heart rates (hrs) were established in the lvm and each mitral bioprosthesis (27 and 31 mm diameter) was installed in 2 orientations, rotated by 180 degrees. for each experimental setup, 2-dimensional particle image velocimetry (2d piv) measurements and simultaneous mitral valve (mv) area detection were obtained from 50 samples. results: the results from the velocity profiles immediately downstream of mitral bioprostheses showed the influence of valve orientation for moderate hrs, although for a similar magnitude of mean velocity vectors. the geometries of mv open areas for each hr were similar regardless of valve orientation, except for the 27-mm valve at 90 beats per minute (bpm), and for the 31-mm valve at 60 bpm. moreover, for each hr, similar percentages of valve open area were obtained regardless of mv nominal diameters. conclusions: in conclusion, the experimental setup for the 2d piv measurements synchronized with the mv area detection was a useful tool for knowing the inflow characteristics of the lvm.
machine_design	analytical calculation methods for all the major components of the synchronous inductance of tooth-coil permanent-magnet synchronous machines are reevaluated in this paper. the inductance estimation is different in the tooth-coil machine compared with the one in the traditional rotating field winding machine. the accuracy of the analytical torque calculation highly depends on the estimated synchronous inductance. despite powerful finite element method (fem) tools, an accurate and fast analytical method is required at an early design stage to find an initial machine design structure with the desired performance. the results of the analytical inductance calculation are verified and assessed in terms of accuracy with the fem simulation results and with the prototype measurement results.
thermodynamics	a low-dimensional model that describes both saturated and unsaturated flow processes in a single equation is presented. subsurface flow processes in the groundwater, the vadose zone, and the capillary fringe are accounted for through the computation of aggregated hydrodynamic parameters that result from the integration of the governing flow equations from the bedrock to the land surface. the three-dimensional subsurface flow dynamics are thus described by a two-dimensional equation, allowing for a drastic reduction of model unknowns and simplification of the model parameterizations. this approach is compared with a full resolution of the richards equation in different synthetic test cases. because the model reduction stems from the vertical integration of the flow equations, the test cases all use different configurations of heterogeneity for vertical cross-sections of a soil-aquifer system. the low-dimensional flow model shows strong consistency with results from a complete resolution of the richards equation for both the water table and fluxes. the proposed approach is therefore well suited to the accurate reproduction of complex subsurface flow processes.
machine_design	in this paper, a complete sensitivity analysis of the optimal parameters for the axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines working in the field weakening region is implemented. thanks to the presence of a parameterized accurate analytical model, it is possible to obtain all the required parameters of the machine. the two goals of the ideal design are to maximize the power density: p-density and the ratio of maximal to rated speed: n(max)/n(r,) which is an inductance related parameter keeping the efficiency at the target speed above 90%. different slots/poles/phases combinations are studied to reveal the optimum combination for each phase. this paper has studied the effect of the ratio of number of stator slots to number of rotor poles on the p-density and n(max)/n(r). it is shown that a low value of this parameter results in a better p-density and n(max)/n(r). the effect of the outer diameter, and the inner to outer diameter ratio are studied with respect to the two design goals. in addition, a comparison between the finite and the theoretical infinite speed designs is implemented. a complete 3d finite element validation has proven the robustness of the analytical model.
internal_combustion_engine	about 20 years ago electromagnetic valve trains have been topic of many research projects in the automotive industry. despite promising approaches this technology had no chance to prevail on the market yet. in the meantime reinforced market restrictions are introduced and improved technical boundary conditions are available. the task of this project is to reevaluate the electromagnetic valve train (emvt) technology under these new circumstances. a dynamic simulation environment in dymola/modelica is created to be able to simulate the multidisciplinary system. this includes a magnetic, an electrical, a mechanical and a controller subsystem. the biggest challenge regarding the controller development is the high-dynamic valve movement. this is considered by implementing a repetitive learning feed forward controller developed in matalb/simulink/targetlink via a fmi interface into the simulation. the simulation shows that a concept based on a conventional spring mass system with additional lateral magnets is able to open the valves of an internal combustion engine and simultaneously has a sufficient impact on velocity control.
machine_design	the selection of suitable working fluids for use in organic rankine cycles (orc) is strongly addicted to the intended application of the orc system. the design of the orc, the kind of heat source and the ambient condition has an influence on the performance of the organic rankine cycle and on the selection of the working fluid. it can come to a discrepancy between the best candidate from the thermodynamic point of view and the transformation into a real machine design. if an axial turbine design is considered for expansion and energy conversion within the orc, the vapor volume flow ratios within the expansion path, the pressure ratio and of course the number of stages have to be considered within the fluid selection process and for the design parameters. furthermore, environmental aspects have to be taken into account, e.g. the global warming potential (gwp) and the flammability of the selected fluid. this paper shows the results of the design and fluid selection process for an organic rankine cycle for application in a combined operation with a 2mw class industrial gas turbine. the gas turbine contains two radial compressor stages with an integrated intercooler. to further increase the thermal cycle efficiency, a recuperator has been implemented to the gas turbine cycle, which uses the exhaust gas waste heat to preheat the compressed air after the second compressor, before it enters the combustion chamber. the shaft power is generated by a three stage axial turbine, whereby the first stage is a convection cooled stage, due to a turbine inlet temperature of 1100 degrees c. to further increase the electrical efficiency and the power output of the energy conversion cycle, a combined operation with an organic rankine cycle is intended. therefore the waste heat from the gt compressor intercooler is used as first heat source and the waste heat of the exhaust gas after the recuperator as second heat source for the organic rankine cycle. it is intended that the orc fluid acts as heat absorption fluid within the compressor intercooler. due to these specifications for the orc, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been performed to determine the optimal design parameter and the best working fluid for the orc, in order to obtain a maximum power output of the combined cycle. due to the twice coupling of the orc to the gt cycle, the heat exchange between the two cycles is bounded by each other and a detailed analysis of the coupled cycles is necessary. e.g. the ambient temperature has an enormous influence on the transferred heat from the intercooler to the orc cycle, which itself affects the heat transfer and temperatures of the transferable heat from the second heat source. thus, a detailed analysis by considering the ambient operation conditions has been performed, in order to provide a most efficient energy conversion system over a wide operation range. the performance analysis has shown that by application of an orc for a combined operation with the intercooled and recuperated gas turbine, the combined cycle efficiency can be increased, for a wide ambient conditions range, by more than 3 %pts. and the electrical power output by more than 10 %, in comparison to the stand alone intercooled and recuperated gas turbine.

computer-aided_design	background: during microtia reconstruction, the intraoperative design of the cartilage framework is important for the appearance and symmetry of the bilateral auricles. templates (traditionally, the x-ray film template) are usually utilized to complete the task, which can provide cues regarding size, cranioauricular angle and positioning to the surgeons. with a combination of three-dimensional (3d) scanning and additive manufacturing (am) techniques, we utilized two different ear-shaped templates (sheet moulding and 3d templates) during the fabrication of 3d-customized autologous cartilage frameworks for auricle reconstruction. methods: forty unilateral microtia patients were included in the study. all the patients underwent auricle reconstruction using the tissue-expanding technique assisted by the new am templates. images were processed using computer-aided design software and exported to print two different am ear-shaped templates: sheet moulding and 3d. both templates were assisted by the 3d framework fabrication. the 3d images of each patient 's head were captured preoperatively using a 3d scanner. x-ray film templates were also made for the patients. the lengths and widths of the contralateral auricles, x-ray film and sheet moulding templates were measured in triplicate. the error of the template and the contralateral auricle were used to compare the accuracy between the two templates. results: between january and may 2014, 40 unilateral microtia patients aged 6-29 years were included in this study. all patients underwent auricle reconstruction using autogenous costal cartilage. the sterilized am templates were used to assist in the framework fabrication. the operative time was decreased by an average of 15 min compared with the method assisted by the x-ray film template. postoperative appearance evaluation (based on five indexes: symmetry, length, width, cranioauricular angle and the substructure of the reconstructed ear) was performed by both the doctors and the patients (or their parents). follow-up (ranging from 9 to 18 months) showed that all of the patients obtained satisfactory results with life-like 3d configuration and symmetric cranioauricular angle. the follow-up showed that no surgery-related complications occurred. comparing the accuracy of the x-ray film and sheet moulding templates, the average errors of length were 1.8 mm +/- 1.44 mm and 0.39 mm +/- 0.35 mm, respectively, and the average width errors were 1.32 mm +/- 0.88 mm and 0.3 mm +/- 0.47 mm, respectively. the new sheet moulding template was more accurate than the x-ray template. conclusions: the new sheet-moulding template is much more accurate than the traditional xray film template. framework fabrication assisted by accurate 3d and informative am templates contributed to individualized cartilage framework fabrication and satisfactory results.

hydraulics	utilisation of submerged vanes in front of intake ports is an effective approach to address sedimentation in lateral intakes from rivers. strategically installed, these flow-training structures could increase the mid-depth and near surface flows into the intake, and simultaneously prevent bed-load transport from entering the intake channels. the effectiveness of submerged vanes depends on their number, shape, dimensions and configuration. determination of optimum values for dimensions or configuration of the vanes is very challenging as the effect of many parameters, which are effective in sedimentation in the intake zone, must be investigated. in this study, effort has been made to determine appropriate dimensions of submerged vanes that are installed in front of a 90 degrees intake from a straight channel. fuzzy topsis, a multi-objective optimisation method, has been utilised for the optimisation process by considering ten parameters. the simulations have been conducted for three discharge ratios of 0.11, 0.16 and 0.21. the results show that a height of 0.2 times the flow depth, and a length of four times the vane height are the appropriate dimensions for utilisation of submerged vanes in front of the lateral intakes from straight channels.
strength_of_materials	this paper describes the method of increasing the contact fatigue strength of materials intended for application in the production of gears. investigations were carried out on 41cralmo7 grade steel (closest equivalent: nitralloy 135m) by quenching and tempering or nitriding and double shot-peening. special emphasis should be placed on the combination of nitriding and shot-peening technologies. both nitriding and shot-peening were significantly modified and differ from the classical processes. nitriding was carried out in a way preventing the formation of a compound surface layer formed by nitrides epsilon and gamma. shot-peening was carried out as a double-stage operation with the help of a change of parameters. as a result of combining the modernized processes, a new technology was developed guaranteeing the possibility of attainment of the contact fatigue limit comparable with the limit obtained by carburizing or induction hardening. the paper describes the methodology and the experimental work, as well as the obtained values of contact fatigue strength. other surface parameters are also given, such as roughness, hardness, state and distribution of residual stresses.
computer-aided_design	the g protein coupled receptor 119 is an exciting and promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. in this study, three dimensional quantitative structure activity relationships i.e. a comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular field analysis region focusing have been carried out on a novel series of g protein coupled receptor 119 agonists. a quality pharmacophore model was built by hip-hop algorithm. the best pharmacophore model indicated which feature of hydrogen-bond acceptor and hydrophobic existed around active compounds. as the quality of the pharmacophore model is satisfactory, it was utilized to search the zinc database for a virtual screening task. the obtained compounds subjected to lipinski filter at first, were docked with gold algorithm to discover potent hits. the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (""gap"") implies high reactivity of the most active molecule in the active site of protein. in addition, the molecular electrostatic potential energy at density functional theory level confirms the results from molecular docking. in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicity risk assessment analysis were carried out on the seven hits with the highest gold score fitness. six of the new hits from virtual screening had diverse structures and are reported as new scaffold candidates for g protein coupled receptor 119 agonists.
materials_engineering	the increasing demand in the diverse device applications of transparent conducting oxides (tcos) requires synthesis of new tcos of n- or p-type conductivity. this article is about materials engineering of zno-sno2-in2o3-ga2o3 to synthesize powders of the quaternary compound zn2-xsn1-xinxgaxo4-delta in the stoichiometry of x = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 by solid state reaction at 1275 degrees c. lattice parameters were determined by x-ray diffraction (xrd) technique and solubility of in3+ and ga3+ in spinel zn2sno4 was found at 1275 degrees c. the solubility limit of in3+ and ga(3+)in zn2sno4 is found at below x = 0.4. the optical transmittance approximated by the uv-vis reflectance spectra showed excellent characteristics while optical band gap was consistent across 3.2 ev with slight decrease along increasing x value. carrier mobility of the species was considerably higher than the older versions of zinc stannate spinel co-substitutions whereas the carrier concentrations were moderate.
strength_of_materials	the estimation of the theoretical strength of materials is important in order to assess the potential for improvements in processing and design of structures, especially with the increased interests in nanostructured materials. most estimates are based on knowledge of inexact potential energy functions. fractal geometry presents a mathematical approach to the understanding of fracture in materials at all length scales. the fractal dimension, which is a quantitative characterization of the tortuosity of the fracture surface, is directly related to the toughness of a material. fractal geometry provides a framework by which bond rupture can be described as a series of bond reconfigurations. this article shows how fractal geometry can use this framework to estimate the theoretical strength of materials based on crack tip geometry and generated fracture surface without any assumption of the shape or type of potential energy function. the estimates are between the commonly quoted values of e/pi and e/8.

computer-aided_design	nowadays, power is a dominant factor that constrains highly integrated hardware-systems designs. the implied problems of high power density, causing chip overheating, or limited power source in modern internet-of-things devices are most commonly dealt with the use of the dynamic power management. this method enables to use power-reduction techniques, such as clock gating, power gating, or voltage and frequency scaling. since the adoption of power management is quite difficult in modern complex systems, there are new approaches evolving intended to simplify power-constrained systems design. we have also proposed such an approach, utilizing the system level of design abstraction and increased automation in the design process. in this paper, the proposed hybrid verification approach is described that represents an integral part of the suggested design methodology. it consists of formal and informal techniques, enabling the verification process to begin at the very early specification stage of the system development. our approach helps a designer to create correct and consistent power-management specification and verifies whether the specified power intent is preserved after design refinement. the continuous automated verification steps can quickly find errors at early design stages and thus reduce the amount of design re-spins, which speeds-up the overall development process.

manufacturing_engineering	aluminium matrix composites find wide applications in the present industrial scenario due to their desirable properties. study of the effect of process parameters on machinability of aluminium matrix composites is of paramount importance in the field of manufacturing engineering. machining of a composite depends on the properties and relative content of the reinforcement and the matrix materials as well as on its response to the machining process. in this article, investigations on the machinability aspects of aluminium-silicon carbide and aluminium-graphite composites are presented. experiments have been carried out through the design of experiments technique and regression machinability models have been developed, which express the degree to which the resultant force depends upon the cutting parameters and the percentage of reinforcement present in the aluminium matrix composites machined. a comparative study of the effect of cutting parameters on the resultant force has been presented.
fluid_mechanics	in this work, the wrf meteorological model is run in three different modes to estimate the wind energy potential in the bay of biscay for the 1990-2001 period. the first simulation (noda) involves a typical use of the wrf model and it does not use data assimilation. the second one (12hda) performs 3dvar data assimilation at 00 utc and 12 utc. finally, 6hda uses 3dvar data assimilation at 00 utc, 06 utc, 12 utc and 18 utc. verification for the three simulations has been carried out at a preliminary stage using wind data from buoys, and then a spatially distributed analysis has been conducted of surface wind based on satellite data from the cross-calibrated multi-platform (ccmp). to that purpose, the spatial correlation and error patterns over our study area have been used as statistical indicators. the results indicate that the wind values obtained with data assimilation every six hours (6hda) yield the best verification scores at a 95% confidence level, thereby being the most accurate at reproducing wind observations in the area. regarding the estimation of wind energy potential, at a second stage, we tested the calculation 's sensitivity to the use of data assimilation. the most reliable simulation with data assimilation (6hda) estimates 21% less energy potential than the simulation without data assimilation. in the absence of historical wind observation records of the sea with sufficient time and space resolution, meteorological models such as wrf provide an estimation of the wind values in tentative areas for offshore wind farms. in this line, our study highlights the need to use meteorological models with data assimilation, as future wind energy production can then be more realistically estimated beforehand. this may also contribute to a more accurate economic and technical evaluation of the risks and benefits for future investments in offshore wind energy.

hydraulics	large-scale reactor calculations with monte carlo (mc), including nonlinear feedback effects, have become a reality in the course of the last decade. in particular, implementations of coupled mc and thermalhydraulic (t-h) calculations have been separately developed by many different groups. numerous mc codes have been coupled to a variety of t-h codes (system level, subchannel, and computational fluid dynamics). in this work we review the numerical methods that have been used to solve the coupled mc-t-h problem with a particular focus on the formulation of the nonlinear problem, convergence criteria, and relaxation schemes used to ensure stability of the iterative process. we use a simple pressurized water reactor pin cell problem to numerically investigate the stability of commonly used schemes and which problem parameters influence the stability-or lack thereof. we also examine the role that the running strategy used in the mc calculation plays in the convergence of the coupled calculation. results indicate that the instability in fixed-point iterations is driven by the doppler feedback effect and that underrelaxation can be used to restore stability. we also observed that a form of underrelaxation could be achieved by performing the coupled iterations without converging the mc fission source each iteration. by performing many iterations of few histories, we observed rapid convergence to the coupled mc-t-h solution in a relatively small number of batches. numerical results also showed that the presence of instability in the fixed-point iteration is independent of the stochastic noise in the mc simulation.
computer-aided_design	the rational design of molecularly imprinted polymers (mips) has been a major contributor to their reputation as ""plastic antibodies"" - high affinity robust synthetic receptors which can be optimally designed, and produced for a much reduced cost than their biological equivalents. computational design has become a routine procedure in the production of mips, and has led to major advances in functional monomer screening, selection of cross-linker and solvent, optimisation of monomer(s)-template ratio and selectivity analysis. in this review the various computational methods will be discussed with reference to all the published relevant literature since the end of 2013, with each article described by the target molecule, the computational approach applied (whether molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics, semi-empirical quantum mechanics, ab initio quantum mechanics (hartree-fock, moller-plesset, etc.) or dft) and the purpose for which they were used. detailed analysis is given to novel techniques including analysis of polymer binding sites, the use of novel screening programs and simulations of mip polymerisation reaction. the further advances in molecular modelling and computational design of synthetic receptors in particular will have serious impact on the future of nanotechnology and biotechnology, permitting the further translation of mips into the realms of analytics and medical technology.

computer-aided_design	in the paper a possibility of using a metrology micro computed tomography (ct) to assess quality of parts made by rapid prototyping technique was presented. additive manufacturing techniques dramatically change the approach to manufacturing process. not long ago they allowed solely for obtaining a spatial model of a part in order to visualize its features. nowadays, it is possible to produce elements and assembly groups with properties that make it possible to replace many parts manufactured using traditional casting or injection techniques. polymer components created by means of 3d printing can be generated one layer of material after another. in many cases inner spaces (sections) are not fully filled in (solid), they are rather replaced by a specially selected structure. thanks to this it is possible to save material and reduce weight. to control these structures and to inspect joints between particular layers using a non-destructive method it is necessary to use a metrology micro ct. in the paper an application of x-ray computed tomography and assessment of measurement uncertainty regarding elements manufactured with fused deposition modeling (fdm) method using abs 3d printing on up! printer was presented. inspection of both: inner structure and outer shapes as well as joints between them was performed basing on computer aided design (cad) model.

fluid_mechanics	a new compact scheme has been developed for any non-uniform grid. the compact scheme has been developed for spatial discretization and is analyzed here in conjunction with four-stage, fourth order runge-kutta (rk4) scheme for time integration while solving the one-dimensional convection equation. the space-time discretization combination is calibrated by subjecting the system to global spectral analysis (gsa) which was developed by the authors' group. here, the compact scheme has been obtained by using a combination of two bi-diagonal schemes. the novel aspect of this scheme is its application in the physical plane directly without the necessity of mapping or transformations. some typical cases for problems in acoustics, as well as fluid mechanics, have been studied here and potential use in large eddy simulations (les) has been demonstrated by solving navier-stokes equation for lid driven cavity.

fluid_mechanics	the violations of the second law are relevant as the length and/or time scales become very small. the second law then needs to be replaced by the fluctuation theorem and mathematically, the irreversible entropy is a submartingale. first, we discuss the consequences of these results for the axioms of continuum mechanics, arguing in favor of a framework relying on stochastic functionals of energy and entropy. we next determine a lyapunov function for diffusion-type problems governed by stochastic rather than deterministic functionals of internal energy and entropy, where the random field coefficients of diffusion are not required to satisfy the positive definiteness everywhere. next, a formulation of micropolar fluid mechanics is developed, accounting for the lack of symmetry of stress tensor on molecular scales. this framework is then applied to employed to show that spontaneous random fluctuations of the microrotation field will arise in couette-and poiseuille-type flows in the absence of random (turbulence-like) fluctuations of the classical velocity field. finally, while the permeability is classically modeled by the darcy law or its modifications, besides considering the violations of the second law, one also needs to account for the spatial randomness of the channel network, implying a modification of the hierarchy of scale-dependent bounds on the macroscopic property of the network.
thermodynamics	herein, we studied the absorption of h2s and co2 by alkanolamine protic ionic liquids binary mixtures based on 2-hydroxyethylammonium (mea) or triethanolammonium cations and residues of 2hydroxy-5-sulfobenzoic acid or pyridine-3-carboxylic acid at various temperatures and partial gases pressures. it was found that absorbents based on the 2-hydroxyethylammonium cation, performed high absorption properties toward the h2s. the solubility of hydrogen sulfide, characterized by the henry 's law constant, in mea-based binary mixtures had the values comparable to the commercially available ionic liquids. the results of thermal desorption analysis demonstrated that the capture of acid gases in meabased absorbents occurred at two stages: through the dissolution in mea component and in protic ionic liquid.
machine_design	it was recently demonstrated that the synchronous reluctance motor is well suited for electric as well as for hybrid electric vehicles. this paper deeply investigates the capabilities of a synchronous reluctance motor and compares them with those of a permanent-magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motor, according to the typical requirement of a traction application. a proper rotor design is necessary. the average torque is due to the rotor anisotropy. the permeance difference between the directand the quadrature-axis is achieved by means of a high number of flux barriers. the position of the flux barrier ends and proper rotor asymmetries are chosen so as to reduce the torque ripple, mainly due to the slot harmonics. the impact of the rotor design on the motor performance is presented deeply, showing several simulation and experimental results, carried out on synchronous reluctance motors with different rotor geometries. permanent magnets can be inset in the flux barriers to assist the synchronous reluctance motor improving its capabilities, but avoiding to use rare-earth permanent magnets. the main advantages of the permanent magnet assistance is an increase of the main torque density and of the power factor. they are evaluated experimentally. however, the drawback of adopting permanent magnets is the possible demagnetization of the magnets themselves. this can greatly limit the maximum overload capability of the motor, which is a salient requirement of a traction motor.
strength_of_materials	data are presented describing refined simulations of perturbation growth in a three-layer cylindrical liner system tested with disk explosive magnetic flux compression generators (demgs) to study the strength properties of copper and polyethylene at shocklessly applied pressures of up to similar to 15 gpa. the calculated performance for the same liner system in the experiments to study the strength properties of copper at shockless loading of up to similar to 40-gpa pressures is presented. the feasibility of similar strength experiments with quasi-isentropic material compression to similar to 2000 gpa using demgs is demonstrated.
manufacturing_engineering	the purposes of this study are to develop a simulator generating a ski board vibration in actual skiing and to perform the basic construction for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism, which still has not been clarified completely. in the simulator developed in this study, the surface on the bottom of the ski was assumed as to be a snowy slope and a mass of snow (snow pack) assuming a skier had slid on this ski bottom surface. a ball vibrator connected to a large-sized compressor was installed onto the ski panel in order to vibrate a ski board. the compressed air from the compressor rotated a steel ball in the vibrator at high speed, causing vibration on the ski. a dynamic friction force (f) was detected by the digital force gauge when the snow pack was sliding from the top of the ski to the tail on the surface formed by the bottom of the ski. a coefficient of kinetic friction (mu k) was calculated using this dynamic friction force. furthermore, the velocity and acceleration of the snow pack were measured by two high speeded cameras. the experiment for confirming the validity of this simulator was carried out in the temperature conditions of -5 degrees c. the velocity and acceleration of the snow pack with vibration were higher than without vibration. on the other hand, the coefficient of kinetic friction (mu k) with vibration was lower than without vibration. from these results, the simulator is suitable for studying the role of vibration in ski sliding and for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism.

strength_of_materials	the paper has a discussion of forward problem and inverse problem for beams in strength of materials. known load case of a beam can certainly determine its shearing force diagram and bending moment diagram, but conversely, there may be a variety of statically determinate or statically indeterminate constraint conditions. furthermore, the solution from statically indeterminate constraint conditions does n't agree with the given shearing force diagram and bending moment diagram in a general way.
hydraulics	paleokarst is most commonly expressed as subtle stratigraphic surfaces rather than large void systems penetrating deeply into the paleo-subsurface. in contrast, a regional precambrian-cambrian unconformity on victoria island (nwt, canada), is associated with exceptional exposure of large, intact cambrian paleocavems (100 m diameter; tens of m high). the paleocaves are distributed along a paleo-horizontal plane, and an associated gryke network is present in the 30-60 m of neoproterozoic dolostone between cave rooves and the base of overlying cambrian sandstone; both are filled by cambrian sandstone. the formation and preservation of such karst features require aggressive dissolution along a stable paleo-water-table shortly before transgression and deposition of shallow-marine sand over the dolostone. during the transgression, the karst network acted as a conduit for flowing groundwater that was discharged through overlying, unconsolidated cambrian shallow-marine sand, producing water-escape structures (sand volcanoes and their conduits). the conduits are preserved as cylindrical remnants of the sand volcanoes' feeder pipes. sediment fluidisation was probably caused by variations in the hydraulic-head gradient in a meteoric lens near the cambrian coastline under a tropical climate with abundant, probably seasonally variable rainfall that caused pulses in subsurface fluid flow. spatial distribution of the paleocaves and sand volcanoes suggests their formation on the southeast side of a recently faulted horst of proterozoic carbonate bedrock that formed a nearshore island during early cambrian sea-level rise. fluidisation structures such as those reported here have generally been difficult to interpret owing to a lack of data on the fluid hydraulics of the underlying aquifer. this is the first report linking the hydraulics of a well-characterised paleokarst to development of fluid-escape structures. such structures are widely known from sandstones overlying the sub-cambrian unconformity around the circumference of laurentia.

machine_design	iron loss modeling is crucial for electric machine design. however, current models feature severe drawbacks. they are 1) very complex, and thus, can hardly be applied, 2) require very high effort for measuring and computation, and/or 3) are not very accurate. in this paper, a newmodeling technique is introduced for calculating the instantaneous power loss in ferromagnetic materials without taking the magnetization history into account. a standard measurement setup and specimen shape is used. the considered approach comprises the required measurements, the nonlinear loss modeling by itself, and an extensive verification for different flux density waveforms and frequencies. in addition, a detailed qualitative comparison to well-known iron loss models is given. the presented technique gives very accurate results, while obtaining the model is comparably easy. moreover, as the calculation of the instantaneous losses is not based on the previous magnetization state of the material, a modeling error for a particular instant of time has no impact on the subsequently calculated characteristics. in the future, this model should ensure a more accurate iron loss calculation for electric machine designs.
thermodynamics	evolution of vibration relaxation of hydrogen atoms in metals with the close-packed lattice at high and medium temperatures is investigated based on non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, in that number on using the retarded two-time green function method. in accordance with main kinetic equation - the generalized fokker-plank- kolmogorov equation, anharmonism of hydrogen atoms vibration in potential wells does not make any contribution to collision effects. it influences the relaxation processes at the expense of interference of fourth order anharmonism with single-phonon scattering on impurity hydrogen atoms. therefore, the total relaxation time of vibration energy of system metal-hydrogen is written as a product of two factors: relaxation time of system in harmonic approximation and dimensionless anharmonic attenuation of quantum hydrogen state.
fluid_mechanics	certain medical treatments involve the introduction of exogenous liquids in the lungs. these liquids can form plugs within the airways. the plugs propagate throughout the branching network in the lungs being forced by airflow. they leave a deposited film on the airway walls and split at bifurcations. understanding the resulting distribution of liquid throughout the lungs is important for the effective administration of the prescribed treatments. in this paper, we investigate numerically the splitting of a liquid plug by a two-dimensional pulmonary bifurcation under the influence of a transverse gravitational field. the splitting is characterized by the splitting ratio, which is the ratio of volume of the liquid plug in the daughter channels and depends on the capillary number and the orientation of the bifurcation plane with respect to a three-dimensional gravitational field. it is observed that gravity induces asymmetry in the splitting, causing the splitting ratio to he reduced. this effect is mitigated as the capillary number is increased. it is also observed that there exists a critical capillary number where the plug will not split and will instead propagate entirely into the gravitationally favoured daughter channel we also compute the wall stresses on the bifurcation walls and observe the locations where stresses and their gradients are the highest in magnitude.
fluid_mechanics	in fluid mechanics, how to solve multiple solutions in ordinary differential equations is always a concerned and difficult problem. an improved rna genetic algorithm inspired by rna molecular structure and operators is proposed for solving the parameter estimation problems of the multiple solutions that described as the flow of the fluid through a porous channel with expanding or contracting walls. in this paper, multiple solutions can be found through changing accuracy and search coverage and multi-iterations of computer. at last, the ordinary differential equations is calculated, and the result has great accuracy and this method is practical.

strength_of_materials	csp solar fields are designed as lightweight structures. nevertheless, due to their size and complexity, large amounts of materials are required. environmental conditions like wind loads are a key driver for the design of solar fields, including required strength of materials and therefore mass. to give a solid example: structural steel work for the solar field of a 500,000 m(2) aperture parabolic trough plant (typical 50 mw plant in spain with 7 h thermal storage) amounts to approx. 12,500 tons of steel. due to changes in european design codes and the respective loading conditions, the design wind speed increased from 34 m/s to 38 m/s, which increases solar field structural steel mass to 14,450 tons, i.e. by about 16 %. obviously, prescribed load conditions have a tremendous effect on steel mass and hence cost and environmental impact. unfortunately, load description in many tender specifications is insufficiently accurate, what often results in confusion or even in significant errors in planning and construction, or higher risks. the paper describes various environmental loading effects, mainly wind, for parabolic trough and heliostat collector fields.

fluid_mechanics	given the facts that a vast area of the earth is covered by water and the average depth of the oceans is more than 3,000 m, the issue of the unknowns beneath the water surface is a challenging and questionable one. it has been a few decades since remotely operated vehicles as well as untethered underwater robots have appeared and elevated the level of complex engineering. in this category, underwater robots that mimic fish and aquatic creatures open new horizons. in this article, imitating the body shape, kinematics, and swimming mechanism of a batoid fish (dasyatidae), a vessel is designed that can swim at an acceptable speed with a limited amount of power. the hull shape is based on a cardioid curve, and drag force is calculated using fundamentals of fluid mechanics. propulsion of the robot-fish is two wings at starboard and port that are undulating backward; thrust is approximated versus shaft speed. finally, the power for swimming at the design speed is evaluated and compared with the available data of similar orders of magnitude.
fluid_mechanics	cavitation distribution in a high intensity focused ultrasound sonoreactors (hifu) has been extensively described in the recent literature, including quantification by an optical method (sonochemiluminescence scl). the present paper provides complementary measurements through the study of acoustic streaming generated by the same kind of hifu transducers. to this end, results of mass transfer measurements (electrodiffusional method) were compared to optical method ones (particle image velocimetry). this last one was used in various configurations: with or without an electrode in the acoustic field in order to have the same perturbation of the wave propagation. results show that the maximum velocity is not located at the focal but shifted near the transducer, and that this shift is greater for high powers. the two cavitation modes (stationary and moving bubbles) are greatly affect the hydrodynamic behavior of our sonoreactors: acoustic streaming and the fluid generated by bubble motion. the results obtained by electrochemical measurements show the same low hydrodynamic activity in the transducer vicinity, the same shift of the active focal toward the transducer, and the same absence of activity in the post-focal axial zone. the comparison with theoretical eckart 's velocities (acoustic streaming in non-cavitating media) confirms a very high activity at the ""sonochemical focal"", accounted for by wave distortion, which induced greater absorption coefficients. moreover, the equivalent liquid velocities are one order of magnitude larger than the ones measured by ply, confirming the enhancement of mass transfer by bubbles oscillation and collapse close to the surface, rather than from a pure streaming effect.

internal_combustion_engine	electric and hybrid electric vehicles (ev and hev) seem to be the future of transport in smart cities and the key for the total reduction of noise disturbance and pollution in urban areas. however, several problems have to be solved to guarantee the safety of these types of vehicle. up to now, the use of hev has shown the dangers of a ""quiet"" transport system in urban environments; in fact, it has been estimated that an hev is twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash as would be an internal combustion engine (ice) vehicle in the same situation. with the aim of improving their safety, different kinds of warning sounds are being designed to increase the detectability of ev and hev without themselves becoming new annoying sound sources. the sound directivity, frequency of emission and intensity of warning sound systems will guarantee their efficiency and limited noise impact. several research works bring to the fore a significant variation of the pedestrian response time to different acoustic stimuli. however, it is necessary to examine the suitability of these warning sounds according to the urban environments in which they are going to be emitted. distinct areas inside the city have different soundscapes whose spectral content can vary significantly, masking some of the sounds suggested as an alert. this paper analyses in detail the main characteristics of several warning sounds proposed by the industry, conducting a comparative study of the different design trends. a total of 131 sighted listeners were exposed to a virtual road-crossing test. the behaviour and appropriateness of warning sounds are analysed depending on the urban environment. for this purpose, three clearly different soundscapes have been selected: stopped vehicles at a traffic light, a pedestrian shopping area and the vicinity of a playground. the results highlight the wide variability in pedestrian reaction time for the different warning sounds used. some signals considerably improve the detectability of the vehicle, providing results even above the ice vehicle ones. however, other warning sounds do not decrease the reaction time with respect to the ev. in addition, a clear dependence is observed between the detectability and the soundscape involved, changing the results for the same warning sound depending on the acoustic environment.

fluid_mechanics	data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut are considered key parameters in the control and matching of production in each layer of intelligent well wellbores. owing to the complicated conditions in the downhole, no permanent downhole flowmeter is installed in the current simple intelligent well system of onshore oilfields in china. furthermore, necessary real-time data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer cannot be obtained. on the basis of mass conservation equation, momentum conservation equation, and theories of heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics in porous medium, this study establishes the energy conservation equation of fluids in the tubing and annulus. by using the single-point real-time data of the pressure and temperature in the tubing and annulus, the temperature gradient in each producing layer can be deduced. moreover, the temperature profile, data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer can be calculated. this approach is used to solve the problem of flow measurement in each producing layer of intelligent well systems without permanent downhole flowmeters in onshore chinese oilfields. according to the production data of intelligent well lei 632, the temperature distribution along the wellbore is analyzed, the water yield formation is diagnosed, and the reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer are calculated. the analytic solution of the method agrees well with that of the conventional production logging, thus indicating the feasibility of the method in realizing the dynamic monitoring of intelligent wells and in solving the actual problem in real time. the proposed method fills in the gaps in theories on intelligent well technology in china.

hydraulics	plant transpiration is the main evaporative flux from terrestrial ecosystems; it controls land surface energy balance, determines catchment hydrological responses and influences regional and global climate. transpiration regulation by plants is a key (and still not completely understood) process that underlies vegetation drought responses and land evaporative fluxes under global change scenarios. thermometric methods of sap flow measurement have now been widely used to quantify whole-plant and stand transpiration in forests, shrublands and orchards around the world. a large body of research has applied sap flow methods to analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of transpiration and to quantify their responses to hydroclimatic variability, but syntheses of sap flow data at regional to global scales are extremely rare. here we present the sapfluxnet initiative, aimed at building the first global database of plant-level sap flow measurements. a preliminary metadata survey launched in december 2015 showed an encouraging response by the sap flow community, with sap flow data sets from field studies representing >160 species and >120 globally distributed sites. the main goal of sapfluxnet is to analyse the ecological factors driving plant-and stand-level transpiration. sapfluxnet will open promising research avenues at an unprecedented global scope, namely: (i) exploring the spatio-temporal variability of plant transpiration and its relationship with plant and stand attributes, (ii) summarizing physiological regulation of transpiration by means of few water-use traits, usable for land surface models, (iii) improving our understanding of the coordination between gas exchange and plant-level traits (e.g., hydraulics) and (iv) analysing the ecological factors controlling stand transpiration and evapotranspiration partitioning. finally, sapfluxnet can provide a benchmark to test models of physiological controls of transpiration, contributing to improve the accuracy of individual water stress responses, a key element to obtain robust predictions of vegetation responses to climate change.
computer-aided_design	a compelling, innovative approach to teaching gross anatomy is the use of computer-aided holographic models. they allow for clean, time-saving dissection, manipulation of structures and appreciation of anatomical relationships, and potential elimination of the need for cadavers. the present study tests the hypothesis that using holographic models improves mastery of anatomical information. first-year medical students were taught gross anatomy using the dissection of donor cadavers, manipulation of digitized 3-dimensional holographic renderings, and examination of plastinated specimens. the effectiveness of these approaches was assessed by comparing students' performance on identification questions on cadavers (qc), holographic models (qh), and plastinated specimens (qp). students in the top quintile of the class performed strongly on qc, qh, and qp. in contrast, performance by students in the bottom quintile was uneven; they scored best on qh. performance on the qp was relatively non-discriminating. students in the top quintile scored higher on the biological sciences section of the medical college admission test (mcat) than students in the lowest quintile, whereas students in the lowest quintile had higher scores on the verbal section of their mcats. the availability of different approaches for presenting gross anatomy improves the success of students in mastering the material, particularly for students struggling with the information. the use of holographic models apparently reaches students who may be challenged to learn the material using traditional approaches. this may be linked to potentially predictive information gleaned through performance on the mcat. clin. anat. 29:917-924, 2016.

strength_of_materials	the calculation formulas for concrete and steel utilization rate of reinforcing layer have been deduced, in view of the underutilization of reinforcing layer material by composite main arch circle method. the calculation formulas is defined as load bearing capacity of reinforcing layer divided by the ultimate bearing capacity of reinforcing layer, combined with initial strain of main arch ring before reinforcement and reinforcing layer section edge strain, take compression zone partial of reinforcing layer subjected to tension and compression as example. the calculation formulas for concrete utilization rate of reinforcing layer is divided into 2 types according to the height of compression zone and on the edge of compressive strain in the reinforcing layer, the calculation formulas for steel utilization rate of reinforcing layer is divided into 1 types according to tension strain of the steel. the results show that controlling the stress and strain of stone arch bridge before reinforcement can make full use of compression resistance on main arch ring, strength of materials and reduce the waste of materials relying on engineering example. the calculation formulas provide the theoretical basis for calculation and design of the similar reinforcement structure.
internal_combustion_engine	this work addresses the potential for waste energy recovery from exhaust gases in a diesel passenger car mounted in a chassis dynamometer. the new european driving cycle was followed, while recording relevant operating variables. tests were performed under three temperature conditions, and exergy analysis was included to find the potential of exhaust gases to produce useful work at six points in the exhaust system. results include mean temperature at each point, as well as the energy quality index, which was lower than 33%, meaning that less than one-third of the energy of exhaust gases can be converted into useful work in a recovery system. in general, the highest exergy losses were found in the muffler. although the greatest recovery potential corresponds to the highest temperature of gases, environmental regulations for vehicles restrict waste energy recovery to be performed downstream after-treatment devices, which, in the present work, was the outlet of the diesel particle filter. temperature of gases at this location varied in the range 115-320 degrees c, and potential fuel saving varied between 8% and 19% for the complete driving cycle.

hydraulics	modeling individual fish habitat selection in highly variable environments such as hydropeaking rivers is required for guiding efficient management decisions. we analyzed fish microhabitat selection in the heterogeneous hydraulic and thermal conditions (modeled in two-dimensions) of a reach of the large hydropeaking rhone river locally warmed by the cooling system of a nuclear power plant. we used modern fixed acoustic telemetry techniques to survey 18 fish individuals (five barbels, six catfishes, seven chubs) signaling their position every 3 s over a three-month period. fish habitat selection depended on combinations of current microhabitat hydraulics (e.g. velocity, depth), past microhabitat hydraulics (e.g. dewatering risk or maximum velocities during the past 15 days) and to a lesser extent substrate and temperature. mixed-effects habitat selection models indicated that individual effects were often stronger than specific effects. in the rhone, fish individuals appear to memorize spatial and temporal environmental changes and to adopt a ""least constraining"" habitat selection. avoiding fast flowing midstream habitats, fish generally live along the banks in areas where the dewatering risk is high. when discharge decreases, however, they select higher velocities but avoid both dewatering areas and very fast-flowing midstream habitats. although consistent with the available knowledge on static fish habitat selection, our quantitative results demonstrate temporal variations in habitat selection, depending on individual behavior and environmental history. their generality could be further tested using comparative experiments in different environmental configurations.

strength_of_materials	the structural integrity of multi-component structures is usually determined by the strength and durability of their unions. adhesive bonding is often chosen over welding, riveting and bolting, due to the reduction of stress concentrations, reduced weight penalty and easy manufacturing, amongst other issues. in the past decades, the finite element method (fem) has been used for the simulation and strength prediction of bonded structures, by strength of materials or fracture mechanics-based criteria. cohesive-zone models (czms) have already proved to be an effective tool in modelling damage growth, surpassing a few limitations of the aforementioned techniques. despite this fact, they still suffer from the restriction of damage growth only at predefined growth paths. the extended finite element method (xfem) is a recent improvement of the fem, developed to allow the growth of discontinuities within bulk solids along an arbitrary path, by enriching degrees of freedom with special displacement functions, thus overcoming the main restriction of czms. these two techniques were tested to simulate adhesively bonded single- and double-lap joints. the comparative evaluation of the two methods showed their capabilities and/or limitations for this specific purpose.

fluid_mechanics	in 2008, the first commercial wave farm came online in portugal. as with other types of renewable energy, the electricity obtained from waves has the drawback of intermittency. knowing a few hours ahead how much energy waves will hold can contribute to a better management of the electricity grid. in this work, three types of statistical models have been used to create up to 24-h forecasts of the zonal and meridional components of wave energy flux (wef) levels at three directional buoys located off the coast in the bay of biscay. each model 's performance has been compared at a 95% confidence level with the simplest prediction (persistence of levels), along with the forecasts provided by the physics-based wave modeling (wam) wave model at the nearest grid point. the results indicate that for forecasting horizons between 3 and roughly 16 h ahead, the statistical models built on random forests (rfs) outperform the rest, including wam and persistence.
manufacturing_engineering	in order to satisfy the requirements of productivity and quality, in recent years, laser welding processes of certain grades of steels mainly thin sheets assemblies or tailored welded blanks (twbs) have given many successful advantages in manufacturing engineering. this welding process of in particular makes it possible very easily to joint the steel parts in thickness and grade identical or different in many industrial applications (car industry, pipe lines, tubes, etc.). additionally, interstitial free (if) steels with very low c and n contents have been successfully developed in order to perform specific or complex deep drawing operations in the automotive industry. major developments of twb by means of laser welding in this area have also occurred. certain grades of if steel are particularly suitable for deep drawing operations of twb due to high r values (lankford ratio) [grumbach, m., sanz, g., 1972. ductile-brittle tests by impact tensile test (itt). j. metall. 2, 145-164; bayraktar, e., kaplan, d., buirette, c., grumbach, m., 2004. application of impact tensile testing to the welded thin sheets. j. mater. process. technol. 145 (1), 27-39; bayraktar, e., kaplan, d., hugele, d., jansen, j.p., 2004. evaluation of pipe line laser girth weld properties by charpy and impact tensile tests. j. mater. process. technol. 147 (11), 155-162; bayraktar, e., kaplan, d., grumbach, m., 2004. application of impact tensile testing to the spot welded sheets. j. mater. process. technol. 153, 80-86]. however, because of the narrowness of the weld bead and important hardness gradient, determination of ""toughness"" (definition of a criterion of the ""ductile/brittle"" transition during the impact test) of the welded connection (weld bead and heat affected zone) confirm very delicate in laser welding. the main objective of this paper was to make a comparative study for microstructural and mechanical-toughness characterisation of the steel assemblies, base metal or welded by laser. for that a procedure of test specifically adapted was used for welded joints (t < 4mm). the first part of this study consider different steel grades such as a grade of the fe360bfn steel (t = 4 mm) and a grade of the interstitial free steel (if-ti, t = 0.8 mm) and hr60 (t = 2.5 mm) welded by laser that largely used in the automotive industry.

fluid_mechanics	effects of impeller configurations on docosahexaenoic acid production and flow characteristics were investigated by schizochytrium sp. in a 15 l bioreactor. 6-straight blade disc turbine (6-sbdt), 6-arrowy-blade disc turbine (6-abdt) and down-pumping propeller (dpp) were combined to form different impeller configurations. simulated results showed that configuration ssa consisting of upper two 6-sbdt and one bottom 6-abdt possessed the worst oxygen supply capacity. but it obtained the highest dha percentage of 48.17 % and dha yield of 21.42 g/l, indicating that it was beneficial for dha synthesis and converting glucose to biomass and lipids. configuration sas consisting of one middle 6-abdt and two 6-sbdt provided better mixing capacity, which resulted in the maximum glucose consumption rate of 2.86 g/l h and the highest biomass of 108.09 g/l. this study would improve insight into understanding the relationship between flow field and the physiology of schizochytrium sp. for the scale-up of industrial dha production.
internal_combustion_engine	concerns have been expressed regarding the displacement of harmful emissions from internal combustion engine vehicle (icev) tailpipes to the sources of electricity generation used to charge electric vehicles (ev). the degree to which evs can reduce the environmental impacts of road transportation is dependent on the fuel mix of electricity generation within a country and on the real-time charging behaviours of ev users since the fuel mix of electricity generation frequently changes. this paper analyses the varying environmental impacts of evs based on contrasting user behaviours and compares them to the environmental impacts of icevs. individual ev user profiles are developed which comprise real data emerging from charge events undertaken in ireland, and information is gathered on the actual co2 intensity of the electrical grid in real-time, allowing for the carbon intensity of every individual charge event to be determined using time and date information. the results show that the environmental impacts of evs are highly influenced by the charging behaviours of individual users, and night-time charging was found to produce the largest environmental impact. evs are shown to be a more environmentally friendly choice of vehicle than icevs under a wide majority of scenarios.

computer-aided_design	a systematic method which combines the shape curvature entropy and computational fluid dynamics analyses was proposed in this study for creating automobile shapes. various automobile shapes were evaluated by the proposed method and the parameters including the curvature entropy and the drag coefficient of each configuration were calculated so as to determine the optimal shape design. first, shapes of commercially available car models were collected and their curvature entropy values were determined by the proposed equation. meanwhile, the drag coefficient of each car model was determined by computational fluid dynamics simulation. both values were compared and the results indicated a positive correlation between an automobile shape 's curvature entropy value and its drag coefficient. therefore, the curvature entropy is proven to be a suitable indicator for estimating an automobile shape 's aerodynamic performance. for a new automobile shape design, the required number of numerical analyses can be reduced by utilizing the proposed curvature entropy calculation so that the time spent on designing an automobile shape can be greatly reduced.
thermodynamics	we studied production of biodiesel from microalga chlorella protothecoides (sag 211-10 c) through direct saponification of its wet biomass (70% moisture) in a microwave reactor using ethanolic potassium hydroxide. the resulting soap was precipitated by ""common ion effect"" using saturated solution of potassium chloride and subjected to simultaneous acidulation and esterification to form biodiesel. the optimum parameters for saponification were: temperaure- 60 a degrees c, ethanol to dry biomass ratio (ml/g)-80 : 1, concentration of koh-0.5%, microwave power-450w; and for esterification they were temperature-60 a degrees c, wt% of sulfuric acid-2.5%, molar ratio of methanol to fatty acids-70 : 1, microwave power-450w. the kinetics and thermodynamics of saponification and esterification were investigated. both reactions were found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. activation energies were determined as 14.177 kj/mol and 17.234 kj/mol for saponification and esterification, respectively. the final biodiesel yield and purity were 98.74% and 94.83%, respectively.
thermodynamics	high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses are carried out to understand the microstructure of the ultra-thin oxide-film grown on a (native) amorphous al2o3-coated al-0.8 at.% mg alloy substrate at t = 600 k for t = 2 h and at po(2) of 1 x 10(-2) pa. this oxide-film is found to be non-uniformly thick with thicknesses varying from 1.50 to 4.60 nm. occasionally, this oxide is found to diffuse into the al-mg alloy substrate, forming oxide thicknesses up to 10.5 nm. overall, this oxide-film is found to consist of a mixed amorphous, (poly) crystalline and an intermediate amorphous-to-crystalline transition regions, with crystalline regions consisting mostly of mgo and the diffused oxide regions into the al-mg alloy substrate coated with gamma-al2o3. these observations are then compared with the experimental results obtained using angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and thermodynamic predictions for the growth of an ultra-thin oxide-film due to dry, thermal oxidation of al-mg alloy substrates.
materials_engineering	we report on an experimental verification that emission properties of photocathodes can be manipulated through the engineering of the surface electronic structure. ultrathin multilayered mgo/ag(0 0 1)/mgo films were grown by pulsed laser deposition, tuning the thickness n of the flanking mgo layers to 0, 2, 3, and 4 monolayers. we observed an increase in quantum efficiency and simultaneous decrease in work function with layer thickness. the scale and trend direction of measurements are in good but not excellent agreement with theory. angle resolved photoemission data for the multilayered sample n = 3 showed that the emission profile has a metallic-like momentum dispersion. deviations from theoretical predictions [k. nemeth et al., prl 104, 046801 (2010)] are attributed to imperfections of real surfaces in contrast with the ideal surfaces of the calculation. photoemissive properties of cathodes are critical for electron beam applications such as photoinjectors for free electron lasers (fel) and energy recovery linacs (erl). an ideal photoemitter has a high quantum efficiency, low work function, low intrinsic emittance and long lifetime. it has been demonstrated here that emission properties may be systematically tailored by control of layer thickness in ultrathin multilayered structures. the reproducibility of the emission parameters under specific growth conditions is excellent, even though the interfaces themselves have varying degrees of roughness.

fluid_mechanics	dispersed micro- to nano-particle-laden gas flows are common in many engineering and environmental applications. characterizing both their dispersed and carrier phase using experimental methods is very important for determining their properties and behavior. this paper reviews techniques for measuring the carrier phase, as well as the dispersed particles ranging from the micro- to the nano-scale. we focus not only on the developments of specific techniques over the last 20 years, but also on relationships and comparisons among these techniques. in addition to a systematic description and classification of these methods, we discuss the parameters they measure, such as particle velocity, size, composition and concentration. a more detailed review is provided for several important measurement techniques, including particle image velocimetry, the phase-doppler particle analyzer and light-scattering intensity measurements for microparticles, as well as the scanning mobility particle sizer, the fast mobility particle sizer and the electrical low pressure impactor for nano-particles. the founding principles, development histories, various applications of these techniques and where they are going are summarized. this article provides a resource for investigators that plan to study micro- or nano-particle-laden gas flows in various contexts.
thermodynamics	single and multi-component adsorptive removal of cs-134(+), co-60(2+) and eu-152+154(3+) from aqueous solutions onto sepiolite are studied in the present study. removal of these radionuclides in single systems is found to be strongly dependent on the initial ph on the solution. removals >99% (for(60)co(2+) and 152+154eu3+) and of about 82% (for cs-134(+)).are achieved at initial ph values higher than 4 and 5, respectively. the kinetic data and the equilibrium isotherms are modeled by two kinetic models, the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order, and two isotherm models, langmuir and freundlich, respectively. the effect of various coexisting cations, na+, ca2+ and al3+, at different concentrations on the adsorption processes of the concerned radionuclides in single systems was evaluated. desorption studies of radionuclide-loaded sepiolite are studied using different concentrations of organic, edta and ha (strong complexing agents for radionuclides), and inorganic, hci, naci, cacl2, mg(no3)(2) and alcl3, desorbing agents. adsorption mechanisms of radionuclides onto sepiolite are deeply discussed. multi-component adsorptive removal of cs-134(+), co-60(2+) and eu-152+154(3+) onto sepiolite as a function of adsorbent weight and time was also studied. the influence of the solution ph on co-removal efficiency of radionuclides was investigated in presence of edta. furthermore, the present investigation evaluated the removal efficiency of radionuclides, in multi-systems, in presence of different concentrations either of naci or cacl2.

manufacturing_engineering	to take up the challenge of global distributed companies, manufacturing engineering has to be accomplished in a worldwide collaborative way. design and development of production processes and their execution are nowadays spread all over the world. to ensure quality standards and to create synergies between spatially distributed entities, distance collaboration tools must be provided to allow cooperation even over large distances. the virtual reality (vr) is thereby offering beneficial capabilities to exchange current planning stages, identify problems and solve them cooperatively. this paper introduces a new approach for distance collaboration, which enables users to work in a joint virtual space, nearly as if they were working together in the same place. therefore two full-immersive cave-like systems are interconnected using the virca (virtual collaboration arena) platform. the paper describes the requirements of mechanical engineers towards distance collaboration tools and the technical challenges solved with the enhanced virca framework. this working prototype is one premier application in the field of vr-enhanced spatially distributed collaboration. a typical use case scenario is provided to highlight the interaction and cooperation capabilities offered by virca net.
machine_design	the objective of this paper is to develop an analytical optimal design tool to determine a megawatt-scale yokelss and segmented armature (yasa) machine design that fulfills the application requirements and constraints. this analytical tool considers both electromagnetic and structural designs. different designs that provide similar performance will have emerged from this analytical process. a design reference map that graphically shows the relationships and tradeoffs between each objective function is introduced. a multicriteria optimization process is applied to determine a design optimum. in the optimization process, the design objectives considered in this study are to minimize the outer diameter, to minimize the structural mass of the machine, to minimize the copper and iron losses, and to minimize the active materials cost. three variables considered in calculating the objective functions are the air-gap flux density, the ratio of outer-to-inner machine diameter, and the current loading. the optimization method uses a pseudoweight vector to provide the flexibility to prioritize one or more objective functions, dependant on the specific application requirements.

thermodynamics	in this study, citric acid (ca) was employed as a low-molecule organic acid to influence the adsorption performance of phosphorus by as-obtained magnetite. the factors including initial phosphate concentrations, dosage of citric acid, ph value, ion strength, contact time and temperature were examined in detail. results indicated that the dissolution of anion sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) covering on surface of magnetite, a slight decrease of fe level and a superior structure of magnetite after ca modification occurred. the ph-dependence of phosphate adsorption was impeded and the surface potential of magnetite positively increased at ph >5.0 when ca was added. non-linear regression langmuir-freundlich model was fitted well in thermodynamics, and the opposite adsorption process as a function of temperatures with or without ca addition was due to the decrease of active energy and active mobility of phosphate ion. finally, the declining adsorption efficiency with increasing cycles was observed while phosphate removal was approximately finished and had small change with 0.05 and 0.1 m of ca addition. those improvements of removal efficiency of phosphorus by modified iron oxide were because of the removal of anionic sds that increased the surface positive charge, and especially the dissolution of element fe into solution to form precipitate with phosphorus ions. the enhanced stability of magnetite by ca also promoted the high removal efficiency of phosphorus. these implications of ca on phosphate removal can be extended to the field where phosphate pollution is notorious but urgent.

computer-aided_design	this paper presents a 3-d statistical simulation study of an n-channel si step-finfet due to work-function variability depending on grain orientation of metal gate. the statistical fluctuation induced by metal gate granularity on threshold-voltage (sigma v-t), on current (sigma i-on), and off current (sigma i-off) are estimated for a wide range of channel length and effective fin width for varying average grain size using technology computer aided design simulator. we investigated the effect of grain on magnitude of variability and also on shapes of various electrical parameters of distribution. the results indicate that sigma v-t decreases for increase in each dimension of the device. the value of sigma(ion), and sigma(ioff) reduces as channel length increases. however, sigma(ion) and sigma(ioff) increase as fin width increases. the distribution of electrical parameters is near to normal for small grain size and becomes bimodal at large grain size. the proposed structure shows excellent behavior in terms of threshold-voltage (v-t), subthreshold swing, and current ratio (i-on/i-off) compared with conventional finfet at high temperature. it is found that the hot carrier effect reduces with increased effective channel width.
strength_of_materials	polished finishing granites are greatly accepted for claddings because of the plates' shape, design and color variety. the features depend on the geological conditions that occur during the formation process, which include the mineralogy of the stone, the fluids formed during the process, the grain size of the minerals and the way in which the minerals interact with each other. one of the noblest uses of stone plates is in non-adherent covering systems (without mortar), such as ventilated fa double dagger ades and pedestrian paving systems. currently, the methodology for non-adherent systems uses the allowable stress design criteria. in recent years, the number of papers indicating reliability analysis as an important design tool for natural stones has increased. however, a lack of information concerning the design methodology still happens. therefore, the structural properties assessed as complementing these studies were: compressive strength, three-point flexural tensile strength, young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio. a granite slab design example was also presented. first, the thickness of the plates was determined based on the formulation proposed by timoshenko [strength of materials (original language, portuguese), volume ii. editora ao livro t,cnico s. a., rio de janeiro, 1977], using the allowable stress design criteria. next, the reliability analysis was performed by monte carlo simulation. results showed that the desire, white granitic plate presented a higher reliability index than the capo bonito red granitic plate. this result seems to be paradoxical, owing that the capo bonito red presented a higher value of mean flexural strength than the desire, white. the minimal safety factors to satisfy the target reliability value of 3.8 as recommended by the standard en 1990:2002 (eurocode) were found to be 2.61, 1.98 and 2.72, respectively, for the three stone types.
fluid_mechanics	we present a preliminary examination of a new approach to a long-standing problem in non-newtonian fluid mechanics. first, we summarize how a general implicit functional relation between stress and rate of strain of a continuum with memory is reduced to the well-known linear differential constitutive relations that account for ""relaxation"" and ""retardation."" then, we show that relaxation and retardation are asymptotically equivalent for small deborah numbers, whence causal pure relaxation models necessarily correspond to ill-posed pure retardation models. we suggest that this dichotomy could be a possible way to reconcile the discrepancy between the theory of and certain experiments on viscoelastic liquids that are conjectured to exhibit only stress retardation.

materials_engineering	recent advances in the simulation of the quench, cold-work and machining processes for large aluminum forgings are opening the way for a new paradigm in the design, manufacture and sustainment of aircraft structures. the use of large forgings permits the unitization of smaller parts (brackets, fittings, lugs, etc.) with primary structural components like spars and bulkheads. this is being done in order to reduce part count, which in turn leads to significant reductions in manufacturing cost. unitization can also translate into weight reduction / avoidance when comparing against built-up structure, but it raises a number of issues for structural durability and damage tolerance, notably reduced repair / replace capability and reduced crack arrest capability. the viability of the unitization concept is dependent not only on the availability of material systems that retain their mechanical properties in very thick sections, but also on the designer 's ability to retain durability and damage tolerance, and to understand and mitigate the effects of residual stresses. recently a ""next-generation"" design approach that directly addresses some of these issues has been developed and deployed. among other things, this new approach requires the extraction of residual stress effects from material property data and the explicit re-introduction of those effects in selected, critical regions of the structure. in this paper we will provide an overview of an emerging application of icme to the design of large aluminum forgings for aircraft primary structure and the concomitant development of verification and validation methodologies.
internal_combustion_engine	the effect of urea injection on nox emissions in a six-cylinder, four-stroke internal combustion engine fueled with b80 biodiesel has been experimentally investigated. the results reveal that urea injection leads to a reduction of nox emissions of b80 biodiesel fuel. moreover, the influence of injection parameters on nox reductions has been studied. the findings show that increasing the injection temperature results in lower nox emissions. also urea mass flow rate increment leads to more nox reduction. the same result has been obtained by an increase in spray angle. in addition, increasing the number of nozzles indicates more depletion in nox emissions while a ""three-nozzles spray system"" has the most considerable effect on nox reductions.

internal_combustion_engine	the demand for clean power source which can be used to run the various types of vehicles on the road is increasing on a daily basis due to the fact that high emissions released from internal combustion engine play a significant role in air pollution and climate change. fuel cell devices, particularly proton exchange membrane (pem) type, are strong candidates to replace the internal combustion engines in the transport industry. the pemfc technology still has many challenges including high cost, low durability and hydrogen storage problems which limit the wide-world commercialization of this technology. in this paper, the fuel cell cost, durability and performances challenges which are associated with using of fuel cell technology for transport applications are detailed and reviewed. recent developments that deal with the proposed challenges are reported. furthermore, problems of hydrogen infrastructure and hydrogen storage in the fuel cell vehicle are discussed.

strength_of_materials	use type 4a nanoscale zeolite powder composite with low-density polyethylene(ldpe), obtained the different of doping concentration of composite materials which the zeolite weight percentage are from 0.5wt% to 3wt%. by using broadband dielectric spectrometer measure and analyse the dielectric performance in a relatively wide frequency range to lopeizeolite composite and pure polyethylene at different temperature (293k, 323k and 353k). the test results show that, with the increase of the concentration of the doping, the lope/zeolite composite materials' dielectric constant gradually declined, until below 2.0 when the zeolite weight percentage was 3wt% at 293k. because zeolite material has a framework of silicon, oxygen and aluminum with porous structure, the empty space in the framework make the dielectric constant of lopeizeolite composite reduced. when the temperature rise to 323k and 353k the dielectric constant of lopeizeolite composite and pure polyethylene are on a declining curve. the dielectric constant goes to 1.85 when the zeolite weight percentage was 3wt% at 353k and the frequency is 106hz. at the same time, dielectric losses of the composite material also have obvious changes, in the low frequency area dielectric loss of lope/zeolite composite decrease in 10(-2)similar to 1hz area and are lower the pure polyethylene. in the 10(1) similar to 10(4)hz area, the dielectric losses of lope/zeolite composite have a peak in all the samples. when the frequency is more than 10(5)hz, the dielectric losses are on the rise. this kind of phenomenon can be also concerned with the framework of zeolite within the lope/zeolite composite. this new type of composite material keeps the same performance of polyethylene, reduce the dielectric constant and change the dielectric loss features will contribute to improve the breakdown strength of materials.
fluid_mechanics	cardiovascular diseases (cvds) are the leading cause of death in the western world. with the current development of clinical diagnostics to more accurately measure the extent and specifics of cvds, a laudable goal is a better understanding of the structure-function relation in the cardiovascular system. much of this fundamental understanding comes from the development and study of models that integrate biology, medicine, imaging, and biomechanics. information from these models provides guidance for developing diagnostics, and implementation of these diagnostics to the clinical setting, in turn, provides data for refining the models. in this review, we introduce multi-scale and multi-physical models for understanding disease development, progression, and designing clinical interventions. we begin with multi-scale models of cardiac electrophysiology and mechanics for diagnosis, clinical decision support, personalized and precision medicine in cardiology with examples in arrhythmia and heart failure. we then introduce computational models of vasculature mechanics and associated mechanical forces for understanding vascular disease progression, designing clinical interventions, and elucidating mechanisms that underlie diverse vascular conditions. we conclude with a discussion of barriers that must be overcome to provide enhanced insights, predictions, and decisions in pre-clinical and clinical applications.

thermodynamics	more than 20 countries are still suffering problems of excessive fluoride containing water, and greater than 8 mg/l fluoride groundwater has been reported in some villages in china. in order to meet the challenge in the drinking water defluoridation engineering, a high efficiency and affinity defluoridation adsorbent ppy/tio2 composite was designed and synthetized by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), x-ray diffraction investigator (xrd), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps), thermogravimetric analysis (tg), n-2 isotherm analysis, scanning electron microscopy (sem) and zeta potential analysis were conducted to characterize surface and textural properties of the as-prepared ppy/tio2, and the possibility of fluoride adsorption was carefully estimated by adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies. characterization investigations demonstrate the uniqueness of surface and textural properties, such as suitable specific surface area and abundant positively charged nitrogen atoms (n+), which indicate the composite is a suitable material for the fluoride adsorption. adsorption isotherms and kinetics follow better with langmuir and pseudo-second-order model, respectively. the maximum adsorption capacity reaches 33.178 mg/g at 25 degrees c according to langmuir model, and particular interest was the ability to reduce the concentration of fluoride from 11.678 mg/l to 1.5 mg/l for drinking water at ph of 7 within 30 min. moreover, the adsorbent can be easily recycled without the loss of adsorption capacity after six cycles, greatly highlighting its outstanding affinity to fluoride, low-cost and novel to be used in the purification of fluoride containing water for drinking. furthermore, the adsorption mechanism was extensively investigated and discussed by ftir investigation and batch adsorption studies including effect of ph, surface potential and thermodynamics. the adsorption is confirmed to be a spontaneous and exothermic process with decreasing entropy, which is prominently conducted through electrostatic attraction, and ionic exchange, and chelation may be also involved. hydroxyls and positively charged nitrogen atoms play important roles in the adsorption.

machine_design	although the brushless doubly-fed induction machine (dfim) has great potential as generator system in large-scale wind turbines, its complexity has so far retained a commercial breakthrough. this paper contributes by combining brushless dfim finite element (fe) modelling with multi-objective optimization. a static brushless dfim fe model is applied with the nsga-ii multi-objective optimization algorithm. the result is an accurate and fast brushless dfim design optimization tool. this tool is then used to generate a machine design with optimized performance, that fits a fixed volume frame size d180. optimization results of different brushless dfim construction variations are compared. the best designs of each construction variation are then analysed in more detail using a time-stepping brushless dfim fe model. this provides good insight in the effects of different construction variations on torque ripple and induced time-harmonics. the optimized design of the best construction variation will be selected to be manufactured as prototype machine.
machine_design	because of high frequency and rotation speed, the analysis and design methods of high speed machine are different from conventional ones, such as rotor stress calculation, rotor dynamics analysis and electromagnetic design. in view of an outer rotor permanent magnet claw pole machine proposed, the claw pole and wingding were designed and analyzed by equivalent magnetic circuit and finite element method (fem); the rotor stress distribution were calculated to check its strength; and the rotor bending mode and critical speed were simulated to analyze dynamics properties. finally, a prototype of 1.5kw was developed, then the test research of prototype was carried out, the feasibility and accuracy of theoretical analysis have been verified by experimentation.
strength_of_materials	the thermal shock behavior of ceramics with the cooling medium temperatures in the range 5 degrees c to 100 degrees c has been studied in detail by measuring the retained flexural strength after water quenching. the test materials is zro2(3y). results show that the thermal shock resistance of ceramics is very sensitive to the cooling medium temperature, even which is very low. when characterizing the thermal shock resistance of ceramics the effect of cooling medium temperature should be taken into account. a higher water-bath temperature may not correspond to a greater thermal shock resistance of ceramic materials owing to the effect or thermal shock initial temperature on the material properties. when the temperature difference in thermal shock is close to the critical temperature difference or rupture, a little change of which can cause a great change in the retained strength of materials. as the retained strength of materials is too sensitive to the temperature difference close to the critical temperature difference of rupture, it is unsuitable to use the critical temperature difference of rupture to characterize the thermal shock resistance of ceramic materials. this study shows some innegligible problems in the evaluation system for the thermal shock resistance of ceramic materials.

manufacturing_engineering	indoor positioning techniques are being considered for use within team sports where players are tracked and recorded providing coaching assistance. while global positioning system (gps) is the de facto standard employed to estimate the location of players, this is unsuitable for accurate indoor positioning due to roof and wall signal obstruction. over a dozen techniques have been suggested for wireless indoor positioning of static and/or moving objects with improved methods for limiting the position estimation errors. for those indoor techniques that rely on radio frequency (rf) signal propagation, propagation statistics are useful in determining path loss and signal degradation. this static indoor propagation knowledge is critical in the design of wireless indoor positioning systems and ultimately the accuracy of the position estimation. signal path propagation losses and variations produced from shadowing, multipath, fading, scattering or diffraction from objects can hinder the designer 's efforts to provide a reliable and accurate positioning system. however, sporting indoor environments generally have an open floor area where play is conducted free from objects apart from the players themselves. at the elite sporting level these indoor play areas are designed and constructed under international specifications. consequently, static wireless rf signal propagation knowledge obtained from one of these commonly built play areas is applicable to hundreds of other venues around the world. many of these indoor sporting areas are used for a variety of sports, for example, basketball, volleyball, indoor cricket, indoor soccer, netball and handball. a player positioning installation could potentially be used for all of these sports. this paper reports the wireless rf signal propagation of a 2.4ghz waist mounted beacon for an indoor sporting venue 'play area', which has been designed to international standards. a basketball court constructed of highly polished wood was chosen as the sample 'play area'. propagation models are discussed and comparisons between predicted and measured results demonstrate the validity of the technique.

thermodynamics	shear banding is observed in many soft materials. we recently developed a two-fluid model for semidilute entangled polymer solutions by using the generalized bracket approach of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. this model assumes that fickian diffusion and stress-induced migration generate a nontrivial velocity difference between the polymers and the solution, thereby resulting in shear band formation. a straightforward implementation of the slip boundary conditions is possible because the differential velocity is treated as a state variable. numerical calculations showed obvious shear banding in the polymer concentration profile. increasing the pressure gradient reduces the inhomogeneity of the concentration profile and moves the transition region toward the center of the channel. moreover, the velocity deviates from the typical parabolic form and shows a plug-like profile with a low shear band near the center and a high one near the walls. the lack of hysteresis in the profiles of the volumetric flow rate calculated with the increasing and decreasing pressure gradient demonstrates the uniqueness of the solution. in addition, the flow rate exhibits a spurt at a critical pressure gradient, as experimentally observed for shear banding materials. the simplicity of the new model encourages us to analyze it in more complicated flows.

manufacturing_engineering	today, manufacturing is being shaped by the paradigm shift from mass production to on demand dictated, personalized, customer-driven and knowledge-based proactive production. thus, shorter product life cycles, an increased number of product varieties, high performance processes, flexible machines and production systems result in an increased complexity in all factory level domains from product design, process development, factory and production planning to factory operation. to handle this complexity, new knowledge-based methods, technologies and tools to model, simulate, optimize and monitor planned and existing manufacturing systems are required. this paper presents the challenges, the approach and an overview of the results of the eu-fp7 funded project apps4ame (ga no 314156) and provides a concise overview over the engineering apps (eapps) approach that the project is based on. the project aims at the comprehensive consideration of ict-based support of manufacturing engineering in all the above mentioned domains, called advanced manufacturing engineering (ame). the different life cycles are aligned by the development of a reference data model that provides a detailed overview of all relevant domain-specific and inter-domain interdependencies. this life cycle-oriented model enables an integrated product design, process development, factory planning as well as production planning and factory operation. all stakeholders in these activities are supported by eapps that are conceived, developed and validated with the help of four industrial use cases spanning very diverse industrial branches.

computer-aided_design	the demand for electricity production has been consistently raising since the last century. in the future, the tendency is to grow even further. concerning this fact, renewable energy and specifically, wave energy should be considered as an alternative for energy production. however, devices suitable to harness this renewable energy source and convert it into electricity are not yet commercially competitive. this paper is focused on the structural analysis of a wave energy converter (wec) through the numerical study of several design parameters. tridimensional computer aided design (3d cad) numerical models were built and several finite element analyses (fea) were performed using a commercial finite element code. the main components of the wec were simulated assuming different materials. the von mises stress gradients and displacement fields determined by fea demonstrated that, regardless of the wec component, materials with low young 's modulus seems to be unsuitable for this application. the same is valid for the material yield strength since materials with higher yield strength lead to a better structural behavior of the wec components. the developed 3d
strength_of_materials	various designated precipitation hardening and cold working have been employed to improve mechanical properties of aluminum magnesium silicon alloys. the aim of this study is to study how both high strength and excellent ductility could be achieved. two main processes are competing to each other when the cold working is combined with precipitation hardening. they are dislocation annihilation during age treatment which improves ductility; and dislocation pinning by precipitates which increases strength of materials. in this paper, the mechanical properties of cold rolled aa6061 sheets in pre-aging, single and double aging conditions were compared. the different sequences of precipitation hardening and cold working were employed to achieve both high strength and excellent ductility. the results show that the amount of initial cold rolling and pre-aging may have negligible effect on the strength and hardness but significant effect on the ductility of alloy.

computer-aided_design	background and aim: prosthetic cad/cam systems require accurate 3d limb models; however, difficulties arise when working from the person 's socket since current 3d scanners have difficulties scanning socket interiors. while dedicated scanners exist, they are expensive and the cost may be prohibitive for a limited number of scans per year. a low-cost and accessible photogrammetry method for socket interior digitization is proposed, using a smartphone camera and cloud-based photogrammetry services. technique: 15 two-dimensional images of the socket 's interior are captured using a smartphone camera. a 3d model is generated using cloud-based software. linear measurements were comparing between sockets and the related 3d models. discussion: 3d reconstruction accuracy averaged 2.6 +/- 2.0 mm and 0.086 +/- 0.078 l, which was less accurate than models obtained by high quality 3d scanners. however, this method would provide a viable 3d digital socket reproduction that is accessible and low-cost, after processing in prosthetic cad software.
fluid_mechanics	this paper is concerned with approximations of the boltzmann equation based on the method of moments. we propose a generalization of the setting of the moment-closure problem from relative entropy to -divergences and a corresponding closure procedure based on minimization of -divergences. the proposed description encapsulates as special cases grad 's classical closure based on expansion in hermite polynomials and levermore 's entropy-based closure. we establish that the generalization to divergence-based closures enables the construction of extended thermodynamic theories that avoid essential limitations of the standard moment-closure formulations such as inadmissibility of the approximate phase-space distribution, potential loss of hyperbolicity and singularity of flux functions at local equilibrium. the divergence-based closure leads to a hierarchy of tractable symmetric hyperbolic systems that retain the fundamental structural properties of the boltzmann equation.
strength_of_materials	determining the residual stress during casting processes is important for evaluating the mechanical properties and strength of materials and to optimize manufacturing conditions. in this study, we propose a field data interface procedure between fdm and fem in a 3-dimensional space for analyzing the casting process and structural analysis. the casting process was analyzed using fdm and the data of the temperature distribution were converted into a format suitable for fem analysis to calculate the thermal stress and safety factor by tightening force. the results of the coupled analysis between fdm and fem showed that casting residual stress is an important factor in predicting life time and evaluating durability.

computer-aided_design	structured-light (sl) depth sensors are widely used because of their simplicity in design and ability to process depth data with minimal computational expense. certain sl light coding methods can, however, lead to a loss of information, as well as inhomogeneous depth errors that depend on the composition and properties of the scene. this results in a reduction of potential accuracy for model-based pose estimation methods that operate on the depth images or subsequently transformed three-dimensional point clouds, such as the popular class of point set registration (psr) methods. we therefore formulate an asymptotically optimal maximum likelihood estimation (mle) method that operates directly on the raw sl infrared (ir) images. the proposed slir-mle method maximizes the likelihood of the measured ir image over the pose region given the object model, sensor model, and calibrated speckle and thermal noise distributions. we also formulate a method to compute the fisher information contained in the ir image and resulting cramer-rao bound (crb) of any unbiased pose estimator for unique sl sensor measurement data. slir-mle is shown to nearly achieve the calculated crb for the kinect sensor by operating on the more informative raw ir images. furthermore, our method is shown to outperform two cutting edge psr methods by an order of magnitude in the respective mean square errors.
materials_engineering	the present study is concerned with a numerical analysis of the uncertainties in the response of foam core sandwich structures caused by the uncertain microstructure of the core material. in the sense of an integrated computational materials engineering type approach, a three-step procedure is proposed. in the first step, the effective material properties of the core material are computed. for this purpose, a probabilistic homogenization procedure is adopted for the prediction of all elastic constants together with their probability distributions as well as all spatial correlations and interrelations between the individual parameters. in the second step, a random field model for the core material is derived, based on the homogenization results obtained in the first step. the random fields are found to reproduce all stochastic features of the uncertain core material in a proper manner. using the random field description as an input for a monte-carlo-type structural analysis, the uncertainties in the stiffness and strength of sandwich structures are computed in the third step. the capabilities of the proposed procedure are demonstrated using the example of a single edge clamped sandwich beam under transverse loads.

materials_engineering	computational simulation tools have become critical components for supporting learning, as well as research, in both science and engineering. one objective of these tools is to help students develop deeper conceptual understanding of difficult concepts. this explanatory sequential mix-method design study characterizes the influence of the use of a computational tool called gibbs, on the students' understanding and representation of core concepts in thermodynamics. participants included 48 sophomore-engineering students from a large midwestern university who were enrolled in the course entitled ""thermodynamics of materials."" in the first phase, quantitative results examined students' conceptual understanding before and after being exposed to the computational tool as part of their laboratory session. in the second phase a qualitative evaluation characterized the nature of students' representational forms and the way they used them. results for the quantitative study revealed positive gains in students' conceptual understanding for the majority of the concepts tested. in addition, insight gained from the qualitative analysis identified how students' representational systems were used to support their conceptual understanding in thermodynamics of materials concepts.
fluid_mechanics	slotted liners are flow control devices widely used in both injection and production wells for thermal oil sands recovery operations such as steam-assisted gravity drainage. in these devices, slots are cut into the well at regular intervals around and along the well. the dimensions tend to be from fractions to several millimeters in gap and a few to about twenty centimeters long along the pipe. the key benefits offered by slotted liners are that they are among the most economical solutions for sand control and well bore stability as well as manufacturing. slotted liners have several design parameters including the slot density, pattern, slot opening size and shape that must be chosen to provide optimum inflow and outflow performance in the reservoir. due to the complexity in deriving these parameters analytically or experimentally, we have examined the impact of design parameters on steam injection by using a realizable k-epsilon turbulence computational fluid dynamic model of a 5 m slotted liner section coupled to a reservoir flow domain outside of the well governed by a modified darcy 's law that accounts for inertial effects. the results reveal that slot open area affects the flow distribution in the reservoir. the role of drive forces changes through the flow with viscous and pressure forces dominant in the slot and upstream area an(d) inertial forces just downstream of the slot and pressure and viscous forces in the reservoir.

internal_combustion_engine	the methanol fuel used in diesel engine can reduce the emissions effectively, while the performance of engine keeps unchanged or even improved, the study of methanol used in diesel engine is paid more and more attention. experiments were conducted in a 4-cylinder, turbocharged direct injection diesel engine fueled with diesel/methanol dual fuel (dmdf). in the experiment, methanol was injected into inlet duct by two low-pressure injectors, and directly mixed with intake air before entering the engine. the diesel fuel was directly injected in cylinder. the methanol substitution percent (msp), intake air temperature and engine speed were changed to investigate the unevenness degree (ued) cylinder-to-cylinder. the experimental results show that the ued of engine increases with the increase of msp under various engine loads, the covpp increases with msp under low engine load, and the covpp curves vary very little under low msp under 75% and 100% engine load, but a significantly rise appeared when msp further increases. the ued gradually increases with the increase of intake air temperature, and it is usually less than 8% when intake air temperatures lower than 80 degrees c under 40% msp. it suggests it is helpful to decrease the ued when the intake air temperature is in the range of 35-80 degrees c as msp less than 40%. in addition, the difference of pressure between cylinder-to-cylinder decreases with the increase of engine speed, it can be considered raising msp at high engine speed in order to gain better engine economy.

thermodynamics	involvement of suprafacial and intrafacial oxygen species in catalytic combustion of methane over the (100) faceted cobalt spinel was systematically examined as a function of temperature and ch4 conversion (x-ch4). the clear-cut co3o4 nanocubes of uniform size were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and characterized with xrd, rs, hr-tem, xrf, tpsr (ch4/o-16/18(2)), and ssitka (ch4/o-16/18(2)) techniques. the experimental results were corroborated by first-principles thermodynamic and dft+u molecular modeling, providing a rational framework for a detailed understanding of the origin of a different redox comportment of the catalyst with the varying temperature and its mechanistic implications. three temperature/conversion stages of the methane oxidation reaction were distinguished, depending on involvement of the adsorbed or lattice oxygen and the redox state of the catalyst. a stoichiometric (100) surface region (300 degrees c < t < 450 degrees c, x-ch4 < 25%) is featured by the dominant suprafacial (langmuir-hinshelwood) mechanism of methane oxidation. a region of slightly defected surface (450 degrees c < t < 650 degrees c, 25%80%), the oxygen vacancies are only partially refilled, the catalyst is significantly reduced, and methane is combusted according to the mars van krevelen scheme. molecular modeling revealed that the suprafacial co-o-ads adoxygen species are more active (delta e-a = 0.83 ev) than the intrafacial co-o-surf surface sites (delta e-a = 1.11 ev) in the ch4 oxidation. the (100) surface state diagrams for the three distinguished conversion regions were constructed to elucidate the catalyst thermodynamic behavior under those conditions. it was shown that the activity of cobalt spinel is maintained by redox autotuning of the catalyst and dynamic adjustment of uneven participation of the suprafacial and intrafacial oxygen species in methane oxidation to the actual reaction conditions. these factors have important structural and mechanistic consequences for the catalytic ch4 combustion on cobalt spinel and related systems, controlling not only the sustainable versus the stoichiometric turnovers but also for the prevalence or coexistence of the langinuir-hinshelwood and the mars van krevelen mechanisms with the reaction progress.
fluid_mechanics	the analysis of the penalized stokes problem, in its variable viscosity formulation, coupled to convection-diffusion equations is presented in this article. it models the interaction between a highly viscous fluid with variable viscosity and immersed moving and deformable obstacles. indeed, while it is quite common to couple poisson equations to diffusion-transport equations in plasma physics or fluid dynamics in vorticity formulations, the study of complex fluids requires to consider together the stokes problem in complex moving geometry and convection-diffusion equations. the main result of this paper shows the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to this equations system with regularity estimates. then we show that the solution to the penalized problem weakly converges toward the solution to the physical problem. numerical simulations of fluid mechanics computations in this context are also presented in order to illustrate the practical aspects of such models: lung cells and their surrounding heterogeneous fluid, and porous media flows. among the main original aspects in the present study, one can highlight the non linear dynamics induced by the coupling, and the tracking of the time-dependence of the domain.
manufacturing_engineering	in manufacturing engineering, localization accuracy is a key concern in the design of a fixture to specify a locating scheme and tolerance allocation. this paper presents a general analysis methodology that is able to characterize the effects of localization source errors based on the position and orientation of the workpiece. from this methodology, a fixture model is formulated by taking into account the overall errors among the system consisting of the workpiece and the fixture in the design of the fixture locating scheme. with this model, the locating principle and a criterion of the robust optimal design are then proposed to improve the localization quality of the fixture. some examples are provided and allow for a detailed discussion about how to carry out the optimal design of the locating scheme. a comparative study is also made between the optimal solution and the empirical one. finally, an experiment is made to validate the fixture locating scheme for a cylindrical workpiece. we conclude that this robust design method effectively achieves stable machining precision in workpieces.
machine_design	in this paper, a novel motor topology (lateral stator machine) is proposed for various drilling applications where the space in the tool head is limited. the stator of the motor grows in one lateral direction, allowing for a compact direct drive design. finite-element analysis (fea) is carried out and the machine design is optimized for the specifications of a high-speed micro-machining spindle which is given as an example. the design procedure for those specifications is described in detail, where the torque is maximized while considering the space limitations and the loss constraints at the critical operating points. the construction of a lateral stator machine merged into a test bench is also described. the test bench is used for measuring the standstill torque of the machine in a configuration without bearings, such that only the electromagnetic torque is measured without any friction effects from the bearings. moreover, the test bench can be modified to measure the no-load losses and separate the mechanical and electromagnetic components of it. although described on a lateral stator machine, the measurement methodology of this paper can be applied to any electrical machine. finally, measurement results are given and the design procedure is verified.
machine_design	this paper explains the reason for the difference in maximum torque-speed characteristics and power factor of im between the motor and generator operation modes and investigates the influence of machine design parameters on the difference, such as stator resistance, rotor resistance and iron loss etc. an analytical mathematical model based on the dq reference frame is employed for investigation. it is shown that the difference in torque-speed characteristics between the motor and generator operation modes is mainly caused by the opposite direction of q-axis current and affected by stator and rotor resistance values. finally, analytically calculated torque-speed characteristics of a 12 kw im in the motor and generator operation modes are verified by finite element analyses.

hydraulics	this study presents a methodology for the estimation of a-priori parameters of the widely used kinematic wave approximation to the unsteady, 1-d saint-venant equations for hydrologic flow routing. the approach is based on a multi-dimensional statistical modeling of the macro scale spatial variability of rating curve parameters using a set of geophysical factors including geomorphology, hydro-climatology and land cover/land use over the conterminous united states. the main goal of this study was to enable prediction at ungauged locations through regionalization of model parameters. the results highlight the importance of regional and local geophysical factors in uniquely defining characteristics of each stream reach conforming to physical theory of fluvial hydraulics. the application of the estimates is demonstrated through a hydrologic modeling evaluation of a deterministic forecasting system performed on 1672 gauged basins and 47,563 events extracted from a 10-year simulation. considering the mean concentration time of the basins of the study and the target application on flash flood forecasting, the skill of the flow routing simulations is significantly high for peakflow and timing of peakflow estimation, and shows consistency as indicated by the large sample verification. the resulting a-priori estimates can be used in any hydrologic model that employs the kinematic wave model for flow routing. furthermore, probabilistic estimates of kinematic wave parameters are enabled based on uncertainty information that is generated during the multi-dimensional statistical modeling. more importantly, the methodology presented in this study enables the estimation of the kinematic wave model parameters anywhere over the globe, thus allowing flood modeling in ungauged basins at regional to global scales.

computer-aided_design	selective laser melting (slm) process, an additive manufacturing (am) technology, has had a rapid growth in the biomedical and aerospace markets because of the ability to manufacture complex designs directly from computer-aided design (cad) using materials such as titanium and aluminum alloys. although this technology allows designers to fabricate geometries not achievable with conventional manufacturing, it has some restrictions. the paper presents the technological problems and restrictions resulting in the production of structures in aluminum alloy by slm. in particular, it analyzed the input file of the process, .stl file, and the dimensional limits of geometries with sharp edges as a simple parallelepiped with a square base since the understanding of the limitations can help the designer in the creation of new components. the creation of function-independent design rules, easily transferrable on individual part designs, could allow a wide industrial usage and a better knowledge of am technologies. the results presented in this paper showed that the choice of parameters of conversion from the cad model to .stl file could be a restriction for the software for preprocessing part but also affects the surface roughness. moreover, if a slm machine with a laser beam of 100 mu m is used, it is not possible to produce geometries with sharp edges with size base below 0.8 mm in an aluminum alloy.
machine_design	a novel expert hydro/aero-static spindle design system strategy is presented in this paper. it is based on the comprehensive principles of machine design, machining dynamics and metal cutting mechanics. the transmission and lubrication types of the spindle are decided by a selection system, which utilize a dedicated logical choice algorithm in the light of the specifications of both workpiece material and desired cutting condition. hydro/aero-static spindles are designed by this system from its dynamics perspective. the chatter vibration of the spindle is automatically improved by optimizing the structural parameters of the spindle. meanwhile, the predicted frequency response function (frf) of the spindle based on the rotor dynamics is integrated to the chatter vibration stability law. consequently, the expert design system enables the structure of machine tools to be designed efficiently with a higher precision. the proposed system was demonstrated through an aerostatic spindle design for micro-array structures machining.

thermodynamics	the density measurements have been carried out for ternary aqueous solutions containing a fixed concentration (similar to 0.1 mol center dot kg(-1)) of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-cd) and varying concentrations (similar to 0.003 to similar to 0.21 mol center dot kg(-1)) of some local anesthetical drugs, namely procaine hydrochloride (pc center dot hc1), lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate (lc center dot hc1) and tetracaine hydrochloride (tc center dot hc1) at 298.15 k. the density data are used to determine apparent molar volumes of the drug molecules in ternary solutions at finite concentrations (phi(v)) as well at infinitely dilute solutions (phi(0)(v)). following the methods developed by hoiland et al. as well by jolicoeur et al. and using the infinite dilution volume values for the drugs in ternary and binary solutions and incorporating the equilibrium constant values for the complexation between alpha-cd and drugs, volume changes due to encapsulation or complexation have been estimated. it is observed that all the studied hydrochlorides exhibit high positive volume change due to complexation. the results are discussed in terms of host-guest interaction and structural specificity of guest molecules.

computer-aided_design	the influence of the acuteness of the model angle and the direction of printing was investigated on different three-dimensional (3d) printers to understand the fidelity of 3d printing. a polyjet printer and two fused deposition modeling printers were used in the present study. computer-aided design (cad) models were designed in the form of a triangular prism with a height of 15 mm and with varying angles of 60a degrees, 45a degrees, 30a degrees, 20a degrees, 10a degrees, and 5a degrees. from the cad designs, additive manufacturing (am) models were printed in three different directions by each of the three printers. to investigate the global fidelity of the 3d printers, the height and surface outlines of the am model cross sections were measured. the fidelity of the am models with increasingly acute angles was not accurately reproduced when 3d printed, and the surface outlines of the am model cross sections were different in each direction of printing for each device. printing technology and printing direction need to be considered if accurate reproduction of acute angles in fine am structures in medical models is a necessity.
manufacturing_engineering	the context and problem of identifying and thereafter representing, analyzing and managing information and knowledge about an organization has always been very crucial to achieve business goals in an efficient and flexible way. particularly in a plm context, the issue of information overload is growing in importance. an emergent challenge consists in providing a context-driven access to federated information and knowledge and fostering cross-discipline collaborations between actors to improve quality in product development. this paper highlights key issues for knowledge definition and representation. we propose a bottom-up approach based on the user story mapping method (usm). this method is user-centric and leads to the definition of current and/or expected scenarios and processes along with a collaboratively agreed vision. common concepts and viewpoints are therefore derived and generalized through a process of merging defined roles, activities and usages sequences with a focus on the product content. this bottom-up approach provides a federated and common understanding of information throughout the industrial product and process lifecycle; which combined with appropriate tools and methods, such as questionnaires, standards specifications, knowledge based approaches, etc. results in the definition of the knowledge network and domain and therefore improves capabilities for sharing and reusing this knowledge in collaborative product development. the proposed approach is applied in the context of the fp7 european project linkeddesign (linked knowledge in manufacturing, engineering and design for next-generation production) based on three application scenarios.
internal_combustion_engine	as a result of severe environmental pressure and stringent government regulations, refined energy management for vehicles has become inevitable. to improve vehicle fuel economy, this paper presents a bus-based energy management system for the electrical system of internal combustion engine vehicles. both the model of an intelligent alternator and the model of a lead-acid battery are discussed. according to these models, the energy management for a vehicular electrical system is formulated as a global optimal control problem which aims to minimize fuel consumption. pontryagin 's minimum principle is applied to solve the optimal control problem to realize a real-time control strategy for electrical energy management in vehicles. the control strategy can change the output of the intelligent alternator and the battery with the changes of electrical load and driving conditions in real-time. experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the traditional open-loop control strategy, the proposed control strategy for vehicle energy management can effectively reduce fuel consumption and the fuel consumption per 100 km is decreased by approximately 1.7%.

strength_of_materials	there is evidence that when at least one spatial dimension of a material component is in the nanometer range, the effects of nanosize stress concentrators (nscs) such as impurities, inclusions, pores, and cracks are either eliminated or significantly reduced. the aim of the paper is to examine such evidence using atomistic simulation techniques for a crystalline metal and identify the critical dimensions below which the effects of nscs are minimal or even nonexistent. the preliminary results reported herein show that for cu single crystals subjected to constant external strain rate, such critical dimensions are larger than about 30 rim. since atomistic details are crucial in understanding material behavior at such scales, the paper points to the need for multiscale simulations techniques, presently being developed, for identifying critical dimensions and for examining slow strain rates. based on the results, the paper presents simulation-based explanations why nscs may be insignificant at nanoscales.

fluid_mechanics	turbine blade surfaces are cooled by jet flow from expanded exit holes (eehs) against the prevailing hot gas flow. the flow through eeh must be designed to form a film of cool air over the blade. computational analyses are performed to examine the cooling effectiveness of flow from eeh over the suction side of a blade by solving conservation equations and the ideal gas equation of state for turbulent and compressible flow. for a sufficiently high coolant mass flow rate, the flow through eeh, which acts as a converging-diverging nozzle, is choked at the nozzle throat, resulting in a supersonic flow, a shock, and then a subsonic flow downstream. the location of the shock relative to the high-temperature gas flow determines the temperature distribution along the blade surface; which is analyzed in detail when the following conditions are varied: coolant mass flow rate, the temperature difference between gas-and coolant-flow, eeh location on the blade surface, eeh inclination angle to the blade surface, and exit-to-inlet area ratio (ar) of eeh. the film cooling effectiveness is calculated along the surface of the blade. the results show (1) increasing the coolant flow rate improves the effectiveness, (2) change in temperature difference between the mainstream and the coolant slightly affects the effectiveness, (3) inclination angle of eeh has a pronounced effect on film cooling and the corresponding effectiveness, (4) both the location of the eeh on a blade and the ar of the eeh slightly change the effectiveness.

thermodynamics	caffeic acid (ca) is a plant polyphenol which acts as an antioxidant and has various pharmacological effects. dna is one of the major cellular targets of therapeutic molecules. thus, studying the interaction of small molecules with dna is of great importance. in the current article, we have studied the mode of binding of ca with calf thymus dna (ct-dna) using a series of biophysical techniques. formation of complex between ca and ct-dna is ascertained by analyzing the uv-vis absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra of ca upon successive addition of ct-dna. binding constants of ca with ct-dna obtained using multiple experiments was in the order of 103 m-1 which is consistent with known groove binders. analysis of thermodynamic parameters suggest that hydrogen bonding and van der waal 's forces played major role in the binding process. competitive displacement studies confirmed that ca binds to the minor groove of ct-dna. these observations were further validated by ki quenching experiment, dna melting studies, cd and viscosity measurements. in silico molecular docking further provided insight into the mode of binding of ca with ct-dna. through in vitro experiments and in silico molecular docking studies, it was concluded that ca binds to the minor groove of ct-dna.

machine_design	this paper puts forward a novel design method of permanent magnet synchronous generator (pmsg). the most significant advantage of this method is that the output power of pmsg can be prominently improved without increasing any material costs. the main difference from the traditional design scheme is that the volume of permanent magnet (pm) remains unchanged during the entire design procedure. and the maximum output power scheme is found out just by optimizing the pm 's shapes with the change of mechanical pole-arc coefficient. in other words, this method aims to obtain the maximum pm utilization design scheme that can produce more ""effective"" magnet field so that it can generate the larger output power. the dimension parameters of pms with different shapes are calculated by the equivalent analytic geometry method. to verify its availability, this novel method is performed on four common types of pmsgs with different rotor structures, and their satisfactory performance results are obtained. the comparison with the traditional machine design scheme is also presented to illustrate the innovation and priority. the finite element analysis method based on ansoft/maxwell is applied for the electromagnetic models' building and simulation.
fluid_mechanics	the role of hyaline hairs on the thallus of brown algae in the genus fucus is long debated and several functions have been proposed. we used a novel motorized set-up for two-dimensional and three-dimensional mapping with o-2 microsensors to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the diffusive boundary layer (dbl) and o-2 flux around single and multiple tufts of hyaline hairs on the thallus of fucus vesiculosus. flow was a major determinant of dbl thickness, where higher flow decreased dbl thickness and increased o-2 flux between the algal thallus and the surrounding seawater. however, the topography of the dbl varied and did not directly follow the contour of the underlying thallus. areas around single tufts of hyaline hairs exhibited a more complex mass-transfer boundary layer, showing both increased and decreased thickness when compared with areas over smooth thallus surfaces. over thallus areas with several hyaline hair tufts, the overall effect was an apparent increase in the boundary layer thickness. we also found indications for advective o-2 transport driven by pressure gradients or vortex shedding downstream from dense tufts of hyaline hairs that could alleviate local mass-transfer resistances. mass-transfer dynamics around hyaline hair tufts are thus more complex than hitherto assumed and may have important implications for algal physiology and plant-microbe interactions.
manufacturing_engineering	wear resistance is an important rubber compound property related to useful product life. the rubber compound properties that affect wear behavior are very complicated. wear is related to a rubber compound 's cut resistance, tear resistance, fatigue resistance hardness, etc. the most commonly used test method to determine the wear resistance of rubber materials is abrasion test. tested compounds are usually compared on a ""volume loss"" basis which is calculated from the weight loss and density of the compound. this method is known to be variable and does n't give additional information for the wear behavior. for this reason we propose alternative approaches for examination of the wear behavior of rubber composites, giving information not only for the wear resistance but also for elastic the modulus, stiffness of the material, damage mechanism, etc. continuous multi-cycle indentation is used to determine the indentation hardness, elastic modulus and the stiffness with two indenter types - vickers and sphero-conical. comparison of both results is made in order to investigate the effect of the indenter type.

computer-aided_design	conventional planar transistor shows shrinking substrate bias effect at scaled technology. on the other hand, epitaxial delta-doped channel (edc) transistor shows substantial amount of substrate bias effect even at 16-nm channel length. this paper unveils the physics behind the substrate bias effect of an n-channel edc transistor through technology computer aided design simulation with analytical justifications. the depletion width for an edc transistor very weakly depends upon the applied substrate bias, and with scaling down of channel length, the depletion width insignificantly gets widened. the substrate control over the channel is high so that significant amount of substrate depletion charge terminates on the gate, instead of on the source and the drain. the degradation of threshold voltage roll off and drain-induced barrier lowering coefficient with the increase of substrate bias, is less for the edc transistor, compared to that of a conventional halo free transistor. the dependence of the substrate bias sensitivity on the thickness of the low-doped epitaxial layer and concentration of the high-doped layer is explored. the effects of reverse substrate bias on leakage power dissipation and intrinsic delay of edc and conventional transistors are discussed.

machine_design	design of an agricultural machine is a highly complex process due to interactions between the operator, machine, and environment. mountain coffee plantations constitute an economic sector that requires huge investments for the development of agricultural machinery to improve the harvesting and post-harvesting processes and to overcome the scarcity of work forces in the fields. the aim of this study was to develop a preliminary design for a virtual prototype of a coffee fruit harvester. in this study, a project methodology was applied and adapted for the development of the following steps: project planning, informational design, conceptual design, and preliminary design. the construction of a morphological matrix made it possible to obtain a list of different mechanisms with specific functions. the union between these mechanisms resulted in variants, which were weighed to attribute scores for each selected criterion. from each designated proposal, two variants with the best scores were selected and this permitted the preparation of the preliminary design of both variants. the archetype was divided in two parts, namely the hydraulically articulated arms and the harvesting system that consisted of the vibration mechanism and the detachment mechanism. the proposed innovation involves the use of parallel rods, which were fixed in a plane and rectangular metal sheet. in this step, dimensions including a maximum length of 4.7 m, a minimum length of 3.3 m, and a total height of 2.15 m were identified based on the functioning of the harvester in relation to the coupling point of the tractor.

internal_combustion_engine	engine performance varies significantly due to the variations in weather conditions in different regions. so, in order to optimize the performance and fuel consumption, engines should be calibrated according to the weather conditions in which they operate. in this paper the effects of the air conditions (such as pressure and temperature) on the power and fuel consumption of the si engine are modeled. first a comprehensive one-dimensional model of the real engine is constructed in gt power (r), and validated with experimental data from actual engine. next, using this model, a set of experiments is carried out by varying pressure, temperature, and humidity of the incoming air, and engine speed. the measuring outputs are the power and bsfc of the engine. then, two mathematical models are developed using mlp neural networks and also regression technique to estimate the outputs in terms of the inputs. at last, the estimation ability of the models is shown by a set of new experiments. these models could be used in engine calibration and shift the process from a near blind one to the one in which prior information have a significant role.
materials_engineering	accreditation bodies for engineering education around the world have been advocating for the implementation of outcome based education. in order to achieve this effectively, engineering educators are increasingly adopting student-centered modes of learning. one such mode is problem based learning (pbl). in this paper experience with the implementation of micro-level pbl is described. here one topic in a course on electronic materials at the undergraduate programme in materials engineering is taught using pbl. at the end of the course, students feedback is recorded to gauge the success or otherwise of this learning method. in general, student are found to be more enthuiastic in learning with pbl than in lectures. they appreciated to have, in the pbl, an opportunity to play the role of a professional engineer and to apply acquired kowledge to solve a particular problem. student feedback reveals that pbl can be effective in achieving the programme outcomes (pos) that are not easy to achieve through lectures, such as those related to i) lifelong learning, ii) team work, iii) professional and ethical responsibility, iv) economic, social and environmental impact, etc.. thus pbl can complement lectures in successfully implementing outcome based education. implementation of pbl at the micro level, that is, for one topic in a course has been found to be fairly easy as it does not require any extra resources. since converting the whole undergraduate programme into pbl can be a formidable venture, it is believed that pbl can be adopted for a limited number of topics in some of the major courses in the programme with tangible benefits.
computer-aided_design	temperature variation during semiconductor device operation can be significant and how this affects contact resistance is investigated. this paper reports improvements to analytical modeling for determining specific contact resistance (scr) by including the effect of temperature. a technique for extracting the value of scr using technology computer-aided design (tcad) modeling is also demonstrated. scr results obtained for analytical and tcad models for metal-to-silicon contacts are compared and this shows the significance of temperature in the analyticalmodel. small changes in electron affinity and, hence, barrier height due to changes in temperaturemust be considered in order to obtain reliable analytical expressions for scr.

strength_of_materials	failure mechanisms of materials are intrinsically intertwined with nonhomogeneity and randomness at fine scales. by using mean field data for heterogeneous materials, homogeneous materials-based fracture models might result in prediction of unrealistic smooth crack trajectories and consequently unreliable load-carrying capacity. this study aims to develop a heterogeneous cohesive (hc) crack model to predict macroscopic strength of materials based on meso-scale random fields of fracture properties. by characterizing spatially varying fracture properties as random fields, heterogeneous cohesive crack propagation is simulated to predict more realistic crack paths and to more reliably assess macroscopic load-carrying capacity. a new stress-based criterion to determine the crack growth direction is developed by taking into account both the crack-tip stress state and heterogeneity of the tensile strength. a concrete beam subjected to mixed-mode fracture is modelled as a benchmark example to demonstrate the hc crack model. the numerical simulation reveals that crucial fracture phenomena, such as the tortuousness in crack trajectories, can be effectively captured by the hc model. effects of various important parameters on the crack paths, peak loads, macroscopic ductility and overall reliability, including the variance of random fields, the correlation length, and the shear fracture resistance, are investigated and discussed. criticality of the crack propagation incremental length in fracture modelling of random heterogeneous materials is especially highlighted.

computer-aided_design	assembly or disassembly sequence planning is a very hard combinatory problem while the assembly parts numbers become important. to reduce this difficulty, especially for the case of complex products, the subassembly identification concept can constitute an original way. it aims to decompose the complex assembly product into some subassembly entities containing a small number of parts. consequently, the generation of assembly or disassembly sequence planning of parts becomes between the subassemblies and, in that case, can be determined relatively easily. despite the prettiness of the subassembly method, the identification of subassembly from a computer-aided design (cad) model remains a relevant research subject to be improved. in this paper, a subassembly identification approach is presented. the proposed approach begins with the exploration of the cad assembly data to carry out an adjacency matrix. then, to identify the subassemblies, the extracted matrix is transformed through three steps. the first step consists of idealizing this matrix by removing all connection parts identified by the feature-manager, which permits reducing its size. afterward, based on the reduced matrix, an all-direction matrix is constructed to identify the base part of a subassembly. the third step consists of enriching the all-direction matrix by mounting conditions to construct the set of subassemblies. an example of a cad assembly mechanism is presented in all sections of this paper in order to explain and discuss the steps of the proposed approach.

thermodynamics	we study an s-p model magnetic system with a triplet ground state coupled to two temperature baths. by varying the temperatures we both generate non-thermal electronic distributions and create additional coherences in the density matrix of the system. thus the thermally-induced magnetic response goes beyond the simple picture of majority-minority population dynamics. furthermore, we discuss the influence of temperature induced relaxation effects on the dynamics induced by an optical perturbation for this quantum system.

fluid_mechanics	we describe a measuring transducer of electrical conductivity of liquids, used both under laboratory conditions and also for the study of ocean processes (under natural conditions). the transducer is represented in the form of a separate unit for laboratory investigations, which can be used as part of a deep-water hydraulic probe. for an example of different processes and flows, at the ipmekh ran laboratory of fluid mechanics it has been shown that a small-scale transducer has a high speed and high spatial resolution.
thermodynamics	the main problem of utilization of ceramic nanopowders consists in their tendency to form hard agglomerates. the inter-agglomerate space forms pores surrounded by numerous elementary particles (crystallites). such pores cannot be easily removed from the system during pressureless sintering. so, the obvious strategy for a technologist is to eliminate such pores at the level of shaping operations. dry pressing is a frequently applied shaping technique of ceramic materials. that is why mechanical strength of agglomerates should be as low as possible. it enables the elimination of inter-agglomerate pores to occur under moderate pressures, applied during the shaping process. this problem will be illustrated using the really nanometric (below 10 nm) zirconiayttria solid solution powder. the methods of effecting agglomerate strength will be shown. one of the elaborated powder preparation rout results in extremely soft agglomerates.
fluid_mechanics	according to the fluid mechanics and rolling theory, the rolling interface friction dynamic characteristics and their influence on rolling speed, rolling load, roller material, rolling temperature and oil properties were studied respectively with lubrication or without lubrication in hot rolling. the two-dimensional reynolds equation was established for steady and unsteady rolling friction interface. through the research of rolling interface friction characteristics influence on the mill vibration, we found that when the lubrication film thickness in the roll gap was thicker, the friction coefficient was lower, its damping effect and system stability was worse. and if the rolling speed is greater than a certain value, the rolling interface friction coefficient will fall sharply with the increase of rolling speed and produces the self-excited vibration caused by negative damping. so the contrast test with different rolling interface has been carried out, such as the emulsion is open or close, high chromium cast iron/high speed steel roller is put to use, high chromium cast iron roller is grinded finely or coarsely, rolling speed is normal/reduced. and the results showed that it had an obvious effect on the mill vibration suppression by the adoption of the emulsion close and high speed steel roller.
internal_combustion_engine	the purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate a new application of hydrogen to a special internal combustion engine (free-piston engine generator). the development of a full-cycle zero-dimensional dynamic simulation model is described, and an extensive coupled research method is presented by the iteration simulation between the zero dimensional dynamic model and a multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics engine model of combustion process, giving insight into the operating characteristics and performances of the new hydrogen fueled engine. the influences of the piston motion on combustion process are analyzed. the performance characteristics of the new hydrogen engine are found to differ significantly from those of a corresponding traditional hydrogen engine and a free-piston gasoline engine. the results indicate that compared with the above-mentioned traditional hydrogen engine, the free-piston hydrogen engine has a higher piston acceleration around top dead center (tdc) and a advantage in terms of emissions formation due to faster power stroke expansion, but the indicated efficiency is slightly lower due to the longer late combustion process. moreover, the indicated efficiency, combustion velocity and peak pressure are both larger, compared with the free piston engine combusting gasoline, and the concentration of no emission also has an advantage. copyright (c) 2015, hydrogen energy publications, llc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
machine_design	this paper investigates the transient synchronization performance of a line-start permanent magnet synchronous machine (ls pmsm) taking into account the effect of the rotor cage slot design, active permanent magnet volume and load inertia. first the transient performances of a rotor cage with different slot profiles and the same cross sectional area are evaluated. the design optimization of ls pmsm with a selected rotor slot shape is then conducted by employing an adapted multi-step taguchi method. the aim of the optimization is to improve transient performance. in addition, the optimized rotor design is subjected to further sensitivity analysis by exposing the design to various noise factors such as the system 's moment of inertia and permanent magnet volume. this is to check the robustness of the design. finally, results are discussed and relevant conclusions are drawn.
thermodynamics	chitosan materials that were prepared from different sources of fishery waste were subsequently characterized and the influence of molecular weight (mw) and degree of deacetylation (dda) on the chitosan-acetic acid solution viscosity was studied. the mw of the prepared chitosan was found to influence the viscosity of the solution and, an increase in mw increases the viscosity of the chitosan acetic acid solution, while the dda was found not to influence the viscosity of chitosan-acetic solutions. chitosan solutions with varying concentrations and viscosities, were used to produce chitosan membranes by the phase inversion technique, followed by cross-linking the membranes using glutaraldehyde. the chitosan content of the membranes was found to be only 4-6 mol%, and the characterisation results indicated that the membranes could be visualised as consisting of a hydrated polymeric network in which chitosan forms a rigid honeycomb structure. the moisture that was present in the membrane was found to be present as fixed water, integrated with the chitosan that enabled the use of a pressure driving force for the removal of moisture from the membrane. the free water content was subsequently found to be equal to the porosity of the membrane, namely 65% of the total water in the membrane, with 30% of the water being characterised as fixed water. the membrane wet density, pore radius and specific surface area were determined as 1100 kg m(-3), 40 nm, and 1.15 x 10(5) m(2) kg(-1) respectively. subsequently, the chitosan membranes were found to be analogous in their transport behaviour to ultrafiltration membranes. the pure water flux of the membranes was found to be in the order of 12 lm(-2)hr(-1)bar(-1), and the transport of solutes and solvent could be modelled sufficiently at low solute concentrations using a generic membrane model derived from irreversible thermodynamics.

internal_combustion_engine	due to combination of factors, such as environmental concerns, high oil prices and the potential for peak oil, development of cleaner alternative fuels and advanced power systems for vehicles has become a high priority for many governments and vehicle manufacturers around the world. use of gasoline as an alternative fuel in gasoline engine is becoming a need, looking at the scarcity of petroleum fuels in near future. this paper investigates the influence of compression ratio and ethanol-gasoline blending to find the effects on four-stroke si engine performance. in this research, air cooled engine having compression ratio of 9.1 & 9.7 is used. fuel blend e50 is used in the study and engine operated at a speed range of 600-1100 rpm. maximum power was obtained for e50 fuel at a compression ratio of 9.1, while, a minimum fuel consumption rate was obtained at a compression ratio of 9.7. this clearly depicts that as compression ratio increases, fuel consumption rate decreases considerably. further, experimental results showed that comparing several blends, 50% ethanol is cost and power effective for the four-stroke si engine.
strength_of_materials	the critical conditions to effect transverse fracture in canine teeth of carnivores in lateral loading are analyzed. the teeth are modeled as tapered coaxial beams with uniformly thin enamel coats. a stress analysis is first carried out using beam theory, and stress intensity factors for inward propagating cracks at the location of maximum tensile stress along the lingual face are then determined. the fracture begins as arrested channel cracks within the enamel, followed by stable penetration around the tooth and into the dentin to the point of failure. two- and three-dimensional finite element models are used to evaluate the full fracture evolution. the analysis yields an explicit scaling relation for the critical fracture load in terms of characteristic tooth dimensions, notably tooth height and base radius. the role of enamel, ignored in previous 'strength of materials' analyses, is shown to be important in determining the precursor crack equilibrium prior to full fracture. implications concerning allometry are briefly discussed.

materials_engineering	combining high strength, hardness and high toughness remains a tremendous challenge in materials engineering. interestingly nature overcomes this limitation, with materials such as bone which display unusual combinations of these properties in spite of their weak constituents. in these materials, highly mineralized ""building-blocks'' provide stiffness and strength, while weak interfaces between the blocks channel non-linear deformation and trigger powerful toughening mechanisms. this strategy is also exploited in multilayered ceramics, fiber-reinforced composites, and more recently in topologically-interlocked materials. in this work we apply these concepts to the toughening of glass panels by incorporating internal architectures carved within the material using three-dimensional laser engraving. glass is relatively stiff and hard but it has no microstructure, no inelastic deformation mechanism, low toughness and poor resistance to impacts. we demonstrate how introducing controlled architectures in glass completely changes how this material deforms and fails. in particular, our new architectured glass panels can resist about two to four times more impact energy than plain glass. our architectured glass also displays nonlinear deformation, progressive damage and failure contained within a few building blocks. this work demonstrates how micro-architecture, bio-inspiration and top-down fabrication strategies provide new pathways to transform the mechanics and performance of materials and structures.

internal_combustion_engine	the usage of a fuel cell (fc) as a range extender in a full electric vehicle (fev) is a convenient solution to address the issue of the shortage of range of this type of vehicles. compared with the internal combustion engine range extender (ice-re), the fuel cell - range extender (fc-re) has the potential to provide power with higher efficiency (more than 50%) and, above all, it can allow zero emissions operation of the vehicle even when the on-board power source is switched on for range extension. in this work, the introduction of a new ht-pemfc (high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell), developed in the framework of the collaborative european project artemis (automotive pemfc range extender with high temperature improved, meas and stacks), on a light duty, full electric, commercial vehicle, was investigated. firstly, a model of the full electric vehicle was created and validated by means of experimental tests carried out on rolling chassis dyno over both type approval and real world driving cycles. once the model was developed, the effects of the introduction of an ht-pemfc on the vehicle range was evaluated and the performances of different ht-pem fuel cell stack systems, combined with various hydrogen storage system configurations, were compared.

materials_engineering	the paper is devoted to analysis of the utilization possibilities of suitable similarity criteria for physical modelling of transfer processes between metal and slag including the presence of a third gaseous phase. the attention is also devoted to the modelling results and to the simulation methodology of the element transfer in the ladle. the modelling was done on a physical model of the ladle constructed on a geometric scale of 1: 9 located in the laboratory of physical and numerical modelling at the department of metallurgy, faculty of metallurgy and materials engineering. first, the discussion deals with the option of converting the operating variables to laboratory values, and vice versa. the suitability of the chosen similarity criteria for individual methodology of the simulation is also discussed. the results of the physical modelling of the transfer and homogenization processes are used as input data. the discussion is also focused on factors affecting the intensity of these processes under real operating conditions of the secondary metallurgy equipment. from analysis of the results, the final recommendations lead to the further expansion of the physical modelling techniques and to the results complementation by the data obtained from the numerical modelling. the department of metallurgy together with the department of physical chemistry and theory of technological processes are involved in the regional materials science and technology centre project, research program no. 6. in this project, these workplaces created the laboratory for modelling of processes in the liquid and solid phases. the newly purchased equipment and existing human and material laboratory facilities will provide new opportunities for conducting applied research not only in the field of transfer and homogenization processes in the ladle.
thermodynamics	we revisit the equilibrium one-dimensional phi(4) model from the dynamical systems point of view. we find an infinite number of periodic orbits which are computationally stable. at the same time some of the orbits are found to exhibit positive lyapunov exponents! the periodic orbits confine every particle in a periodic chain to trace out either the same or a mirror-image trajectory in its two-dimensional phase space. these ""computationally stable"" sets of pairs of single-particle orbits are either symmetric or antisymmetric to the very last computational bit. in such a periodic chain the odd-numbered and even numbered particles' coordinates and momenta are either identical or differ only in sign. ""positive lyapunov exponents"" can and do result if an infinitesimal perturbation breaking a perfect two-dimensional antisymmetry is introduced so that the motion expands into a four-dimensional phase space. in that extended space a positive exponent results. we formulate a standard initial condition for the investigation of the microcanonical chaotic number dependence of the model. we speculate on the uniqueness of the model 's chaotic sea and on the connection of such collections of deterministic and time-reversible states to the second law of thermodynamics.

machine_design	cross-sectional ovalization of thin-walled circular steel tube because of large plastic bending, also known as the brazier effect, usually occurs during the initial stage of tube 's continuous rotary straightening process. the amount of ovalization, defined as maximal cross section flattening, is an important technical parameter in tube 's straightening process to control tube 's bending deformation and prevent buckling. however, for the lack of special analytical model, the maximal section flattening was determined in accordance with the specified charts developed by experienced operators on the basis of experimental data; thus, it was inevitable that the localized buckling might occur during some actual straightening operations. new normal strain component formulas were derived based on the thin shell theory. then, strain energy of thin-walled tube (per unit length) was obtained using the elastic-plastic theory. a rational model for predicting the maximal section flattening of the thin-walled circular steel tube under its straightening process was presented by the principle of minimum potential energy. the new model was validated by experiments and numerical simulations. the results show that the new model agrees well with the experiments and the numerical simulations with error of less than 10%. this new model was expected to find its potential application in thin-walled steel tube straightening machine design.
strength_of_materials	the objective of this study is the characterization of the fretting fatigue strength in a hydrogen gas environment. the test materials were a low alloy steel scm435h, super alloy a286 and two kinds of austenitic stainless steels, sus304 and sus316l the test was performed in hydrogen gas at 0.12 mpa absolute pressure. the purity of the hydrogen gas was 99.9999%. the fretting fatigue limit was defined by the fretting fatigue strength at 30 million cycles. for all materials, the fretting fatigue strength in the hydrogen gas environment increased in the short-life region. however, the fretting fatigue strength in the hydrogen gas environment decreased in the long-life region when exceeding 10 million cycles except for scm435h, while there was no reduction in the fretting fatigue strength in air between 10 and 30 million cycles. the reduction rate was 18% for a286, 24% for sus304 and 7% for sus316l the tangential force coefficient in the hydrogen gas environment increased when compared to that in air. it can be estimated that this increase is one of the causes of the reduced fretting fatigue strength found in a hydrogen gas environment. in order to discuss the extension of the fretting fatigue life in hydrogen gas observed at the stress level above the fretting fatigue limit in air, continuous measurement of the fretting fatigue crack propagation was performed in a hydrogen gas environment using the direct current potential drop method. as a result, it was found that the extension of the fretting fatigue life was caused by the delay in the start of the stable crack propagation.

computer-aided_design	to analyse the accuracy of maxillary positioning after le fort i osteotomy, we retrospectively assessed the outcome in three patients (mean (range) age 40 (21 60) years) who had been treated with patient-specific cad-cam osteosynthesis plates as part of a bimaxillary osteotomy. virtual surgical planning in each case was based on cone-beam computed tomography (ct) (simplant (r) o&o, dentsply implants nv, kessel-lo, belgium), and patient-specific cad-cam drilling guides and osteosynthesis plates were produced for maxillary positioning and fixation. we evaluated the accuracy of the placement by virtual comparison of the preoperative and postoperative images. in the upper dentition, postoperative analysis showed a mean (sd) deviation of 1.3 (1.4) mm from the preoperative plan. the method enables accurate placement of the maxilla, independent of the condyle or mandible, without the need for extraoral reference points.

thermodynamics	textbooks state that the lift, drag, and thrust coefficients cl, cd, and ct, are numbers that must be dimensionally proper (i.e., dimensionless) for their use in comparing different data sets. this paper posits that for the meaningful comparison of different data sets, numbers must be dimensionally and physically proper. the physical propriety is satisfied by expressing the number as a ratio of work and the energy available at an aerodynamic system during the generation of lift, drag, or thrust. the aerodynamic systems addressed in this paper are aircraft, propellers and lift rotors, cylinders in magnus effect, and flapping wings. this paper introduces the normalized lift, eta(l), normalized drag eta(d), and normalized thrust, eta(t), numbers that are dimensionally and physically proper and can evaluate the ability of generating lift, drag, and thrust of these aforementioned systems and compare this ability between different systems. these numbers are shown to act like the thermal efficiency. in thermodynamics as they represent the ratio of work exerted onto the surrounding flowfield and the kinetic energy available at the system, are associated with a maximum value eta(max) (that may exceed 1) and can be read on a stand-alone basis. their common mathematical format facilitates crosspollination between engineering, biomechanics, and biology. a numerical calculation of the normalized lift eta(l) of the blades of the record-breaking quadcopter aerovelo atlas is presented and compared with its lift coefficient cl as calculated by the aerovelo group.

computer-aided_design	purpose: the aim of this study was to determine the stability of computer-aided design and manufacturing (cad/cam) and prefabricated abutment by measuring removal torque before and after cyclic loading. materials and methods: three types of fixture and 2 types of abutments were used. removable torque was measured after cyclic loading for 5000 cycles between 25 and 250 n for each group. the same procedure was performed twice. results: first, removal torque values (newton centimeter) were measured for stock versus custom abutments as follows: group 1: 27.17 versus 26.67, group 2: 26.27 versus 26.33, and group 3: 37.33 versus 36.67. second removal torque values (newton centimeter) were also measured: group 1: 23 versus 23.5, group 2: 22.5 versus 22.33, and group 3: 32.67 versus 32.5. there was no significant difference between the stock and custom abutments in either the first or second removal torque values and also no significant difference among initial tightening torque, first or second removal torque (p >0.05). conclusion: with precise control of cad/cam abutments, good screw joint stability can be achieved.
fluid_mechanics	central aortic pressure (cap) can be used to predict cardiovascular structural damage and cardiovascular events, and the development of simple, well-validated and non-invasive methods for cap waveforms estimation is critical to facilitate the routine clinical applications of cap. existing widely applied methods, such as generalized transfer function (gtf-cap) method and n-point moving average (npma-cap) method, are based on clinical practices, and lack a mathematical foundation. those methods also have inherent drawback that there is no personalisation, and missing individual aortic characteristics. to overcome this pitfall, we present a personalized-model-based central aortic pressure estimation method (pm-cap)in this paper. this pm-cap has a mathematical foundation: a human aortic network model is proposed which is developed based on viscous fluid mechanics theory and could be personalized conveniently. via measuring the pulse wave at the proximal and distal ends of the radial artery, the least square method is then proposed to estimate patient-specific circuit parameters. thus the central aortic pulse wave can be obtained via calculating the transfer function between the radial artery and central aorta. an invasive validation study with 18 subjects comparing pm-cap with direct aortic root pressure measurements during percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention was carried out at the beijing hospital. the experimental results show better performance of the pm-cap method compared to the gtf-cap method and npma-cap method, which illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

computer-aided_design	transient operations are very crucial for high power insulated-gate bipolar transistor modules, because high current and voltage are applied during this period for several microseconds. therefore, the ability for doubly fed induction generator (dfig) variable speed wind turbine power converters to withstand abnormal conditions is strictly imperative in order to achieve its lifetime specifications and also fulfil the grid codes. this study presents a new control scheme for dfig wind turbine having parallel interleaved converters (pic) configuration and a series dynamic braking resistor (sdbr) connected at its stator side. interleaving the wind turbine converters in parallel configuration could help to increase the current capability, while the sdbr helps in post fault recovery of the wind turbine. the coordinated control analysis of the scheme was implemented in power system computer aided design and electromagnetic transient including dc simulation environment for a severe three-phase to ground fault. results obtained were compared with the conventional dc chopper and crowbar rotor circuit protection scheme for the wind turbine. a better performance of the wind turbine variables were achieved using the proposed control scheme of the pic and sdbr because the space vector modulation of the pic results in maximum value of the change in common mode voltage, leading to improved switched output voltage of the voltage source converter leg.
manufacturing_engineering	while serving a vital role in the undergraduate curriculum, capstone design courses face a variety of challenges. these challenges include lack of student value & utilization of course objectives & assessment tools, sponsor retention & funding issues, and large instructional demands. many of these challenges may be addressed by placing a larger and more genuine emphasis on assessing the product of the design project, not only the process by which the design occurs. oregon state university 's (osu) mechanical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering capstone course currently organizes, manages, and evaluates capstone projects using the house of quality (hoq). in general, the hoq is a tool used to relate project requirements to design performance specifications. additionally, at osu the hoq serves as (i) a contract between students, sponsors, course instructors, and faculty advisers detailing exactly what is required from the design project, (ii) a guiding tool to allow students to self-monitor their progress throughout the course, and (iii) an objective means of evaluating the students' performance in terms of the product produced by their capstone design projects. this paper describes the osu course, introduces the hoq, and presents a time-line of the implementation of product assessment at osu. key changes are shown during the move from a purely process based assessment framework to the current state where 50% of total points in the design implementation term of the capstone course are awarded based on the student design team accomplishing design product metrics per sponsor defined design requirements. in addition, the authors report on the course instructor 's perception regarding the effect of implementing the hoq in the osu capstone course. finally, conclusions and implications of the work are presented.

fluid_mechanics	a simple new device for dry separation of fine particulate matter from bulk soil samples is presented here. it consists of a stainless steel tube along which a nitrogen flow is imposed, resulting in the displacement of particles. taking into account particle transport, fluid mechanics, and soil sample composition, a tube 6-m long, with a 0.04-m diameter, was found best adapted for pm10 separation. the device rapidly produced several milligrams of particulate matter, on which chemical extractions with edta were subsequently performed to study the kinetic parameters of extractable metals. new caledonian mining soils were chosen here, as a case-study. although the easily extracted metal pool represents only 0.5-6.4 % of the total metal content for the elements studied (ni, co, mn), the total concentrations are extremely high. this pool is therefore far from negligible, and can be troublesome in the environment. this dry technique for fine particle separation from bulk parent soil eliminates the metal-leaching risks inherent in wet filtration and should therefore ensure safe assessment of environmental quality in fine-textured, metal-contaminated soils.
machine_design	this paper proposes a novel dual-consequent-pole vernier memory machine (dcp-vmm) featuring alternatively arranged ndfeb and low coercive-force (lcf) magnet poles on the rotating and stationary sides, respectively. due to the presence of lcf magnets that can be repetitively magnetized or demagnetized via a simple current pulse, the extra-high torque density at low-speed, and excellent high-efficient high-speed flux-weakening performance can be simultaneously realized. the configuration and operating principle, as well as the design considerations of the proposed machine are introduced, respectively. the finite element method (fem) coupled with a nonlinear analytical hysteresis model for lcf magnets is employed to investigate the electromagnetic performance of the machine, which verifies the effectiveness of machine design and the feasibility as a competent candidate for automotive applications.
hydraulics	the boiling water reactors (bwrs) are inherently nonlinear physical system, as any other physical system. the reactivity feedback, which is caused by both moderator density and temperature, allows several effects reflecting the nonlinear behavior of the system. stability analyses of bwr is done with a simplified, reduced order model, which couples point reactor kinetics with thermal hydraulics of the reactor core. the linear stability analysis of the bwr for steady states shows that at a critical value of bifurcation parameter (i.e. feedback gain), hopf bifurcation occurs. these stable and unstable domains of parametric spaces cannot be predicted by linear stability analysis because the stability of system does not include only stability of the steady states. the stability of other dynamics of the system such as limit cycles must be included in study of stability. the nonlinear stability analysis (i.e. bifurcation analysis) becomes an indispensable component of stability analysis in this scenario. hopf bifurcation, which occur with one free parameter, is studied here and it formulates birth of limit cycles. the excitation of these limit cycles makes the system bistable in the case of subcritical bifurcation whereas stable limit cycles continues in an unstable region for supercritical bifurcation. the distinction between subcritical and supercritical hopf is done by two parameter analysis (i.e. codimension-2 bifurcation). in this scenario, generalized hopf bifurcation (gh) takes place, which separates sub and supercritical hopf bifurcation. the various types of bifurcation such as limit point bifurcation of limit cycle (lpc), period doubling bifurcation of limit cycles (pd) and neimark-sacker bifurcation of limit cycles (ns) have been identified with the floquet multipliers. the lpc manifests itself as the region of bistability whereas chaotic region exist because of cascading of pd. this region of bistability and chaotic solutions are drawn on the various parametric bifurcation diagrams (c) 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
internal_combustion_engine	with urging needs to decrease the fuel consumption and environment pollution, energy saving and emission reduction technologies in the ice (internal combustion engine) industry are developed. a thermal os/orc (oil storage/organic rankine cycle) system was constructed and preliminarily tested for whr (waste heat recovery) from exhaust gas of a 240 kw diesel engine. the heat balance test of diesel engine without os/orc was conducted first to investigate the varying property of exhaust gas, then the os/orc system was tested to show its ability against high temperature and variation of exhaust gas. the results show that thermal oil effectively dropped the working temperature of organic fluid to less than 210 degrees c, which is much lower than the decomposition temperature of many organic fluids. also, thermal oil brought a significant inertia to the response of system which could be positive against the variation of engine condition. in order to learn more about the operating characteristics of os/orc system, the impact of important parameters on each other was investigated quantitatively as well as on the performance of os/orc system. the results show that within the given range, higher evaporating pressure can obviously improve the performance of os/orc while the impact of superheat is nearly negligible.

internal_combustion_engine	there are increasing pressures upon the automotive industry to reduce harmful emissions as well as meeting the key objective of enhanced fuel efficiency, while improving or retaining the engine output power. the losses in an internal combustion (ic) engine can be divided into thermal and parasitic as well as due to gas leakage because of untoward compression ring motions. frictional losses are particularly of concern at low engine speeds, assuming a greater share of the overall losses. piston-cylinder system accounts for nearly half of all the frictional losses. loss of sealing functionality of the ring pack can also contribute significantly to power losses as well as exacerbating harmful emissions. the dynamics of compression ring is inexorably linked to its tribological performance, a link which has not been made in many reported analyses. a fundamental understanding of the interplay between the top compression ring three-dimensional elastodynamic behavior, its sealing function and contribution to the overall frictional losses is long overdue. this paper provides a comprehensive integrated transient elastotribodynamic analysis of the compression ring to cylinder liner and its retaining piston groove lands' conjunctions, an approach not hitherto reported in the literature. the methodology presented aims to aid the piston ring design evaluation processes. realistic engine running conditions are used which constitute international drive cycle testing conditions.
hydraulics	steam injector (si) is known as passive jet pump and heat exchanging device which operates without external power source or mechanical machineries. it utilizes direct contact condensation heat transfer between steam and water-jet as a driving mechanism of the operation and is capable of discharging sub cooled water at higher pressure than the inlet fluids pressure. in addition, it has an excellent heat transfer capability, more than 1000 times that of shell and tube heat exchanger. in the present study, thermal hydraulics characteristics of the water-jet-centered supersonic si system were investigated from both experimental and analytical approaches. the si body was manufactured with stainless steel equipped with overflow port. the water injection nozzle was designed with shaft-driving mechanism to freely adjust the axial location of the water nozzle and steam inlet cross sectional area. high pressure steam was supplied to the si from once-through boiler, which is capable of supplying saturated steam at the maximum pressure of 0.63 mpa for the current test facility. water jet was injected at mass flow rate of 0.4-0.8 kg/s. pressure and temperature measurements were conducted at inlet and outlet of the steam injector system as well as at the overflow port to investigate the operation characteristics of the si. results showed the water-jet centered si 's promising functionality as a passive coolant injection in view of its quick-start up, operable condition limits, discharge pressure and heat transfer capabilities at current inlet conditions. in addition, obtained experimental results were compared with analytical model to assess the predictive capability of discharge pressure value and reasonable agreement was obtained.

machine_design	this paper proposes a combined numerical and analytical approach for magnetic vibration analysis of a new dc-excited multitoothed switched reluctance (msr) machine. first, the machine design is artfully to incorporate the dc-excited winding into the msr topology, hence breeding a new flux controllable, high-torque, low-torque ripple, and doubly salient magnetless machine. then, the finite-element-method is used to calculate the machine force and torque. a series of analytical equations are formulated to calculate the magnetic vibration parameters of the proposed machine. the analysis process and the corresponding results are given to verify the validity of the proposed approach for magnetic vibration analysis of the new machine.
thermodynamics	this paper presents the results of research conducted in the field of confinement effects in ultrathin dielectric films. method of choice is the method of green 's functions which proved to be a very powerful tool for theoretical research in solid state physics. among many other properties of materials, such as optical, conductive, etc. with this method it is possible to obtain critical values of boundary parameters corresponding to all transitions from bulk to localized exciton states. this research is valid for four layered crystalline film, since that type of ultrathin structure was the object of research. conditions for occurrence of one, two, three, or even four localized states have been found and analyzed and regions with equal number of localized states have been defined. this corresponds to the process of reconstruction of the energy spectra of excitons in quasi 2d nanostructures with respect to those in corresponding bulk-structures.
machine_design	the study involved performance evaluation of a multistage jatropha fruit shelling machine (pi2015701163) which is used to produce jatropha kernels (oil-rich nucleus) with higher purity by removing both the outer shells of fruits and husks (seeds' coating). the reduction of shells and husks together, which is not commonly practised at the moment, can improve oil yield and quality during oil extraction process in biodiesel production. the shelling machine consists of two cracking unit with each having different roller clearance for different stage of decortications. every roller was featured with male threads on the surface. the male threads in different rotating directions and speeds can provoke more shearing effect onto the loaded jatropha fruits. the machine design also deploys multistage separation mechanisms consisting of vibratory sieve and blowers for a purpose to produce cleaner kernels. the designed machine has been tested at different blower air speeds and fruit moisture contents. the optimal air speed and fruit moisture content were found to be 9.8 +/- 0.4 m s(-1) and around 5.7% w.b. respectively, where the husks could be removed without causing high kernel loss. the overall results show that the designed machine at the optimal conditions was able to remove 99% of shells and 52% of husks while controlling the kernel loss at around 5%. further, the separation process which applies blower as separation mean has been further analysed using eulerian model and dense discrete phase model (ddpm) in ansys fluent, for a purpose to understand the behaviour of jatropha fruits' particles under air flow during the separation process. the simulation revealed that some vortices have existed at converging portion or slope end of the designed separator duct due to instantaneous changes of air velocity and pressure. the formation of vortices could change the flowing direction of particles and lengthen the residence time of the particles in the duct. the phenomena were also found able to cause momentum loss of heavier kernel particles, achieving reduction of kernel loss during the separation process. the simulation results have provided a basis to understand the dynamics of multiphase flow. further, the numerical model makes the study possible to provide a better insight for making a decision along with future developed scaling factor for machine scaled up activity.

hydraulics	ski jump is one of the most effective structures in energy dissipation over spillways. spillways have long been of practical importance to safety of dams. the major criteria in hydraulic design are based on the analytical and empirical methods. in the current study, in order to increase chute spillway efficiency, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm known as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (nsga-ii) has been utilized to design the optimal triangular bucket angle and chute width. in design method, two separate objective functions have been used. in the first objective function, equations of dynamic pressure of the bucket, the jet length after bucket, and the scour depth have been used. the second objective function is related to construction volume of chute spillway. for calibrating the first objective function, characteristics of karoon iii dam have been used as a case study. the difference between design parameters of karoon iii spillway and those from nsga-ii algorithm method is less than 12 percent. according to the results, if the jet length is considered as the most impressive parameter in the first objective function, design of the spillway becomes frugal.

computer-aided_design	the authors of this study explored (a) body-to-pattern measurement and shape relationships in trouser patterns drafted by two methods; (b) the consistency of these body-to-pattern relationships between methods and between differently shaped bodies within methods; (c) the patternmaking procedures that cause these outcomes; and (d) how these findings impact garment fit, particularly for mass customization. body-to-pattern measurement and shape relationships were inconsistent between and within methods, making them unsuitable for use in computer-aided custom patternmaking. most strikingly, pattern crotch shapes were similar within each method, despite the fact that form crotch shapes were different. patternmaking procedures causing these inconsistencies include (a) use of proportion of noncorresponding body measurements; (b) use of standard, rather than body, measurements; (c) variations in ease as proportions or standard amounts; (d) trueing, blending, and connecting steps; (e) variation between methods of measurements used, in use of proportions or standard measurements, and in steps; and (h) disregard of body shape.
fluid_mechanics	seawater viscosity is influenced by temperature as well as through excretion of exopolymers by some plankton. we examined the role of viscosity on the movement patterns and sensory abilities of the dinoflagellate heterocapsa triquetra, manipulating the viscosity of seawater to simulate a 10 +/- 1.5 degrees c temperature change. in a second treatment, we seeded the water with microbeads to examine swimming behaviours in the presence of a mechanical stimulus. increased viscosity reduced distances between conspecifics 4.7-fold and increased distances between protists and microbeads by 3.4-fold. increased viscosity also affected other aspects of motility, with an overall reduction in swimming speed of 2.0-and 7.0-fold for treatments with and without mechanical stimuli. higher viscosities were associated with upward vertical migration, in both the presence and absence of microbeads. cells were highly sensitive to disturbances to the velocity field, by as little as 1.5%, and different approach distances of h. triquetra to conspecifics over mechanical stimuli suggest sensory capacity to distinguish types of particles. mediation of motility and migratory behaviours through viscosity implies ramifications for the distribution of protists and their encounters with resources, predators and conspecifics triggered by events such as temperature changes and phytoplankton bloom events.
machine_design	the thermal analysis of high speed machine is necessary made to check of serviceability. the temperatures of electric machine individual parts influence other aspects of electric machine design. this paper deals with modeling of thermal phenomena of high seed asynchronous machine. the main requirement for this model is easy integration into electromagnetic model. the computational fluid dynamics (cfd) analysis can be used to determine some boundary condition of thermal model that are n't commonly known for high speed machine.
fluid_mechanics	three basic diffusion properties of argon - shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity - were studied in the neighborhood of the critical point using molecular dynamics (md) and the lennard-jones potential energy function. md simulations were performed along the 1.0p(c), and 1.2p(c) isobars. green-kubo relations and a lennard-jones pair potential were used. four different sets of lennard-jones parameters were used. a comparison of computed shear viscosity and thermal conductivity values with data available from the national institute of standards and technology (nist) displayed a good agreement. results for bulk viscosity indicated that values of this property cannot be neglected in this thermodynamic region, a result that violates the traditional and much-assumed stokes hypothesis in classical fluid mechanics. furthermore, it was shown that in the neighborhood of the critical region the bulk viscosity can have larger values than the shear viscosity.

computer-aided_design	background:horizontal advancement genioplasty can be extremely rewarding for microgenia. however, it is challenging for even very experienced surgeon to determine the three-dimensional position of the distant bone fragment during the operation. this study aimed to apply and evaluate computer-aided design (cad) and computer-aided manufacturing techniques for horizontal advancement genioplasty to improve surgical accuracy.methods:seven patients with microgenia were prospectively enrolled in the study. preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (ct), photographs, and lateral cephalograms were performed. computer-aided design was done based on preoperative ct data, and then surgical templates (cutting guide templates and fixation templates) were designed accordingly to guide horizontal advancement genioplasty. all surgeries were performed by junior surgeons. the accuracy of the authors' method was evaluated by the relative error (the mean value of discrepancy between postoperative ct and preoperative design at 6 points selected randomly/preoperative design movement x 100%), pg position error (postoperative pg advancement - preoperative cad pg advancement)/preoperative cad pg advancement x 100%), and me position error (postoperative me downward movement - preoperative cad me downward movement)/preoperative cad me downward movement x 100%). they are all calculated by geomagic automatically.results:all 7 patients were satisfied with their aesthetic outcomes. the average absolute relative error is 1.8%. the average absolute pg position error is 1.9% and the average absolute me position error value is 1.3%.conclusions:the authors' study showed that applying computer-assisted techniques for horizontal advancement genioplasty provided accurate surgical result. with this technique, best result for horizontal advancement genioplasty could be achieved by even inexperienced surgeons.
machine_design	the static and dynamic characteristics of the edm machine as the main machining unit directly influence the machining accuracy and stability. for a particular type of the edm machine, the three-dimensional model was built with solidworks and the finite element method was employed with the ansys workbench to analyze the static and dynamic characteristics of the machine. the results show that the stiffness of the ram and vertical guide (z-axis) in the y and z directions is the weak side of the machine. the analytical method is proved to be effective for the optimization of the machine design.
fluid_mechanics	ventilation is the intentional air supply to a closed space from the outside, which is essential for the sake of a comfortable environment and the health of human beings. in recent, with the wide spread of renewable energy, much attention has been paid to the natural ventilation. the natural ventilator is classified into a fixed type, a venturi type and a wind turbine type. in this study, the ventilation rates of the fixed type ventilator were experimentally investigated by changing the wind velocity. additionally, the condition of a backflow was also examined. according to the experimental results, the ventilated air flow strongly depended on the outside wind velocity and also on the intake opening area. in the reverse flow test, it was confirmed that the reverse flow into the ventilator occurred if the wind velocity was under a certain threshold value. furthermore, the reverse flow phenomenon was more severe when an obstacle is located in the downstream of a ventilator.
manufacturing_engineering	structural systems are subject to uncertainties due to variability in many hard-to-control noise factors, which include external loads, material properties, and construction workmanship. traditional structural design methodologies, although clearly recognizing the presence of uncertainty, omit robustness against the effects of uncertainty in the design process. first, if the actual uncertainties in the design process are underestimated, the design may fail to satisfy safety requirements. second, to guarantee safety in the presence of high variability of the system response, the structural designer may be forced to choose an overly conservative, thus inefficient and costly design. when robustness against uncertainty is not treated as one of the design objectives, the trade-off between over-design for safety and under-design for cost-savings is exacerbated. this manuscript demonstrates that safe and cost-effective structural engineering designs maybe achieved by implementing robust design concepts originally developed in manufacturing engineering to consider robustness against uncertainty. this manuscript presents an optimization-based methodology for the application of robust design principles to structural design and demonstrates its application on an academic problem involving design of a reinforced-concrete frame.

materials_engineering	designing materials for targeted performance requirements as required in integrated computational materials engineering (icme) demands a combined strategy of bottom-up and top-down modeling and simulation which treats various levels of hierarchical material structure as a mathematical representation, with infusion of systems engineering and informatics to deal with differing model degrees of freedom and uncertainty. moreover, with time, the classical materials selection approach is becoming generalized to address concurrent design of microstructure or mesostructure to satisfy product-level performance requirements. computational materials science and multiscale mechanics models play key roles in evaluating performance metrics necessary to support materials design. the interplay of systems-based design of materials with multiscale modeling methodologies is at the core of materials design. in high performance alloys and composite materials, maximum performance is often achieved within a relatively narrow window of process path and resulting microstructures. much of the attention to icme in the materials community has focused on the role of generating and representing data, including methods for characterization and digital representation of microstructure, as well as databases and model integration. on the other hand, the computational mechanics of materials and multidisciplinary design optimization communities are grappling with many fundamental issues related to stochasticity of processes and uncertainty of data, models, and multiscale modeling chains in decision-based design. this paper explores computational and information aspects of design of materials with hierarchical microstructures and identifies key underdeveloped elements essential to supporting icme. one of the messages of this overview paper is that icme is not simply an assemblage of existing tools, for such tools do not have natural interfaces to material structure nor are they framed in a way that quantifies sources of uncertainty and manages uncertainty in representing physical phenomena to support decision-based design.

strength_of_materials	the concepts of size and scale are of fundamental importance in science, engineering and technology, and occupy a central place in human experience and thought. size and shape are crucial properties of physical and abstract objects, while scale and dimension are basic descriptive tools that we employ to compare them. understanding the dependence of physical phenomena on size and scale allows us to develop predictive tools that form the core of design and enable the creation of artefacts and technological systems. of particular interest to us are situations when the size dependence turns out to be complex, characterized by changes and transitions in behaviour between different scales, e.g. laboratory and full scale prototypes, nano-scale objects as opposed to macroscopic, etc. scaling transitions and size effects in the fracture and strength of materials and structures have particular significance in modern science and engineering. the boundaries of scale of the mechanical phenomena studied and devices exploited are expanding, on the one hand, towards global scale phenomena, and on the other towards the nanometre scale processes. these circumstances challenge the conventional wisdom acquired over many decades, according to which laboratory experiments performed at the engineering scale (sub-mm to a few meters) provide the source of material property data then used as input for modelling at the scale of the real object. when deviations from accepted scaling laws are found, new physical deformation mechanisms need to be proposed or identified, and new modelling approaches to be developed and validated. in this paper i review some examples of non-trivial size dependence, and address a fundamental question of the efficient description of size effects and scale transitions. the functional description of multi-scaling power law regimes is considered, and the functional form suitable for the task is identified. this form is then applied to a variety of experimental data manifesting size effects, including dual failure strength criteria (stress and toughness), fatigue crack growth thresholds (kitagawa-takahashi diagram) and applications in the context of fretting fatigue, paris fatigue crack growth law, hardness of coated systems, etc.
computer-aided_design	user interface (ui) design patterns for mobile applications provide a solution to design problems and can improve the usage experience for users. however, there is a lack of research categorizing the uses of design patterns according to users' hand dominance in a learning-based mobile ui. we classified the main design patterns for mobile applications and investigated their relationships with major learning tasks. students' use of different patterns was compared with respect to hand dominance. a questionnaire on 71 patterns was administered to 92 participants, and the number of patterns they used was analyzed. ui design patterns for mobile learning significantly differed between left- and right-hand-dominant participants. we also performed a cluster analysis to explore possible theme sets among participants with regard to hand dominance in learning. the results revealed three-cluster solutions for both the left- and right-hand-dominant groups. we profiled these solutions based on insights obtained from structured interviews. our findings provide evidence that pattern use differs between right- and left-hand-dominant users with regard to reading, information retrieval, and information-browsing tasks. these findings will facilitate further development of suitable uis for educational mobile applications.
internal_combustion_engine	in a torch ignition engine system, the combustion starts in a pre-combustion chamber, where the pressure increase pushes the combustion jet flames through calibrated nozzles to be precisely targeted into the main combustion chamber. this paper presents the layout of the prototype engine and the developed fuel injection system. it continues with a detailed description of the performance of the torch ignition engine running on a gasoline/ethanol blend for different mixture stratification levels as well as engine speeds and loads. also detailed analyses of specific fuel consumption, thermal and combustion efficiency, specific emissions of co2 and the main combustion parameters are carried out. a numerical model based on thermodynamic and kinetic analyses has been established in order to explore the performance limit of a stratified torch ignition engine. the paper concludes presenting the main numerical results obtained in this work, which show a significant increase in the torch ignition engine performance as compared with the commercial baseline engine.

thermodynamics	water engages in two important types of interactions near biomolecules: it forms ordered cages around exposed hydrophobic regions, and it participates in hydrogen bonds with surface polar groups. both types of interaction are critical to biomolecular structure and function, but explicitly including an appropriate number of solvent molecules makes many applications computationally intractable. a number of implicit solvent models have been developed to address this problem, many of which treat these two solvation effects separately. here, we describe a new model to capture polar solvation effects, called sho (solvent hydrogen-bond occlusion); our model aims to directly evaluate the energetic penalty associated with displacing discrete first-shell water molecules near each solute polar group. we have incorporated sho into the rosetta energy function, and find that scoring protein structures with sho provides superior performance in loop modeling, virtual screening, and protein structure prediction benchmarks. these improvements stem from the fact that sho accurately identifies and penalizes polar groups that do not participate in hydrogen bonds, either with solvent or with other solute atoms (unsatisfied polar groups). we expect that in future, sho will enable higher-resolution predictions for a variety of molecular modeling applications.

fluid_mechanics	in fluid mechanics, a lot of authors have been executing their researches to obtain the analytical solutions of navierstokes equations, even for 3d case of compressible gas flow. but there is an essential deficiency of non-stationary solutions indeed. in our derivation, we explore the case of non-stationary helical flow of the navierstokes equations for incompressible fluids at any given initial conditions for velocity fields (it means an open choice for the space part of a solution). such a non-stationary helical flow is proved to be decreasing exponentially in regard to the time-parameter, the extent of time-dependent exponential component is given by the coefficient of kinematic viscosity, multiplied by the square of the coefficient of proportionality between the vorticity and velocity field.

thermodynamics	adsorption of methane on twelve microporous carbon adsorbents of different origin and structural and energy characteristics was studied at the pressures up to 20 mpa. specific capacities have been calculated for methane adsorption storage systems. the effectiveness of adsorption accumulation was analyzed in terms of structural and energy characteristics, packing density and thermodynamic parameters of methane adsorption. differential molar isosteric heats of adsorption and absolute efficiency of adsorption accumulation systems were evaluated. the effects of increased packing density and proper shape of adsorbent material on the adsorption accumulation efficiency were considered. it was shown that a selection of an adsorbent with the most optimal porous structure and density should be adjusted for thermodynamic parameters of accumulation system.

hydraulics	we extend a recently proposed 2d depth-integrated finite volume solver for the nonlinear shallow water equations with non-hydrostatic pressure distribution. the proposed model is aimed at simulating both nonlinear and dispersive shallow water processes. we split the total pressure into its hydrostatic and dynamic components and solve a hydrostatic problem and a non-hydrostatic problem sequentially, in the framework of a fractional time step procedure. the dispersive properties are achieved by incorporating the non-hydrostatic pressure component in the governing equations. the governing equations are the depth-integrated continuity equation and the depth-integrated momentum equations along the x, y and z directions. unlike the previous non-hydrostatic shallow water solver, in the z momentum equation, we retain both the vertical local and convective acceleration terms. in the former solver, we keep only the local vertical acceleration term. in this paper, we investigate the effects of these convective terms and the possible improvements of the computed solution when these terms are not neglected in the governing equations, especially in strongly nonlinear processes. the presence of the convective terms in the vertical momentum equation leads to a numerical solution procedure, which is quite different from the one of the previous solver, in both the hydrostatic and dynamic steps. we discretize the spatial domain using unstructured triangular meshes satisfying the generalized delaunay property. the numerical solver is shock capturing and easily addresses wetting/drying problems, without any additional equation to solve at wet/dry interfaces. we present several numerical applications for challenging flooding processes encountered in practical aspects over irregular topography, including a new set of experiments carried out at the hydraulics laboratory of the university of palermo.

machine_design	a 6/8 flux-switching machine with large air-gap and toroidal winding design is presented. the fractional-slot winding of c-core flux-switching machine is wound around the stator yoke instead of the stator pole in this machine design. on the basis of the c-core flux-switching machine several modifications of the stator core shape and of pm arrangement are evaluated by means of 2d finite element analysis. a significant enhancement of the torque capability of the toroidal winding design can be achieved by some minor changes of the stator core shape. additionally, the application of halbach shaped magnets leads to even more torque and a reduction of the leakage flux at the stator outer diameter.

hydraulics	for more than 20 years, hydrogeomorphological mapping in france has been considered as an efficient method of flood mapping that contributes to sustainable land development by taking into account occurrences of extreme events. the european floods directive (2007/60/ce) requires the production of maps showing water depths during extreme flood events. this article provides an overview of the numerical floodplain models (nfm) methodology, which uses hydrogeomorphological observations and lidar dem data to produce water depth mapping. this article focuses on the nfm realised for the meurthe river, close to the city of nancy, france. the nfm methodology initially charts the floodplain from hydrogeomorphological mapping, then uses simple hydraulics for validation, and finally produces water depth maps with gis processing. the resulting nfm shows good agreement with the historic 1947 flood. this methodology is a simple and complementary solution to hydraulics modelling. it provides a better way to communicate information on the extent extreme floods and shows the importance of hydrogeomorphology in flood hazard study and management.

hydraulics	in order to reduce the accumulation of hydrogen and thus to mitigate the risk of combustion, many countries have installed passive autocatalytic recombiners (pars) within light water reactor containments. the severe hydrogen combustion events of the recent fukushima daiichi accident are likely to incentivize an increased demand in upgrading nuclear power plants with pars. numerical simulation is an important tool for assessing par operation during a severe accident in terms of efficiency and proper installation. advanced numerical par models are required for the challenging boundary conditions during a severe accident, for example, low oxygen amount, high steam amount, and presence of carbon monoxide. the reko-direkt code has been developed in order to provide a par model capable of simulating complex par phenomena and at the same time being suitable for implementation in thermal-hydraulic codes. the development of reko-direkt was supported by small-scale experiments performed at forschungszentrum juelich in the reko facilities. these facilities allow the study of par-related single phenomena such as reaction kinetics under different conditions including variation of steam, oxygen, and carbon monoxide (reko-3) and the chimney effect (reko-4). recently, the code has been validated against full-scale experiments performed in the thermal-hydraulics, hydrogen, aerosols, iodine (thai) facility at eschborn, germany, in the framework of the organisation for economic co-operation and development/ nuclear energy agency thai project. by this, the code has proven its applicability for different par designs and for a broad range of boundary conditions (pressure of up to 3 bars, steam amount up to 60 vol %, low-oxygen conditions). reko-direkt has been successfully implemented in the commercial computational fluid dynamics code ansys-cfx as well as in the lp code cocosys [gesellschaft for anlag- und reaktorsicherheit (grs), germany].

hydraulics	monte carlo method can provide high fidelity neutronic analysis of different types of nuclear reactors, owing to its advantages of the flexible geometry modeling and the use of continuous-energy nuclear cross sections. it can also be coupled with thermal-hydraulics codes to consider feedbacks. due to the effect of thermal motion of target nucleus known as doppler effect, special treatments have to be used for cross sections at different temperature points. the traditional approach of pre-generated cross sections has difficulty of memory footprint when the number of temperature points is large. the target motion sampling (tms) method was proposed and developed in serpent code for temperature treatment based on the woodcock tracking. in this paper, the tms method was developed in rmc code based on the ray tracking. moreover, doppler-broadening rejection correction (dbrc) technique was also implemented in rmc to consider the effect of thermal motion on scattering kinematics. the pre-generated technique was proposed and applied to accelerate the calculation of tms method. the results show that tms method is equivalent to the exact cross-sections with dbrc, while tms in rmc has higher efficiency in the cases of pwr and htgr, no matter that the number of nuclides is small or large.

manufacturing_engineering	increasing quality requirements for functional sports-and work wear make their development more demanding as complex interaction between human physiology and clothing is to be taken adequately into account. previous test designs, often based on subjective perceptions, make a convincing comparison difficult. material-specific laboratory tests only offer limited validity regarding effects on physiological and ergonomic properties. principal objective of the study is to compare two different types of down jackets with respect to their effect on core body temperature during physical activity and inactivity. both jackets were filled with different lining, one with chemically modified down called ""quixdown"" (qd), the other one with conventional down (cd). a climatic chamber test with two activity sessions and a break in between was performed. subjects were physically active on a bike ergometer at moderate level. a total of n = 26 (12m, 14f) healthy and physically active subjects between 18 and 35 years of age were randomly divided into control (cg) and treatment group (tg). tg was equipped with the qd, control group with the cd jacket. to ensure identical loading intensity for the test the individual anaerobic threshold of each subject had been determined in a pretest. each person was equipped with an in-ear thermometer for measuring the core body temperature at the acoustic meatus. with qd jacket the subject 's core body temperature dropped less during the break between both activity sessions than when wearing the cd jacket (p < 0.05, omega(2) = 0.124). no statistical significance could be shown in gender (p = 0.22, omega(2) = 0.02) and interaction jacket/gender (p = 0.56, omega(2) approximate to 0). the chemically modified down insulation seems to offer better thermal insulation than conventional down.

thermodynamics	the binding of doxorubicin (dox) to cross-linked pluronic f127-g-paa-egdma and l92-g-paa-egdma microgels at different alpha (alpha) and salt concentrations was investigated using isothermal titration calorimetric (itc), optical and scanning electron microscopic techniques (sem). we seek to elucidate the mechanisms of interaction and the release of dox from cross-linked microgels composed of pluronic and poly (acrylic acid). the itc results indicated a high binding affinity of dox to the microgel, which is a function of salt concentrations due to the impact of electrostatic shielding on the dox-binding process. applying the polyelectrolyte theory allows the decoupling of the gibbs free energy of binding that describes the role of non-electrostatic interaction of dox and the microgel. the presence of dox within the microgel resulted in the collapse of the microgel due to charge shielding, pi-pi interactions and self-association of polymer-bound dox molecules. the diffusion of dox through the microgel is controlled by the dissociation of coo-/dox+ coupling pairs.

thermodynamics	virgin aggregate is heated and dried in a drum dryer and uses this heated mass to heat and dry reclaimed asphalt pavement (rap) and/or recycled asphalt shingles (ras) materials in a drum mixer before blending with virgin asphalt binder. however, often the virgin aggregate temperature inside the dryer is unknown since many dryers do not have a temperature-measuring unit but the mixer has. up to this end, thermodynamics and heat transfer principles are applied to predict virgin aggregate temperatures necessary to dry and heat rap/ras with varying moisture content and for various hot-mix asphalt (hma) mix proportions. among the many results, it is found that for a hma mix consisting of 50% virgin aggregate with 3% moisture content and 50% rap with 5% moisture content, the temperature required to raise the virgin aggregate temperature is 608 degrees c to dry and heat virgin aggregate and rap. for verification purposes, the virgin aggregate temperature is recorded at a drum plant facility, and thermodynamics and heat transfer principles are used to predict the virgin aggregate temperatures. it has been observed that for the hma mix, the temperature predicted for larger-size virgin aggregate shows good agreement with the recorded value.

machine_design	usually an induction machine with closed slots on the rotor has lower harmonics in stator line currents than that with open slots. however, some induction machines with closed-rotor slots may suffer from local saturation in the rotor slot bridges, and thus, exhibit significant low-order time harmonics in the stator currents. such phenomenon is revealed with theoretical analysis, and validated with both finite element analysis and experiments. this study is of reference value for the induction machine design so as to avoid the low-order current harmonics.
materials_engineering	background textbooks play an important role in engineering education, influencing instructors' pedagogical approaches and providing much of the information students learn. research has explored students' recollections of the roles that textbooks played in their educational experiences, but how students actually use textbooks remains largely unexplored. purpose this phenomenological study describes engineering students' textbook use during problem-solving activities. this study directly examined how students employed a textbook in order to generate detailed descriptions of students' behaviors, approaches, and reflections regarding their actual problem-solving experiences. method ten senior materials engineering students (8 males and 2 females) were asked to think aloud while solving engineering problems. follow-up retrospective interviews regarding the think aloud session were conducted to gain in-depth information on students' textbook use during the problem-solving activities. results students used the textbook primarily to find information related to problem constraints that were explicitly stated in the problem. furthermore, textbook example problems exerted a strong influence on students' problem-solving processes. students also reported limitations of the textbook, contrasting it to the diversity of resources available via the internet. conclusions this study provides insight into students' textbook use during engineering problem-solving activities. students' limited application of the textbook during problem solving suggests that textbooks may not be serving their intended purposes.
thermodynamics	the study of radiation exergy has important significance for solar energy and high-temperature engineering. in this paper, several exergy expressions of blackbody radiation were discussed and the differences between petela 's expression of exergy and two other expressions were analyzed. considering that radiant energy and thermal energy are different, the radiation machine model was established; furthermore, the validity of petela 's formula was indicated by this model. based on the concept of radiation equivalent temperature, the integral form expression of monochromatic photon exergy was put forward by establishing the infinite-staged carnot heat engine model. at the same time, an approximate relation between equivalent temperature and radiation wavelength was given. the error of this relation is negligible when calculating the exergy of blackbody radiation within the temperature range of the engineering field. finally, the monochromatic photon entropy was discussed by considering the infinite-staged carnot heat engine model, and an expression of photon entropy with integral form was given. the monochromatic photon entropy and exergy proposed in our paper satisfy the thermodynamic relation and can reflect the differences between radiant energy and thermal energy.
strength_of_materials	a quaternion is an ordered combination of four real numbers. it can also be expressed as a sum of a scalar and a vector in three dimensional euclidian space. quaternion algebra allows the division of vectors. since the current vector algebra does not allow the division of vectors; in many branches of mechanics, when a vectoral quantity falls to the denominator of an expression, the general tendency is to use its magnitude rather than its vector character. once the vector division is defined by the quaternion algebra, it becomes possible to redrive the equations that have vector quantities in their denominators. in this study, basic equations of stress in strength of materials are reviewed according to the rules of quaternion algebra. it is shown that this new point of view brings a more powerful and consistent system. the normal stress becomes a scalar quantity. area and moment of inertia of a cross-section becomes a vectoral quantity. direction of shearing stresses change and becomes a more consistent convention especially in torsion problems. the most striking results are obtained in shear flow.

internal_combustion_engine	often employed in the analysis of conventional si and ci engines, mathematical models can also be applied to engines with torch ignition, which have been researched almost exclusively by cfd or experimentally. the objective of this work is to describe the development and application of a zero dimensional model of the compression and power strokes of a torch ignited engine. it is an initial analysis that can be used as a basis for future models. the processes of compression, combustion and expansion were described mathematically and applied to an existing prototype by means of a computer code written in matlab language. conservation of energy and mass and the ideal gas law were used in determining gas temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate within the cylinder. gas motion through the orifice was modelled as an isentropic compressible flow. the thermodynamic properties of the mixture were round by a weighted arithmetic mean of the data for each component, computed by polynomial functions of temperature. combustion was modelled by the wiebe function. heat transfer to the cylinder walls was estimated by annand 's correlations. results revealed the behaviour of pressure, temperature, jet velocity, energy transfer, thermodynamic properties, among other variables, and how some of these are influenced by others.

hydraulics	seed dehydration is the normal terminal event in the development of orthodox seeds and is physiologically related to the cessation of grain dry mass accumulation and crop grain yield. for a better understanding of grain dehydration, we evaluated the hypothesis that hydraulic conductance of the ear decreases during the latter stages of development and that this decrease results from disruption or occlusion of xylem conduits. whole ear, rachis, and stem nodes hydraulic conductance and percentage loss of xylem conductivity were measured from flowering to harvest-ripeness on bread wheat (triticum aestivum l.) cv. recital grown under controlled environments. flag leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and grain and ear water potentials were also measured during grain development. we show that grain dehydration was not related with whole plant physiology and leaf senescence, but closely correlated with the hydraulic properties of the xylem conduits irrigating the grains. indeed, there was a substantial decrease in rachis hydraulic conductance at the onset of the grain dehydration phase. this hydraulic impairment was not caused by the presence of air embolism in xylem conduits of the stern internodes or rachis but by the occlusion of the xylem lumens by polysaccharides (pectins and callose). our results demonstrate that xylem hydraulics plays a key role during grain maturation.

internal_combustion_engine	this paper describes the energy management controller design of a mid-sized vehicle driven by a fuel cell/battery plug-in hybrid powertrain, where an experimentally validated hight temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell model is used. the power management strategy is derived by the application of the pontryagin 's minimum principle, where the control parameter is adapted by using feedback information on the state of charge and total trip length forecast as a function of a moving average of past information about the driving cycle speed. the strategy we propose aims at achieving a real time suboptimal solution of the control problem which is cast into the minimization of the consumed fuel. the vehicle is also equipped by an auto-thermal reformer and, in order to minimize the hydrogen buffer size, the control algorithm is subject to constraints on the maximum hydrogen buffer level. a comparative analysis of the proposed strategy against the optimal one is conducted and results are reported. the obtained fuel consumptions are also compared to those obtained by the same vehicle, powered by an internal combustion engine and by a plug-in hybrid electric powertrain.

machine_design	recently, vernier permanent magnet (vpm) machines, one special case of magnetic flux-modulated (mfm) machines, benefiting from their compact, simple construction and low-speed/high-torque characteristics, have been receiving increasing interest. in this paper, the vernier structure is integrated with an axial-flux pm machine to obtain the magnetic gear effect and produce an improved torque density for direct-drive wind power generation application. another advantage of the proposed machine is that the stator flux rotating speed can be relatively high when the shaft speed is low. with this benefit, sensorless control strategy can be easily implemented in a wide speed range. in this paper, an improved sliding mode observer (smo) is proposed to estimate the rotor position and the speed of the proposed machine. with the estimated shaft speeds, the maximum power point tracking (mppt) control strategy is applied to maximize the wind power extraction. the machine design and the sensorless mppt control strategy are verified by finite element analysis and experimental verification.
materials_engineering	atomic-scale tomography (ast) is defined and its place in microscopy is considered. arguments are made that ast, as defined, would be the ultimate microscopy. the available pathways for achieving ast are examined and we conclude that atom probe tomography (apt) may be a viable basis for ast on its own and that apt in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy is a likely path as well. some possible configurations of instrumentation for achieving ast are described. the concept of metaimages is introduced where data from multiple techniques are melded to create synergies in a multidimensional data structure. when coupled with integrated computational materials engineering, structure-properties microscopy is envisioned. the implications of ast for science and technology are explored.
machine_design	the main issue of higher education in the czech republic relating to mechanical engineering is currently the lack of opportunities for students to acquire practical knowledge and experience in the field during their studies. moreover, engineering companies in the czech republic are often reluctant to share their knowhow with universities, meaning that the study of machine design is isolated from practice in engineering companies. one way to deal with these issues is to improve different aspects of teaching technical subjects in order to improve the quality, efficiency, comprehensibility and attractiveness of machine design. the faculty of mechanical engineering at the university of west bohemia (fme) has launched the machine design teaching enhancement project (tep) whose goal is to provide students and academics at fme with quality learning materials. learning materials concerned with teaching of computer aided engineering (cae) systems were developed as a part of tep. these step-by-step learning materials promote self-study and make learning cae systems much easier for students. another part of tep is concerned with developing a new concept of project-based learning materials based on interactive cae models. the learning materials have been developed by academics in cooperation with local engineering companies and software developers. this paper presents these learning materials and their advantages for students and academics at fme.
fluid_mechanics	microgravity experiments are essential for research in space science, biology, fluid mechanics, combustion, and material sciences. one way to conduct microgravity experiments on earth is by using drop tower facilities. these facilities combine a high quality of microgravity, adequate payload masses and have the advantage of virtually unlimited repeatability under same experimental conditions, at a low cost. in a collaboration between the institute of space systems (irs) at the university of stuttgart and baylor university (bu) in waco, texas, a new drop tower is currently under development at the center for astrophysics, space physics and engineering research (casper). the design parameters of the drop tower ask for at least 1.5 sin free fall duration while providing a quality of at least 10(-5) g. previously, this quality has only been achieved in vacuum drop tower facilities where the capsule experiences virtually zero aerodynamic drag during its free fall. since this design comes at high costs, a different drop tower design concept, which does not require an evacuated drop shaft, was chosen. it features a dual-capsule system in which the experiment capsule is shielded from aerodynamic forces by surrounding it with a drag shield during the drop. as no other dual-capsule drop tower has been able to achieve a quality as good as or better than 10-5 g previous work optimized the design with an aerodynamic perspective by using computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulations to determine the ideal shape and size of the outer capsule and to specify the aerodynamically crucial dimensions for the overall system. experiments later demonstrated that the required quality of microgravity can be met with the proposed design. the main focus of this paper is the mechanical realization of the capsule as well as the development and layout of the surrounding components, such as the release mechanism, the deceleration device and the drop shaft. because the drop tower facility is a complex system with many interdependencies between all of the components, several engineering challenges had to be addressed. for example, initial disturbances that are caused by the release mechanism are a common issue that arises at drop tower facilities. these vibrations may decrease the quality of microgravity during the initial segment of free fall. because this would reduce the free fall time experiencing high quality microgravity, a mechanism has been developed to provide a soft release. challenges and proposed solutions for all components are highlighted in this paper.
machine_design	the paper presents a design procedure for tangentially magnetized variable flux machines that aims to reduce the machine inverter rating. the proposed design can achieve high torque density at low speeds, and high efficiency at an extended speed range, as armature d-axis current pulses are applied at high speeds to reduce the magnet flux, thus avoiding the flux weakening current in conventional permanent magnet synchronous (pmsms) machines. in order to regain the full torque capability when the motor slows down, a magnetizing current pulse has to be applied. the amplitude of the magnetizing current is usually larger than the machine rated current. therefore, the machine might need an oversized inverter in order to be able to re-magnetize the magnets. the impact of different machine design parameters on the magnetization current requirement is investigated in order to reduce the inverter cost.
fluid_mechanics	3d-ptv is a quantitative flow measurement technique that aims to track the lagrangian paths of a set of particles in three dimensions using stereoscopic recording of image sequences. the basic components, features, constraints and optimization tips of a 3d-ptv topology consisting of a high-speed camera with a four-view splitter are described and discussed in this article. the technique is applied to the intermediate flow field (5 <x/d <25) of a circular jet at re approximate to 7,000. lagrangian flow features and turbulence quantities in an eulerian frame are estimated around ten diameters downstream of the jet origin and at various radial distances from the jet core. lagrangian properties include trajectory, velocity and acceleration of selected particles as well as curvature of the flow path, which are obtained from the frenet-serret equation. estimation of the 3d velocity and turbulence fields around the jet core axis at a cross-plane located at ten diameters downstream of the jet is compared with literature, and the power spectrum of the large-scale streamwise velocity motions is obtained at various radial distances from the jet core.

internal_combustion_engine	this report analyzes the health benefits associated with driving an electric vehicle, and compares them with the cost of expanding the electric vehicle charging infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. damages related to poor air quality such as sick days and increased chronic illness were quantified, and reductions in instances of these issues resulted in a benefit that can be reaped by governments and municipalities. the results indicate that the benefits associated with improved air quality in general exceed the costs of installing additional charging stations. the findings indicate that the overall outlook for future expansion of charging stations can be borne by the improved air quality provided by an increasing movement away from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electrified mobility options.
fluid_mechanics	in pre-surgery decisions in hospital emergency cases, fast and reliable results of the solid and fluid mechanics problems are of great interest to clinicians. in the current investigation, an iterative process based on a pressure-type boundary condition is proposed in order to reduce the computational costs of blood flow simulations in arteries, without losing control of the important clinical parameters. the incorporation of cardiovascular autoregulation, together with the well-known impedance boundary condition, forms the basis of the proposed methodology. with autoregulation, the instabilities associated with conventional pressure-type or impedance boundary conditions are avoided without an excessive increase in computational costs. the general behaviour of pulsatile blood flow in arteries, which is important from the clinical point of view, is well reproduced through this new methodology. in addition, the interaction between the blood and the arterial walls occurs via a modified weak coupling, which makes the simulation more stable and computationally efficient. based on in vitro experiments, the hyperelastic behaviour of the wall is characterised and modelled. the applications and benefits of the proposed pressure-type boundary condition are shown in a model of an idealised aortic arch with and without an ascending aorta dissection, which is a common cardiovascular disorder.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper presents a fully coupled multiphysics model developed for numerical simulation of the elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact between a cam and roller, typically found in cam mechanisms controlling fuel injection in an internal combustion engine. special attention was focused on enabling systematic analyses of effects associated with, roller crowning and edge geometries, lubricant rheology as well as typical cam mechanism operating conditions. the interaction between the cam and roller follower result in high generated pressure and narrow film thickness that increase the risk of wear and fatigue. furthermore, this article highlights the variation of pressure and film thickness under tilting conditions. the model was also validated against some particular model problems, found in the literature.

computer-aided_design	an optimization technique that utilizes a genetic algorithm is used to minimize the electrical power produced by the conducting disks in resistive bitter magnets. the resulting values from the optimization give the conditional design parameters necessary for a preliminary magnet design. this precursor design method can be employed for either split or single solenoid nested designs. this method is used to design a 10 t, 10 s magnet at the university of maryland, baltimore county for plasma physics research. the design parameters from the optimization are used to generate computer-aided design models that are examined with finite element analysis software to verify safety and performance of the design. the magnet design then progresses to a series of thermal and mechanical tests to ensure safe operating conditions.
hydraulics	restoration of channelized streams by returning coarse sediment from stream edges to the wetted channel has become a common practice in sweden. yet, restoration activities do not always result in the return of desired biota. this study evaluated a restoration project in the vindel river in northern sweden in which practitioners further increased channel complexity of previously restored stream reaches by placing very large boulders (>1 m), trees (>8 m), and salmonid spawning gravel from adjacent upland areas into the channels. one reach restored with basic methods and another with enhanced methods were selected in each of ten different tributaries to the main channel. geomorphic and hydraulic complexity was enhanced but the chemical composition of riparian soils and the communities of riparian plants and fish did not exhibit any clear responses to the enhanced restoration measures during the first 5 years compared to reaches restored with basic restoration methods. the variation in the collected data was among streams instead of between types of restored reaches. we conclude that restoration is a disturbance in itself, that immigration potential varies across landscapes, and that biotic recovery processes in boreal river systems are slow. we suggest that enhanced restoration has to apply a catchment-scale approach accounting for connectivity and availability of source populations, and that low-intensity monitoring has to be performed over several decades to evaluate restoration outcomes.
computer-aided_design	dealing with component interactions and dependencies remains a core and fundamental aspect of engineering, where conflicts and constraints are solved on an almost daily basis. failure to consider these interactions and dependencies can lead to costly overruns, failure to meet requirements, and lengthy redesigns. thus, the management and monitoring of these dependencies remains a crucial activity in engineering projects and is becoming ever more challenging with the increase in the number of components, component interactions, and component dependencies, in both a structural and a functional sense. for these reasons, tools and methods to support the identification and monitoring of component interactions and dependencies continues to be an active area of research. in particular, design structure matrices (dsms) have been extensively applied to identify and visualize product and organizational architectures across a number of engineering disciplines. however, the process of generating these dsms has primarily used surveys, structured interviews, and/or meetings with engineers. as a consequence, there is a high cost associated with engineers' time alongside the requirement to continually update the dsm structure as a product develops. it follows that the proposition of this paper is to investigate whether an automated and continuously evolving dsm can be generated by monitoring the changes in the digital models that represent the product. this includes models that are generated from computer-aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics systems. the paper shows that a dsm generated from the changes in the product models corroborates with the product architecture as defined by the engineers and results from previous dsm studies. in addition, further levels of product architecture dependency were also identified. a particular affordance of automatically generating dsms is the ability to continually generate dsms throughout the project. this paper demonstrates the opportunity for project managers to monitor emerging product dependencies alongside changes in modes of working between the engineers. the application of this technique could be used to support existing product life cycle change management solutions, cross-company product development, and small to medium enterprises who do not have a product life cycle management solution.
internal_combustion_engine	the growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, together with increasingly available parallelism provided by multi-core chips, fosters the parallelization of simulation. simulation speed-ups are expected from co-simulation and parallelization based on model splitting into weakly coupled submodels, such as in the framework of a functional mockup interface. however, slackened synchronization between submodels and their associated solvers running in parallel introduces integration errors, which must be kept inside acceptable bounds. choptrey denotes a forecasting framework enhancing the performance of complex system co-simulation, with a trivalent articulation. first, we consider the framework of a computationally hasty online prediction system. it allows to improve the tradeoff between integration speed-ups, needing large communication steps, and simulation precision, needing frequent updates for model inputs. second, smoothed adaptive forward prediction improves co-simulation accuracy. it is obtained by past-weighted extrapolation based on causal hopping oblivious polynomials. third, signal behavior is segmented to handle the discontinuities of the exchanged signals: the segmentation is performed in a contextual and hierarchical ontology of patterns. implementation strategies and simulation results demonstrate the framework ability to adaptively relax data communication constraints beyond synchronization points which sensibly accelerate the simulation. the choptrey framework extends the range of applications of standard waring-lagrange polynomial extrapolation, often deemed unstable. the embedding of predictions in lag-dependent smoothing and discontinuity handling demonstrates its practical efficiency.
manufacturing_engineering	this paper presents the methodology that is being applied at present time for teaching and evaluation of different courses in the area of manufacturing processes engineering at the university of leon. the context is delimited to the use of content management systems and continuous evaluation of learning. in particular, the moodle platform is used for structuring the contents and for the continuous evaluation of courses in the scope of materials science, manufacturing processes and automation of operations. an analysis of the changes and challenges derived from the adoption of this methodology in the different courses in which has been applied is presented. these changes have been slightly different as a function of the compulsory or optional character of courses, as well as depending on the number of students enrolled in them.
materials_engineering	a bottom-up, multiscale modeling approach is presented to carry out high-fidelity virtual mechanical tests of composite materials and structures. the strategy begins with the in situ measurement of the matrix and interface mechanical properties at the nanometer-micrometer range to build up a ladder of the numerical simulations, which take into account the relevant deformation and failure mechanisms at different length scales relevant to individual plies, laminates and components. the main features of each simulation step and the information transferred between length scales are described in detail as well as the current limitations and the areas for further development. finally, the roadmap for the extension of the current strategy to include functional properties and processing into the simulation scheme is delineated.
manufacturing_engineering	recent interest in improving pedagogical approaches in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields has stimulated research at many universities. several educational methodologies are reviewed in the context of manufacturing and through the lens of sustainability. it is found that there is a need to identify and understand the stem educational challenges, and to assess the usefulness of existing methodologies using case-based analyses. in particular, this research aims to support student learning in manufacturing engineering through real-time process evaluations. a pedagogical framework is presented that can assist engineering educators in developing learning modules in support of this goal. the framework encompasses four steps: define the learning outcomes, create instructional resources, create active learning resources, and create a summative assessment mechanism. the framework emphasizes engagement of manufacturing engineering students in psychomotor learning, which remains a challenge due to the high cost of instructional laboratories. the framework is applied to develop a participatory pedagogy for manufacturing courses through the use of computer numerical control of manufacturing operations, and real-time monitoring, visualization, and data analysis of machine energy use. the framework is demonstrated for upper-level undergraduate and graduate manufacturing engineering courses at two universities (i.e., computer-aided design and manufacturing at oregon state university and precision manufacturing at university of california, berkeley). it is found that the framework can effectively support learning module development in manufacturing engineering education.
fluid_mechanics	high speed self-excited oscillation pulsed waterjet (seopw) offers many advantages over continuous jets or external-excited pulsed jets and has a large number of practical and industrial applications, in order to take better advantage of seopws, effects of area discontinuity at nozzle inlet were analyzed based on the previous related research and then experimentally investigated with respect to the axial pressure oscillations. a jet-driven helmholtz oscillator, which is capable of producing effective seopws, was employed in the experiment. it was found that area discontinuity has a capacity of enhancing the peak, which largely depends on the inlet pressure and standoff distance. the enhancement decreases with increasing inlet pressure and only happens within small standoff distances. compared with the continuous case, area enlargement enhances the peak by 25%, 21%, and 16%, corresponding to inlet pressures of 10, 15, and 20 mpa, respectively; while area contraction turns to be a better one by improving the peak by 8% at inlet pressure of 25 mpa. however, at inlet pressure of 30 mpa, both enlargement and contraction decrease the peak. moreover, area discontinuity cannot influence the optimum standoff distance where the maximum peak appears. for the pressure oscillation amplitude, even both area discontinuities have the ability of increasing the amplitude regardless of inlet pressure and standoff distance, contraction enhances the amplitude much more than enlargement does at all the testing inlet pressures. in addition, area discontinuity has nearly no influence on the oscillating frequency and causes perturbations that may only affect the intensity of self-excitation by amplitude.

materials_engineering	nanotechnology is key to the 21st century, involving all aspects of nanoscale science and technology and generating a paradigm shift in diverse areas of physics, chemistry, electronics, materials, engineering, and even medicine and biology, as a result of its interdisciplinary nature. rf and terahertz electronics are among the fastest growing areas as a result of the discovery, fabrication, and investigation of nanomaterials, in particular carbon nanotubes, graphenes, and compound semiconductors. these advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of nano rf or terahertz devices, which are capable of transcending conventional devices in their compactness, efficiency, performance, and operating frequency. this paper sets out the evolution of nanotechnology in rf and terahertz electronics in which a challenge awaits for the microwave science and engineering research community.
materials_engineering	ceramic matrix composites (cmc) with continuous fiber reinforcements have the potential to enable the next generation of high speed hypersonic vehicles and/or significant improvements in gas turbine engine performance due to their exhibited toughness when subjected to high mechanical loads at extreme temperatures (2200f+). reinforced fiber composites (rfc) provide increased fracture toughness, crack growth resistance, and strength, though little is known about how stochastic variation and imperfections in the material effect material properties. in this work, tools are developed for quantifying anomalies within the microstructure at several scales. the detection and characterization of anomalous microstructure is a critical step in linking production techniques to properties, as well as in accurate material simulation and property prediction for the integrated computation materials engineering (icme) of rfc based components. it is desired to find statistical outliers for any number of material characteristics such as fibers, fiber coatings, and pores. here, fiber orientation, or 'velocity', and 'velocity' gradient are developed and examined for anomalous behavior. categorizing anomalous behavior in the cmc is approached by multivariate gaussian mixture modeling. a gaussian mixture is employed to estimate the probability density function (pdf) of the features in question, and anomalies are classified by their likelihood of belonging to the statistical normal behavior for that feature.
internal_combustion_engine	the polymer electrolyte membrane (pem) fuel cell system is considered to be an ideal alternative for the internal combustion engine, especially when used on a city bus. hybrid buses with fuel cell systems and energy storage systems are now undergoing transit service demonstrations worldwide. a hybrid pem fuel cell city bus with a hierarchical control system is studied in this paper. firstly, the powertrain and hierarchical control structure is introduced. secondly, the vehicle control strategy including start-stop strategy, energy management strategy, and fuel cell control strategy, including the hydrogen system and air system control strategies, are described in detail. finally, the performance of the fuel cell was analyzed based on road test data. results showed that the different subsystems were well-coordinated. each component functioned in concert in order to ensure that both safety and speed requirements were satisfied. the output current of the fuel cell system changed slowly and the output voltage was limited to a certain range, thereby enhancing durability of the fuel cell. furthermore, the economic performance was optimized by avoiding low load conditions.
manufacturing_engineering	sport research activities often require graphical user interfaces (gui) for viewing, merging, tagging and processing of data. more complex processing, like video, requires more complex interfaces but often these guis are for short term research use and the investment in creating or purchasing and adapting the gui is lost. this paper demonstrates an auto generation gui creation tool using matlab environment. any gui is created using a text file that defines all component properties, including the figure, its controls and the callbacks. the auto generation gui was used in this paper for the creation of a video digitizing interface for monitoring upper arm and forearm rotations of cricket bowlers. this method simplifies the creation and modification of guis used in research.

internal_combustion_engine	in this two-part paper, a topological analysis of powertrains for refuse-collecting vehicles (rcvs) based on the simulation of different architectures (internal combustion engine, hybrid electric, and hybrid hydraulic) on real routes is proposed. in this first part, a characterization of a standard route is performed, analyzing the average power consumption and the most frequent working points of an internal combustion engine (ice) in real routes. this information is used to define alternative powertrain architectures. a hybrid hydraulic powertrain architecture is proposed and modelled. the proposed powertrain model is executed using two different control algorithms, with and without predictive strategies, with data obtained from real routes. a calculation engine (an algorithm which runs the vehicle models on real routes), is presented and used for simulations. this calculation engine has been specifically designed to analyze if the different alternative powertrain delivers the same performance of the original ice. finally, the overall performance of the different architectures and control strategies are summarized into a fuel and energy consumption table, which will be used in the second part of this paper to compare with the different architectures based on hybrid electric powertrain. the overall performance of the different architectures indicates that the use of a hybrid hydraulic powertrain with simple control laws can reduce the fuel consumption up to a 14 %.
manufacturing_engineering	a great deal of attention in manufacturing engineering has been focused on finishing operations of hard and brittle materials in recent years. this paper reports an experimental work on the analysis of surface roughness and material removal using design of experiment (doe) method in magnetic abrasive finishing, (maf) of flat surfaces. change in surface roughness and material removal were found to increase with an increase in weight percentage of abrasive particles in magnetic abrasive brush, lubricant volume and decrease in working gap. also, any decrease in the relative size of the abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles would result into an increase of the surface roughness and decrease in material removal. it was observed that the work piece hardness had no considerable effect on the process results. the optimum parameter levels which lead into the best surface finish and highest material removal were also derived from these experimentations. optimum levels included weight percentage of abrasive particles of 40%, lubricant volume of 1 ml, working gap of 3 mm, relative size of abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles of 0.22, and work piece hardness of 82-87 hbn. disk type test pieces were selected from al 7075 and their two side surfaces were under experiments. experiments were made using a milling machine spindle as magnetic pole holder, and its table as fixture holder for work pieces.
hydraulics	instream wood promotes habitat heterogeneity through its influence on flow hydraulics and channel geomorphology. within the columbia river basin, usa, wood is vital for the creation and maintenance of habitat for threatened salmonids. however, our understanding of the relative roles of the climatic, geomorphic, and ecological processes that source wood to streams is limited, making it difficult to identify baseline predictions of instream wood and create targets for stream restoration. here, we investigate how instream wood frequency and volume differ between seven sub-basins of the interior columbia river basin and what processes shape these differences within these sub-basins. we collected data on wood volume and frequency, discharge and stream power, and riparian and watershed forest structure for use in modelling wood volume and frequency. using random forest models, we found that mean annual precipitation, riparian tree cover, and the individual watershed were the most important predictors of wood volume and frequency. within sub-basins, we used linear models, finding that some basins had unique predictors of wood. discharge, watershed area, or precipitation often combined with forest cover, riparian conifer, and/or large tree cover in models of instream large wood volume and frequency. in many sub-basins, models showed at least one hydrologic variable, indicative of transport competence and one ecological variable, indicative of the reach or upstream watershed 's capability to grow measurable instream wood. we conclude that basin-specific models yield important insights into the hydrologic and ecological processes that influence wood loads, creating tractable hypotheses for building predictive models of instream wood. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
internal_combustion_engine	battery electric vehicles (bevs) have been slow to diffuse on the international as well as the swedish market. previous studies have indicated situational factors such as economic factors, size and performance to be of major importance for vehicle purchasers in their choice of vehicle. in this paper, the authors explore a consumer centric total cost of ownership (tco) model to investigate the possible discrepancy between purchase price and the tco between internal combustion engine vehicles (icevs), hybrid electric vehicles (hevs) and bevs. the creation and testing of the tco model reveals that computation could be a challenging task for consumers due to bounded access of relevant data and the prediction of future conditions. the application of the model to the vehicle sample found that bevs could be cheaper compared to icevs and hevs. the findings in this paper could prove to be of importance for policy and marketing alike in designing the most appropriate business models and information campaigns based on consumer conditions in order to further promoting the diffusion of bevs in society.

hydraulics	we compared the hydrodynamics of replicate experimental mixed cell and replicate standard burrows pond rearing systems at the dworshak national fish hatchery, id, in an effort to identify methods for improved solids removal. we measured and compared the hydraulic residence time, particle removal efficiency, and measures of velocity using several tools. computational fluid dynamics was used first to characterize hydraulics in the proposed retrofit that included removal of the traditional burrows pond dividing wall and establishment of four counter rotating cells with appropriate drains and inlet water jets. hydraulic residence time was subsequently established in the four full scale test tanks using measures of conductivity of a salt tracer introduced into the systems both with and without fish present. vertical and horizontal velocities were also measured with acoustic doppler velocimetry in transects across each of the rearing systems. finally, we introduced abs sinking beads that simulated fish solids then followed the kinetics of their removal via the drains to establish relative purge rates. the mixed cell raceway provided higher mean velocities and a more uniform velocity distribution than did the burrows pond. vectors revealed well-defined, counter-rotating cells in the mixed cell raceway, and were likely contributing factors in achieving a relatively high particle removal efficiency-88.6% versus 8.0% during the test period. we speculate retrofits of rearing ponds to mixed cell systems will improve both the rearing environments for the fish and solids removal, improving the efficiency and bio-security of fish culture. we recommend further testing in hatchery production trials to evaluate fish physiology and growth. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper shows the performance curves obtained with an experimental campaign on the following different prime movers: a 100 kw microturbine, a 20 kw internal combustion engine, a 450 kw sofc-based hybrid system and a 100 kw absorption chiller. while the size related to the microturbine and the engine are actual electrical power values, the hybrid system size is an electrical virtual power (an emulator rig was used for this plant) and the chiller value is a cooling thermal power. these experimental results were obtained with a smart polygeneration facility installed in the innovative energy systems laboratory by the thermochemical power group of the university of genoa. this facility was designed to perform tests on smart grids equipped with different generation technologies to develop and improve innovative control and optimization tools. the performance curves were obtained with two different approaches: tests on real prime movers (for the microturbine, the engine and the chiller) or measurements on an emulator rig (for the hybrid system). in this second case, the tests were carried out using an experimental facility based on the coupling of a second microturbine with a modular vessel. a real-time simulation software was used for components not physically present in the experimental plant. these results are a significant improvement in comparison with the available data, because experimental results are presented for different prime movers in different operative conditions (both design and part-load operations). moreover, since both manufacturers and users are not usually able to control air inlet temperature, special attention was devoted to the ambient temperature impact on the 100 kw microturbine because this property has a strong influence on the performance of this machine. for this reason, empirical correlations on the ambient temperature effect were obtained from the experiments with the objective to perform an easy implementation of the optimization tools. experimental performance curves (including several off-design conditions) are essential for smart grid management because (if they are implemented in optimization tools) they allow to find real optimal solutions (while tools based on linear or calculated correlations can obtain results affected by significant errors).

computer-aided_design	purpose a 3d printer was used to realise compartmental dosage forms containing multiple active pharmaceutical ingredient (api) formulations. this work demonstrates the microstructural characterisation of 3d printed solid dosage forms using x-ray computed microtomography (x mu ct) and terahertz pulsed imaging (tpi). methods printing was performed with either polyvinyl alcohol (pva) or polylactic acid (pla). the structures were examined by x mu ct and tpi. liquid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (snedds) formulations containing saquinavir and halofantrine were incorporated into the 3d printed compartmentalised structures and in vitro drug release determined. results a clear difference in terms of pore structure between pva and pla prints was observed by extracting the porosity (5.5% for pva and 0.2% for pla prints), pore length and pore volume from the x mu ct data. the print resolution and accuracy was characterised by x mu ct and tpi on the basis of the computer-aided design (cad) models of the dosage form (compartmentalised pva structures were 7.5 +/- 0.75% larger than designed; n = 3). conclusions the 3d printer can reproduce specific structures very accurately, whereas the 3d prints can deviate from the designed model. the microstructural information extracted by x mu ct and tpi will assist to gain a better understanding about the performance of 3d printed dosage forms.
machine_design	this paper deals with torque ripple minimization using a degree of liberty offered when the doubly fed induction machine is employed in electrical naval propulsion. various strategies have been carried out on the analysis and the reduction of torques ripples. the torque ripples can be reduced by either the machine design or control methods. the authors introduce a new technique to decrease its torque ripples using the control strategy. simulation results and experimental tests are presented and discussed.
thermodynamics	recent work has demonstrated that black hole thermodynamics and information loss/restoration in ads(3)/cft2 can be derived almost entirely from the behavior of the virasoro conformal blocks at large central charge, with relatively little dependence on the precise details of the cft spectrum or ope coefficients. here, we elaborate on the non-perturbative behavior of virasoro blocks by classifying all 'saddles' that can contribute for arbitrary values of external and internal operator dimensions in the semiclassical large central charge limit. the leading saddles, which determine the naive semiclassical behavior of the virasoro blocks, all decay exponentially at late times, and at a rate that is independent of internal operator dimensions. consequently, the semiclassical contribution of a finite number of high-energy states cannot resolve a well-known version of the information loss problem in ads(3). however, we identify two infinite classes of sub-leading saddles, and one of these classes does not decay at late times.
computer-aided_design	purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different reconstruction plates and screw combinations on stress distribution of segmental resected mandibles using finite element analysis. methods: lateral (l) and lateral-central (lc) defects were simulated by a computer aided design modeling. the straight (s) and angular (a) titanium locking reconstruction plates of 2.5 mm(12 holes for l defects and 16 holes for lc defects) were modeled. each screw was 2.5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length. a total of 20 different screw placement combinations were created. the bite force used in the present model was a unilateral molar clench. the data obtained from finite element analysis were recorded as von mises, maximum principle and minimum principle stress values. results: it was observed that stress values on neck of screw were higher for screws close to the resection area. when the first screw was loosened, the stress on the plate body and the remaining screws increased. principle stress values were within the tolerance limits of the bone. conclusion: the highest stress is observed in the screws nearest to the resection edge. therefore, it is very important to place a screw adjacent to the resection edge.
machine_design	the breakthroughs in permanent magnet synchronous machines through the latest technologies, especially about machine design, raise the importance of those machines. moreover, developments in materials technology implement the development of cost effective and profitable products on electric machines. permanent magnet synchronous machines are divided into two parts according to the situation of slot/pole combination, which is integer or fractional. permanent magnet synchronous machines are subject of interest due to low torque ripple and low cogging torque. in this paper, the 2d lumped parameter method (lpm) of permanent magnet synchronous machine was composed and stated, and lumped parameter was verified by finite element method. when smc materials are used in electric machines, flux flows in 3d. because of this and according to literatures, 3d method is used to analyze the smc-used machines. 3d finite element method takes a quite long time. thanks to 2d lpm analysis, which was used in our work; the analysis period become remarkably shorter. in addition, torque and back emf of permanent magnet synchronous machine were calculated through the developed lpm method. prototype is tested. it is seen by the results that the produced prototype and the developed algorithm are matching properly.
internal_combustion_engine	a modified thermostatic control strategy is applied to the powertrain control of a parallel mild hybrid electric vehicle (hev) to improve fuel economy. this strategy can improve the fuel economy of a parallel mild hev by operating internal combustion engine (ice) in a high-efficiency region. thus, in this study, experiments of a parallel mild hey were conducted to analyze the characteristics of the hybrid electric powertrain and a numerical model is developed for the vehicle. based on the results, the thermostatic control strategy was modified and applied to the vehicle model. also, battery protection logic by using electrochemical battery model is applied because the active usage of battery by thermostatic control strategy can damage the battery. the simulation results of the vehicle under urban driving conditions show that the thermostatic control strategy can improve the vehicle 's fuel economy by 3.7 % compared with that of the conventional strategy. the results also suggest that the trade-off between the fuel economy improvement by efficient ice operation and the battery life reduction by active battery usage should be carefully investigated when a thermostatic control strategy is applied to a parallel mild hev.

strength_of_materials	the design procedures currently applied in dimensioning of structural and load-bearing components of conveyances do not specify their safe service life, instead they are based on safety factors related to static loads. in order to solve this problem and to work out verified relationships to find the fatigue endurance of structural elements of conveyances in the function of service time and the type of conveyance it is required that that the values of all applied loads be considered in the function of time and in the normal operating conditions. this study, compiling the results of research work undertaken at the department of strength of materials and structures agh-ust, provides analytical formulas verified experimentally on real objects, yielding: maximal loads experienced by the conveyance suspensions and hoisting ropes during the start-up of a fully loaded conveyance moving from the bottom station; maximal loads experienced by the conveyance suspensions and hoisting ropes during the braking of a fully loaded conveyance approaching the top station; loads in the guiding system (skip head- shalt steelwork; skip lower frame- shaft steelwork) during the skip travel at the fixed speed v(0).
internal_combustion_engine	this study is based on an earlier one (1995) containing a proposed taxonomic classification which we have now reviewed and updated according to the growth and emergence of these practices during this period. on an intrinsic level, we studied the purpose and nature of these activities and rethought and analysed the relevance and appropriateness of 'adventure physical activities in nature' (apan) as a valid name to identify them. on an extrinsic level, we identified the apan that are currently being significantly performed by part of the population worldwide and we restructured and completed the taxonomic classification of 1995 with the specific presence of a new emerging sector 'fire' due to the increasing presence of practices that use the internal combustion engine. we built a table identifying each of the selected apan practices and drew up a table of environmental impacts with four pollutant classifications. finally, we developed a coordinate axis in which we link the degree of sportisation of the groups of practices with the 'asceticism/hedonism' variable. in the previous study we distinguished three major mediums, 'air', 'earth' and 'water', with 6 groups (a), 13 groups (e) and 8 groups (w) respectively. in total, we structured 27 groups and we clearly identified 33 practices. in the current study we have four mediums, 'air', 'earth', 'water' and 'fire', with 5 groups (a), 12 groups (e), 8 groups (w) and 4 groups (f). in summary, we build 29 groups and we distinguish 98 practices.
internal_combustion_engine	dynamic development of internal combustion engines creates a need to adopt a strategy concerning operational use of these driving units based on the knowledge of their technical condition. the assessment of technical condition belongs to tasks of technical diagnostics. this article presents an analysis of issues concerning vibration diagnostics of automatic compensators of clearances in piston valves of combustion engine. scientific experiments focused on delivering information necessary to create (and also to validate) diagnostic models enabling assessment of technical condition of those elements of combustion engine that are essential taking into account effectiveness and durability that were carried out and described here. on the basis of the worked out diagnostic model, the algorithm for assessment of the technical condition of automatic compensators of valve clearance was created.

materials_engineering	the crystal structure of a metal plays an important role in its relationship to its macroscopic properties as well as atomic mechanisms of structural change. as such, students need to have an ability to visualize planar crystal atomic packing features, but often find it difficult. thus, the research question here is, ""how can a student 's baseline knowledge and misconceptions of planar atomic packing features for different metal structures be measured and how well can instruction promote conceptual change and misconception repair."" answering this question will provide insight for developing more effective pedagogy for crystal structures. a multiple-choice survey with six items was developed using misconceptions from students' pencil and paper sketches of face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) atoms on (100), (110), and (111) planes. pretests and posttests of the survey were administered to students in a spring 2012 introductory materials engineering course. misconceptions that were revealed included: missing atoms, extra atoms, misplaced atoms, ""non-touching atoms where they should touch""; and ""touching atoms that should not touch"". students' difficulty in solving increased from (100) to (110) to (111) planes for both bcc and fcc structures. details of the survey instrument and results are described in the paper.
internal_combustion_engine	recent demands to reduce pollutant emissions and improve energy efficiency have driven the implementation of hybrid solutions in mobile machinery. this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental analysis conducted on a hydraulic hybrid excavator (hhe). the machinery under study is a middle size excavator, whose standard version was modified with the introduction of an energy recovery system (ers). the proposed ers layout was designed to recover the potential energy of the boom, using a hydraulic accumulator as a storage device. the recovered energy is utilized through the pilot pump of the machinery which operates as a motor, thus reducing the torque required from the internal combustion engine (ice). the analysis reported in this paper validates the hhe model by comparing numerical and experimental data in terms of hydraulic and mechanical variables and fuel consumption. the mathematical model shows its capability to reproduce the realistic operating conditions of the realized prototype, tested on the field. a detailed energy analysis comparison between the standard and the hybrid excavator models was carried out to evaluate the energy flows along the system, showing advantages, weaknesses and possibilities to further improve the machinery efficiency. finally, the fuel consumption estimated by the model and that measured during the experiments are presented to highlight the fuel saving percentages. the hhe model is an important starting point for the development of other energy saving solutions.
machine_design	this paper presents a design approach for interior permanent-magnet (ipm) machines with variable-flux characteristics using low-coercive-force magnets for improved efficiency and extended operating speed range. a flux-intensifying ipm type with l-d >l-q is used in the design due to positive i-d operation and reduced loaded i-q effects. design considerations of machine structures and variable-flux machine attributes are discussed. in addition, leakage flux in a rotor is particularly designed to also obtain another flux-varying capability. evaluation of the designed machine is provided by finite-element analysis simulations and experiments on a proof-of-principle machine. the designed machine shows benefits in increasing efficiency and speed range in a low-torque region when variable magnetization control of the low-coercive-force magnets or the design of the leakage flux proposed in this paper is implemented.

thermodynamics	the k-i of carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitors is often determined by the stopped-flow co2 hydration assay, the method that directly follows the inhibition of ca enzymatic activity. however, the assay has limitations, such as largely unknown concentration of co2 and the inability to determine the k-i below several nm. the widely used direct binding assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, also does not determine the k-d below several nm. in contrast, the thermal shift assay can accurately determine picomolar affinities. new equations estimating co2 concentration were developed for the determination of k(cat) and km of ca i and ca ii. the inhibitor dose-response curves were analyzed using hill and morrison equations demonstrating that only the morrison model is applicable for the determination of tight-binding inhibitor k-i. the measurements of interactions between ten inhibitors and seven ca isoforms showed the limitations and advantages of all three techniques. inhibitor 6 exhibited the k-d of 50 pm and was highly selective towards human ca ix, an isoform which is nearly absent in healthy human, but highly over expressed in numerous cancers. combination of inhibition and binding techniques was necessary for precise determination of ca-high-affinity inhibitor interactions and future drug design.

fluid_mechanics	this article addresses a classical fluid mechanics problem where the effect of capillary action on a column of viscous liquid is analyzed by quantifying its time-dependent penetrated length in a narrow channel. despite several past studies, a rigorous mathematical formulation of this inherently unsteady process is still unavailable, because these existing works resort to a crucial assumption only valid for mildly transient systems. the approximate theories use an integral approach where the penetration is described by equating total force acting on the domain to rate of change of total momentum. however, while doing so, the viscous resistance under temporally varying condition is assumed to be same as the resistance created by a quasi-steady velocity profile. thus, leading order error appears due to such approximation which can only be true when the variation in time is not strong enough causing negligible transient deviation in the hydrodynamic quantities. the present paper proposes a new way to solve this problem by considering the unsteady field itself as an unknown variable. accordingly, the analysis applies an eigenfunction expansion of the flow with unknown time-dependent amplitudes which along with the unsteady intrusion length are calculated from a system of ordinary differential equations. a comparative exploration identifies the situation for which the integral approach and the rigorous technique based on eigenfunction expansion deviate from each other. it also reveals that the two methods differ substantially in short-time dynamics at the initial stage. then, an asymptotic perturbation shows how the two sets of results should coincide in their long-time behavior. in this way, the findings will provide a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind the transport phenomenon.
machine_design	primary european car-makers agree on a 48 v embedded-supply to support the growing current-load requirements in modern vehicles. the functionalities required to the starter-generator are the engine start up, launch assistant torque, regenerative braking, battery charging and early fuel cut off. the dynamic load profile and the harsh environment working conditions make thermal issues the key challenge in the machine design. the paper presents the simulation and experimental test results of a belt driven starter-generator for 48 v mini hybrid powertrains. in particular, a double three-phase 10 kw induction machine has been selected as the suitable candidate for the application. in detail, the authors illustrate the experimental calibration and validation of the steady state thermal model, as well as the thermal characterization of a liquid cooled prototype. finally, the paper deals with the temperatures prediction of the motor working in different load conditions.
strength_of_materials	it is increasingly a requirement to be able to determine the mechanical properties of materials: (i) at the micro-scale, (ii) that are in the form of surface coatings and (iii) that have nanoscale microstructures. as a consequence micro-scale testing is an important tool that has been developed to aid the evaluation of the mechanical properties of such materials. in this work cantilever beam specimens (typically 2 mu m by 2 mu m by 10 mu m in size) have been prepared by gallium ion milling and then deformed in-situ within a fei helios dual beam workstation. the latter is achieved using a force probe with a geometry suitable for loading the micro-scale test specimens. thus force and displacement can be measured together with observing the deformation and fracture of the individual specimens. this paper considers the evaluation of the mechanical properties in particular elastic modulus, yield strength and fracture strength of materials that result in relatively large deflections to the micro-scale cantilever beams. two materials are considered the first is linear elastic single crystal silicon and the other elastic-plastic nanocrystalline (nc) nickel. the results are discussed with respect to the reproducibility of this method of mechanical testing and the evaluated properties are compared with those derived by alternative procedures.
fluid_mechanics	the ammonothermal crystal growth technique is one of the most effective methods used for growing gallium nitride (gan) crystals in terms of the final product quality and manufacturing efficiency. popular applications of gan crystals include light emitting diodes (leds) and high-frequency electronic devices. a laterally-heated cylindrical enclosure with a top to bottom temperature gradient is considered in this study to investigate the fluid mechanics and heat transfer in an ammonothermal crystal growth reactor. three-dimensional (3d) large eddy simulations (les) results of natural convection in a laterally heated cylindrical reactor, using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (cfd) software, ansys fluent, are presented in this paper for a rayleigh number (ra) of 8.8 x 106. the ra is defined based on a length scale that is equal to the ratio of volume to the lateral area of the cylinder (r/2). in addition, an experiment of a geometrically- and dynamically-similar geometry is developed, and particle image velocimetry (piv)-based flow visualizations are carried out for the purpose of validating the numerical model. comparisons between experiments and numerical simulations showed that flow patterns were qualitatively similar, and fourier transforms of velocity magnitudes at selected points in the domain matched reasonably well. an added interesting observation in the simulation was the existence of temperature inversion, which has potential implications on the choice of mineralizer (acidic/basic).

hydraulics	xylem embolism is one of the main processes involved in drought-related plant mortality. although its consequences for plant physiology are already well described, embolism formation and spread are poorly evaluated and modelled, especially for tracheid-based species. the aim of this study was to assess the embolism formation and spread in pinus sylvestris as a case study using x-ray microtomography and hydraulics methods. we also evaluated the potential effects of cavitation fatigue on vulnerability to embolism and the micro-morphology of the bordered pits using scanning electron microscopy (sem) to test for possible links between xylem anatomy and embolism spread. finally, a novel model was developed to simulate the spread of embolism in a 2d anisotropic cellular structure. results showed a large variability in the formation and spread of embolism within a ring despite no differences being observed in intertracheid pit membrane anatomical traits. simulations from the model showed a highly anisotropic tracheid-to-tracheid embolism spreading pattern, which confirms the major role of tracheid-to-tracheid air seeding to explain how embolism spreads in scots pine. the results also showed that prior embolism removal from the samples reduced the resistance to embolism of the xylem and could result in overestimates of vulnerability to embolism.
fluid_mechanics	the turbulent wake of a generic space launcher wind tunnel model with an underexpanded nozzle jet is investigated experimentally and numerically to gain insight into the variation of intricate wake flow phenomena of space vehicles at higher stages of the flight trajectory with increasing mach number. the experiments are carried out at m-infinity = 3 and m-infinity = 6 in the ludwieg tube test facility at the institute of fluid mechanics at the technische universitat braunschweig, while the corresponding time-resolved computations are performed by the institute of aerodynamics at rwth aachen university using a zonal rans-les approach. a strong alteration of the wake topology with increasing mach number due to the changing pressure ratio at the nozzle exit is found. at m-infinity = 3 the moderate underexpansion rate of p(e)/p(infinity) approximate to 5 leads to a formation of a recirculation region with an elongated triangular cross-section reaching to the nozzle exit. at m-infinity = 6 a substantially stronger afterexpansion of the jet plume (p(e)/p(infinity) approximate to 100) causes the formation of a cavity region with a quadrangular cross-section. the stronger deflection towards the nozzle at m-infinity = 3 results in lower mean and rms wall pressure ratios than at m-infinity = 6. however, due to the higher freestream pressure value at the lower mach number the relation of absolute values is reciprocal, making the lower supersonic regime more critical with respect to dynamic structural loads. this observation is confirmed by an overall good agreement between numerical and experimental data at characteristic positions on the base and nozzle wall. furthermore, it was shown that undesired effects of the strut support in the wake are present along the whole circumference. for m-infinity = 3 the strut influence is found to be particularly intense. the spectral analysis of wall pressure fluctuations reveals fundamental differences in the dynamic behavior of the two investigated wake flow regimes. at m-infinity = 3, a dominant frequency range around sr-d approximate to 0.2 associated with the inner dynamics of the recirculation bubble is found at the base, while on the nozzle a broad-band low-frequency content of substantially higher amplitudes is detected, which is a footprint of the graduate realignment of the turbulent shear layer along the nozzle wall. the spectra at m-infinity = 6 are characterized by several high-frequency sharp peaks at sr-d >= 0.8. a strong correlation between the supported wind tunnel configuration and the axisymmetric free-flight case is found for the peaks at sr-d approximate to 0.85 known to be caused by the radial flapping motion of the shear layer along the cavity.
computer-aided_design	there is a significant clinical need for engineered bone graft substitutes that can quickly, effectively, and safely repair large segmental bone defects. one emerging field of interest involves the growth of engineered bone tissue in vitro within bioreactors, the most promising of which are perfusion bioreactors. using bioreactor systems, tissue engineered bone constructs can be fabricated in vitro. however, these engineered constructs lack inherent vasculature and once implanted, quickly develop a necrotic core, where no nutrient exchange occurs. here, we utilized comsol modeling to predict oxygen diffusion gradients throughout aggregated alginate constructs, which allowed for the computer-aided design of printable vascular networks, compatible with any large tissue engineered construct cultured in a perfusion bioreactor. we investigated the effect of 3d printed macroscale vascular networks with various porosities on the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, using both gas-permeable, and non-gas permeable bioreactor growth chamber walls. through the use of 3d printed vascular structures in conjunction with a tubular perfusion system bioreactor, cell viability was found to increase by as much as 50% in the core of these constructs, with in silico modeling predicting construct viability at steady state.
hydraulics	ectomycorrhizal fungi have been reported to increase root hydraulic conductivity (l (pr)) by altering apoplastic and plasma membrane intrinsic protein (pip)-mediated cell-to-cell water transport pathways in associated roots, or to have little effect on root water transport, depending on the interacting species and imposed stresses. in this study, we investigated the water transport properties and pip transcription in roots of aspen (populus tremuloides) seedlings colonized by the wild-type strain of laccaria bicolor and by strains overexpressing a major fungal water-transporting aquaporin jq585595. inoculation of aspen seedlings with l. bicolor resulted in about 30 % colonization rate of root tips, which developed dense mantle and the hartig net that was restricted in the modified root epidermis. transcript abundance of the aspen aquaporins pip1;2, pip2;1, and pip2;2 decreased in colonized root tips. root colonization by jq585595-overexpressing strains had no significant impact on seedling shoot water potentials, gas exchange, or dry mass; however, it led to further decrease in transcript abundance of pip1;2 and pip2;3 and the significantly lower l (pr) than in non-inoculated roots. these results, taken together with our previous study that showed enhanced root water hydraulics of l. bicolor-colonized white spruce (picea glauca), suggest that the impact of l. bicolor on root hydraulics varies by the ectomycorrhiza-associated tree species.
strength_of_materials	the elevated temperature performances of 2d70 al alloy hot extrusion rods after two-stage homogenization and intensive deformation were studied by measuring the elevated temperature enduring strength and the creep ultimate strength. the fracture morphology of some selected samples after testing at different elevated temperatures was observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results indicate that, as the test temperature increases, the elevated temperature enduring strength of 2d70 al alloy decreases gradually. in a comparison between 150a degrees c and 240a degrees c, the notch enduring strength drops from 375 to 185 mpa and the smooth enduring strength drops from 337 to 130 mpa. enduring strength is not sensitive to the notch. the notch sensitivity ratio (nsr) coefficient is in the range of 1.119 to 1.423 from 150a degrees c to 240a degrees c. the creep test results show that, as the test temperature increases from 150a degrees c to 240a degrees c, the creep ultimate strength of 2d70 al alloy rods drops gradually from 312 to 117 mpa.

strength_of_materials	shot peening is a surface process widely used to improve the fatigue strength of materials, through compressive residual stresses induced in their surface layers. considering mechanical components for high responsible applications, wear and corrosion control is currently accomplished by the use of coated materials. in the case of chrome plating or hard anodizing, lower fatigue strength in comparison to uncoated parts are associated to high residual tensile stresses and microcracks density. under constant or variable amplitude loading microcracks will propagate and cross the interface coating substrate without impediment. the aim of the present study is to analyze the influence of wc-10ni coating applied by hvof process on the axial fatigue strength of aisi 4340 steel. the shot peening effect on the fatigue performance of coated aisi 4340 steel was also evaluated. the fractured fatigue specimens were investigated using a scanning electron microscope in order to obtain information about the crack initiation points.

materials_engineering	in this paper we derive an approach for the effective utilization of thermodynamic data in phase-field simulations. while the most widely used methodology for multi-component alloys is following the work by eiken et al. (2006), wherein, an extrapolative scheme is utilized in conjunction with the tq interface for deriving the driving force for phase transformation, a corresponding simplistic method based on the formulation of a parabolic free-energy model incorporating all the thermodynamics has been laid out for binary alloys in the work by folch and plapp (2005). in the following, we extend this latter approach for multi-component alloys in the framework of the grand-potential formalism. the coupling is applied for the case of the binary eutectic solidification in the cr-ni alloy and two-phase solidification in the ternary eutectic alloy (al-cr-ni). a thermodynamic justification entails the basis of the formulation and places it in context of the bigger picture of integrated computational materials engineering.

computer-aided_design	scaling-up capabilities for the design, build, and test of synthetic biology constructs holds great promise for the development of new applications in fuels, chemical production, or cellular-behavior engineering. construct design is an essential component in this process; however, not every designed dna sequence can be readily manufactured, even using state-of-the-art dna synthesis methods. current biological computer-aided design and manufacture tools (biocad/cam) do not adequately consider the limitations of dna synthesis technologies when generating their outputs. designed sequences that violate dna synthesis constraints may require substantial sequence redesign or lead to price-premiums and temporal delays, which adversely impact the efficiency of the dna manufacturing process. we have developed a suite of build-optimization software tools (boost) to streamline the design build transition in synthetic biology engineering workflows. boost incorporates knowledge of dna synthesis success determinants into the design process to output ready-to-build sequences, preempting the need for sequence redesign. the boost web application is available at https://boost.jgi.doe.gov and its application program interfaces (api) enable integration into automated, customized dna design processes. the herein presented results highlight the effectiveness of boost in reducing dna synthesis costs and timelines.
fluid_mechanics	background three competing theories about the mechanism of mitral coaptation in normal subjects were evaluated by color doppler and vector flow mapping (vfm): (1) beginning of ventricular (lv) ejection, (2) ""breaking of the jet"" of diastolic lv inflow, and (3) returning diastolic vortices impacting the leaflets on their lv surfaces. methods and results we analyzed 80 color doppler frames and 320 vfm measurements. in all 20 normal subjects, coaptation occurred before lv ejection, 78 +/- 16 ms before onset. on color doppler frames the larger anterior, and smaller posterior vortices circle back and, in all cases, strike the ventricular surfaces of the leaflets. on the first closing-begins frame, for the first time, vortex velocity normal to the ventricular surface of the anterior leaflet (aml) is greater than that in the mitral orifice, and the angle of attack of lv vortical flow onto the aml is twice as high as the angle of flow onto the valve in orifice. thus, at the moment coaptation begins, vortical flow strikes the mitral leaflet with higher velocity, and higher angle of attack than orifice flow, and thus with greater force. according to the ""breaking of the jet"" theory, one would expect to see de novo lv flow perpendicular to the leaflets beginning after transmitral flow terminates. instead, the returning continuous lv vortical flow that impacts the valve builds continuously after the p-wave. conclusions late diastolic vortices strike the ventricular surfaces of the mitral leaflets and contribute to valve coaptation, permitted by concomitant decline in transmitral flow.
machine_design	in this work an ultrasound-based measurement method is used for monitoring suspension velocity and build-up of magnetic material inside a wet low-intensity magnetic separator, a process used e.g. in beneficiation of magnetite ores. today the only available option is to monitor material transport between unit operations; i.e. flow rate, solids concentration, and particle size distribution of suspension flow in pipes are measured online using standard equipment. an acoustic backscatter system is fitted to the tank of a separator, and used to monitor the internal flow. a method called ultrasonic velocity profiling is used to capture internal velocity profiles. simultaneously, the backscatter signal intensity is used to get indications about local solids concentration of the flow, and build-up of magnetic material. the methods are evaluated in realistic conditions, where the effect of varying factors relevant to machine performance is investigated. the included factors are; the slurry feed rate, the slurry solids concentration, the magnet assembly angle, and the drum rotational speed. the presented method gives useful information about the internal material flow inside the separator. the velocity measurements capture the, sometimes complex, internal flow patterns, for example the presence and velocity of a recirculating flow in the dewatering zone. additionally, keeping a balanced material loading in the concentrate dewatering zone is important to separator performance. using the signal backscatter intensity it is possible to qualitatively monitor this material loading. generally these direct measurements can aid in improvements to machine design, process optimization, and process control.

computer-aided_design	digital technology has been widely used in the field of implant dentistry. from a surgical standpoint, computer-guided surgery can be utilized to enhance primary implant stability and to improve the precision of implant placement. from a prosthetic standpoint, computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (cad/cam) technology has brought about various restorative options, including the fabrication of customized abutments through a virtual design based on computer-guided surgical planning. this case report describes a novel technique combining the use of a three-dimensional (3d) printed surgical template for the immediate placement of an implant, with cad/cam technology to optimize hard and soft tissue healing after bone grafting with the use of a socket sealing abutment.
hydraulics	manning 's empirical formula in conjunction with strickler 's scaling is widely used to predict the hulk velocity v from the hydraulic radius rh, the roughness size r and the slope of the energy grade line s in uniform channel and pipe flows at high bulk reynolds numbers. despite their importance in science and engineering, both manning 's and strickler 's formulations have waited for decades before finding a theoretical explanation. this was provided, for the first time, by gioia & bombardelli (phys. rev. lett., vol. 88, 2002. 014501), labelled as gb02, using phenomenological arguments. perhaps their most remarkable finding was the link between the strickler and the kolmogorov scaling exponents, the latter pertaining to velocity fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the turbulence spectrum and presumed to he universal. in this work, the gb02 analysis is first revisited, showing that gb02 employed several ad hoc scaling assumptions for the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and, although implicitly, for the mean velocity gradient adjacent to the roughness elements. the similarity constants arising from the gb02 scaling assumptions were presumed to he independent of r/r-h, which is inconsistent with well-known flow properties in the near-wall region of turbulent wall flows. because of the dependence of these similarity constants on r/r-h, this existing theory requires the validity of the strickler scaling to cancel the dependence of these constants on rirh so as to arrive at the strickler scaling and manning 's formula. here, the gb02 approach is corroborated using a co-spectral budget (csb) model for the wall shear stress formulated at the cross-over between the roughness sublayer and the log region. assuming a simplified shape for the spectrum of the vertical velocity w, the proposed csb model (subject to another simplifying assumption that production is balanced by pressure velocity interaction) allows manning 's formula to be derived. to substantiate this approach, numerical solutions to the csb over the entire flow depth using different spectral shapes for w are carried out for a wide range of r/r-h. the results from this analysis support the simplifying hypotheses used to derive manning 's equation. the derived equation provides a formulation for n that agrees with reported values in the literature over seven decades of r variations. while none of the investigated spectral shapes allows the recovery of the strickler scaling, the numerical solutions of the csb reproduce the nikuradse data in the fully rough regime, thereby confirming that the strickler scaling represents only an approximate fit for the friction factor for granular roughness.
computer-aided_design	the effect of a triple metal-gate (tmg) on the performance and on the ambipolar current in a tmg vertical tunnel field-effect transistor with triple metal-gate (tmg-tfet) is investigated using technology computer-aided design simulation. the tmg-tfet is designed to tackle the performance as well as the ambipolar current, simultaneously, by modulating the tmg parameters-the work function of the tmg and/or the length of each mg-that have critical impacts on the energy-band diagrams of the channel region. the tempered on-/off-current ratio of 10(8) and the steep average subthreshold slope of 43.5 mv/decade at a power supply voltage of 0.5 v are ascribed to the formation of an energy barrier in the channel by the optimal device parameters. it is found that two main flaws in a conventional (single-material gate) tfet, which are the degraded on-state current and the ambipolar current, can be successfully controlled by adjusting the tmg structure.
internal_combustion_engine	hydrogen is a promising energy carrier, and the port fuel injection (pfi) is a fuel-flexible, durable, and relatively cheap method of energy conversion. however, combustion knock as an abnormal combustion phenomenon does not only limit the brake torque and thermal efficiency, but also breaks the piston or engines. this paper uses a four-stoke cycle, displacement of 2.0 l pfi hydrogen internal combustion engine and a calculated model to study the inducing factors and frequency of combustion knock. results showed that combustion knock occurs at relatively higher engine speed (more than 3000 r/min) than the engine speed occurring knock of gasoline engine. the calculated average temperatures of air fuel mixture at the end of combustion using thermodynamics dual zone model fall in the range of 1000-1100 k for hydrogen engines, which are higher than gasoline ones (about 200 k). knock and the other abnormal combustion phenomena (backfire and pre-ignite) interact with each other. when the backfire generates, the components in the cylinder will be heated. in the next cycle, the components of the cylinder will release heat to the intake, which can increase the initial temperature at ignition. the high initial temperature will lead to the combustion knock. otherwise, because of the combustion knock, the temperatures of cylinder components will increase, which generates hot spots and ultimately causes pre-ignite and backfire. through the figures of fast fourier transform (fft) amplitude, the frequency of hydrogen engines is higher than gasoline ones for every kind of mode. the pressure waves of combustion knock spread with radial direction for light combustion knock and with circumferential direction for heavy combustion knock. these conclusions can be used to explore the working conditions close to combustion knock to achieve higher thermal efficiency and provide a guidance to detect the knock in hydrogen engine.

computer-aided_design	we investigate the electrical characteristics according to changing temperature on trap distribution in the energy gap of grain boundary (gb) and interface trap density (d-it) between polycrystalline-silicon (poly-si) channel and tunnel oxide in vertical nand (vnand) flash cell with poly-si channel. we confirmed that there are two factors changing gb potential barrier height such as trap distribution in gb and dit using technology computer-aided design (tcad) simulation. also, we found that the electrical characteristics according to changing temperature are significantly dependent on height and position of gb potential barrier in vnand flash cell with poly-si channel. we expect that it is required to develop more accurate extraction method for trap distribution in each gb and dit for better understanding temperature dependence of electrical characteristics in vnand flash cell.
machine_design	since earlier days, most of the failures encountered by the structures or machines are mainly due to material fatigue. the dynamic behaviour of the beam may change when cracks begin to appear in it. knowledge of these changes in the dynamic individualism is important in crack detection as well as in structure or in machine design. this paper deals with systematic study on the free vibration of euler-bernoulli beam containing open edge transverse cracks. in this study, two springs steel materials (en 8 and en 47) are considered. the effect of the top side cracks and bottom side cracks on the natural frequency of a cantilever beam is discussed. the natural frequency of a cracked case cantilever beam is investigated numerically using fe analysis software ansys. experimental work is done by using dewefrf to investigate the natural frequency of cracked beams for strong validation of the numerical results. the results of this study suggest that the average value of natural frequencies for all top side cracked beams are identical to the average value of natural frequency for all bottom side cracked beams. this is true for both en 47 and en 8. hence, it is clear that the dynamic characteristic (natural frequency) is not changing, when same configuration of cracks is either on top or bottom side of the beam. the natural frequencies for en 8 material are comparatively on higher side than en 47 material for the same crack configurations. in most of the cracked cases, the damping effect of en 47 is greater than en 8. it is also found that as crack location increases at constant crack depth, then natural frequency increases. at the last location, as crack depth increases, natural frequencies almost remain same. it is observed that, the presence of top side crack and bottom side crack of the same configuration in the cantilever beam is not a function of natural frequency, when cantilever beam is of a square cross section.
hydraulics	whitewater parks (wwps) are increasingly popular recreational amenities, but the effects of wwps on fish habitat and passage are poorly understood. this study investigated the use of a two-dimensional (2-d) model as compared with a three-dimensional (3-d) hydrodynamic model (flow-3d((r))) for assessing effects of wwps on fish habitat. the primary aims of this study were to (1) examine the utility of 3-d modelling versus 2-d modelling in a hydraulically complex wwp and (2) compare modelled habitat quality for resident fishes with actual fish abundance and biomass generated from field sampling surveys. two reaches of a wadeable river in colorado were modelled: a natural reach and a reach containing a wwp. a 2-d habitat suitability analysis for juvenile and adult brown trout, juvenile and adult rainbow trout, longnose dace and longnose sucker predicted the same or higher habitat quality in the wwps than the natural pools for all four species and for all modelled flow rates; however, results from fish sampling found significantly higher fish biomass for all four species in natural pools compared with wwp pools. all hydraulic metrics (depth, depth-averaged velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, 2-d and 3-d vorticity) had higher magnitudes in wwp pools than in natural pools. in the wwp pools, 3-d model results described the spatial distribution of flow characteristics or the magnitude of variables better than 2-d results. this supports the use of 3-d modelling for complex flows found in wwps, but improved understanding of linkages between fish habitat quality and 3-d hydraulic descriptors is needed. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.
internal_combustion_engine	purpose - this paper aims to present experimental results of gasoline-fuelled engine operation of a crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engine used for unmanned air vehicle (uav)/unmanned air system application and to cross correlate with computational fluid dynamic modelling results. design/methodology/approach - computational modelling of the engine system was conducted using the wave software supported by the experimental research and development via dynamometer testing of a spark ignition uav engine to construct a validated computational model exploring a range of fuel delivery options. findings - experimental test data and computational simulation have allowed an assessment of the potential advantages of applying direct in-cylinder fuel injection. practical implications - the ability to increase system efficiency offers significant advantages in terms of maximising limited resources and extending mission duration capabilities. the computational simulation and validation via experimental test experience provides a means of assessment of possibilities that are costly to explore experimentally and offers added confidence to be able to investigate possibilities for the development of similar future engine designs. originality/value - the software code used has not been applied to such crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engines and provides a valuable facility for further simulation of the twin cylinder horizontally opposed design to offer further system optimisation and exploration of future possibilities.
computer-aided_design	this study aims to investigate the influence of different neck structures on implant stress distribution. a computer-aided design (cad) mandibular model based on adult mandibular computed tomography (ct) information was first established, and then used to create a mandibular model and a related mandibular implant model by using solidworks. the implant was then fitted to the mandibular first molar. four neck-type implants, i.e., uniform-threaded implant (ut), wide-neck implant (wn), implant with single-microthreaded neck (smn), and implant with double-microthreaded neck (dmn), received axial 100-n, horizontal 50-n, and oblique 100-n loads, by using the ansys workbench software; the von mises equivalent stress (es) and maximum principal stress (mps) in different implant groups were then compared. axial 100-n load: the maximum es in the cortical bone area (cb-mes, mpa) was 46.58, 35.25, 20.98, and 58.01 in ut, wn, smn, and dmn respectively; the mps at the superior edge of cortical bone (cb-mps, mpa) was 0.97, 0.89, 0.79, and 1.22 in the same four groups respectively. horizontal 50-n load: cb-mes was 53.21, 41.93, 36.95, and 64.18 in ut, wn, smn, and dmn respectively; cb-mps was 41.77, 39.61, 29.67, and 46.99 in the same four groups respectively. oblique 100-n load: cb-mes was 49.37, 47.78, 34.02, and 78.52 in ut, wn, smn, and dmn respectively; cb-mps was 29.35, 21.28, 15.34, and 34.69 in the same four groups respectively. cb-mes and cb-mps of smn were the smallest.
fluid_mechanics	under the design conditions of a research reactor, the siphon phenomenon induced by pipe rupture can cause continuous efflux of water. in order to prevent water efflux, an additional facility is necessary. a siphon breaker is a type of safety facility that can resist the loss of coolant effectively. however, analysis of siphon breaking is complex since it comprises two-phase flow and there are many inputs to be considered. for this reason, in order to facilitate the analysis and design of the siphon breaker, a simulation program based on fluid mechanics was developed using mfc (microsoft foundation class) programming. from bernoulli 's equation, the velocity and quantity as well as undershooting height, water level, pressure, friction coefficient, and factors related to the two-phase flow could be calculated. the chisholm model, which was included in the program to analyze the two-phase flow, can predict the results in a manner similar to those obtained from a real-scale experiment. by modifying the values of the input parameters and analyzing the results with respect to loss of coolant accident (loca) locations, the size of pipe and coefficients could be compared easily. since simulation results are shown in the form of a graph, the user is able to confirm the total breaking situation. furthermore, it is possible to save the entire simulation results. the simulation results were shown to be similar to those obtained from the real-scale experiment and the program functioned correctly. by using the program, the user is easily able to confirm the status of the siphon breaking, and the program is also helpful in the design of the siphon breaker.

machine_design	this paper presents a new accessory drive system for hybrid electric vehicles (hevs). this new concept involves a dual winding electric machine with simultaneous motor and generator functions. the electric machine provides power for all accessory loads such as the steering pump, compressors and 12 v loads. when the engine is off, the electric machine starts its motoring action and provides mechanical power to the accessory loads. simultaneously, the generator windings provide power for the 12 v loads. the proposed structure could be a viable choice for fault-tolerant applications because of the concentrated winding type that maintains electrical and magnetic isolation. design considerations of the proposed electric machine are outlined in the paper. the distributed winding topology and concentrated winding topologies are also compared. analytical proof of magnetic decoupling is presented and experimentally verified.
strength_of_materials	strength properties of materials under static and dynamic loading are essential quantities for characterizing mechanical behavior. quantitative measurements of static strengths achieved in the diamond anvil cell can be made using x-ray diffraction in a radial geometry for samples under non-hydrostatic compression. results for several metals up to 68 gpa show that the ratio of yield strength to shear modulus ranges from 0.01-0.03 and increases weakly with compression. trends at lower pressure for re, w, and epsilon-fe are consistent with available data above 1 mbar. strong ceramics such as b6o, c-si3n4, and tib2 achieve yield strengths as large at 10% of the shear modulus at pressures up to similar to 70 gpa. strengths of materials used as pressure media are quantitatively compared and evaluated.
strength_of_materials	the heterogeneous elastoplastic deformation of structural glasses is explored using the framework of the random first-order transition theory of the glass transition along with an extended mode-coupling theory that includes activated events. the theory involves coupling the continuum elastic theory of strain transport with mobility generation and transport as described in the theory of glass aging and rejuvenation. fluctuations that arise from the generation and transport of mobility, fictive temperature, and stress are treated explicitly. we examine the nonlinear flow of a glass under deformation at finite strain rate. the interplay among the fluctuating fields leads to the spatially heterogeneous dislocation of the particles in the glass, i.e., the appearance of shear bands of the type observed in metallic glasses deforming under mechanical stress.
strength_of_materials	the objective of the work is the investigation of the relationship between the mechanisms of the short-term tensile strength and the creep rupture strength at testing temperatures more than 2/3 of the materials' melting temperatures. the fundamental equations relating the materials tensile strength to the creep rupture strength at different temperatures and structural factors are obtained. these equations are derived by the use of the phenomenological and statistical thermodynamics of the crystalline lattice. the derived theoretical equation is used to determine creep on the bases of experimental values of the short-term test. the agreement between experimental and theoretical values of the creep is demonstrated. the presented results can be applied for prediction of the creep strength of new materials, particularly materials with enhanced mechanical properties.

hydraulics	this work develops a two-dimensional hydro-morphological model which can be used to simulate river hydraulics and morphology with various vegetation covers. the model system consists of five modules, including a hydrodynamic model, a sediment transport model, a vegetation model, a bank failure model and a bed deformation model. the secondary flow effects are incorporated through additional dispersion terms. the core components of the model system solve the full shallow water equations; this is coupled with a non-equilibrium sediment transport model. the new integrated model system is validated against a number of laboratory-scale test cases and then applied to a natural river. the satisfactory simulation results confirm the model 's capability in reproducing both stream hydraulics and channel morphological changes with vegetation. several hypothetical simulations indicate that the model can be used not only to predict flooding and morphological evolution with vegetation, but also to assess river restoration involving vegetation.

hydraulics	nature-based approaches to flood risk management are increasing in popularity. evidence for the effectiveness at the catchment scale of such spatially distributed upstream measures is inconclusive. however, it also remains an open question whether, under certain conditions, the individual impacts of a collection of flood mitigation interventions could combine to produce a detrimental effect on runoff response. a modelling framework is presented for evaluation of the impacts of hillslope and in-channel natural flood management interventions. it couples an existing semidistributed hydrological model with a new, spatially explicit, hydraulic channel network routing model. the model is applied to assess a potential flood mitigation scheme in an agricultural catchment in north yorkshire, united kingdom, comprising various configurations of a single variety of in-channel feature. the hydrological model is used to generate subsurface and surface fluxes for a flood event in 2012. the network routing model is then applied to evaluate the response to the addition of up to 59 features. additional channel and floodplain storage of approximately 70,000m(3) is seen with a reduction of around 11% in peak discharge. although this might be sufficient to reduce flooding in moderate events, it is inadequate to prevent flooding in the double-peaked storm of the magnitude that caused damage within the catchment in 2012. some strategies using features specific to this catchment are suggested in order to improve the attenuation that could be achieved by applying a nature-based approach.
computer-aided_design	the physical conception of the memristor by the hewlett-packard labs has opened the possibility of combining this new fundamental circuit element with traditional devices in order to carried out novel applications. an important step for incorporating the memristor into the computer-aided design tools is to find an expression that represents the behavior of the device. in this paper, a novel modeling methodology for memristive systems using homotopy perturbation methods is introduced. this methodology is capable of generating a semi-symbolical expression that represents the memristive behavior of the device. the new memristor model is characterized in order to determinate the impact of the variables on the memristive behavior and establishes the range of compliance using the principal fingerprints of the memristor. besides, the novel memristor model is depicted by two cases of study. finally, the advantages of the memristor model are presented and discussed.
computer-aided_design	a 3-d electron-beam-induced current (ebic) model was implemented in technology computer aided design simulations. the model uses a carefully designed charge carrier generation profile that describes how an electron beam induces charge carriers in a semiconducting device and then drift-diffusion equations are solved to determine the resulting current. the simulation provides a map of the ebic signal, which can be compared with experimental 2-d profiles. this comparison can be used to fit parameters such as the surface recombination rate which is otherwise difficult to fit in completed devices. additional experimental data for these fits are obtained by performing the experiments at different electron beam energies and thereby generating carriers at different depths in the sample. the experiments were performed on cross sections of silicon photodiodes with varying surface preparations. a strong influence of the surface preparation method on the charge carrier diffusion was observed.
strength_of_materials	flexural vibration analysis of beams made of functionally graded materials (fgms) with various boundary conditions is considered in this paper. due to technical problems during fgm fabrication, porosities and micro-voids can be created inside fgm samples which may lead to the reduction in density and strength of materials. in this investigation, the fgm beams are assumed to have even and uneven distributions of porosities over the beam cross-section. the modified rule of mixture is used to approximate material properties of the fgm beams including the porosity volume fraction. in order to cover the effects of shear deformation, axial and rotary inertia, the timoshenko beam theory is used to form the coupled equations of motion for describing dynamic behavior of the beams. to solve such a problem, chebyshev collocation method is employed to find natural frequencies of the beams supported by different end conditions. based on numerical results, it is revealed that fgm beams with even distribution of porosities have more significant impact on natural frequencies than fgm beams with uneven porosity distribution.
computer-aided_design	a feasibility study was performed in order to demonstrate the benefits of designing and manufacturing a customized foot orthosis by means of digital technologies, such as reverse engineering (re), generative design (gd) and additive manufacturing (am). the aim of this work was to define the complete design-manufacturing process, starting from the 3d scanning of the human foot anatomy to the direct fabricating of the customized foot orthosis. moreover, this first methodological study tries to combine a user-friendly semi-automatic modelling approach with the use of low-cost devices for the 3d laser scanning and the 3d printing processes. finally, the result of this approach, based on digital technologies, was also compared with that achieved by means of conventional manual techniques.
internal_combustion_engine	this article presents a fuel consumption model, sefum (semi empirical fuel use modeling), and its comparison with three models from the literature on a 600 km experimental database. this model is easy to calibrate with only a few required parameters that are provided by car manufacturers. the test database has been built from 21 drivers who drove in two conditions (normal and ecodriving) on a 15 km trip. for the model evaluation, three indicators have been selected: instantaneous fuel use root mean square error, cumulated error and computation time in order to evaluate the accuracy both in cumulated and instantaneous fuel use and to estimate computation time of each model. results tend to prove that the model is able to compute rapidly (maximum of 1500 simulated kilometers under matlab) in comparison to all other models while ensuring a high accuracy and precision for cumulated and instantaneous fuel use.

internal_combustion_engine	this brief investigates the cycle-to-cycle transient behavior of the residual gas fraction (rgf) in terms of systems theory and proposes a multivalued logic-based optimal control strategy for the attenuation of rgf fluctuation. first, an incylinder pressure-based method for measuring rgf is provided, and the stochastic properties of the rgf are examined based on statistical data obtained by conducting experiments on a full-scale internal combustion engine test bench. based on the observation of the experiment, a stochastic logical transient model is proposed to represent the cycle-to-cycle transient behavior of the rgf. then, an optimal feedback control law, which targets the rejection of the rgf fluctuation, is derived using the policy iteration algorithm. finally, the experimental result is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control law.
internal_combustion_engine	turbocompounding is an important technique to recover waste heat from engine exhaust and reduce co2 emission. this paper presents a parametric study of turbocompound diesel engine based on analytical model. an analytical model was developed to investigate the influence of system parameters on the engine fuel consumption. the model is based on thermodynamics knowledge and empirical models, which can consider the impacts of each parameter independently. the effects of turbine efficiency, back pressure, exhaust temperature, pressure ratio and engine speed on the recovery energy, pumping loss and engine fuel reductions were studied. results show that turbine efficiency, exhaust temperature and back pressure has great influence on the fuel reduction and optimal power turbine (pt) expansion ratio. however, engine operation speed has little impact on the fuel savings obtained by turbocompounding. the interaction mechanism between the pt recovery power and engine pumping loss is presented in the paper. due to the nonlinear characteristic of turbine power, there is an optimum value of pt expansion ratio to achieve largest power gain. at the end, the fuel saving potential of high performance turbocompound engine and the requirements for it are proposed in the paper.

hydraulics	hydroinformatics emerged in 1991 when numerical modelling of water expanded its range from one that was restricted to the modelling of flows to a much wider ranging sociotechnical discipline that supports stakeholders in addressing their water-related problems. however, despite numerous advances in hydroinformatics, the current practical and research effort is still very much technocratic (or techno-centric) which in turn may restrict the potential of hydroinformatics in its scope and its reach. this special issue, through the compilation of thirteen papers, illustrates some of the developments and applications in the field of hydroinformatics and marks the twenty-five years of its existence. we hope that this will help to further raise the awareness of the subject and its developments and applications. in the editorial of this special issue, we briefly discuss the origin of hydroinformatics and we introduce the papers that are featuring in this special issue. we also give a way forward for future research and application.
fluid_mechanics	a methodology for predicting scaling in membrane distillation (md), which considers thermodynamics, kinetics, and fluid mechanics, is developed and experimentally validated with calcium sulfate. the theory predicts the incidence of scaling as a function of temperature, concentration, and flow conditions by comparing the nucleation induction time to the residence time and applying an experimental correction factor. the relevant residence time is identified by considering a volume of solution near the membrane surface that contains enough ions to form a nucleus of critical size. the theory is validated with fouling experiments using calcium sulfate as a model sealant over a range of temperatures (40-70 degrees c) saturation indices, and flow rates. although the model is validated with a bench-scale md system, it is hoped to be compatible with large-scale systems that may have significant changes in concentration, temperature, and flow rate along the flow direction. at lower temperatures, the saturation index can be as high as 0.4-0.5 without scaling, but the safe concentration limit decreases with increasing temperature. increasing the feed flow rate reduces concentration polarization and fluid residence time, both of which decrease the likelihood of fouling. the model is translated into easily readable maps outlining safe operating regimes for md. the theory and maps can be used to choose safe operating conditions in md over a wide range of conditions and system geometries.
fluid_mechanics	in this study, an in vitro device that mimics the oral phase of swallowing is calibrated using in vivo measurements. the oral flow behavior of different newtonian and non-newtonian solutions is then investigated in vitro, revealing that shear-thinning thickeners used in the treatment of dysphagia behave very similar to low-viscosity newtonian liquids during active swallowing, but provide better control of the bolus before the swallow is initiated. a theoretical model is used to interpret the experimental results and enables the identification of two dynamical regimes for the flow of the bolus: first, an inertial regime of constant acceleration dependent on the applied force and system inertia, possibly followed by a viscous regime in which the viscosity governs the constant velocity of the bolus. this mechanistic understanding provides a plausible explanation for similarities and differences in swallowing performance of shear-thinning and newtonian liquids. finally, the physiological implications of the model and experimental results are discussed. in vitro and theoretical results suggest that individuals with poor tongue strength are more sensitive to overly thickened boluses. the model also suggests that while the effects of system inertia are significant, the density of the bolus itself plays a negligible role in its dynamics. this is confirmed by experiments on a high density contrast agent used for videofluoroscopy, revealing that theologically matched contrast agents and thickener solutions flow very similarly. in vitro experiments and theoretical insights can help designing novel thickener formulations before clinical evaluations.

machine_design	this paper presents the design of a novel electronic voting machine using microcontroller. voter 's information facility has also been incorporated in the machine design. the information about the number of voters present at the polling place is stored in a register, which is later used to do various analyses. infrared sensors have been used for determining the voter 's information. the design proposed here has a special option of vote rejection which is not present in the conventional systems. the simulation of the system is done on proteus professional software v8.0. multiple vote casting has been avoided by using software coding techniques. the design presented in this paper is appropriate and the simulation is working properly under normal conditions.
fluid_mechanics	data-driven low-order modelling has been enjoying rapid advances in fluid mechanics. arguably, sirovich (q. appl. maths, vol. xlv, 1987, pp. 561-571) started these developments with snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition, a particularly simple method. the resulting reduced-order models provide valuable insights into flow physics, allow inexpensive explorations of dynamics and operating conditions, and enable model-based control design. a winning argument for proper orthogonal decomposition (pod) is the optimality property, i.e. the guarantee of the least residual for a given number of modes. the price is unpleasant frequency mixing in the modes which complicates their physical interpretation. in contrast, temporal fourier modes and dynamic mode decomposition (dmd) provide pure frequency dynamics but lose the orthonormality and optimality property of pod. sieber et al. (j. fluid mech., vol. 792, 2016, pp. 798-828) bridge the least residual and pure frequency behaviour with an ingenious interpolation, called spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (spod). this article puts the achievement of the tu berlin authors in perspective, illustrating the potential of spod and the challenges ahead.
thermodynamics	fluctuation conductivity is experimentally studied in the genuine critical region near the superconducting transition of yba2cu3o7-delta, yba2cu2.985fe o-0.015(7-delta) and y0.95ca0.05ba2cu3o7-delta single crystal samples. two fluctuation regimes where the electrical conductivity diverges as a power-law of the reduced temperature were systematically observed. in the first regime, farther from the critical temperature t-c, the transition behaves as predicted by the thermodynamics of the three dimensional-xy (3d-xy) universality class characteristic of a second-order phase transition. in the asymptotic regime closer to tc a power-law regime characterized by a much smaller exponent is observed. the smallest value ever reported for the fluctuation conductivity exponent in the high-t-c superconductors is obtained for the fe- and ca-doped systems. we suggest that the regime beyond 3d-xy is a crossover towards a weakly first-order transition induced by internal magnetic excitations.

internal_combustion_engine	electrified powertrains/propulsion systems have gained a significant interest in transport industry to develop energy-efficient vehicular systems. in these powertrains, rechargeable energy storage systems (such as high energy batteries, electrochemical double-layer capacitors or high power batteries), electric motors, energy management strategies and advanced power electronics converters play an important role in the development of new generations of clean vehicles. therefore, this paper proposes new drivetrain architectures for straddle truck carriers, as one of off-highway vehicles, which are used in harbors to move containers, in order to improve the straddle truck carriers drivetrain efficiency and to reduce the greenhouse emissions as well as the energy bills. the proposed drivetrains are: (1) series hybrid straddle truck carrier based on a small rechargeable energy storage system (option a), (2) series hybrid based on a reduced internal combustion engine (option b), (3) full electric drivetrain, and (4) new full electric drivetrain based on dynamic wireless-power transfer system. in this paper, an accurate quasi-static model of the conventional straddle truck carrier drivetrain is developed and described in detail. then, the proposed drivetrain architectures are designed and modeled using matlab/simulink. this article also presents the optimal design of rechargeable energy storage systems that can be utilized in those drivetrains. based on the rechargeable energy storage system type, a thorough comparative study of new straddle truck carrier drivetrains is described in detail. finally, the developed model and simulation results have been validated with real measurements of the drivetrain.

strength_of_materials	a closed-form solution for upper and lower bounds ( 'dual bounds') to a slow indentation of rigid ball (under increasing normal load) into rigid plastic solids are presented. the solutions enlarge the theoretical background to the familiar brinell hardness tests used in assessing strength of materials and add few new features. the new features are mainly: (i) constructing a lower-bound solution to ball indentation, (ii) a closed-form estimation of the dual bounds with any prescribed frictional shear along the indenter/solid contact, (iii) providing dual bounds to two different situations of the material response: (a) the removed material is falling off from the bulk (akin to indentation into brittle-like materials) and (b) the removed material is piled up along the indenter face (akin to indentation into ductile-like materials). the dual bound solutions of the indenting mean ball pressure for both material cases seem to capture properly well the material constrain to local plastic indentation and the effect of the interfacial friction. having both bounds simultaneously, despite their unavoidable deviation, provide much more informative results than a single bound. comparisons between the suggested bounding analysis and experiments (taken from tabor [tabor d. hardness of metals. oxford: clarendon press; 1951], johnson [johnson kl. contact mechanics. cambridge: cambridge university press; 1985 (new edition, 2001)] and others), numerical fem solutions (mesarovic and fleck [mesarovic sdj, fleck n. spherical indentation of elastic-plastic solids. proceedings of royal society of london 1999; a455: 2707-28] and others) and some self-made measurements are all favorable.

manufacturing_engineering	this paper presents a methodology to generate manufacturing routes and operations using rules of precedence to provide logical approach in their dimensioning and chaining. the rules of precedence order and prioritize the knowledge of various manufacturing processes, taking into account the theories of machining, forging, assembly, and heat treatments; also, utilizes the theories of accumulation of tolerance and process capability, between others. the proposed methodology requires development of manufacturing data bases of manufacturing process, tolerances and capabilities, deviations of the machine tool - cutting tool - fixture device and work piece. the rules of precedence make viable the generation of manufacturing routings and operations, through the usage of structured knowledge, instead of tacit one. this approach allows the structured development of manufacturing routes, which can be deployed to engineers working in the areas of manufacturing engineering.
internal_combustion_engine	the main design criteria for the modern sustainable development of vehicle powertrains are the high energy efficiency of the conversion system, the competitive cost and the lowest possible environmental impacts. the need for efficiency improvement of the vehicle energy system induces the search for an innovative methodology during the design process. in this article the energy services for mobility and comfort are integrated. the energy integration of the mobility and the comfort service is applied through an innovative methodology combining process integration techniques. the methodology is applied on the energy integration study of a hybrid electric vehicle powertrain with the vehicle cabin. the energy balance of the internal combustion engine is done and discussed, according to the operating points. the energy requirement for comfort in the cabin is also determined, according to the seasonal requirement for heating or cooling. work cycles for heat recovery are described and investigated. the minimum energy requirement is determined for different mobility and comfort situations. the energy recovery potential of a single stage rankine cycle for a diesel engine in combination with a hybrid electric powertrain is assessed. the rankine cycle circuit and equipment are simultaneously presided.
internal_combustion_engine	organic rankine cycles (orc) using toluene and hexamethyldisiloxane (mm) are put forward as a means of improving the efficiency of automotive heavy duty engines, and provide a reference for comparison in this study. despite an efficiency improvement potential of 4-4.7%, the current orc approach is not reaching the required fuel savings within the expected costs. as such, innovative pathways to improve the orc performance and cost-effectiveness are of great importance to the research community. this paper presents a partial solution by means of a conceptual overview and simulation results for orcs especially tailored for high-temperature applications. a fundamental revision of the heat transfer and expansion characteristics is presented, without increasing the system integration complexity. these characteristics are attributed to the use of formulated organic blends with toluene and mm as a significant blend component. the developed 22 criteria blend screening methodology is presented. simulation results show that for an equivalent expansion volume flow ratio, and product of heat transfer coefficient and area, the blends offer a 22-24% improvement in the net power. this resulted in a 15-18% cost savings compared to the reference orc. the simulations were conducted in aspen hysys v8 using the peng-robinson and wilson fluid property packages.

machine_design	the main objective of this paper is to develop a new technique for detecting turn-to-turn short-circuit faults in one or two stator phases of an induction motor. hence, modeling a turn-to-turn short-circuit fault in more than one phase and a phase-to-ground fault is the first novelty of this paper for calculating phase currents under faulty conditions. this strategy uses the extracted features from the corresponding three-phase current pattern in 3-d space. identification of faulty phases and of the severity of the fault is the outcome of this technique. this technique is also capable of detecting a phase-to-ground fault. this method just requires current sensors that are available in most drive systems to provide good controllability, and details of the machine design are not necessary. experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting and locating phase/phases under different faults and load conditions.
internal_combustion_engine	this chapter deals with the numerical simulation of the exhaust of an engine, passing through a pipe of 100 mm long and 30 mm diameter. the velocity and temperature profiles along with the concentration of exhaust gases are plotted along the axial length of the pipe. further, a coaxial surface junction thermocouple (10 mm long and 3.25 mm diameter) is placed at an appropriate location of the pipe and the flow field is reinvestigated. in both the cases, the lateral variation of temperature and velocity, are found to be negligible. but, the composition of exhaust gas changes beyond an axial length of 20 mm which may be possibly due to chemical reaction of exhaust gases with ambient air. one of the important objectives of this simulation is to estimate a desired axial location of the thermocouple for a proposed experiment. based on the simulated results, it found that the thermocouple can be mounted at any axial location between 0-20 mm from the inlet of exhaust pipe.
internal_combustion_engine	big-end bearing knock faults in ic engines can be considered as a real industrial case of a slider-crank mechanism including a joint with clearance and lubrication. in this paper, an artificial neural network (ann) based system was used to solve the problem of intelligent big-end bearing knock fault diagnosis in internal combustion (ic) engine. but when the ann is used in machine condition monitoring, it is either unlikely or uneconomical to experience all different real faults to generate sufficient training data. therefore, model based method should be a viable way to generate adequate data to train the networks for the intelligent big-end bearing fault diagnosis in ic engines. in order to evaluate and update the simulation model, experiments with normal bearing clearance and with different oversize bearing clearances were first carried out on the engine test rig. it was found that the relevant diagnostic information lies in the squared envelope of the vibration signals. therefore, we only need build a proper simulation model to simulate the correct envelope signals rather than the raw vibration signals. as the important inputs of the simulation model, the inertia properties of the simulated engine components were also measured and studied. next, we built an ann-based bearing knock diagnosis system which consists of three phases: fault detection phase, fault localization phase and fault severity identification phase. particularly, a saturating linear function is selected as the transfer function of the fault severity identification stage, so the networks can linearly classify the fault levels and the output is more in agreement with the reality in industry. following the feature extraction and selection from the processed squared envelope signals, the networks were purely trained by the simulated data with normal bearing clearance and with different oversize bearing clearances. finally the networks was tested by the real experimental data and it was demonstrated that the networks can successfully detect different bearing knock faults in real tests, and also classify the faults' location and severity levels.

machine_design	ultra-precision manufacturing (upm) machines are used to fabricate and measure complex parts having micrometer-level features and nanometer-level tolerances/surface finishes. therefore, random vibration of the machine due to ground excitations and residual vibration stemming from onboard disturbances must be mitigated using vibration isolation systems. a long-standing rule of thumb in vibration isolation system design is to locate the isolators in such a way that the vibration modes of the isolated machine are decoupled. however, prior work by the authors has demonstrated that coupling vibration modes of passively-isolated upm machines could provide conditions for drastic reduction of residual vibrations compared to decoupling. the authors' analysis was based on the restrictive assumption that the isolated machine was modally damped. the key contribution of this paper is in investigating the effect of mode coupling on the residual vibrations of upm machines with non-proportional (np) damping which is more realistic than modal damping. it also analyzes the effects of mode coupling on the reduction of ground vibrations (i.e., transmissibility). the analyses reveal that, even though np damping changes the vibration behavior of the machine compared to modal damping, mode coupling still provides ample opportunities to reduce residual vibration and transmissibility. guidelines for properly designing a upm machine to best exploit mode coupling for vibration reduction are provided and validated through simulations and experiments. up to 40% reduction in residual vibration and 50% reduction in transmissibility are demonstrated.

machine_design	the aim of this paper is to discuss electrical machines building and computation while taking into account the change of reluctance network (rn) topology required in an optimization process. indeed, as electrical machine rn changes during an electrical period, this model has to consider several rotor positions to analyze harmonic influence on machine performance (e.g., its torque and losses). such a requirement can also be important in applications where machine geometry changes shortly during sizing process by optimization. these two cases are addressed in this paper. using established independent meshes of the initial rn, this paper proposes an algorithm to deal with all topologies necessary for an optimization process. this aims to reduce the computation time, increase the model, and improve the solving stability. an output selectivity approach is also applied on the rn modeling to improve the computation time of the optimization process. the simulation results are compared to finite-element methods and the optimization performance is presented.
thermodynamics	adsorption is a widely used technique for the removal of dyes from wastewaters by variety of adsorbents. in this work, the main focus is on the potential assessment of anion exchange membrane for the removal of different dyes using batch system and investigation of experimental data by applying various kinetic and thermodynamic models. the removal of anionic dyes i.e., eosin-b, eriochrome black-t and congo red by anion exchange membrane bii from aqueous solution was carried out and effect of various parameters such as contact time, membrane dosage, temperature and ionic strength on the percentage removal of anionic dyes was studied. the experimental data was assessed by kinetic models namely pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, elovich liquid film diffusion, bangham and the modified freundlich models equation have been used to analyze the experimental data. these results indicate that the adsorption of these anionic dyes on bii follows pseudo-second-order kinetics with maximum values of regression coefficient (0.992-0.998) for all the systems. the adsorption of dyes was more suitable to be controlled by a liquid film diffusion mechanism. the adsorptive removal of dye eosin-b and eriochrome black-t were decreased with temperature and thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (delta g degrees), enthalpy (delta h degrees) and entropy (delta s degrees) for adsorption of dyes on membrane bii were calculated at 298 k, 308 k and 318 k. the values of enthalpy and entropy were negative for eb and ebt representing that the adsorption of these dyes on bii is physiosorptive and exothermic in nature. whereas the positive values of enthalpy and entropy for cr adsorption on bii, indicating that its adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous in nature. it is evident from this study that anion exchange membrane has shown good potential for the removal of dyes from aqueous solution and it can be used as adsorbent for dues removal on commercial levels.
fluid_mechanics	the california sea lion (zalophus californianus), is an agile and powerful swimmer. unlike many successful swimmers (dolphins, tuna), they generate most of their thrust with their large foreflippers. this protocol describes a robotic platform designed to study the hydrodynamic performance of the swimming california sea lion (zalophus californianus). the robot is a model of the animal 's foreflipper that is actuated by motors to replicate the motion of its propulsive stroke (the 'clap'). the kinematics of the sea lion 's propulsive stroke are extracted from video data of unmarked, non-research sea lions at the smithsonian zoological park (snz). those data form the basis of the actuation motion of the robotic flipper presented here. the geometry of the robotic flipper is based a on high-resolution laser scan of a foreflipper of an adult female sea lion, scaled to about 60% of the full-scale flipper. the articulated model has three joints, mimicking the elbow, wrist and knuckle joint of the sea lion foreflipper. the robotic platform matches dynamics properties-reynolds number and tip speed-of the animal when accelerating from rest. the robotic flipper can be used to determine the performance (forces and torques) and resulting flowfields.

computer-aided_design	a compact model of amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide thin-film transistors, suitable for cad simulators, is proposed. the model is simple, symmetric, and accurately accounts for the subthreshold, linear, and saturation regimes via a unique formulation. it accounts for both trapped and free charges by means of multiple-trapping-and-release and percolation in the conduction band. aim of the paper is to work out the analytic expression of the current and of the terminal charges, along with the surface potential and the electric field as a function of position in the channel. the availability of the surface potential and of the electric field is the key to model advanced physical effects as, for example, the carrier injection from the electrodes into the channel.
thermodynamics	cellulose and chitosan have intrinsic sorption properties for nd(iii); however, their efficiency for metal recovery can be easily improved by a relatively simple chemical modification. the grating of aspartic acid via an intermediary chlorination step of the polysaccharides allows increasing sorption capacities due to the specific reactivity of carboxylate groups. the grafting process is confirmed by elemental analysis, ftir spectrometry, while the physical properties of the derivatives are characterized by xrd (crystallinity) and tga (thermogravimetric analysis). the sorption properties are carried out by investigating the effect of the ph, studying the uptake kinetics and evaluating the thermodynamics (sorption isotherms). the sorption properties of modified sorbents are systematically compared to the performance of raw materials. sorption capacity is doubled after grafting aspartic acid onto biopolymer backbone. sorption isotherms are described by the freundlich and the langmuir equation and maximum sorption capacities reach up to 77-80 mg nd g(-1) at ph 5. the uptake kinetics are described by the pseudo-first order reaction rate and under selected experimental conditions the equilibrium is reached within 3 h of contact. the sorption is spontaneous, endothermic. metal desorption can be successfully performed with 0.5 m nitric acid and the sorbents can be recycled for at least 4 sorption/desorption cycles without significant loss in sorption/desorption performances.

thermodynamics	the electrochemical properties of sn-m (m = cu, mg and fe) bi-alloy nanoparticles prepared by dc arc-discharge method have been studied when these nanoparticles serve as the anode materials in li-ion batteries (libs). among all the alloy electrodes, the sn-fe electrode has the best initial specific capacity that maintains at about 227.3 mah g(-1) within 20 cycles. the intermetallic compounds in the nanoparticles have been characterized and thermodynamics analysis is introduced to elucidate the energy balance of their formation mechanism. as the electrochemical behaviours of the various alloy nanoparticles are different, we conclude that the present intermetallic compounds eventually determine the lithium-ion storage ability as well as the cyclic stability during the lithiation/delithiation process.

hydraulics	nuclear thermal rocket (ntr) propulsion is a viable and meritorious option for human exploration into deep-space because of its high thrust, improved specific impulse, well established technology, bimodal capability, and enhanced mission safety and reliability. the ntr technology has already been investigated and tested by the united states of america and russia and the former soviet union. the representative nuclear engine for rocket vehicle applications (nerva) type reactors traditionally used highly enriched uranium (heu) fuels, shaped in hexagonal fuel element geometries because of the importance of making a high power reactor with a minimum size. although the heu-ntr designs are the best choice in terms of rocket performance and technical maturity, they inevitably provoke nuclear proliferation obstacles not only for all research and development activities by civilians and non-nuclear weapon states but also for potential commercialization. to overcome the security issues due to heu, the non proliferative, small-size ntr engine with low thrust levels of 41 kn-53 kn (9.2 klb(f) similar to 11.9 klb(f)), korea advanced nuclear thermal engine rocket utilizing a low-enriched uranium fuel (kanuter-leu), is being designed for future generations. its design goals are to make use of an leu fuel for its fairly compact core, but to minimize the rocket performance sacrifice relative to the traditional heu-ntrs. to achieve these goals, a new space propulsion reactor is conceptually designed with the key concepts of a high uranium density fuel with resistance against high heating and h-2 corrosion, a thermal neutron spectrum core, and a compact and integrated fuel element core design with protective cooling capability. in addition, a preliminary design study of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics was performed to explore the design space of the new leu-ntr reactor concept. the result indicates that the innovative reactor concept has great potential, both to implement the use of an leu fuel and to create comparable rocket performance, compared to the existing heu-ntr designs.

computer-aided_design	background and objective: antibacterial peptides (abps) are essential components of host defense against microbial infections present in all domains of life. the amps incorporating unnatural amino acids (uabps) exhibit several advantages over naturally occurring amps based on factors such as bioavailability, metabolic stability and overall toxicity. methods: computer-aided modeling and in vitro susceptibility test were combined to rationally design short uabps with potent antimicrobial activity. in the procedure, peptide characterization and machine learning modeling were used to develop statistical regression predictors, which were then employed to guide the molecular design and structural optimization of uabps, to which a number of commercially available unnatural amino acids were introduced. results: an improved uabp population was obtained, from which several promising candidates were successfully prepared and their antibacterial potencies against three bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli were measured using broth microdilution assay. consequently, four uabps with hybrid structure property were determined to have high potency against the tested strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of <50 mu g/ml. conclusions: molecular dynamics (md) simulations revealed that the designed uabps are amphipathic helix in solution but they would largely unfold when spontaneously embedding into an artificial lipid bilayer that mimics microbial membrane.

machine_design	an open-source musculoskeletal model for predictions of lumbar muscle forces is presented in this paper. the model is based on a previously published anatomically detailed lumbar spine model, with upper extremity, lower extremity and head-neck models incorporated. it is implemented in opensim, an open-source musculoskeletal modeling platform. the features of this model include the ability to predict joint reactions, lumbar muscle forces and lumbar muscle activation patterns. to validate the ability of the model to predict lumbar loading, the loads acting on the vertebral bodies under several conditions were determined and compared with loads measured in vivo using instrumented vertebral body replacements and pressure transducers in the intervertebral discs. model-predicted loads were strongly correlated with measured loads (r = 0.934); thus, the model successfully predicts variations in loading between different conditions. the model introduced here should ultimately aid in the ergonomics of machine design, since current machines are still mainly designed without knowing reasonable lumbar loads.
strength_of_materials	in the most recent years, structural applications of bonded joints have increased remarkably owing to their several advantages relative to other joining methods. as a consequence, the development of improved models to provide design efficiency and, at the same time, increase the confidence of designers acquires special relevancy. recent developments considering cohesive and continuum mixed-mode damage models have demonstrated that these methods are able to deal with several details inherent to mechanical behaviour of bonded joints. both methods allow simulation of damage initiation and propagation by combining classical strength of materials approaches with fracture mechanics concepts. in this work, several different mixed-mode cohesive laws adapted to different types of adhesives mechanical behaviour are presented and discussed. effectively, while mechanical behaviour of brittle or moderately ductile adhesives is well simulated by means of the simple bilinear cohesive law, adhesives with pronounced ductile behaviour require more sophisticated cohesive laws. the aspects regarding determination of some cohesive parameters are also given special attention in the present paper. a continuum mixed-mode damage model is also presented using the bilinear softening cohesive law. this model is advantageous since properties degradation takes place inside solid elements used to simulate the adhesive, which allows the evaluation of specific issues like the influence of asymmetric propagation on joint mechanical behaviour in a more realistic manner. important conclusions about advantages and drawbacks of both methodologies are drawn.
manufacturing_engineering	evolution of manufacturing technology has been a definitive indicator of human society 's development. from the wheels that started the spree to the world of machines that have revolutionized the manufacturing processes, manufacturing tools have been indicative of eras of development. in this paper, we have focused on the branch of engineering that deals with manufacturing - specifically its structure in india. in this study we investigate some premier government institutes with respect to manufacturing engineering education. we have also included the technical education model at different education level.
computer-aided_design	laser sintered technology has been introduced for clinical use and can be utilized more widely, accompanied by the digitalization of dentistry and the development of direct oral scanning devices. this study was performed with the aim of comparing the marginal accuracy and internal fit of co-cr alloy copings fabricated by casting, cad/cam (computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture) milled, and 3-d laser sintered techniques. a total of 36 co-cr alloy crown-copings were fabricated from an implant abutment. the marginal and internal fit were evaluated by measuring the weight of the silicone material, the vertical marginal discrepancy using a microscope, and the internal gap in the sectioned specimens. the data were statistically analyzed by one-way anova (analysis of variance), a scheffe 's test, and pearson 's correlation at the significance level of p = 0.05, using statistics software. the silicone weight was significantly low in the casting group. the 3-d laser sintered group showed the highest vertical discrepancy, and marginal-, occlusal-, and average-internal gaps (p < 0.05). the cad/cam milled group revealed a significantly high axial internal gap. there are moderate correlations between the vertical marginal discrepancy and the internal gap variables (r = 0.654), except for the silicone weight. in this study, the 3-d laser sintered group achieved clinically acceptable marginal accuracy and internal fit.
hydraulics	hydraulic jump is a phenomenon which usually occurs in rivers and in correspondence with hydraulic structures. it is characterized by a rapid transition from a super- to sub-critical flow conditions, involving a huge energy dissipation. for its characteristics and its relevance in hydraulics, it has been studied since the early years of the last century. nevertheless, many features still require a further investigation, e.g., scale effects, air entrainment process, effect of bed ""roughness on conjugate depths, etc. in particular, in the last few decades, the analysis of the main geometric parameters has been further developed. nevertheless, no studies dealing with d-jump occurring on a rough sloping channel are present in literature. therefore, the present paper reports the results of experimental investigations, which allowed to develop a semi-theoretical approach in order to evaluate the d-jump conjugate depth in a wide range of channel bed geometric and boundary configurations.

strength_of_materials	the performance of industrial waste incineration bottom ash in controlled low-strength material (clsm) was investigated in this paper, as the quarry dust was added. clsm mixtures were made from the industrial waste incineration bottom ash, quarry dust, and cement. tests for fresh density, bleeding, compressive strength, shear strength, hydraulic conductivity, and excavatability were carried out. the compressive strength ranges from 60 kpa to 6790 kpa, the friction angle varies from 5a degrees to 19a degrees, and the cohesion is from 4 to 604 kpa. most of the mixtures are found to be non-excavatable. it is indicated that the quarry dust addition increases the compressive strength and shear parameters, decreases bleeding, and increases the removability modulus.
hydraulics	an overview is given on the work of the laboratory of nuclear energy systems at eth, zurich (ethz) and of the laboratory of thermal hydraulics at paul scherrer institute (psi), switzerland on tight-lattice bundles. two-phase flow in subchannels of a tight triangular lattice was studied experimentally and by computational fluid dynamics simulations. two adiabatic facilities were used: (1) a vertical channel modeling a pair of neighboring sub channels; and (2) an arrangement of four subchannels with one subchannel in the center. the first geometry was equipped with two electrical film sensors placed on opposing rod surfaces forming the subchannel gap. they recorded 2d liquid film thickness distributions on a domain of 16 x 64 measuring points each, with a time resolution of 10 khz. in the bubbly and slug flow regime, information on the bubble size, shape, and velocity and the residual liquid film thickness underneath the bubbles were obtained. the second channel was investigated using cold neutron tomography, which allowed the measurement of average liquid film profiles showing the effect of spacer grids with vanes. the results were reproduced by large eddy simulation + volume of fluid. in the outlook, a novel nonadiabatic subchannel experiment is introduced that can be driven to steady-state dryout. a refrigerant is heated by a heavy water circuit, which allows the application of cold neutron tomography. copyright (c) 2016, published by elsevier korea llc on behalf of korean nuclear society.

hydraulics	this study numerically investigated the laminar mixed-convection heat transfer of different water copper nanofluids inside a microtube with curvature angle of 90 degrees using a finite volume method. the reynolds number of modeling was 10, nanoparticles volume fractions were chosen from 0.0% to 6.0% and richardson numbers varied from 0.1 to 10. the findings were depicted for dimensionless axial velocity, coefficient of friction and nusselt number profiles as well as dimensionless temperature contours. the validity of model was excellent compared to former numerical and experimental studies. the results showed that the heat transfer and hydraulics behavior of nanofluids in curved geometries is to some extent different with other geometries and flat surfaces due to presence of buoyancy and centrifugal forces at the same time. especially, in the regions near and after 45 degrees curvature angle, the behavior of heat transfer and nanofluid flow is unpredictable. in this region, increasing the nanoparticles volume concentration or transition from forced convection regime to free convection state, cause a decrease in nusselt number and friction factor. that 's while for the entrance region of microtube, the results are completely opposite; increasing the richardson number or nanoparticle concentration enhances the heat transfer as well as friction factor. also, the velocity profile variations in the vertical and horizontal diameter of microtube is significant in areas of 60 degrees (pi/3) and the heterogeneity of this profile increases by rising rayleigh number and volume fraction of solid particles.

manufacturing_engineering	earlier association rule data mining was mainly used for analysis of market basket data but now the scope has widened. it is experimented in various areas where extraction of interesting correlations can help like healthcare, education systems, manufacturing engineering, network management, intelligence etc. as android is a new technology which came into use from 2008 only, very few researchers have touched the area of applying association rule mining on android applications. here an implementation of association rule fp-growth algorithm on similar android applications (clones) is done, which is a novel area itself. paper describes a framework which mines association rules from android application clones. the analysis of the rules and dependencies proved fruitful and gave useful results. interesting relations are extracted between codes, which can help the developers in performing future operations like modification of the code easily.
materials_engineering	creating an environment to enable the seamless integration of experiment, computation, and data within a laboratory environment is essential to enabling the practice of integrated computational materials engineering. such an environment depends on the connection of experimental equipment and high performance computing resources to a collaborative software environment that supports research teams through simulation tool sharing and archival data management in a secure manner. key functions of such a system include project management, workflow management, tool staging, data provenance tracking, and user authentication. an overview will be provided on efforts to establish such an integrated collaborative environment in a research laboratory involved in material and process discovery and development in both structural and functional materials.
machine_design	this paper deals with rare-earth-free permanent magnet traction machine design for c-segment electric vehicle (ev). four different ferrite permanent magnet synchronous machine topologies having different magnets arrangement and pole-pair number, selected for their high potential, are presented and compared thanks to a computationally efficient finite-element based analysis tool that was developed purposely. it was found that flux focusing machine having 12 poles and 72 slots outperforms in terms of torque-speed requirement fulfillment, efficiency and power to weight ratio. influence of the magnet grade on the resilience against demagnetization under symmetrical short-circuit condition of the selected machine was then investigated. it is shown that the machine is subject to complete demagnetization if low grade hard ferrite (ceramic 8) is adopted, thereby fostering research of new and abundantly available magnet grades is key for penetration of new and cost effective electrical machines into ev powertrain market.
thermodynamics	we prepared srcuo2 thin film by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering on glass substrate and have investigated its post-annealing effects on structure and thermal conductivity. the as-sputtered film belongs to two-dimensional spin system srcuo2, namely, layer-type srcuo2, which has a possibility of exhibiting high, anisotropic thermal conductivity by magnetic excitation of the spins. it was found that the as-sputtered film has (001)-orientation in which the spin layers are parallel to the surface of substrate and that post-annealing results in enhancement of crystallinity of the film such as disappearance of grain boundaries, which can cause an increase in thermal conductivity.

internal_combustion_engine	homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) engines are a promising alternative to traditional spark-and compression-ignition engines, due to their potential to achieve a high thermal efficiency and near-zero emissions of nox and soot. in this work, the heat transfer from the bulk gas to the cylinder wall is measured during motored and hcci operation in a single cylinder (cfr) engine fueled with n-heptane. heat flux measurements in the cylinder wall and head show small spatial variation of the heat flux in the combustion chamber. design of experiments methods are applied to study the effect of the engine settings on the heat transfer. it is found that the inlet air temperature does not affect the heat flux under motored operation. under fired operation, all engine settings affect the heat transfer, but none of their interactions are significant. the compression ratio and inlet air temperature have a quadratic effect on the peak heat flux and peak convection coefficient, whereas the mass fuel rate has a linear effect. for the total heat released, the compression ratio and inlet air temperature have a linear effect and the mass fuel rate has a quadratic effect on it. all engine settings affect the instantaneous heat flux.

strength_of_materials	strength of materials or the mechanics of deformable bodies is the part of mechanics which deals with the study of and the relationship between internal forces and deformations arising in real bodies and their changes in shape and size in relation to loads acting on them, their linkages and the physical properties of the material they are made of. in general, resistance of materials engineering provides the foundation that will allow us to, together with the conditions of stability and balance, calculate and project work or elements of machines, determining their size or verifying that they are well designed and are suitable for their proposed objectives. this is why we can distinguish two perspectives in the scope of this subject; firstly the problem of sizing and secondly, checking. the study of scientific-technological areas must have the characteristic of providing practical results, so it gives students the opportunity to test the usefulness of the course in solving everyday problems in the practice of engineering. it is important that the teacher uses this to obtain maximum attention and interest of students [2]. the study of the strength of materials can not be done in isolation, but must rely on knowledge of mechanics and be related to the study of elasticity. the difference between the theory of elasticity and strength of materials is primarily focusing on the problem, as the theory of elasticity is based on more accurate approaches which means we can dispense with some simplified assumptions adopted by strength of materials. the subject of elasticity and strength of materials (erm) is usually given during the middle years of the degree. it is a compulsory subject in most engineering degrees, as well as in architecture, agronomy, etc. the vastness of the subject, the assumptions that simplify every problem and sometimes the lack of practical experiments that support the accuracy of the theoretical analysis, provoke insecurity, lack of student motivation and lack of critical thinking, which are essential for an engineer [4]. to remedy this lack of motivation, insecurity and critical spirit, we propose the creation of a working group. the work is to analyze the stress state of a real piece comparing the results of three methods of analysis. the first method would be theoretical analysis, the second and third experimental analysis and numerical analysis. the variation in results obtained by each method will promote discussion and analysis of the reasons for these results. the choice of the piece is important because a very complex piece would be beyond the bounds of the subject, and a very simple piece would not produce a significant variation in results. the teaching experiment was performed with the participation of four teams or groups of student volunteers [8]. to test whether the introduction of this work in the subject generates a positive educational outcome, we have conducted a student survey, focusing on three aspects: the acquisition of knowledge, increased motivation and the importance of the course for a future engineer. this survey provided very different results between students who have participated in the project and those who have not. the students who took part in the 3-part analysis felt able to discuss any real part of the subject and the others have much less understanding of the subject. students in the surveys on the teaching of the real life problems give the impression that they have not achieved the main objectives.
strength_of_materials	this paper examines the use of a continuum damage model to predict strength and size effects in notched carbon-epoxy laminates. the effects of size and the development of a fracture process zone before final failure are identified in an experimental program. the continuum damage model is described and the resulting predictions of size effects are compared with alternative approaches: the point stress and the inherent flaw models, the linear elastic fracture mechanics approach, and the strength of materials approach. the results indicate that the continuum damage model is the most accurate technique to predict size effects in composites. furthermore, the continuum damage model does not require any calibration and it is applicable to general geometries and boundary conditions.

hydraulics	in high-velocity chute flows, free-surface aeration is often observed. the phenomenon is called self-aeration or white waters. when the turbulent shear stresses next to the free-surface are large enough, air bubbles are entrained throughout the entire airwater column. a rapidly-varied flow region is observed immediately downstream of the inception point of free-surface aeration. an analytical solution of the air diffusion equation is proposed and the results compare well with new experimental data. both experiments and theory indicate that the flow bulking spans over approximately 3-4 step cavities downstream of the inception point of free-surface aeration on a stepped chute. further downstream the void fraction distributions follow closely earlier solutions of the air diffusion equation. the application of the diffusion equation solution to prototype and laboratory data shows air bubble diffusivities typically larger than the momentum transfer coefficient. the result highlights however a marked decrease in the ratio of air bubble diffusivity to eddy viscosity with increasing reynolds number. the finding might indicate some limitation of laboratory investigations of air bubble diffusion process in self-aerated flows and of their extrapolation to full-scale prototype applications.
fluid_mechanics	while onsite measurement of air permeability provides a useful approach to assess the service life of concrete structures, the combined use of onsite and laboratory measurement of air permeability is useful to anticipate whether the target service life is to be achieved. this investigation was developed within the aim of founding the application of an air permeability test (torrent method), based on the experimental observation of specimen geometry and surface influence on air permeability results. an experimental program was developed considering three specimen geometries, two types of surface, and twelve concrete mixes. the results were analysed and no significant influence of the tested specimens geometry and surfaces was detected. therefore, the use of any of the surfaces or specimens geometry in mix approval or in compliance control processes is possible without correction of the results. this work constitutes a contribution to further understanding of the test method in particular and of concrete air permeability assessment in general.
computer-aided_design	a method is presented for modeling the tensile behavior of multifilament twisted yarns. a filament assembly model and a computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering (cad/cae) approach are proposed for the tensile analysis. the geometry of the twisted yarn and the nonlinear filament properties were considered. the finite element method (fem) and large deformation effects were applied for computation of the stress-extension curves. ideal yarn structures of five layers with different twist angles were simulated to predict the tensile behavior of each filament and each layer. the stress acting on the filaments after yarn extension could be directly analyzed by the fem. the stress distribution in the filaments showed that the highest stress regions were located at the filament in the center of the yarn and decreased slightly to the yarn surface. the stress-extensions of the filaments were converted to yarn tensile behavior that is shown in terms of the maximum and average stress-extension curves. the results of this prediction model were compared with the stress-strain curves of high-tenacity rayon yarn and the energy method. the maximum stress-extension curves showed very good agreement with experimental results and are more accurate than those obtained by previous methods.
hydraulics	purpose of review this review shows that a more or less constant rate of tip-to-base vessel widening across species, together with the assumption that wider vessels are more vulnerable to embolism, suggests how climate should limit maximum vegetation height; together, these two factors predict a maximum mean vessel diameter permitted by temperature and water availability at a site and thus maximum plant height. recent findings empirical work makes it increasingly clear that the main driver of variation in mean vessel diameter is plant size, specifically the length of the conductive stream. anatomical evidence, together with hydraulic optimality models, suggests that this vessel diameter-stem length relationship is the result of natural selection favoring the maintenance of constant hydraulic resistance over size increases. from their very narrow termini, vessels widen predictably from the stem tip to the base, following approximately a power law, i. e., with very rapid widening toward the tips and nearly constant diameter toward the base. this size dependence must be taken into account when studying the hydraulics-climate relationship. summary this review discusses outstanding predictions that require testing, including the following: variation in the vessel diameter-stem length relationship should involve factors such as vessel length distributions, pit characteristics, leaf area, and wood density; leaves higher in trees should have higher terminal leaf vein-petiole base vessel widening rates; species without ""disposable"" units (e. g., columnar cacti) might have different widening rates; and within-plant widening rate should vary as plants approach their height limits. finally, we emphasize the need to standardize for size in making comparisons of vessel diameter variation.
hydraulics	laboratory experiments were conducted in order to investigate the effectiveness of a new scour countermeasure consisting of a horizontal extension plate (ep) downstream of a gated spillway-stilling basin structure. these experiments were performed on a 1:30 scale model of one of the south florida water management district (sfwmd) gated spillway structures, the s65e gated spillway, because it has experienced worrisome downstream scour. currently, riprap is the only scour countermeasure documented for these structures. eps of various lengths were installed downstream of the stilling basin, and the equilibrium scour was measured. it was found that a plate length of approximately 1.88 times the exiting flow depth was the shortest length that resulted in significant scour reduction and downstream scour translation. measured flow patterns reveal that the ep altered the flow patterns by transferring the plunging flow downstream and eliminating the near-bed reattachment and surface recirculation, possibly due to a decreased interaction between the plunging flow and the stilling basin face.
manufacturing_engineering	the lack of hands-on experiences in specific manufacturing processes has been identified as one of the major competency gaps in manufacturing engineering education. partly in response to this, funding agencies like sme education foundation (smeef) and the national science foundation (nsf) have supported efforts to address this issue. this paper describes the manufacturing integrated learning lab (mill), which is an outcome of these efforts. mill is an nsf funded multi-institutional project, whose focus is the development of a hands-on approach to manufacturing education. this offers students skills that directly prepare them for careers in manufacturing, design and product realization. four knowledge areas with corresponding detailed learning outcomes were identified for study namely: (1) drafting/design, (2) manufacturing process, (3) process engineering, and (4) cad/cam. based on these, a core curriculum shared between the partner institutions was developed. this encapsulates the mill manufacturing competency model. assessment instruments to measure student learning were also developed. sample test items were developed for all competencies in a series of internal meetings held among mill project staff. the preliminary results from a field test indicate high levels of student achievement under the mill paradigm, and excellent structure of the assessment instruments.
thermodynamics	the competitiveness of the second-generation bioethanol by biotechnological process requires an effective and quantitative control of biochemical reactions. in this study, the potential of isothermal calorimetry technique to measure heat and kinetics of a non-homogeneous substrate enzymatic hydrolysis is intended. using this technique, optimum temperature of the enzymes used for lignocellulosic molecules hydrolysis was determined. thus, the amount of substrate-to-enzyme ratio was highlighted as an important parameter of the hydrolysis yield. furthermore, a new enzymes' cocktail efficiency consisting of a mix of cellulases and cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) was qualified by this technique. the results showed that this cocktail allowed the production of a high amount of gluconic acid that could improve the attractiveness of these second-generation biofuels. from the set of experiments, the hydrolysis heat of wheat straw was derived and a meaningful value of -32.2 +/- 3.2 j g(-1) (gram reducing sugars product) is calculated. then, isothermal measurements were used to determine kinetic constants of the cellulases and cdh mix on wheat straw. results showed that this enzyme cocktail has an optimal rate at 45 a degrees c in the range of temperatures tested (40-55 a degrees c).
strength_of_materials	membrane structures are very lightweight and highly optimized structures. due to the constant stress state, strength of materials is used optimally. in order to prevent the occurrence of large deformations even for small external loads, membrane structures are designed as a double curved surfaces and are stabilized by applying prestress. minimal surfaces has zero mean curvature and the basic advantage is that the stress at all points and directions is equal and there are no extreme stresses anywhere on the surface. also have minimal area for the given contour, so the weight and amount of material is reduced to minimum, which make them suitable for application in architecture. practical realization involve process of cutting pattern generation, which divide surfaces in parts that are developable surfaces. when patterns are assembled and prestressed they provide three-dimensional surface. ideally, the cutting lines should follow the geodesics lines. we use geodesics as the shortest path between two points on a surface. in the article we give method for finding shortest paths on polygonal representations of surfaces follows continual dijkstra paradigm which, on some conditions, can give improved accuracy on a computer despite the restriction of available memory and execution time.

fluid_mechanics	a large amount of methane releasing from the residual coal and the surrounding pressure-relieved gas bearing strata may accumulate in the longwall gob of gas-bearing coal seam, which is increasingly exploited as a major source of coalbed methane (cbm) development in coal mining areas. meanwhile, if the gob methane emits into the working space along with air-leakage flow, they may impair the safety and productivity of underground coal mines. thus, gob gas drainage is of great significance to both the cbm development and the control of gob gas emission. currently, there exist two major technologies for gob gas drainage gob gas ventholes (ggvs) drainage and underground drainage (such as high-level suction tunnels, high-located boreholes and buried pipes in the upper-corner). in practical engineering applications, the ggvs. have greater advantage over the traditional underground drainage in the extraction flux of gob gas and the control of gob gas emission, but the theoretical mechanism of ggvs has not yet been revealed in previous studies. consequently, the characteristics of gob gas flow with ggvs drainage needs further research. in this paper, the numerical simulation of gas flow in gob gas reservoirs and the in-situ assessment of ggvs drainage are carried out to investigate the mechanism of the control of gob gas flow with ggvs drainage. firstly, based on fluid mechanics in porous media the mathematical model of gob gas transport is developed. then, the gas pressure distribution, gas flow patterns and methane concentration distribution in the gob under the conditions of no drainage measures, drainage with buried pipe in the upper corner and ggvs in different locations are discussed by conducting numerical simulation, respectively. in addition, the influence of distance between ggv and return airway on the gob methane flow and the strong control scope of ggvs are analyzed in detail. it is found that: 1) ggvs has the ""flow-interception effect"" on the gas in the deep zone of the gob and the ""flow-reversal effect"" on the gas in the gob close to the longwall face, which accounts for that ggvs drainage advantage over underground drainage. 2) ggvs can be applied to drain the gas in the deep zone of the gob massively and to control the gob gas migration effectively, so they are a top choice for the extraction of gob gas and the control of gob gas emission. finally, both ggvs drainage and underground drainage are adopted to extract gob gas in east-102 working face in weijiadi coal mine. the comparison of the extracted and emitted volume of gob gas with two different technologies shows that, ggv can drain the gob gas with greater flux and can better control the gob gas emission, which validated the prediction of numerical stimulation.

fluid_mechanics	for thermal mixed-convection flows, the nusselt number is a function of reynolds number, grashof number and the angle between the forced-and natural-convection directions. we consider flow over a heated cylinder for which there is no universal correlation that accurately predicts nusselt number as a function of these parameters, especially in opposing-convection flows, where the natural convection is against the forced convection. here, we revisit this classical problem by employing modern tools from machine learning to develop a general multi-fidelity framework for constructing a stochastic response surface for the nusselt number. in particular, we combine previously developed experimental correlations (low-fidelity model) with direct numerical simulations (high-fidelity model) using gaussian process regression and autoregressive stochastic schemes. in this framework the high-fidelity model is sampled only a few times, while the inexpensive empirical correlation is sampled at a very high rate. we obtain the mean nusselt number directly from the stochastic multi-fidelity response surface, and we also propose an improved correlation. this new correlation seems to be consistent with the physics of this problem as we correct the vectorial addition of forced and natural convection with a pre-factor that weighs differently the forced convection. this, in turn, results in a new definition of the effective reynolds number, hence accounting for the 'incomplete similarity' between mixed convection and forced convection. in addition, due to the probabilistic construction, we can quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. this information-fusion framework is useful for elucidating the physics of the flow, especially in cases where anomalous transport or interesting dynamics may be revealed by contrasting the variable fidelity across the models. while in this paper we focus on the thermal mixed convection, the multi-fidelity framework provides a new paradigm that could he used in many different contexts in fluid mechanics including heat and mass transport, but also in combining various levels of fidelity of models of turbulent flows.
manufacturing_engineering	non-destructive controls particularly, x-rays computed tomography (xr-ct) is a useful tool in manufacturing engineering applications in the modern industry to study the texture deformation of mechanical parts with an efficient way. in manufacturing processes, the relationships between the mechanical properties of the materials and their structure and also their composition are crucial for the design of the mechanical parts because they basically influence the general behaviour of these parts in service conditions. therefore, the great interest of xr-ct is the possibility of viewing with high resolution a transversal plane of an object without destroying the controlled parts. moreover, x-ray tomography supplants the ultra sound by its spatial resolution and by its attenuation measure which are well adapted for the study of the material. this paper gives a comparative study on the new developments in non-destructive controls of the composite materials and applications in the manufacturing engineering and also reviews essentially the performance and advantages of x-rays computed tomography (xr-ct) medical scanner about its usage at multiple scales (macro, micro, meso and nano), the method and also the terminology. subsequently, it will deal with the chosen materials to share the performances of this technique for the very different industrial applications.

materials_engineering	increasingly, it is recognised that the abundant resources of evolutionized biological materials and structures provide an exciting opportunity for growth in the area of materials engineering for impact and projectile resistance. a bio-inspired cellular structural system is developed to contain the radial fracture damage of mortar due to projectile impact through boundary impedance mismatch, while utilizing its adjacent cells as a mutual confining mechanism to improve penetration resistance. the penetration resistance was evaluated on a hexagon cell which is confined mutually by six other identical neighbouring cells in a rigid mould and subjected to a 7.77 g, 8 mm diameter, aisi4140 high strength steel projectile impact at similar to 450 m/s. three cell sizes (50 mm, 70 mm and 90 mm) with two types of cellular interface material (air and silicone) were investigated. these were then compared against monolithically cast mortar control specimens of their respective sizes. it was found that the cellular design was effective in significantly reducing the radial damage for an incoming projectile by up to 26%, with a modest increase in penetration depth of up to 12%. furthermore, specimens with silicon as the cellular interface material demonstrated a 33% reduction in proximal crater damage across all specimen sizes tested, with up to 10% increase in penetration depth. numerical simulations using ls-dyna in 3d quarter-symmetry has also led to better understanding of the physical shockwave interactions modified by a cellular design, allowed verification of the experimental results and supported the authors' explanations of the physical phenomena. overall, penetration depths and crater diameters were within 10% and 20% of the experimental results respectively. this research has useful field applications when extensive radial damage is costly to repair, and penetration resistance is not the most critical consideration.

computer-aided_design	in this study, a new algorithm for discrimination between internal faults and inrush current conditions in power transformers is presented. first, the proposed algorithm removes the pre-fault conditions of the fault currents. then, those currents are processed using the discrete wavelet transform to obtain the wavelet matrix. the correlation matrix is computed from wavelet matrix to know the eigenvalues associated with each frequency scale and to reduce the analysed information. this algorithm, which the authors are going to call wavelet correlation modes, is used to identify inrush and internal fault currents in power transformer. to validate the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out in power systems computer-aided design software, and the obtained signals are analysed in order to evaluate its performance and sensitivity.
strength_of_materials	polyurethane-modified epoxy resin was prepared with polyurethane prepolymer(pup). the effects of the pup content and epoxy resin type on mechanical and thermal properties of materials were discussed. the results indicate that the tensile strength and impact strength of the material increase to maximum successively, and then decrease with the increasing addition of pup. when the mass fraction of pup was 15%, the tensile strength and the impact strength of materials were all the best. there were significant differences in mechanical and thermal properties of material for different epoxy, and the best results were cured epoxy tde-85.
computer-aided_design	we present a novel numerical method to simulate crack growth in 3d, directly from the computer-aided design (cad) geometry of the component, without any mesh generation. the method is an isogeometric boundary element method (igabem) based on non-uniform rational b-splines (nurbs). nurbs basis functions are used for the domain and crack representation as well as to approximate the physical quantities involved in the simulations. a stable quadrature scheme for singular integration is proposed to enhance the robustness of the method in dealing with highly distorted elements. convergence studies in the crack opening displacement is performed for a ""penny-shaped crack and an elliptical crack. two approaches to extract stress intensity factors (sifs): the contour m integral and the virtual crack closure integral are compared using dual integral equations. the results show remarkable accuracy in the computed sifs, leading to smooth crack paths and reliable fatigue lives, without requiring the generation of any mesh from the cad model of the component under consideration.

fluid_mechanics	this paper presents a numerical approximation technique for the boltzmann equation based on a moment-system approximation in velocity dependence and a discontinuous galerkin finite-element approximation in position dependence. the closure relation for the moment systems derives from minimization of a suitable go-divergence. this divergence-based closure yields a hierarchy of tractable symmetric hyperbolic moment systems that retain the fundamental structural properties of the boltzmann equation. the approximation in position dependence is based on the discontinuous galerkin finite-element method. the resulting combined discontinuous galerkin moment method corresponds to a galerkin approximation of the boltzmann equation in renormalized form. the new moment-closure formulation engenders a new upwind numerical flux function, based on half-space integrals of the approximate distribution. we establish that the proposed upwind flux ensures entropy dissipation of the discontinuous galerkin finite element approximation. numerical results are presented for a one-dimensional test case.

thermodynamics	two new zinc(ii)-2-chlorophenylacetate complexes, {[zn(2-cl-c6h4ch2coo)(2)(phen)](2-cl-c6h4ch2cooh)(2), 1 and [zn(2-cl-c6h4ch2coo)(2)(bipy)](2-cl-c6h4ch2cooh)(2), 2} with nitrogen donor ligands, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy), were synthesized and characterized by ir spectroscopy and single crystal diffraction. distorted octahedral geometry was confirmed in both complexes. the compounds were studied for the thermal stabilities using tg and dta methods at different heating rates (283, 288 and 293 k min(-1)). it was found that both the complexes show the same trend in stabilities and thermally degrade in two stages. the apparent activation energies for each step of specific conversions were determined using the doyle-ozawa calculation method according to ictac recommendations. the calculated average activation energies for 1 were found to be 17.52/10.19 j mol(-1) for the first and second stages of degradation, respectively. similarly, for 2 corresponding values for the two-stage degradation were found to be 12.45 and 3.485 j mol(-1). determining the enthalpy value of the activation revealed an exergonic nature of the thermal degradation.
materials_engineering	natural cellulose-based fibers offer low cost, low density composite reinforcement with good strength and stiffness. because of their annual renewability and biodegradability, natural fibers have materialized as environmentally-friendly alternatives to synthetic fibers in the last two decades. they are replacing synthetic materials in some traditional composites in industrial manufacturing sectors such as automotive, construction, furniture, and other consumer goods. in this work, the use of lignocellulosic fibers in green materials engineering, particularly their application as polymeric composite reinforcement and surface treatment via ionizing radiation are reviewed. because these cellulose-based materials are intrinsically hydrophilic, they require surface modification to improve their affinity for hydrophobic polymeric matrices, which enhances the strength, durability, and service lifetime of the resulting lignocellulosic fiber-polymer composites. in spite of a long history of using chemical methods in the modification of material surfaces, including the surface of lignocellulosic fibers, recent research leans instead towards application of ionizing radiation. ionizing radiation methods are considered superior to chemical methods, as they are viewed as clean, energy saving, and environmentally friendly. recent applications of controlled ionizing radiation doses in the formulation of natural fiber -reinforced polymeric composites resulted in products with enhanced fiber-polymer interfacial bonding without affecting the inner structure of lignocellulosic fibers. these applications are critically reviewed in this contribution.
internal_combustion_engine	as oil crisis and environment pollution problem become increasingly prominent, gaseous fuel internal combustion engines (gas engines) have been valued more and more because of the great resources potential and the feature of low pollution of gaseous fuel. however, their average efficiency is just about 30-40% wasting large amount of energy by exhaust, cooling water and so on. therefore, it is an effective way of improving the efficiency to recover waste heat. both the rc (steam rankine cycle) and the orc (organic rankine cycle) are considered as quite suitable methods of whr (waste heat recovery), especially for large engines. as the whr system for a specific large gas engine, rc and orc both have advantages and disadvantages. a gas engine of rated power 1000 kw is the studied object in this paper. according to the characters of its waste heat, the whr systems of rc and orc with different working fluids, including a two-stage organic rankine cycle (dorc) are built in math model and they are compared from the aspects of recovered power, thermal efficiency, system feasibility and so on, which provides a reference for the engineering application. finally, the economic performance of orc, rc and dorc are evaluated and compared.

computer-aided_design	plant three-dimensional (3d) computer-aided design (cad) models typically consist of logical configuration, equipment specifications and ports, and 3d shapes. because 3d cad models are used as master information throughout a plant 's entire lifecycle and many stakeholders are involved in such lifecycle, providing a method for sharing plant 3d cad models among various stakeholders is very important. standard 15926 from the international organization for standardization (iso 15926) is a family of standards that is intended to support the sharing and integrating of all information during the life of a process plant. therefore it is important for iso 15926 to support plant 3d cad models. in order to address this issue, this study investigates a standardized method to exchange plant 3d cad models using iso 15926. information requirements regarding plant 3d cad models are established, and then iso 15926 reference data (classes, attributes, and templates) are extended to cover information requirements. for demonstration of the proposed method, we developed a prototype platform where plant 3d cad models in iso 15926 are loaded and retrieved.

hydraulics	in this study, non-darcian flow to a partially penetrating pumping well in a leaky aquifer was investigated. the aquifer system is composed of a main aquifer with an aquitard bounded on the top of the aquifer. the storage of the aquitard was considered in this study, which is the main contribution of this study. the horizontal flow in the main aquifer is assumed to be non-darcian, while both the vertical flows in the main aquifer and the aquitard were assumed to be darcian due to the relative low velocities. the non-darcian flow was described by the izbash equation. a linearization procedure associated with laplace transform and separate variable method were used to solve the non-darcian flow model. semianalytical solutions (laplace-domain solutions) were obtained then inverted to time domain by using the stehfest method. the results indicated that the power index n in the izbash equation results in a smaller drawdown at late times, the flow approaches quasi steady state earlier, and the leakage has little impact on the drawdowns in the main aquifer when n is larger. the drawdowns are quite different from each other for different z positions even at the same radial distance. the sensitivity analysis indicated that the drawdown in the main aquifer is very sensitive to the power index n, moderately sensitive to the parameters of the main aquifer, and relatively not sensitive to the parameters of the aquitard.

fluid_mechanics	needle valve response to input signal is controlled apart from the dynamics of the driving mechanical actuator - by interaction of fluidic and mechanic aspects. despite the long history and ubiquitous use of needle valves, their aerodynamics has never been really systematically investigated. recent uses for extreme conditions, such as those in the new field of additive manufacturing, put great relevance on accumulating aerodynamic research data. this third part of a trilogy presents results of pressure measurements on internal walls in configurations characterised by rounded needle tip and/or entrance into the exit channel.

thermodynamics	a parametric investigation of radiative heat transfer is carried out, including the effects of conjugate heat transfer between fluid and solid media. the thermal radiation is simulated using the p-1-model. the numerical model and the thermal coupling strategy, suitable for a transient solver, is described. such numerical coupling requires that the radiative equation is solved several times at each iteration; hence, the computational cost of the radiative model is a crucial issue. the p-1-model is adopted because of its particularly fast computation. first, a collection of benchmark cases is presented and used to carefully validate the radiation model against literature results and to analyse the model prediction limits. despite the simplicity of the model, it satisfactorily reproduces the thermal radiation effects. some lack of accuracy is identified in particular cases. second, a number of benchmark cases are described and adopted to investigate fluid-solid thermal interaction in the presence of radiation. three cases are designed, to couple radiation with: pure conduction, conduction and forced convection, conduction and natural convection. in all the cases, the surface radiative heat transfer strongly influences the system thermodynamics, leading to a significant increase of the fluid-solid interface temperature. the main non dimensional numbers, related to the mutual influence of the different heat transfer modes, are introduced and employed in the analyses. a new conduction-radiation parameter is derived in order to study the conductive boundary layer in absence of convective heat transfer.

computer-aided_design	objective: no clinical data are available for the new computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (cad/cam) material zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (zls) ceramic. this study describes preliminary clinical results for indirect zls cad/cam restorations after 12 months. method and materials: indirect restorations were fabricated, using the cerec method and intraoral scanning (cerec omnicam, cerec mcxl). sixty-seven restorations were seated adhesively (baseline). sixty restorations were evaluated after 12 months (follow-up), using modified fdi criteria. two groups were established, according to zls restorations' post-processing procedure prior to adhesive seating: group i (three-step polishing, n = 32) and group ii (fire glazing, n = 28). statistical ana-lysis was performed with mann-whitney u test and wilcoxon test (p.05). statistically significant differences were found for criteria surface gloss for group i and group ii (mann-whitney u test, p <.05). conclusion: this study demonstrates zls cad/cam restorations have a high clinical success rate after 12 months. a longer clinical evaluation period is necessary to draw further conclusions.
computer-aided_design	task-based language learning (tbll) has heavily influenced syllabus design, classroom teaching, and learner assessment in a foreign or second language teaching context. in this english as foreign language (efl) learning environment, the paper discussed an innovative language learning pedagogy based on design education and technical writing. in this tbll course, the language learning based assignments centered on designing and analyzing objects using various computer-aided design software and physical lego toolkit. the design software was used collaboratively and the design analysis was done mostly as group activities. the language production activities centered on technical document authoring, using collaborative online authoring tools for website hosting and note-taking for design projects, besides oral in-class presentations, and online posting in english. language reception activities such as readings related to the course lectures, videos, assignment, and assessment instructions were hosted and linked from moodlethe learning management system. this paper critically analyzed student performance with physical lego design and cad software, including how student groups authored websites detailing the structural and functional specifications related to the product assembly procedure. this paper outlined how design pedagogy could be included in the curriculum while teaching english as a foreign language. in the process, students not only learnt about design fundamentals, but how to author complex technical documents in english. findings based on course data and class interactions have adequately demonstrated that students were capable of handling the task-based language projects with reasonable efficiency and confidence.
thermodynamics	cancer cells are the site of numerous metabolic and thermodynamic abnormalities. we focus this review on the interactions between the canonical wnt/beta-catenin pathway and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar gamma) in cancers and their implications from an energetic and metabolic point of view. in numerous tissues, ppar gamma activation induces inhibition of beta-catenin pathway, while the activation of the canonical wnt/ beta-catenin pathway inactivates ppar gamma. in most cancers but not all, ppar gamma is downregulated while the wnt/beta-catenin pathway is upregulated. in cancer cells, upregulation of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling induces dramatic changes in key metabolic enzymes that modify their thermodynamic behavior. this leads to activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (pdk-1) and monocarboxylate lactate transporter. consequently, phosphorylation of pdk-1 inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdh). thus, a large part of pyruvate cannot be converted into acetyl-coenzyme a (acetyl-coa) in mitochondria and only a part of acetyl-coa can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. this leads to aerobic glycolysis in spite of the availability of oxygen. this phenomenon is referred to as the warburg effect. cytoplasmic pyruvate is converted into lactate. the wnt/beta-catenin pathway induces the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, i.e., myc and cyclin d1. this ultimately promotes the nucleotide, protein and lipid synthesis necessary for cell growth and multiplication. in cancer, activation of the pi3k-akt pathway induces an increase of the aerobic glycolysis. moreover, prostaglandin e2 by activating the canonical wnt pathway plays also a role in cancer. in addition in many cancer cells, ppar gamma is downregulated. moreover, ppar gamma contributes to regulate some key circadian genes. in cancers, abnormalities in the regulation of circadian rhythms (crs) are observed. crs are dissipative structures which play a key-role in far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. in cancers, metabolism, thermodynamics and crs are intimately interrelated.
strength_of_materials	porous magnesium-based materials are biodegradable and promising for use in orthopaedic applications, but their applications are hampered by their difficult fabrication. this work reports the preparation of porous magnesium materials by a powder metallurgy technique using ammonium bicarbonate as spacer particles. the porosity of the materials depended on the amount of ammonium bicarbonate and was found to have strong negative effects on flexural strength and corrosion behaviour. however, the flexural strength of materials with porosities of up to 28 vol.% was higher than the flexural strength of non-metallic biomaterials and comparable with that of natural bone.

fluid_mechanics	water and other liquids can cause production problems for natural gas wells. an established but labour-intensive method for removing these liquids is the use of absorbent foam sticks, which are lowered into the wells and then lifted back up again. this paper presents an automated solution for launching foam sticks down gas wells and recovering them - and without the need for a grid electricity supply. the foam-stick launching apparatus has an enclosed magazine with several chambers. it is controlled by a solar-powered skid-mounted electric-pneumatic control system, which includes a storage battery, time relays, a wireless switch module and a compressed gas supply. a typical water-producing gas well was selected to illustrate the technology. its successful application indicates that engineers can remove liquid from water-producing gas wells and bring them back to production normally using this novel artificial lift technology, which can also be used in remote areas with no electrical supply.
computer-aided_design	in this paper, 3d printing as a novel printing process was considered for deposition of polymers on synthetic fabrics to introduce more flexible, resource-efficient and cost effective textile functionalization processes than conventional printing process like screen and inkjet printing. the aim is to develop an integrated or tailored production process for smart and functional textiles which avoid unnecessary use of water, energy, chemicals and minimize the waste to improve ecological footprint and productivity. adhesion of polymer and nanocomposite layers which were 3d printed directly onto the textile fabrics using fused deposition modeling (fdm) technique was investigated. different variables which may affect the adhesion properties including 3d printing process parameters, fabric type and filler type incorporated in polymer were considered. a rectangular shape according to the peeling standard was designed as 3d computer-aided design (cad) to find out the effect of the different variables. the polymers were printed in different series of experimental design: nylon on polyamide 66 (pa66) fabrics, polylactic acid (pla) on pa66 fabric, pla on pla fabric, and finally nanosize carbon black/pla (cb/pla) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes/pla (cnt/pla) nanocomposites on pla fabrics. the adhesion forces were quantified using the innovative sample preparing method combining with the peeling standard method. results showed that different variables of 3d printing process like extruder temperature, platform temperature and printing speed can have significant effect on adhesion force of polymers to fabrics while direct 3d printing. a model was proposed specifically for deposition of a commercial 3d printer nylon filament on pa66 fabrics. in the following, among the printed polymers, pla and its composites had high adhesion force to pla fabrics.

fluid_mechanics	the past researches on the gas leakage through the clearance seal were studied mainly by the analytical model or numerical simulations using cfd method based on the classical fluid mechanics theory in the conditions of steady laminar flow, incompressible, constant temperature, constant viscosity, and no relative sliding between the inner and outer wall. however, it is widely known that the cfd theory may not be applicable to the micro-size flow. in this paper, the molecular mechanism of the gas leak through the clearance seal was investigated by md (molecular dynamics) simulations. the johnson potential model was used for fe-fe atomic interactions and the uff (universal force field) potential model was used for the atomic interactions between fe he and he he. the gap thickness was varied from 2000 a to 5000 a. the pressure difference over the ends of the gap was from 0.2 mpa to 1.0 mpa. the simulation results show that the leakage rate was proportional to the pressure difference and the gap thickness. during the process of the leakage, the sticky layers were formed on the gap walls. the number density of the atoms in the sticky layer was much larger than that of the central region. and the density of the gas flow of the leakage was much smaller than that of the gas reservoir. the leakage mechanism was mainly due to the diffusion motions of the atoms through the sticky layers although the moving speed of the sticky layers was very slow. the leakage flow rate from the md simulation was quite consistent with that from the analytical calculation.

computer-aided_design	independently adjustable multielectrode arrays are routinely used to interrogate neuronal circuit function, enabling chronic in vivo monitoring of neuronal ensembles in freely behaving animals at a single-cell, single spike resolution. despite the importance of this approach, its widespread use is limited by highly specialized design and fabrication methods. to address this, we have developed a scalable, lightweight, integrated and quick-to-assemble multielectrode array platform. this platform additionally integrates optical fibers with independently adjustable electrodes to allow simultaneous single unit recordings and circuit-specific optogenetic targeting and/or manipulation. in current designs, the fully assembled platforms are scalable from 2 to 32 microdrives, and yet range 1-3 g, light enough for small animals. here, we describe the design process starting from intent in computer-aided design, parameter testing through finite element analysis and experimental means, and implementation of various applications across mice and rats. combined, our methods may expand the utility of multielectrode recordings and their continued integration with other tools enabling functional dissection of intact neural circuits.
computer-aided_design	background: three-dimensional (3d) printing has numerous applications and has gained much interest in the medical world. the constantly improving quality of 3d-printing applications has contributed to their increased use on patients. this paper summarizes the literature on surgical 3d-printing applications used on patients, with a focus on reported clinical and economic outcomes. methods: three major literature databases were screened for case series (more than three cases described in the same study) and trials of surgical applications of 3d printing in humans. results: 227 surgical papers were analyzed and summarized using an evidence table. the papers described the use of 3d printing for surgical guides, anatomical models, and custom implants. 3d printing is used in multiple surgical domains, such as orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, cranial surgery, and spinal surgery. in general, the advantages of 3d-printed parts are said to include reduced surgical time, improved medical outcome, and decreased radiation exposure. the costs of printing and additional scans generally increase the overall cost of the procedure. conclusion: 3d printing is well integrated in surgical practice and research. applications vary from anatomical models mainly intended for surgical planning to surgical guides and implants. our research suggests that there are several advantages to 3d- printed applications, but that further research is needed to determine whether the increased intervention costs can be balanced with the observable advantages of this new technology. there is a need for a formal cost-effectiveness analysis.
hydraulics	groundwater recharge processes, water-rock interaction and the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers of the galilee and eromanga basins in central queensland, australia, were investigated using stable (delta h-2, delta c-18 and (87)sr/sr-86) and radiogenic ((ci)-c-36) isotopes and dissolved methane concentrations, complemented by major ion chemistry. the central eromanga and the upper sequence of the galilee basins are both sub-basins of the great artesian basin (gab), and the coal seams of the galilee basin are currently explored for their potential as commercial coal seam gas deposits. in order to understand the potential influence of depressurisation of coal seams required to release the gas on adjacent aquifers, a detailed understanding of recharge processes and groundwater hydraulics of these basins prior to any development is required. each of the different isotope systems were used in this study to provide different information on specific processes. for example, the assessment of delta c-13 and sr-87/sr-86 ratios suggested that carbonate dissolution is one of the major processes controlling the water chemistry within some aquifers. in addition, the combined assessment of delta h-2, delta o-18 and major ion chemistry indicates that transpiration is the primary process controlling the solute concentration in the gab recharge area, whereas evaporation appears to be less significant. groundwaters in the galilee basin recharge area (outside the limits of the gab) are different to any groundwater within the gab units. this difference is attributed to the dissolution of potassium-bearing micas, which are absent in the gab. groundwater age estimates based on cl-36/cl ratios suggest that there is a steady increase along the flow paths, and this lack of anomalous age estimates from the recharge areas to the deeper parts of the basin indicates that there is no evidence for regional inter-aquifer mixing based in isotopes only. however, dissolved methane concentrations and groundwater chemistry near faults indicates the potential mix of gas and/or water from the coal seams into the gab groundwaters, suggesting that there may be local influence of faults as gas/water conduits.

computer-aided_design	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to provide a new approach involving guidelines and supporting techniques that guarantees all needed space for appropriate product maintenance. design/methodology/approach - the approach is based on two major areas: field survey to understand how maintainability parameter is applied and converge theory and practice into a systematic space claim method using computer-aided design (cad) systems to assure proper maintenance procedures at design stages. findings - case studies from a truck industry conducted following the proposed approach contrast the savings that can be achieved by using a proper space claim for aftermarket needs against an unsuitable level of participation by maintenance personnel during the design development. research limitations/implications - this approach is highly dependent on maintenance experts with suitable skills on cad systems. practical implications - products developed according to the approach envisaged can result in following aspects: lower repair time, better maintenance procedures on key components, easier preventive maintenance, less need for special tools, more ergonomic design, better communication between design and service engineers, simplicity and less complex training. social implications - further research on maintainability will provide new information on how to apply this parameter on product development process (pdp), so design teams can better understand and address this relevant issue. the proposed method has been introduced in the pdp of a major multinational automotive company. originality/value - a new process is presented, considering the protection of needed spaces for maintenance procedures throughout the pdp, diverging to other studies that only propose analysis addressing maintainability at singular point in time during the product development. in just one case study presented, savings of us$1.3m were achieved by applying this space claim approach.
thermodynamics	we report on the theoretical and experimental investigations about the ta-hydride formation depending on the temperature for recycling of ta scraps. the structural investigations based on scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffraction (xrd) showed that the amount of hydrogen incorporated into the ta matrix varied with hydridation temperature. the xrd measurement showed that the h/ta mole ratio in ta-hydride increased with increasing the hydridation temperature up to 700 degrees c and then decreased with increasing the temperature furthermore. depending on the hydridation temperature, various phase of ta-hydride, such as tah0.93 and ta2h were formed and this hydride process was verified by thermodynamic analysis.

strength_of_materials	an innovative blended-learning strategy is presented for the subject laboratory of elasticity and strength of materials, based on the use of different tools combining face-to-face methods with e-learning technologies to improve learning outcomes in mechanical engineering. the enhanced teaching environment includes upgraded teaching material, new self-assessment methods, and video clips providing detailed instructions for each practical session. our challenge was to improve the learning method by changing from a model that simply presents the practical sessions to a model that actively involves students in the learning process. the results of an anonymous student satisfaction survey show that these improvements have been very well received; students consider that the new techniques are very useful both for better understanding the subject and for preparing for the oral exam. rates of success demonstrate that the improvements have had a direct and significant impact on performance, as well as reducing the dropout rate. as an overall conclusion, we can state that all the new techniques are effective tools for improving learning outcomes in the degree in mechanical engineering.
internal_combustion_engine	tri-generation plants will have an important role in the near future in the residential sector where heating and cooling demands come into play throughout the year. depending on the building 's location, the characteristics of its enclosure and its use, the thermal loads and demands will be different. this article analyses and compares a combined cooling, heating and power (cchp) system tested in the laboratory and a single household located in spain. the cooling capacity is obtained using a reversible heat pump where the compressor is driven directly by a gas engine with internal combustion engine (ice) technology. the tests were carried out in a work bench at three different operating speeds. a variable-speed model is developed in the trnsys simulation environment with an operating strategy following the thermal load (ftl). once the micro-cchp system was modeled with experimental data and validated, it was dynamically simulated to analyze its performance in different climatic zones defined in the spanish ""codigo tecnico de la edificacion"" (cte). this study reveals that the micro-cchp system is suitable in mild weathers during the summer season.

hydraulics	the shape of a sediment particle can reveal part of the particle 's transportation history and is a significant variable in sediment transport mechanics. measuring sediment shapes is a difficult and time-consuming task. a whole sample sediment particle shape quantitative analysis method (wsqam) was applied in this research for sediment statistical analysis. the shape parameter was found using sphericity and roundness descriptors: three samples were collected from the middle reach of the yellow river at different depths. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to obtain sediment particles images. the sphericity and roundness descriptors were represented by the particle aspect ratio (ar) and the fourier shape coefficient (fsc). the fourier series approximation matched the particle outlines. from the statistical results of the whole sediment particle sample, as counted by wsqam based on digital image processing, fine sediment particles with smooth surfaces accounted for approximately 80% of all of the observed sediment particles. for the majority of sediment particles, ar was greater than 0.3 and fsc was less than 0.1. when ar was greater than 0.5, fsc exponentially decayed with ar. when ar was less than 0.5, the two parameters, ar and fsc, should be combined to describe the sediment particle shape. the combined use of these two parameters can provide a reference for future sediment-related calculations. the sediment particle shape analysis model, programmed in fortran, was rapid and flexible. it proved efficient to use wsqam for sediment statistical analysis, and the results were found to be accurate.

manufacturing_engineering	china 's electronics industry has seen a significant development in the last decades. the electronics manufacturing industry has become one of the country 's largest industries. many well-qualified researchers and engineers are needed to meet the demands of the microelectronics industry and research. the fast developing electronics industry challenges the conventional university education. how to innovate the education curriculum to provide qualified engineers for the electronics industry is a challenging task for universities. education program on microelectronic packaging and assembly has been established at guet. in this paper, the experiences of establishing the multi-level education program for the microelectronics manufacturing are briefly summarized. a focus is put on the new bachelor 's degree program of microelectronic manufacturing engineering. the objective, scope and curriculum structure of the education program are proposed, which is with an emphasis on the sectors of electronic packaging, assembly and test. this proposal is supported by the fact of the existing huge demands for the qualified engineers in these sectors. to achieve the goal, the core courses for the educational curriculum and educational means are proposed and discussed. further effort to enhance the educational ability is needed.

fluid_mechanics	the laminar boundary layer flow and heat transfer of casson non-newtonian fluid from an inclined (solar collector) plate in the presence of thermal and hydrodynamic slip conditions is analysed. the inclined plate surface is maintained at a constant temperature. the boundary layer conservation equations, which are parabolic in nature, are normalized into non-similar form and then solved numerically with the well-tested, efficient, implicit, stable keller-box finite-difference scheme. increasing velocity slip induces acceleration in the flow near the inclined plate surface. increasing velocity slip consistently enhances temperatures throughout the boundary layer regime. an increase in thermal slip parameter strongly decelerates the flow and also reduces temperatures in the boundary layer regime. an increase in casson rheological parameter acts to elevate considerably the velocity and this effect is pronounced at higher values of tangential coordinate. temperatures are however very slightly decreased with increasing values of casson rheological parameter.
fluid_mechanics	the flow characteristics around the proximal and distal stenoses in tandem vessel models are experimentally investigated with varying flow rates (q=0.25, 0.5,1.0 l/min), interspacing distances (l=3, 6,10 of diameter d) and severities (s=50%, 75% reduction in diameter). when the interspacing l is larger than 10 d, no fluid-dynamic interaction is observed. the flow between the proximal and distal stenoses becomes stabilized (turbulence intensity of <3%) as the interspacing distance decreases. when the severity s is 75%, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs at a flow rate higher than 0.5 l/min, although the interspacing distance l is 3 d. formation of recirculation flow is restricted by the presence of distal stenosis as the interspacing distance decreases. in this case, the flow between the stenoses is focused on the central region. the center-line velocity at the neck of the distal stenosis is approximately 10-15% higher than that of the proximal stenosis with equal severity of s=50%. when the inlet flow is center-focused, the lengths of the recirculation and the jet core behind the distal stenosis increase with decrease in interspacing distance l. when the inlet flow is turbulent, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs early as the interspacing distance l is reduced. when the upstream proximal stenosis exhibits increased severity, the pressure drop is measured to be 20% compared with that when the severity of the downstream distal stenosis is increased at the flow rate of q=1.0 l/min.

hydraulics	the release of water from storage compartments to the transpiration stream is an important functional mechanism that provides the buffering of sudden fluctuations in water potential. the ability of tissues to release water per change in water potential, referred to as hydraulic capacitance, is assumed to be associated with the anatomy of storage tissues. however, information about how specific anatomical parameters determine capacitance is limited. in this study, we measured sapwood capacitance (c) in terminal branches and roots of five temperate tree species (fagus sylvatica l., picea abies l., quercus robur l., robinia pseudoacacia l., tilia cordata mill.). capacitance was calculated separately for water released mainly from capillary (c-i; open vessels, tracheids, fibres, intercellular spaces and cracks) and elastic storage compartments (c-ii; living parenchyma cells), corresponding to two distinct phases of the moisture release curve. we found that c was generally higher in roots than branches, with c-i being 3-11 times higher than c-ii. sapwood density and the ratio of dead to living xylem cells were most closely correlated with c. in addition, the magnitude of c-i was strongly correlated with fibre/tracheid lumen area, whereas c-ii was highly dependent on the thickness of axial parenchyma cell walls. our results indicate that water released from capillary compartments predominates over water released from elastic storage in both branches and roots, suggesting the limited importance of parenchyma cells for water storage in juvenile xylem of temperate tree species. contrary to intact organs, water released from open conduits in our small wood samples significantly increased c-i at relatively high water potentials. linking anatomical parameters with the hydraulic capacitance of a tissue contributes to a better understanding of water release mechanisms and their implications for plant hydraulics.
thermodynamics	the ionic composition of intracellular space is rigorously maintained in the expense of high-energy expenditure. it has been recently postulated that the cytoplasmic ionic composition is optimized so the energy cost of the fluctuations of calcium ion concentration is minimized. specifically, thermodynamic arguments have been produced to show that the presence of potassium ions at concentrations higher than 100 mm reduce extend of the energy dissipation required for the dilution of calcium cations. no such effect has been measured when sodium ions were present in the solution or when the other divalent cation magnesium was diluted. the experimental observation has been interpreted as the indication of the formation of ionic clusters composed of calcium, chloride and potassium. in order to test the possibility that such clusters may be preserved in biological space, the thermodynamics of ionic mixtures dilution in solutions containing albumins and model lipid bilayers have been measured. obtained thermograms clearly demonstrate that the energetics of calcium/potassium mixture is qualitatively different from calcium/sodium mixture indicating that the presence of the biologically relevant quantities of proteins and membrane hydrophilic surfaces do not interfere with the properties of the intracellular aqueous phase.
manufacturing_engineering	purpose - the intention of this research paper is to shed light on the key factors influencing the human resource management (hrm) performance of first tier managers (ftms), and the vital importance that a holistic strategic framework can have in this regard. design/methodology/approach - the research paper uses an up-to-date historical approach and, additionally, draws on detailed case study evidence from an aerospace manufacturing/engineering company via manually and electronically analysed in-depth semi-structured interview and company documentation. findings - the case study findings reveal that the ftm 's hrm performance is greatly influenced by a group of four key factors, and their interrelationships. research limitations/implications - the literature survey was mainly industry-specific (manufacturing), and the sample was restricted to one sector (aerospace), as well as one case study organisation. furthermore, the views of ftms' staff are not directly represented. originality/value - the ftms' hrm role shows no signs of abating, in addition, questions regarding their performance of this role have increasingly emerged. this has become more evident as organisations have continued to expand the ftms' role by devolving greater hrm responsibilities to them, and their performance of the role demonstrates that many ftms are ill equipped to perform their hrm duties to the required standard. however, the vital importance that a holistic strategic framework (which encompasses the four key factors influencing their performance) can have on their performance of this role is not acknowledged. the present research paper, gives an empirical example of a case study, and therefore provides a springboard to address the weakness in the literature.
manufacturing_engineering	one result of globalization is the rapid growth of offshoring, i.e., the outsourcing of functions and jobs to offshore locations. in the usa, offshoring has progressed to the point where it already affects everyday lives, from the cars we drive (of which a large portion of the work and components are outsourced) to computers (which are typically manufactured offshore and shipped back to the usa), to electronic diagnostics (where calls are answered overseas). this phenomenon has implications on our lives and on the jobs that engineers and scientists will assume both now and in the future. further, it is something that all highly developed and even some lesser-developed countries must face. consequently, the growth of outsourcing will have a major impact on the educational objectives of engineering programs and the resultant engineering curricula worldwide. this paper presents recent data on product and job offshore migrations and discusses the various dimensions of this phenomenon. in addition to the potential loss of engineering and other high-end technical jobs, sociological and cultural aspects, intellectual property issues, strategic planning concerns, and macro-economic issues are presented. for example, the effects of offshoring on the societal fabric of the countries that are recipients of manufacturing and service center outsourcing, such as china and india, are significant, rapid, and controversial. offshoring has also begun to change the way that engineering programs in these countries educate their students. in addition, intellectual property issues create a major risk to companies considering outsourcing to certain less-developed countries. these issues can be broadly categorized into: the robustness and strength of intellectual property laws, and the degree to which these laws are implemented and enforced. further, such factors as currency fluctuations and geo-political conditions can substantially impact outsourcing decisions and profitability. the phenomenon of offshoring, which is now affecting engineering careers, will play a major role in shaping engineering education worldwide. the next generation of engineers will need to possess the ability to work seamlessly across cultures, have outstanding communication skills and be familiar with the principles of project management, logistics, and systems integration. some educational models that begin to address these requirements will be presented.

machine_design	electromagnetic design of a 1.12-mw, 18 000-r/min high-speed permanent-magnet motor (hspmm) is carried out based on the analysis of pole number, stator slot number, rotor outer diameter, air-gap length, permanent magnet material, thickness, and pole arc. the no-load and full-load performance of the hspmm is investigated in this paper by using 2-d finite element method (fem). in addition, the power losses in the hspmm including core loss, winding loss, rotor eddy current loss, and air friction loss are predicted. based on the analysis, a prototype motor is manufactured and experimentally tested to verify the machine design.
fluid_mechanics	we explore the two-dimensional flow around a circular cylinder with the aim of elucidating the changes in the topology of the vorticity field that lead to the formation of the karman vortex street. specifically, we analyse the formation and disappearance of extremal points of vorticity, which we consider to he feature points for vortices. the basic vortex creation mechanism is shown to he a topological cusp bifurcation in the vorticity field, where a saddle and an extremum of the vorticity are created simultaneously. we demonstrate that vortices are first created approximately 100 diameters downstream of the cylinder, at a reynolds number, re-k, which is slightly larger than the critical reynolds number, r-ecrit approximate to 46, at which the flow becomes time periodic. for re slightly above re-k, the newly created vortices disappear again a short distance further downstream. as re is further increased, the points of creation and disappearance move rapidly upstream and downstream, respectively, and the karman vortex street persists over increasingly large streamwise distances.
internal_combustion_engine	in this paper, a small remote area which is located in nigeria has been considered as a model to be tested by a managing scheme for providing both electricity and water. in this strategy, the groundwater is pumped into a water tank which can be later used for supplying required irrigation and drinking water. a pat (pump as turbine) is used as a hybrid system for supplying electricity and water as well as storing water in the water tank. also, a pv (photovoltaic plant), a package of batteries (bat) in addition to a diesel ice (internal combustion engine) are used and optimized along with the best size of devices and managing system, with the purpose of obtaining the maximum economical operating strategy. in this paper, two cases are considered to assess the effectiveness of the system under study. firstly, all of the mentioned devices are used to show how internal combustion engine system dominates all the other components due to the low cost of fuel. in the second case, all renewable resources have been exploited and optimized in order to make a 100% renewable system with least possible cost. having about 53 variables makes this problem very complicated which requires to be solved by an algorithm with more accuracy. therefore, a mgsa (modified gravitational search algorithm) with an adapted mutation tactic is used to find the best cost and management strategy. in the first case, although the cost of diesel oil is very low, by using the pat, about 5% of diesel oil consumption is reduced. in the second case, in order to make a 100% renewable system, the size of pv is enlarged approximately 16 times in comparison with the first case. the hybrid pv-pat storing structure is capable to deliver the water for irrigation and domestic requirements as well as 9% of the electricity needed for the rural community.

fluid_mechanics	under investigation in this paper is a fifth-order korteweg de vries type (fkdv-type) equation with time-dependent coefficients, which can be used to describe many nonlinear phenomena in fluid mechanics, ocean dynamics and plasma physics. the binary bell polynomials are employed to find its hirota 's bilinear formalism with an extra auxiliary variable, based on which its n-soliton solutions can be also directly derived. furthermore, by considering multi-dimensional riemann theta function, a lucid and straightforward generalization of the hirota riemann method is presented to explicitly construct the multiperiodic wave solutions of the equation. finally, the asymptotic properties of these periodic wave solutions are strictly analyzed to reveal the relationships between periodic wave solutions and soliton solutions.
machine_design	biomass for bioproducts and bioenergy can be sourced from multiple sources. there is little information on commercial planting operations for willow biomass crops in north america. the objectives of this study were to evaluate the field capacities of two commercial machines (step and egedal energy planter) planting willow crops in northern new york state, determine the amount and distribution of delays. a study was conducted to evaluate planter activities. the two machines had similar mean field capacities (c-f) ranging from 0.89 to 1.14 ha h(-1). above-average rainfall in the later part of the planting season decreased cf by over 20% for the step planter from 1.14 to 0.91 ha h(-1); largely due to delays in the headlands. approximately 70% of the total delay time associated with the step planter consisted of long-duration delays (>5 min) compared to 35% for the egedal. quality of planting stock was an issue for operations; undersized stems resulted in feeding issues. several potential factors were identified for improved planting operations: loading stems and clearing feeding mechanisms at each turn, improved planting stock and quality control, improving machine design for wet conditions, and improved preparation for in-field repairs. in-field delays should be minimized to reduce demand on the crew and ensure a more uniform crop is established in the field.

hydraulics	previous thermohydraulic studies performed for the iter tf, cs and pf magnet systems have brought some important information on the detection and consequences of a quench as a function of the initial conditions (deposited energy, heated length). even if the temperature margin of the correction coils is high, their behavior during a quench should also be studied since a quench is likely to be triggered by potential anomalies in joints, ground fault on the instrumentation wires, etc. a model has been developed with the supermagnet code (bagnasco et al., 2010) for a side correction coil (scc2) with four pancakes cooled in parallel, each of them represented by a thea module (with the proper cable in conduit conductor characteristics). all the other coils of the pf cooling loop are hydraulically connected in parallel (top/bottom correction coils and six poloidal field coils) are modeled by flower modules with equivalent hydraulics properties. the model and the analysis results are presented for five quench initiation cases with/without fast discharge: two quenches initiated by a heat input to the innermost turn of one pancake (case 1 and case 2) and two other quenches initiated at the innermost turns of four pancakes (case 3 and case 4). in the 5th case, the quench is initiated at the middle turn of one pancake. the impact on the cooling circuit, e.g. the exceedance of the opening pressure of the quench relief valves, is detailed in case of an undetected quench (i.e. no discharge of the magnet). particular attention is also paid to a possible secondary quench detection system based on measured thermohydraulic signals (pressure, temperature and/or helium mass flow rate). the maximum cable temperature achieved in case of a fast current discharge (primary detection by voltage) is compared to the design hot spot criterion of 150 k, which includes the contribution of helium and jacket.

computer-aided_design	this article describes the computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (cad/cam) accuracy of dental drill guides for application in guided surgery. today, the availability of three-dimensional (3d) desktop printers allows for the cost-effective production of drill guides by dental laboratories. our investigations show the accuracy of produced guides by eliminating influencing factors that exist in the guided surgery workflow. to investigate this accuracy, a method was developed to evaluate the cad/cam production technology apart from sources of error from cone beam computed tomography (cbct) scans, intraoral scans, software or human error. by using a cad/cam-milled idealized reference model, as well as cad data from a scanned dental model with integrated reference spheres, drill guides with different offset values were designed using the codiagnostix r implant-planning software. the bone level roxolid r slactive r implant system (length 8 mm, diameter 3.3 mm) was chosen. the virtual position in relation to both the drill guide and the reference model was determined based on the planning data and exported stl files, respectively. virtual and physical measurements were performed through the center coordinates of the used drill sleeves (t-sleeve: 5 mm), by applying a defined reference coordinate system (rcs) of the dental model. drill guide templates were printed using a fotodent r guide on a dental desktop printer (d30), based on a defined digital workflow. after insertion of the respective drill sleeves, surgical guides were secured on the reference models using quadrangular fixation, thus allowing a tactile measurement by applying a coordinate measurement device for determination of physical position relation. through the central points of the drill sleeves, both the coronal and apical points of the planned implant drilling as well as angular deviation were calculated and reviewed against the cad measurements. on average, a deviation of 0.25 degrees of the planned implant was detected.
hydraulics	the north-eastern region of india, although rich in land and water resources, often suffers from a water-scarce situation particularly during the non-rainy season. the steep terrain conditions do not support conventional irrigation systems and therefore micro-irrigation system needs to be promoted. in micro-irrigation systems, maintaining uniformity of application is necessary to achieve a satisfactory crop yield. maintaining the system hydraulics is a challenge due to the terrain conditions and equipment available. a study was conducted to observe various uniformity parameters of selected emitters at five different operating pressures, viz. 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 kg cm(-2). in the study it was observed that the discharge variation of the selected emitters was between 8.7 and 39.7%. the uniformity coefficient varied from 0.9 to 16.6, where the distribution uniformity and statistical uniformity varied from 81.1 to 99.1% and 83.4-99.1% respectively. the emitter flow variation ranged from 0.03 to 0.49 in the range of 0.51.5 kg cm(-2). the emitter exponent indicated that the values ranged from 0.20 to 0.55. all these values were far from the manufacturer 's value. from the study we can interpret that the emitting system needs to be tested before adoption in the field to ensure uniformity of water application. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
thermodynamics	a new model for interface problems with capillary effects in compressible fluids is presented together with a specific numerical method to treat capillary flows and pressure waves propagation. this new multiphase model is in agreement with physical principles of conservation and respects the second law of thermodynamics. a new numerical method is also proposed where the global system of equations is split into several submodels. each submodel is hyperbolic or weakly hyperbolic and can be solved with an adequate numerical method. this method is tested and validated thanks to comparisons with analytical solutions (laplace law) and with experimental results on droplet breakup induced by a shock wave.

manufacturing_engineering	the purpose of this study is to investigate the shock attenuation properties of long pile synthetic turf. to investigate these properties using a modeling and simulation method, an appropriate model based on reliable data and a precise identification method is required. in previous studies, unstable data were often observed because uneven top yarns had sprouted from the infill material. therefore, the properties of the infill part, buried yarns and infill materials should be considered first, because sprouted yarn causes unstable shock attenuation. for this reason, special construction specimens with different hardness levels and which had almost no sprouted yarn were prepared, and multi-intensity multi-area impact tests and parameter identification were performed for each specimen. the results show that stable data could be acquired for parameter identification, and the findings indicate the applicability of the modeling and simulation method for evaluating the shock attenuation properties of long pile synthetic turf.

internal_combustion_engine	the selective catalytic reduction (scr) of nitrogen dioxide in an air flow modeling the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine is studied. granulated v2o5 (13.5%)-mno2 (0.7-1.0%)/al2o3 powder (avk-10m catalyst) and ammonia injected into a scr catalytic cell are used as a heterogeneous catalyst of no2 reduction and a reducing agent, respectively. if the efficiency of no2 removal is high enough and satisfies the requirements of the state sanitary standards for the maximum permissible concentrations of substances emitted into the atmosphere ( = 0.085 mg/m(3)), the reducing agent (ammonia) is not completely consumed during scr, so a considerable amount of nh3 can be released into the atmosphere. therefore, a strict control of both no2 and unreacted ammonia emissions is needed. the dependences of the concentrations of [nh3] and [no2] on the [nh3]/[no2] ratio for the model air flow passed through the avk-10m granular heterogeneous catalyst are measured. it is found that the maximum degree of removal of no2 from the air takes place at [nh3]/[no2] = 1.3. in the conventional process, the concentration of [no2] drop from 530.00 to 0.07 mg/m(3), i.e., below the . at the same time, the ammonia concentration increases to [nh3] = 3.4 mg/m(3), which becomes 85 times the , 0.04 mg/m(3). to remove unreacted ammonia from air flows, we developed [p-(so3 (-))(2) center dot me2+] sulfocationites, where me are the cu and/or ca ions, p is a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. it is shown that the concentration of ammonia passed through the adsorption cell filled with a freshly sulfocationite drops below = 0.04 mg/m(3). the dependences of the dynamic exchange capacity (dec) before ammonia breakthrough for the [p-(so3 (-))(2) center dot cu2+] delta-sulfocationite on the air flow rate, [nh3] concentration, and humidity are measured. the maximum value of the dec, delta = 59.5 mg/cm(3), is observed at an air flow velocity of 2.171 m/s, [nh3] = 0.0035 mg/l, and 75% humidity. to illustrate practical applications of the proposed improved scr method, it is shown that a 3-l replaceable [p-(so3 (-))(2) center dot cu2+] sorbent cartridge in a scr exhaust gas purifier for a car internal combustion engine does not need replacement more frequently than every 50000 km.
computer-aided_design	an engineering design process consists of a sequence of creative, innovative and routine design tasks. routine tasks address well-known procedures and add limited value to the technical improvement of a product. even if they may require a lot of work. in order to focus designers work on added value tasks, the present work aims at supporting a routine task with a design archetype (da). a da captures, stores and reuses the design knowledge with a tool embedded in a cad software. the da algorithms drive the designer in selecting the most effective design concept to deliver the project requirements and then embody the concept through configuring a cad model. finally, a case study on the definition of a da tool for gear design demonstrates the effectiveness of the da tool.
thermodynamics	deleuze 's use of thermodynamics in the fifth chapter of his masterwork difference and repetition ushers in perhaps the most crucial notion for understanding this work: intensity. given that the process of actualisation relies on the intensive necessarily means that any discussion of the relationship between the virtual and the actual must include a thorough explanation of the role of intensity, and where exactly this notion sits within the virtual-actual doublet. as such, we must return to the fifth chapter of difference and repetition in order to assess the way in which deleuze conceives of this complex and indispensable cog in his ontological and metaphysical philosophy. in this paper we turn, then, to deleuze 's engagement with the theories of the intensive as found in classical thermodynamic theory. quite simply, deleuze will highlight the way in which the productive force of differences in intensity remains under-appreciated in contrast to the extensive states they create in this classical framework. we can understand this engagement, then, as an example of the way in which the extensive is continually privileged over the intensive. in this paper we will outline the details of the engagement between deleuze and thermodynamics, as this paves the way for his own philosophy of intensity. furthermore, we will provide a theory of the relationship between intensity, the virtual and the actual as these notions appear in difference and repetition
fluid_mechanics	this paper discusses the findings from a measurement campaign on a rotating wind turbine blade operating in the free atmosphere under realistic conditions. a total of 40 pressure sensors together with an array of 23 usable hot-film sensors (based on constant temperature anemometry) were used to study the behavior of the boundary layer within a specific zone on the suction side of a 30m diameter wind turbine at different operational states. a set of several hundreds of data sequences were recorded. some of them show that under certain circumstances, the flow may be regarded as not fully turbulent. accompanying computational fluid mechanics (cfd) simulations suggest the view that a classical transition scenario according to the growth of so-called tollmien-schlichting did not apply. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
computer-aided_design	a semi-empirical approach to model the temperature effects on i-v characteristics of carbon nanotube field effect transistors (cntfets) is proposed. the model includes two thermal parameters describing cntfet behaviour in terms of saturation drain current and threshold voltage, whose values are extracted from the simulated and trans-characteristics of the device in different temperature conditions. our results are compared with those of a numerical model online available, obtaining i-v characteristics comparable but with a lower cpu calculation time.
hydraulics	forward quantification of simulation (code) response uncertainties requires knowledge of physical model parameter uncertainties. nuclear thermal-hydraulics codes, such as relap5 and trace, do not provide any information on uncertainties of physical model parameters. a framework is developed to quantify uncertainties of physical model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation (mle), bayesian maximum a priori (map), and markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) algorithms. the objective of the present work is to perform the sensitivity analysis of the physical model parameters in code trace and calculate their uncertainties using mle, map, and mcmc algorithms. the oecd/nea bwr full-size fine-mesh bundle test (bfbt) data is used to quantify uncertainty of selected physical models of trace code. the bfbt is based on a multi-rod assembly with measured data available for single or two-phase pressure drop, axial and radial void fraction distributions, and critical power for a wide range of system conditions. in this work, the steady-state cross-sectional averaged void fraction distribution is used as the input data for inverse uncertainty quantification (iuq) algorithms, and the selected physical model 's probability distribution function (pdf) is the desired output quantity.

thermodynamics	in einstein-aether theory, violating lorentz invariance permits some super-luminal communications, and the universal horizon can trap excitations traveling at arbitrarily high velocities. to better understand the nature of these universal horizons, we first modify the ray tracing method, and then use it to study their surface gravity in charged einstein-aether black hole spacetime. instead of the previous result by cropp et al., our results show that the surface gravity of the universal horizon is dependent on the specific dispersion relation, kuh = 2(z - 1) k(uh)/z, where z denotes the power of the leading term in the superluminal dispersion relation, characterizing different species of particles. and the associated hawking temperatures also are different with z. these findings, which coincide with those derived by the tunneling method, provide some full understanding of black hole thermodynamics in lorentz-violating theories.
thermodynamics	the kinetics of solid-liquid extraction of bioactive adenosine and cordycepin from the mycelia of c. sinensis cs1197 was studied. hot water extraction was carried out at temperature 70, 80 and 90 degrees c and ph 3, 4 and 5 and mechanism of extraction was studied by applying fick 's diffusion and empirical models. akaike information criterion (aic) was employed for selection of the best model among candidate models. based on aic, the parabolic diffusion model was found to be the best among competitive models with high r-2 value. diffusion coefficient for adenosine and cordycepin extraction were 1.06 x 10(-12)-2.13 x 10(-12) and 1.06 x 10(-12)-2.85 x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) respectively. thermodynamic analysis of the process revealed that extraction of adenosine and cordycepin is feasible, endothermic and spontaneous at ph 4 and temperature 70 degrees c.

hydraulics	the optimum economic sizing of a water distribution network has been focus of study for many researches and projectors, and represent a relevant part of sanitation programs. but, by now, the known works approaches only the implantation cost, considering that the pipes have biggest heavy in the project. so, the problem is reduced to sizing pipes which objective is reach a cheaper network and satisfying the minimum hydraulic prerequisites. this leads to the choice of a network with pipes of minor diameters since this choice satisfies the hydraulics restrictions. new in brazil by now, our approach consider too the maintenance cost throughout life span of network. it because, if in one way the larger diameters are more expensive, in an other, it are more resistant to break and to rugosity effects. this leads to a network of minimum maintenance cost throughout its life span. then, we reach the equilibrium between the implantation cost and the maintenance cost.
machine_design	electric machines with concentrated winding and single tooth design provide a cost effective way to use flat wires. hereby high filling factors can be achieved, but due to geometric constraints and the influence of current displacements there remains unused space inside the slot. this space can be used for water cooling channels. as a result of the small thermal resistance between winding and cooling fluid this leads to an outstanding cooling performance. compared to round wires efficiency is improved in wide parts of the operating area. the absence of the cooling jacket leads to comparable production costs but an even more compact machine design. technological aspects are discussed and a particular high-power-density interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (ipmsm) with water jacket cooling and round wires is compared to a flat wire wound, slot cooled motor by the use of fem and cfd simulations and measurements on single tooth specimen.
thermodynamics	a cross-linked polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (poss) nanohybrid is synthesized through schiff base chemistry by using octa-amino poss as building blocks and glutaraldehyde as dual functional reagent. the obtained nanohybrid is characterized by ft-ir, solid-state si-29 nmr, sem, tem, tga and n2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, and the results demonstrate the successful cross-linkage between poss molecules, forming block-like irregular nanoparticles with a specific surface area of 42.8 m(2) g(-1). as a novel solid-phase adsorbent, cross-linked poss nanohybrid exhibits selective adsorption properties for acidic dyes, i.e., methyl orange (mo) in the present case. the strong electrostatic interactions between mo species and the nanohybrid are the main driving forces for mo adsorption. the kinetic data are well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. the adsorption isotherm studies demonstrate that the data are well fit with langmuir model at 293 k and a maximum adsorption capacity of 237.5 mg g(-1) is obtained. thermodynamic studies indicate that the adsorption of mo is spontaneous and exothermal, along with reduced randomness. the adsorbed mo species could be effectively recovered by using methanol/naoh (9/1, viv, 0.1 mol l-1 naoh) as eluent. the practical application for textile wastewater treatment demonstrates that cross-linked poss nanohybrid appears to be a promising material in dye removal field.

fluid_mechanics	we present petiga, a code framework to approximate the solution of partial differential equations using isogeometric analysis. petiga can be used to assemble matrices and vectors which come from a galerkin weak form, discretized with non-uniform rational b-spline basis functions. we base our framework on petsc, a high-performance library for the scalable solution of partial differential equations, which simplifies the development of large-scale scientific codes, provides a rich environment for prototyping, and separates parallelism from algorithm choice. we describe the implementation of petiga, and exemplify its use by solving a model nonlinear problem. to illustrate the robustness and flexibility of petiga, we solve some challenging nonlinear partial differential equations that include problems in both solid and fluid mechanics. we show strong scaling results on up to 4096 cores, which confirm the suitability of petiga for large scale simulations.

internal_combustion_engine	in this study, the experiments aimed at analyzing thermally the exhaust valve in an air-cooled internal combustion engine and estimating the thermal contact conductance in fixed and periodic contacts. due to the nature of internal combustion engines, the duration of contact between the valve and its seat is too short, and much time is needed to reach the quasi-steady state in the periodic contact between the exhaust valve and its seat. using the methods of linear extrapolation and the inverse solution, the surface contact temperatures and the fixed and periodic thermal contact conductance were calculated. the results of linear extrapolation and inverse methods have similar trends, and based on the error analysis, they are accurate enough to estimate the thermal contact conductance. moreover, due to the error analysis, a linear extrapolation method using inverse ratio is preferred. the effects of pressure, contact frequency, heat flux, and cooling air speed on thermal contact conductance have been investigated. the results show that by increasing the contact pressure the thermal contact conductance increases substantially. in addition, by increasing the engine speed the thermal contact conductance decreases. on the other hand, by boosting the air speed the thermal contact conductance increases, and by raising the heat flux the thermal contact conductance reduces. the average calculated error equals to 12.9%.
thermodynamics	to further investigate the porosity evolution during selective laser melting (slm) inconel 718 alloy, a transient mesoscale model with a randomly packed powder-bed has been proposed by finite volume method (fvm), taking consideration of the phase transition, variation of thermo-physical properties and interfacial force. the thermodynamics within molten pool and resulting porosity evolution behavior of a set of laser scanned tracks with various laser scanning speeds were studied using numerical approach. the results evidently revealed that the operating peak temperature was reduced obviously as increasing the scanning speeds. accordingly, the high cooling rate, short lifespan and limiting depth of pool and small velocity of molten liquid flow were obtained under a high scanning speed. scanning speed played a crucial role in determining the type of porosity in the terminally slm-processed inconel 718 components. at a high scanning speed of 500 mm/s, the top surface was primarily dominated by open porosity, accompanying with large-sized inter-layer porosity on the cross section, due to a limiting energy input penetrated into the powder-bed and incomplete melting of powder. by contrast, as a relatively low scanning speed of 200 mm/s was employed, the top surface appeared to be smooth free of less metallurgical porosity and no apparent inter-layer porosity on the cross section surface attributing to the escaping of porosity, indicating an well metallurgical bonding of the neighboring layer towards the building direction. simultaneously, the physical mechanism was thoroughly discussed. the simulated distribution of porosity was found to be consistent with the experimental measurements.
thermodynamics	by the use of thermodynamics formalism of irreversible processes, complex systems theory and systems biology, it is derived a relationship between the production of entropy per unit time, the fractal dimension and the tumor growth rate for human tumors cells. the thermodynamics framework developed demonstrates that, the dissipation function is a landau potential and also the lyapunov function of the dynamical behavior of tumor growth, which indicate the directional character, stability and robustness of the phenomenon. the entropy production rate may be used as a quantitative index of the metastatic potential of tumors. the current theoretical framework will hopefully provide a better understanding of cancer and contribute to improvements in cancer treatment.

materials_engineering	one of the requirements for achieving faster cmos electronics is to mitigate the unacceptably large chip areas required to steer heat away from or, more recently, toward the critical nodes of state-of-the-art devices. thermal-guiding (tg) structures can efficiently direct heat by ""meta-materials"" engineering; however, some key aspects of the behavior of these systems are not fully understood. here, we demonstrate control of the thermal-diffusion properties of tg structures by using nanometer-scale, cmos-integrable, graphene-on-silica stacked materials through finite-element-methods simulations. it has been shown that it is possible to implement novel, controllable, thermally based boolean-logic and spike-timing dependent plasticity operations for advanced (neuromorphic) computing applications using such thermal-guide architectures.
thermodynamics	the aggregation of three different cyclodextrins (cds): 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (hp-b-cd), 2hydroxypropyl- g-cyclodextrin (hp-g-cd) and sulfobutylether-b-cyclodextrin (sbe-b-cd) was studied. the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of these three cds is quite similar and is situated at ca. 2% (m/v). there was only a small difference in the cac values determined by dls and 1h nmr. dls measurements revealed that cds in solution have three size populations wherein one of them is that of a single cd molecule. the size of aggregates determined by tem appears to be similar to the size of the aggregates in the second size distribution determined by dls. isodesmic and k-2-k self-assembly models were used for studying the aggregation process of hp-b-cd, hp-g-cd and sbe-b-cd. the results showed that the aggregation process of these cds is a cooperative one, where the first step of aggregation is less favorable than the next steps. the determined thermodynamic parameters showed that the aggregation process of all three cds is spontaneous and exothermic and it is driven by an increase of the entropy of the environment.

computer-aided_design	in this paper, the authors present a polarisation dependent analytical model for dc, radio frequency (rf) and linearity characteristics of a proposed lattice-matched alinn/aln/gan metal-oxide-semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (moshemt). the developed model includes charge controlled analysis derived from triangular potential well approximation along with the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarisation effects. the model accurately predicts the threshold voltage, two-dimensional electron gas sheet charge density, drain current, transconductance and cut-off frequencies for different samples of gate dielectric materials such as sio2, hfo2 and al2o3 over a full range of gate and drain bias. a detailed analysis of the linearity characteristics by investigating the key figure-of-merit metrics such as second-order voltage intercept point, third-order voltage intercept point, third-order input intercept point and third-order intermodulation distortion are performed for different gate dielectric thicknesses of 5, 7 and 10 nm. the accuracy of the model results is verified against silvaco technology computer aided design numerical simulation results and found to be satisfactory. it is observed that by careful tuning the device parameters such as dielectric constant and dielectric thickness, lattice-matched alinn/aln/gan moshemt can considerably improve the device performance and suitable for high performance low distortion rf applications.
thermodynamics	to establish an adequate thermodynamic model for the mechanism of formation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) corrosion products, theoretical and experimental studies were combined in this work. the corrosion products of api x60 pipeline steel formed under different h2s corrosion conditions were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. a thermodynamic model was developed to clarify the environmental boundaries for the formation and transformation of different products. presumably, a dividing line with a negative slope existed between mackinawite and pyrrhotite. using experimental data presented in this study combined with previously published results, we validated the model to predict the formation of mackinawite and pyrrhotite on the basis of the laws of thermodynamics. the established relationship is expected to support the investigation of the h2s corrosion mechanism in the oil and gas industry.
computer-aided_design	due to the increasing adoption of immediate implantation strategies and the rapid development of the computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing technology, a therapeutic concept based on patient-specific implant dentistry has recently been reintroduced by many researchers. however, little information is available on the designs of custom-made dental implant systems, especially their biomechanical behavior. the influence of the custom-made implant designs on the biomechanical performance for both an immediate and a delayed loading protocol in the maxillary esthetic zone was evaluated by means of the finite element (fe) method. fe models of three dental implants were considered: a state of the art cylindrical implant and two custom-made implants designed by reverse engineering technology, namely a root-analogue implant and a root-analogue threaded implant. the von mises stress distributions and micro-motions around the bone-implant interfaces were calculated using ansys software. in a comparison of the three implant designs for both loading protocols, a favorable biomechanical performance was observed for the use of root-analogue threaded implant which approximated the geometry of natural anterior tooth and maintained the original long-axis. the results indicated that bone-implant interfacial micro-motion was reduced and a favorable stress distribution after osseointegration was achieved.
machine_design	this paper introduces a new electric machine for front-end accessory drive (fead) of hybrid electric vehicles (hevs). the novelty of the electric machine lies in its ability to perform multitasking. besides the independent motor or independent generator operation like any other electric machine, the proposed machine is able to run as motor and generator simultaneously. a dual winding electric machine forms the core part of the proposed system. windings of the electric machine are concentrated type so that electrical and magnetic isolation is maintained. this allows simultaneous motoring and generating operation in the single housing of electric machine. design considerations of the proposed electric machine have been outlined in the paper. comparison between proposed and conventional approaches has been made to highlight potential benefits of the new approach. thermal analyses have been performed to show the suitability and limits of the multitasked electric machine in the hev applications. overall performance of the proposed machine is presented by experimental results.

materials_engineering	metallurgical processes have been traditionally taught as extractive metallurgy of various metals. some 30 years ago the field of process metallurgy was advanced via the special attention given to the analysis and design of metallurgical processes on the basis of understanding and controlling the governing transport phenomena and kinetics. the above paradigm has served well graduates from metallurgical engineering programs in countries with strong metals producing industries like canada. over the past 10-15 years, however we have witnessed the total transformation of metallurgy programs to materials science and engineering programs. design and production of new advanced materials on the basis of processing-structure-property-performance relationships became the new paradigm. it is in this new context that teaching and research in extraction and processing is discussed in this article written on the occasion of the ralph lloyd harris memorial symposium.
strength_of_materials	in this paper, an attempt has been made to extend application of the recently proposed flexural constitutive model to short- and long-term deformational analysis of flexural partially prestressed concrete members. the proposed calculation technique is applied in a simple engineering technique based on principles of strength of materials and the layered approach. the effect of tension stiffening and non-linear time effects of creep and shrinkage are taken into account. effective modulus method is used for modeling of long-term deformations. short- and long-term deformation (curvatures) prediction results were tested against experimental data of partially prestressed concrete beams reported in the literature.
machine_design	recent experiments on the asdex upgrade tokamak aim at improving the physics base for iter and demo to aid the machine design and prepare efficient operation. type i edge localized mode (elm) mitigation using resonant magnetic perturbations (rmps) has been shown at low pedestal collisionality (nu(*)(ped) < 0.4). in contrast to the previous high nu* regime, suppression only occurs in a narrow rmp spectral window, indicating a resonant process, and a concomitant confinement drop is observed due to a reduction of pedestal top density and electron temperature. strong evidence is found for the ion heat flux to be the decisive element for the l-h power threshold. a physics based scaling of the density at which the minimum p-lh occurs indicates that iter could take advantage of it to initiate h-mode at lower density than that of the final q = 10 operational point. core density fluctuation measurements resolved in radius and wave number show that an increase of r/l-te introduced by off-axis electron cyclotron resonance heating (ecrh) mainly increases the large scale fluctuations. the radial variation of the fluctuation level is in agreement with simulations using the gene code. fast particles are shown to undergo classical slowing down in the absence of large scale magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) events and for low heating power, but show signs of anomalous radial redistribution at large heating power, consistent with a broadened off-axis neutral beam current drive current profile under these conditions. neoclassical tearing mode (ntm) suppression experiments using electron cyclotron current drive (eccd) with feedback controlled deposition have allowed to test several control strategies for iter, including automated control of (3,2) and (2,1) ntms during a single discharge. disruption mitigation studies using massive gas injection (mgi) can show an increased fuelling efficiency with high field side injection, but a saturation of the fuelling efficiency is observed at high injected mass as needed for runaway electron suppression. large locked modes can significantly decrease the fuelling efficiency and increase the asymmetry of radiated power during mgi mitigation. concerning power exhaust, the partially detached iter divertor scenario has been demonstrated at p-sep/r = 10 mw m(-1) in asdex upgrade, with a peak time averaged target load around 5 mw m(-2), well consistent with the component limits for iter. developing this towards demo, full detachment was achieved at p-sep/r = 7 mw m(-1) and stationary discharges with core radiation fraction of the order of demo requirements (70% instead of the 30% needed for iter) were demonstrated. finally, it remains difficult to establish the standard iter q = 10 scenario at low q(95) = 3 in the all-tungsten (all-w) asdex upgrade due to the observed poor confinement at low beta(n). this is mainly due to a degraded pedestal performance and hence investigations at shifting the operational point to higher beta(n) by lowering the current have been started. at higher q(95), pedestal performance can be recovered by seeding n-2 as well as cd4, which is interpreted as improved pedestal stability due to the decrease of bootstrap current with increasing z(eff). concerning advanced scenarios, the upgrade of ecrh power has allowed experiments with central ctr-eccd to modify the q-profile in improved h-mode scenarios, showing an increase in confinement at still good mhd stability with flat elevated q-profiles at values between 1.5 and 2.
internal_combustion_engine	commercial vehicles are a common mode of transport employed in the urban freight transport. normally, they are internal combustion engine (ice) vehicles powered by burning fossil fuels. however, with deteriorating air quality and decreasing energy resources, ice vehicles are experiencing a significant transition. electric commercial vehicles (ecvs) as a feasible alternative to alleviate emissions and save energy resources are proposed in the field of urban freight transport. nevertheless, with the increasing intention of adopting ecvs, the number of employed ecvs is lower than ice vehicles and electric passenger cars. therefore, this paper reviewed and analyzed 25 related articles to collect factors affecting the employment. furthermore, we classified the factors into the three pillars of sustainability with integrating technological dimension. the results illustrate the influence of positive factors and negative factors on the employment. the future work will focus on ranking the priorities of factors and suggesting the logistics company to consider ecvs in their fleets thereby improving the adoption and the sustainable urban freight transport.
machine_design	electric machines are a key component of electric/hybrid electric vehicle (ev/hev) powertrains. thus, computationally efficient models for electric machines are essential for powertrain-level design, simulation, and optimization. in this paper, a finite-element-based method for quickly generating torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric machines is presented. first, magnetostatic finite-element analysis (fea) is conducted on a "" base"" machine design. this analysis produces torque, normalized losses, flux linkage, and the maximum magnetic field intensity in the permanent magnets for a wide range of currentmagnitudes and phase angles. these values are then scaled based upon changing the size of the machine and the effective number of turns of the machine windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine designs and their corresponding efficiency maps using postprocessing techniques. results suggest that, by avoiding resolving the fea for the scaled designs, the proposed techniques can be used to quickly generate efficiency maps, and thus are useful for ev/hev powertrain-level simulation and optimization.
fluid_mechanics	testicular compartment syndrome (tcs) refers to the impairment of microcirculation in the testicle due to either increased venous resistance or extraluminal compression, which leads to hypoxia. tcs releases oxidants through hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion injury (iri). the pathophysiology, etiology, evaluation, and management of tcs are reviewed. based on the properties of tcs, specific causes, e.g., varicocele, hydrocele, orchitis, cryptorchidism, and scrotal hernia, are suggested and categorized. the oxidant-induced stress from tcs may explain the correlations between these causes and infertility. a chief shortcoming of current imaging modalities is that they detect tcs late after it has progressed to impair the macrocirculation of the testicle. we propose frequent sequential periodic power doppler ultrasonography to monitoring for earlier detection. intraoperatively, tcs can be diagnosed by the dull purple appearance of a hypoxic testicle and by tissue pressures above 30 mmhg. when compartment pressure is low, the underlying etiology must be promptly treated. during acute presentation, an incision of the resilient tunica albuginea may be necessary. a great challenge of treating tcs is restoring microcirculation while minimizing iri; concomitant antioxidant therapy secondary to treatment may be effective and harmless at the least. because testicular oxidant stress is common in infertility and since tcs can cause such a stress, tcs may be a larger factor in infertility than currently suspected.
manufacturing_engineering	target is a collaborative project involving a partnership of universities and institutes of higher education in uk, ireland, norway, finland and sweden. the project will develop tools to enhance capacity in regional manufacturing companies to adapt and embrace new technologies and innovation. this is to be done in collaboration with small/medium sized manufacturing engineering companies - developing, applying and piloting the tools through individual companies' processes. the toolbox developed will consist of subsets such as digital manufacturing (robotics and simulation), new ideas and thinking (human centred and environmental thinking, competitiveness), business models and modern product innovation. on completion of the project, the toolbox of supports will be made available for use through open access to manufacturing companies. the initial project phase with development of a toolbox suitable for use in all the project partners' regions is presented.
thermodynamics	antimony (sb), which can be toxic at relatively low concentrations, may co-exist with mn(ii) and/or fe(ii) in some groundwater and surface water bodies. here we investigated the potential oxidation and adsorption pathways of sb (iii and v) species in the presence of mn(ii) and mn-oxidizing bacteria, with or without fe(ii). batch experiments were conducted to determine the oxidation and adsorption characteristics of sb species in the presence of biogenic mn oxides (bmos), which were formed in-situ via the oxidation of mn(ii) by a mn-oxidizing bacterium (pseudomonas sp. qjx-1). results indicated that sb(iii) ions could be oxidized to sb(v) ions by bmo, but only sb(v) originating from sb(iii) oxidation was adsorbed effectively by bmo. introduced fe(ii) was chemically oxidized to feooh, the precipitates of which mixed with bmo to form a new compound, biogenic fe-mn oxides (bfmo). the bmo part of the bfmo mainly oxidized and the feooh of the bfmo mainly adsorbed the sb species. in aquatic solutions containing both as(iii) and sb(iii), the bfmo that formed in-situ preferentially oxidized sb over as but adsorbed as more efficiently. chemical analysis and reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the presence of fe(ii), as(iii) and sb(iii) accelerated the oxidation of mn(ii) but inhibited the activity of mn-oxidizing bacteria. these results provide significant insights into the biogeochemical pathways of sb, mn(ii) in aquatic ecosystems, with or without fe(ii).

hydraulics	critical heat flux (chf) is important to thermal-hydraulics design and safety analysis. in the purpose to validate the chf data acquired from ls-thtf of npic, experimental investigation on repeatability of the chf data is carried out with full length non-uniform axial heat flux distribution rod bundle. the repeatability of the chf data from ls-thtf itself is examined by comparing the data from the same run but different time and data from different runs. the rod bundle powers of chf data acquired under well controlled parameters are directly compared with reference measured data from htrf of columbia university. the rod bundle power ratio of chf data is employed to describe the repeatability of chf data from ls-thtf to htrf, and the variations of power ratio with inlet and outlet parameters show a reasonable trend. the point to point differences of chf power between the two facilities of every single point are found to be within 5%. the result demonstrates good repeatability between data from ls-thtf and data from htrf. ls-thtf is capable of acquiring reliable and repeatable chf data to verifying thermal-hydraulics performance of pwr fuel assemblies.

materials_engineering	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to numerically solve the problem of steady mixed convection boundary layer flow past a vertical flat plate embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium filled by a nanofluid. the non-darcy equation model along with the mathematical nanofluid model proposed by tiwari and das (2007) has been used. design/methodology/approach - using appropriate similarity transformations, the basic partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations. these equations have been solved numerically for different values of the nanoparticle volume fraction, the mixed convection and the non-darcy parameters using the bvp4c function from matlab. a stability analysis has been also performed. findings - numerical results are obtained for the reduced skin-friction, heat transfer and for the velocity and temperature profiles. the results indicate that dual solutions exist for the opposing flow case (lambda<0). the stability analysis indicates that for the opposing flow case, the lower solution branch is unstable, while the upper solution branch is stable. in addition, it is shown that for a regular fluid (phi=0) a very good agreement exists between the present numerical results and those reported in the open literature. research limitations/implications - the problem is formulated for three types of nanoparticles, namely, copper (cu), alumina (al2o3) and titania (tio2). however, the paper present results here only for the cu nanoparticles. the analysis reveals that the boundary layer separates from the plate. beyond the turning point it is not possible to get the solution based on the boundary-layer approximations. to obtain further solutions, the full basic partial differential equations have to be solved. practical implications - nanofluids have many practical applications, for example, the production of nanostructured materials, engineering of complex fluids, for cleaning oil from surfaces due to their excellent wetting and spreading behavior, etc. social implications - nanofluids could be applied to almost any disease treatment techniques by reengineering the nanoparticle properties. originality/value - the present results are original and new for the boundary-layer flow and heat transfer past a vertical flat plate embedded in a porous medium saturated by a nanofluid. therefore, this study would be important for the researchers working in porous media in order to become familiar with the flow behavior and properties of such nanofluids.

thermodynamics	adsorption behavior of unstable proteins, i.e., bovine serum albumin and (alpha)-lactalbumin, has been studied on a hydrophobic interaction chromatography medium under mass overloading conditions at different kosmotropic salt concentrations in the mobile phase. a mechanistic model has been formulated and used to describe kinetics and thermodynamics of protein interactions with the adsorbent surface. the model assumed two-site binding adsorption and reversible protein unfolding, which allowed predicting the inhibition of protein unfolding at high column loadings. a simplified procedure for the determination of model parameters has been developed, which was based on the inverse method. the model was successfully used to reproduce the pattern of chromatographic elution as well as the course of breakthrough curves. the model formulation was supported by nano differential scanning fluorimetry measurements, which were exploited to determine the protein stability in the liquid and adsorbed phases at different column loadings and salt concentrations.

fluid_mechanics	hydrodynamic performance of the marine mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis, is studied with time-resolved particle image velocimetry. we evaluated inhalant flow, exhalant jet flow, suction performance and flow control capabilities of the mussels quantitatively. inhalant flow structures of mussels are measured at the coronal plane for the first time in literature. nutrient fluid is convected into the mussel by three-dimensional sink flow. inhalant velocity reaches its highest magnitude inside the mussel mantle while it is accelerating outward from the mussels. we calculated pressure gradient at the coronal plane. as inhalant flow approaches the mussel shell tip, suction force generated by the inhalant flow increases and becomes significant at the shell tip. likewise, exhalant jet flow regimes were studied for 17 mussels. mussels can control their exhalant jet flow structure from a single potential core region to double potential core region or vice versa. peak exhalant jet velocity generated by the mussels changes between 2.77 cm s(-1) and 11.1 cm s(-1) as a function of mussel cavity volume. measurements of hydrodynamic dissipation at the sagittal plane revealed no interaction between the inhalant and exhalant jet flow, indicating energy-efficient synchronized pumping mechanism. this efficient pumping mechanismis associated with the flow-turning angle between inhalant and exhalant jet flows, similar to 90 degrees (s.d. 12 degrees).
fluid_mechanics	quantitative evaluation of the shear threshold on c. tinctorius l. cell growth is vital for bioreactor system design and optimization of scaled-up industrial cultivation. the present research focused on investigating the effects of shear force on c. tinctorius l cell growth by computational fluid dynamic (cfd) analysis in shaken flasks. the results revealed that specific cell growth rates were greatly inhibited as the shear force increased from 1.17 to 2.42 pa. recovery of viability and aggregation diameter to their normal levels could be implemented after a 4-day adaptation with large fluctuations in physiological state. with further correlation analysis on shear force and c. tinctorius l. growth rate, a threshold value was identified at an average and maximum shear stress of approximately 0.55 pa (0.06 w/kg) and 4.00 pa (0.93 w/kg) according to the influence on cell growth. quantitative data on shear effects can facilitate the design of industrial processes and lead to more rational scale-up in industrial c. tinctorius l cultivation.

internal_combustion_engine	three connecting bolts fractured, which were assembled on the fan used in the internal combustion engine. detailed fractographic study and metallurgical analysis were focused on the fractured bolts. fractographic and metallurgical studies indicate that the fracture surface and the microstructure of three bolts exhibit similar features. the fatigue fracture is the main failure mechanism of the bolts. appearance of the micro-cracks in the thread tip of the fractured bolts makes the stress at the thread regions increase intensively so that the fatigue cracks initiated from the thread regions. due to the presence of dynamic load, the bolts were never properly tightened during installation which should be responsible for the formation of the cracks.
strength_of_materials	in the present study, new quaternary mgy1.65zn0.74al0.53 and mgy3.72zn1.96al0.45 alloys (wt.%) were synthesized employing the disintegrated melt deposition (dmd) casting technique followed by hot extrusion. microstructural characterization revealed the presence of 14h long-period stacking ordered structure (lpso) and mg4y2znal3 phases aligned along the direction of extrusion in both alloys. refined grains (= 20 mu m) in the extruded microstructures. compared to monolithic mg, significant increase in the microhardness (similar to 67-88%), tensile yield strength (similar to 245-290%) and ultimate tensile strength (similar to 113-144%) were observed in the mg-y-zn-al alloys. despite the significant increase in strength of materials, failure strains of both mg-y-zn-al alloys were comparable to monolithic mg. ignition temperatures of both mg-y-zn-al alloys were found to outperform commercially available az31, az80 and we43 (high-temperature) mg alloys, and the highest ignition temperature of 770 degrees c was achieved in the mgy3.72zn1.96al0.45 alloy.

materials_engineering	a new open-source project evaluation tool, entitled the materials engineering tetrahedron (met), has been developed to determine the economic viability of materials design, selection, processing, and validation costs associated with any infrastructure-based project. met improves project design by providing an economic perspective to the traditional materials science tetrahedron, relating microstructure, processing, property, and performance through the introduction of value-based economic costs for each side of the tetrahedron. the resulting size and distortion, from a regular tetrahedron illustrates the balance between the system, component, or material fabrication project detailed. the met model also allows for increased budget efficiency and the potential for improved identification of cost saving mechanisms. the use of financial tools, such met, will aid engineering project management by providing easy and reliable metrics to compare projected costs versus desired outcomes. expansion and use of these types of tools will reduce risks during the initial stages of project design. to illustrate the strength of met, several example tetrahedra were generated demonstrating the various uses and applications of this new program.
computer-aided_design	new advanced manufacturing technologies under the alias of additive biomanufacturing allow the design and fabrication of a range of products from pre-operative models, cutting guides and medical devices to scaffolds. the process of printing in 3 dimensions of cells, extracellular matrix (ecm) and biomaterials (bioinks, powders, etc.) to generate in vitro and/or in vivo tissue analogue structures has been termed bioprinting. to further advance in additive biomanufacturing, there are many aspects that we can learn from the wider additive manufacturing (am) industry, which have progressed tremendously since its introduction into the manufacturing sector. first, this review gives an overview of additive manufacturing and both industry and academia efforts in addressing specific challenges in the am technologies to drive toward am-enabled industrial revolution. after which, considerations of poly(lactides) as a biomaterial in additive biomanufacturing are discussed. challenges in wider additive biomanufacturing field are discussed in terms of (a) biomaterials; (b) computer-aided design, engineering and manufacturing; (c) am and additive biomanufacturing printers hardware; and (d) system integration. finally, the outlook for additive biomanufacturing was discussed.

strength_of_materials	in the high speed sliding electrical contact with large current, the temperature of contact area rises quickly under the coupling action of the friction heating, the joule heating and electric arc heating. the rising temperature seriously affects the conductivity of the components and the yield strength of materials, as well affects the contact state and lead to damage, so as to shorten the service life of the contact elements. therefore, there is vital significance to measure the temperature accurately and investigate the temperature effect on damage of rail surface. aiming at the problem of components damage in high speed sliding electrical contact, the transient heat effect on the contact surface was explored and its influence and regularity on the sliding components damage was obtained. a kind of real-time temperature measurement method on rail surface of high speed sliding electrical contact is proposed. under the condition of 2.5 ka current load, based on the principle of infrared radiation non-contact temperature sensor was used to measure the rail temperature. the dynamic distribution of temperature field was obtained through the simulation analysis, further, the connection between temperature changes and the rail surface damage morphology, the damage volume was analyzed and established. finally, the method to reduce rail damage and improve the life of components by changing the temperature field was discussed.
computer-aided_design	composite resin blocks for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) applications have recently become available. however, cad/cam composite resins have lower wear resistance and accumulate more plaque than cad/cam ceramic materials. we assessed the effects of sio2-nanocomposite film coating of four types of cad/cam composite resin blocks: cerasmart, katana avencia block, lava ultimate, and block hc on surface hardness and bacterial attachment. all composite blocks with coating demonstrated significantly greater vickers hardness, reduced surface roughness, and greater hydrophobicity than those without coating. adhesion of streptococcus mutans to the coated specimens was significantly less than those for the uncoated specimens. these reduced levels of bacterial adherence on the coated surface were still evident after treatment with saliva. surface modification by sio2-nanocomposite film coating has potential to improve wear resistance and susceptibility to plaque accumulation of cad/cam composite resin restorations.
thermodynamics	this study aimed to investigate the formation of three inclusion complexes of laccaic acid a (the main component of the lac dye, named as la) with beta-cyclodextrin(beta-cd), methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (m -beta-cd), or (2-hydroxyethyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (hp -beta-cd), exploring particularly the effects of cds on the solubility of la and the binding ability of the final inclusion coitiplexes. lac dye, a natural colorant, had been widely used in food and textile industry. because of its low water solubility, the application of this nontoxic dye was restricted. this study employed beta-cyclodextrin and its derivatives to encapsulate the hydrophobic part of la and resolve the aforementioned limitation. the binding constants (k-c) and solubility of la were determined with the three beta-cds using the phase-solubility method, which followed the rank order of hp-beta-cd>m -beta-cd >beta-cd. the inclusion interactions between la and,beta-cds were detected using the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and h-1 nuclear magnetic resonance. moreover, the scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope were applied to characterize the appearance of the inclusion complexes. this study would provide a useful approach for obtaining novel la-based products with high water solubility and low toxicity.

hydraulics	elevated forest mortality has been attributed to climate change-induced droughts, but prediction of spatial mortality patterns remains challenging. we evaluated whether introducing plant hydraulics and topographic convergence-induced soil moisture variation to land surface models (lsm) can help explain spatial patterns of mortality. a scheme predicting plant hydraulic safety loss from soil moisture was developed using field measurements and a plant physiology-hydraulics model, trees. the scheme was upscaled to populus tremuloides forests across colorado, usa, using lsm-modeled and topographymediated soil moisture, respectively. the spatial patterns of hydraulic safety loss were compared against aerial surveyed mortality. incorporating hydraulic safety loss raised the explanatory power of mortality by 40% compared to lsm-modeled soil moisture. topographic convergence was mostly influential in suppressing mortality in low and concave areas, explaining an additional 10% of the variations in mortality for those regions. plant hydraulics integrated water stress along the soil-plant continuum and was more closely tied to plant physiological response to drought. in addition to the well-recognized topo-climate influence due to elevation and aspect, we found evidence that topographic convergence mediates tree mortality in certain parts of the landscape that are low and convergent, likely through influences on plant-available water.
materials_engineering	the mechanical design of biological materials has generated widespread interest in recent years, providing many insights into their intriguing structure property relationships. a critical characteristic of load-bearing materials, which is central to the survival of many species, is their wear and abrasion tolerance. in order to be fully functional, protective armors, dentitious structures and dynamic appendages must be able to tolerate repetitive contact loads without significant loss of materials or internal damage. however, very little is known about this tribological performance. using a contact mechanics framework, we have constructed materials selection charts that provide general predictions about the wear performance of biological materials as a function of their fundamental mechanical properties. one key assumption in constructing these selection charts is that abrasion tolerance is governed by the first irreversible damage at the contact point. the maps were generated using comprehensive data from the literature and encompass a wide range of materials, from heavily mineralized to fully organic materials. our analysis shows that the tolerance of biological materials against abrasion depends on contact geometry, which is ultimately correlated to environmental and selective pressures. comparisons with experimental data from nanoindentation experiments are also drawn in order to verify our predictions. with the increasing amount of data available for biological materials also comes the challenge of selecting relevant model systems for bioinspired materials engineering. we suggest that these maps will be able to guide this selection by providing an overview of biological materials that are predicted to exhibit the best abrasion tolerance, which is of fundamental interest for a wide range of applications, for instance in restorative implants and protective devices.

internal_combustion_engine	due to marked differences of material properties and combustion characteristics between hydrogen and carbon-based fuels, an increased heat flux inside the cylinder of hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines occurs. the present study aims for a simulation model that describes the wall heat transfer within the entire range of engine calibration possibilities. conducted experiments on a hydrogen engine equipped with temperature sensors provide the base for the present study. using the surface temperature method, highly resolved instantaneous surface heat fluxes can be identified. these measurements are compared with results from published heat transfer models that are originally developed for conventional fuels. as no satisfying result with these models can be obtained for the hydrogen engine, a modified heat transfer model is derived and validated based on the experimental data. necessary developments on characteristic model features lead to a distinctive model for a hydrogen engine. it is demonstrated that the proposed model attains a consistently high prediction quality for a broad range of engine calibration variabilities.

fluid_mechanics	objectives/hypothesisthis study aimed to investigate and measure airway dynamics in anatomical regions where laryngeal cancer was most common in comparison to other regions of the larynx, thereby determining the effect of airway dynamics on the development of laryngeal cancer. study design and methodspulmonary function test airflow data and larynx anatomy measurement data obtained by three-dimensional computed tomography. a healthy male adult was modeled by simulation using the ansys program. analysis of air flow rates, pressure, and force were also made. resultsthe supraglottic region average pressure was higher when compared to the subglottic region and clearly lower when compared to the glottic region. the subglottic had the lowest pressure and force levels. the glottic region was the first ranked location for laryngeal cancer; the supraglottic region was the second; and the frequency of laryngeal cancer was much lower in the subglottic region. our data suggests that the high pressure and force contribute to an increased amount of contact and interaction between toxic particles and mucosa and to increased diffusion of the particles, leading to an increased carcinogenic effect and frequency of cancer. conclusionlaryngeal cancer was found more frequently in regions with an increased pressure and force stress and reduced air velocity, with a subsequent increase in penetration of the inhaled toxic agents. these findings demonstrate the importance of basic physical fluid mechanics in cancer pathogenesis. level of evidencena. laryngoscope, 126:1136-1142, 2016
manufacturing_engineering	tolerances play an important role in modem manufacturing engineering and impact significantly the quality of a product and machining cost. in conventional methods, tolerances design is divided into two separate sequential stages i.e. product tolerance design and process tolerance design. this sequential tolerances design method would result in some problems in cooperation, continuity, and consistency between two separate design stages. a more rational approach in tolerance design is concurrent tolerancing which consolidate the two sequential design stages into one. in this paper, a genetic algorithm (ga) is used for concurrent tolerance design based on manufacturing cost and quality loss. a practical example is used to illustrate the design process. the calculation results by using ca are compared with those by conventional nonlinear optimization method.
internal_combustion_engine	the performance, efficiency and emissions of internal combustion (ic) engines are affected by the thermo-viscous boundary layer region and heat transfer. computational models for the prediction of engine performance typically rely on equilibrium wall-function models to overcome the need for resolving the viscous boundary layer structure. the wall shear stress and heat flux are obtained as boundary conditions for the outer flow calculation. however, these equilibrium wall-function models are typically derived by considering canonical flow configurations, introducing substantial modeling assumptions that are not necessarily justified for in-cylinder flows. the objective of this work is to assess the validity of several model approximations that are commonly introduced in the development of wall-function models for ic-engine applications. this examination is performed by considering crank-angle resolved high-resolution micro-particle image velocimetry (a mu-piv) measurements in a spark-ignition direct-injection single cylinder engine. using these measurements, the performance of an algebraic equilibrium wall-function model commonly used in rans and les ic-engine simulations is evaluated. by identifying shortcomings of this model, a non-equilibrium differential wall model is developed and two different closures are considered for the determination of the turbulent viscosity. it is shown that both wall models provide adequate predictions if applied inside the viscous sublayer. however, the equilibrium wall-function model consistently underpredicts the shear stress if applied in the log-layer. in contrast, the non-equilibrium wall model provides improved predictions of the near-wall region and shear stress irrespective of the wall distance and the piston location. by utilizing the experimental data, significant adverse pressure gradients due to the large vortical motion inside the cylinder (induced by tumble, swirl and turbulence) are observed and included in the non-equilibrium wall model to further improve the model performance. these investigations are complemented by developing a consistent wall heat transfer model, and simulation results are compared against the equilibrium wall-function model and woschni 's empirical correlation.
hydraulics	sediment transport is an important aspect of soil erosion, and sediment transport capacity (t-c) is a key to establishing process -based erosion models. a lot of studies exist that have determined t-c for overland flow, however, few studies have been conducted to determine t-c for loess sediments on steep slopes. experimental data for this region are thus needed. the objectives of this study are to formulate new equations to describe t-c and evaluate the suitability of these equations for loess sediments on steep slopes. the slope gradients in this study ranged from 10.51% to 38.39%, and flow discharges per unit width varied from 1.11 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) to 3.78 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). results showed that 11 increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope gradient, with r-2 = 0.99 and nash -sut(c)liffe model efficiency (nse) = 0.99. t, was more sensitive to flow discharge than slope gradient. t-c increased as a power function with mean flow velocity, which was satisfied to predict t-c with r-2 = 0.99 and nse = 0.99. shear stress (r2 = 0.89, nse = 0.88) was also a good predictor of t-c, and stream power (r-2 = 0.96, nse = 0.96) was a better predictor of t-c than shear stress. however, unit stream power was not a good predictor to estimate t-c in our study, with r-2 = 0.63 and nse = 0.62. these findings offer a new approach for predicting t-c for loess sediments on steep slopes. 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
manufacturing_engineering	there are many ways to achieve knowledge. the experience presented in this paper is one that describes the knowledge achievement process thru knowledge models - in this case using concept maps. the subject of the experiment was to design a knowledge model on a technical subject: turning. the project participants were the students of the terminal year from the engineering faculty of sibiu, lucian blaga university. especially the technical field is one in which knowledge (information interpreted with a result) are hard to reach because of the important quantity of information which in the absence of the right connections made between them they remain raw dates, difficult to understand, hard to integrate in a real technical context in order to solve a given problem.
hydraulics	tree-rings are precious natural archives to assess ecosystem variability over time. xylem anatomy in woody tissue is a promising source of information in tree-rings since it is closely linked to tree hydraulics and carbon fixation. however, despite the rising interest for cell anatomy in dendrochronology, still little is known about the interpretation of the variability of cell anatomical responses observed across different environments and species. here we analyze cell anatomical responses to increasing summer drought on 18 trees from 3 conifer species (picea obovata, pinus sylvestris, and larix sibirica) growing in the transition zone between forest and steppe in the republic of khakassia (russia). analyses include the comparison of tracheid size distributions along climatic gradients and contrasting micro-topography from 1986 to 2008. results indicate an overall decrease of earlywood tracheid lumen and cell wall thickness to high temperature and drought regardless of species and site conditions. in particular an increase of one degree celsius during the summer caused up to 5% reduction of earlywood cell lumen and wall thickness. these anatomical shifts suggest that a downscaling of hydraulic efficiency is not paralleled by increased hydraulic safety, presumably due to carbon limitation. based on the results of this case study, we suggest that increasing drought stress might hamper the formation of a functional xylem structure, thus being a possible trigger for a miss-acclimation causing long-term decline and higher exposure to hydraulic failures. despite the promising study approach, more studies including more data (trees, years) and broader climatic gradients would be needed to further improve our mechanistic understanding.

hydraulics	this study aims to understand (mainly qualitatively) the long-term role of human impact on avulsion processes and the development of fluvial (mega-) fans in semi-arid environments. in this paper we refer to human impact as the direct influences of actions on the river 's hydraulics (i.e. flow regulation, flow diversion and channel engineering). in five case-studies drawn from the khuzestan plains in southwest iran we have analysed the setup and triggering conditions of specific avulsions that occurred in the past (timescale of millennia) and identified the role of human interference in their causation. our analysis is based on the integration of historical, archaeological, geomorphological and geological data. through this study we demonstrate that avulsions in the khuzestan plains are the result of long-term and complex interplay between multiple human-induced and natural causes. in similar ways human-induced actions may play important roles during different phases of avulsion development. the success of an avulsion in the post-triggering phase may be defined by human-induced setup causes as well as morphodynamic processes. we suggest that present-day flood events may be partly inherited from long-term human alterations of the natural processes. these finding could have implications for any fluvial system (e.g. distributive fluvial systems, deltas) where avulsion plays a major role in their development and research tends to emphasize on natural mechanisms. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
machine_design	the flow of muck and cuttings in the face, cutterhead, cutting chamber, and screw conveyor determines the pressure profile of the excavated soil as well as its impact on the wear of the related components in a soft ground tunneling machine. this paper discusses the use of computational fluid dynamic (cfd) to simulate the flow characteristic of the conditioned soil in the screw conveyor of earth pressure balance (epb) tunnel boring machine. in this simulation, conditioned soil assumed to behavior as a bingham plastic fluid. back analysis method in conjunction with cfd modeling is used to calculate the rheological properties of soil from a set of known screw conveyor torque read outs from a machine operating in seattle, wa. the error of the torque values between the simulation results and actual field data is in the range of 0.1-6.2%. this illustrate that the cfd method can simulate the soil movement in the screw conveyor of epb machines. the results also indicates that the same approach can be used to optimize the machine design to minimize torque and wear as well as optimizing machine operating parameters during the tunneling operation to improve productivity and have a better control of the face pressure.

thermodynamics	coco peat powder (cpd), the main by-product of the coconut palm, is an excellent source of environmentally friendly magnetic sorbent with potential application in oil-spill cleanup. in order to develop the best resource for the agricultural crop and alleviate environmental stress caused by disposal of natural cpd, fe3o4 nanoparticles were immobilized on coco peat powder (cpd) with the aid of mussel-inspired polydopamine (pda) and then chemically modified by low-surface-energy octadecylamine (oda) to fabricate a novel magnetic coco peat powder (mcpd) for selective oil-water separation. the obtained mcpi), which had high hydrophobicity (water contact angle: 135 +/- 3 degrees) and saturation magnetization of 27.6 emu/g, exhibited remarkable sorption efficiency for convenient removal of oils from water and displayed excellent separating performance under an auxiliary magnetic field. the results indicated that the highest amount of oil sorption on mcpd reached 8.57 times of its own weight, and the oil could be desorbed from the oil-loaded mcpd and easily recycled for at least 11 cycles. the oil-loaded mcpd also exhibited high recyclability, with a loss of less than 15.32% in oil-sorption capacity after 11 cycles, which suggests that the mcpd prepared through the proposed synthesis process has high potential for application in large-scale removal of spilled oils from water. this work also provides a universal strategy for developing an oil-pollution treatment using natural resources from the waste stream.

internal_combustion_engine	this paper seeks to examine the characteristics and importance of the heat transfer phenomena in combustion chamber walls. in-cylinder pressure and combustion chamber wall temperature (tw) were measured under motored and fired conditions in a spark-ignition (si) engine. parameters were measured at a constant engine speed (1,500rpm), at different ignition timings, and same phi=1.0, separately for lpg, gasoline, or hydrogen. cooling loss and heat release were investigated with different heat transfer equations for all three fuels. also, the cooling loss of hydrogen was compared with fossil fuels to investigate the differences in heat transfer. the values for a correction constant required for each fuel were determined using different heat transfer equations. the findings of this study suggest that the proposed model has better prediction results than eichelberg 's heat transfer coefficient equation and burnt 's specific heat ratio equation for all ignition timings and fuels.

machine_design	particle swarm optimization (pso) and genetic algorithms (ga) are used to minimize the cost of a permanent magnet (pm) synchronous generator with concentrated windings for tidal power applications. with the use of matlabs global optimization toolbox, it is possible to run several optimization algorithms on the same problem, and to combine the two stochastic solvers ga and pso with the gradient based solver fmincon to produce two hybrid optimization solvers. it has been shown that a complex machine design problem with tight constraints and a narrow solution space is difficult to solve for both a ga and for pso. both ga and pso were unable to find the optimal value on their own. hybrid versions of ga and pso gave better results. the average minimum costs found with hybrid pso and hybrid ga were 1.07 and 1.11 times the global minimum. when the integer value was set to the optimal value, the hybrid ga found a mean cost only 1.01 times the global minimum. for both algorithms, it was necessary to increase the population size to improve the fitness functions and reduce the variance.
computer-aided_design	exploratory research was performed on a promising safety intervention concept, prevention through design (ptd), also known as designing for construction safety (dfcs). the overall research goal was to increase understanding of the role that owners of constructed facilities can play in adopting ptd on their capital projects. a total of 65 face-to-face interviews and 79 anonymous surveys were completed at four case-study organizations in addition to 103 surveys completed online by members of national construction associations and organizations. industry survey data indicate that while the majority of owner firm employees had not heard of ptd, they find the concept compelling and do not anticipate significant barriers to its implementation. key empirical findings indicate that (1) an explicit ptd process is required for implementation; (2) proactive owner leadership and involvement are necessary to initiate ptd on a project; (3) owner leadership is required both to set high expectations for worker safety and health and to ensure general contractor and trade contractor personnel participation in the design review process; and (4) supporting tools, such as design checklists, four dimensional (4d) computer-aided design (cad) systems, and risk identification and assessment documents, facilitate the ptd process. these findings can be used by owners to most effectively implement a ptd program on one or more of their projects.

fluid_mechanics	predicting the final embedment depth of a dynamically installed anchor is a key prerequisite for reliable calculation of anchor capacity. this paper investigates the embedment characteristics of dynamically installed anchors in normally consolidated and overconsolidated clay through a series of centrifuge tests involving a model anchor instrumented with a microelectric mechanical system (mems) accelerometer, enabling the full motion response of the anchor to be established. the data are used to assess the performance of an anchor embedment model based on strain-rate-dependent shearing resistance and fluid mechanics drag resistance. predictions of a database of over 100 anchor installations - formed from this study and the literature - result in calculated anchor embedment depths that are within +/- 15% of the measurements. an interesting aspect, consistent across the entire database, relates to the strain rate dependence on frictional resistance relative to bearing resistance. the predictions reveal that strain rate dependency may indeed be higher for frictional resistance, although only if a soil strength lower than the fully remoulded strength is considered as the reference strength, which suggests that water may be entrained along a boundary layer at the anchor-soil interface during installation.
computer-aided_design	isogeometric analysis (iga) is a new analysis method for unification of computer aided design (cad) and computer aided engineering (cae). with the use of nurbs basis functions for both modelling and analysis, the bottleneck of meshing is avoided and a seamless integration is achieved. the cad and computational geometry concepts in iga are new to the analysis community. though, there is a steady growth of literature, details of calculations, explanations and examples are not reported. the content of the paper is complimentary to the existing literature and addresses the gaps. it includes summary of the literature, overview of the methodology, step-by-step calculations and matlab codes for example problems in static structural and modal analysis in 1-d and 2-d. at appropriate places, comparison with the finite element analysis (fem) is also included, so that those familiar with fem can appreciate iga better.
hydraulics	to assess the thermal-hydraulics of a condenser of a typical automotive air conditioning system with maldistribution of intake air, a comprehensive investigation has been taken up. the investigation comprises both experiments and numerical simulations. a special purpose software, coildesigner is used to simulate the heat transfer and fluid dynamics of the multiple channel micro-tube air to refrigerant crossflow condenser. while experimentally the overall performance of the condenser is studied by creating blockages of different types and extents in the inlet air path, simulation results provide the spatial variation of pressure, temperature, heat transfer coefficient, and quality on the tube side, in addition to the overall performance for each of the cases. the simulation results clearly bring out the spatial change in the transport parameters due to a typical blockage. one can compare the effective use of the exchanger area of the heat exchanger for an unblocked and a typically blocked case. the simulation also gives a very reliable prediction of the overall performance as recorded by the experiment.

hydraulics	an accurate, fast-running and stable six-group, point kinetics (pk) model is developed and applied successfully to the dynamic simulation of the operation of the prismatic core, high temperature next generation nuclear plant (ngnp) reactor. the model is unrestricted by the size of the time step, which could be as much as several seconds, accounts for doppler broadening and the fuel and graphite temperature reactivity feedbacks, and includes an active neutron source for zero-power reactor startup. an efficient and robust numerical technique that approximates the exponential matrix using 7th order-accurate pade(3,3) function with a discretization error on the order of (delta t)(3), solves the coupled nonlinear and stiff six-groups point kinetics equations. the pk model handles reactivity insertions in excess of a prompt critical, rho/(beta) over bar>$1.0, with unrestrictive time step size. model results are successfully benchmarked using the inhour solution for a step insertion of external reactivity. to simulate the transient response of the ngnp reactor following an external reactivity insertion and during a startup, the pk model is coupled to 84-nodes thermal-hydraulics model of the reactor, also developed in this work. with a 2 s time step, the error of predicting the reactor thermal power is similar to 0.001%, increasing exponentially to similar to 0.08% and similar to 1.5% with increased time step size to 5 and 8 s, respectively. the present pk model has been successfully incorporated into melcor-h-2 nuclear reactor analysis code to simulate transient operation of very high temperature reactor (vhtr) for electricity generation, using a closed brayton cycle turbomachinery, and the co-generation of hydrogen using sulfur iodine (si) thermo-chemical processes.

computer-aided_design	integrating more functionality in a smaller form factor with higher performance and lower-power consumption is pushing semiconductor technology scaling to its limits. 3-d chip stacking is touted as the silver bullet technology that can keep moore 's momentum and fuel the next wave of consumer electronic products. additionally, the complexity of digital designs imposes that computer-aided design algorithms are getting harder and slower. this paper introduces a framework for application implementation onto 3-d reconfigurable architectures. in contrast to existing approaches, the proposed solution is customizable according to constraints posed by the application and the target 3-d device in order to improve performance metrics. experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our framework, as we achieve average enhancements in terms of maximum operation frequency and power consumption by 35% and 47%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
internal_combustion_engine	power generation from biomass gasification through the use of spark ignition engines requires the cooling of the biomass syngas to avoid knock. this cooling leads to the condensation of tar impurities, which foul and clog up critical process components leading to significant maintenance issues and costs. conventionally, tar related problems are addressed by optimizing the gasification process along with developing tar purification systems, both of which result in increased investment and maintenance costs. a novel method is being developed at the universite catholique de louvain, where the entire process, from the exit of the biomass gasifier to the combustion of tar loaded impure syngas in an internal combustion engine, is carried out at a temperature of 250 degrees c, thereby avoiding tar condensation and its consequent problems. a homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) engine is utilized for such a high intake temperature operation. this paper describes the first experiments with an impure and hot biomass syngas, produced from a two-stage gasifier, which is burned in a hcci engine without the intermediate cooling and tar purification steps. the objective of the experiment was to test the stability of the engine in response to the naturally occurring random variations in the syngas composition. the experiments were carried out over a continuous period of 24 h. indicated efficiencies of 33%-39% and imep around 2.5 bar were observed while the emissions of nox were relatively high, probably due to the presence of ammonia in the syngas. the implementation of a closed control loop, with the combustion phasing as the feedback parameter and the fueling rate as the controlled parameter, ensured a stable operation over the experimental duration.

machine_design	the interest for permanent magnet (pm) synchronous machines equipped with fractional-slot concentrated winding is more and more increasing in recent years. among the others the surface mounted pm machines (spm) have been widely selected from motor manufacturers. particularly attractive are the spoke-type interior pm (ipm) machines. nowadays, pm machines are often selected for variable speed applications without precise positioning requirements taking the advantage of sensorless control algorithms. nevertheless the capability to detect the electrical rotor position without sensor also at zero speed, by means of techniques based on high-frequency signal injection, is an enhancing feature that requires a proper machine design. the aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of both rotor and stator modifications taking a commercial motor as a reference geometry. the analysis of two rotor structures, spm and ipm, as well as stator tooth geometry variations pointed out how the machine response due the injection of an high frequency voltage is significantly affected by the stator iron saturation. finite elements simulations have been confirmed by test on two ipm motors manufactured with different stator design.
strength_of_materials	a stochastic model of nonisothermal creep and long-term strength of metallic materials is proposed. experimental data on the creep of the zhs6kp alloy at temperatures equal to 900, 950, and 1000a degrees c are stochastically analyzed. these experimental data are used to substantiate the hypotheses applied in constructing the model. the stochastic model is checked for adequacy to the experimental data on the creep of the zhs6kp alloy under stationary and nonstationary loading conditions. it is shown that the calculated and experimental data are in satisfactory agreement.
internal_combustion_engine	on account of increasingly strict needs on engine efficiency and emission control, the fuel to air ratio (far) control arrangements for internal combustion engines (ices) are still incessantly developed. the effects of time delay limit the far controller gains and degrade the system performance. this paper addresses a control system design for far in ices that suffer from unknown time-delay induced due to several reasons such as unknown evaporation time, unknown fuel quantity injected into the combustion process, and an imperfection in the model used to describe far and its relation to the surrounding factors that affect the combustion process. a new theorem is proposed in this context depending on routh-hurwitz technique and manipulating poles cancellation control method to achieve the required control action. a mathematical proof is introduced for the proposed theorem and a numerical simulation is performed to illustrate the validity of the control scheme.

machine_design	most of the electrical machines design studies found in literature lie on the concept that the design under investigation (and optimization) focuses mainly on the geometrical aspects of the machine and thus takes into account only a certain ferromagnetic material (i.e. iron) for its parts. these studies, give little or no information about the influence of material alternatives on the same (and optimized) design. from a manufacturers' point of view though, this information is crucial especially nowadays that there are a lot of commercially available materials in the market. in this context, this paper presents the results of a research project in the design stage of an energy efficient three phase squirrel cage induction motor (scim), by investigating the effects of several soft magnetic materials (adopted for its stator and/or its rotor parts) on multiple quantities of primary concern such as: efficiency, power factor, output torque, losses, weight and cost. after a brief proposed design procedure, a total of twenty-two different materials from recent manufacturers' data were examined. also, the main electromagnetic analysis was performed through commercial analysis software. simple ranking methods are also proposed here for different application areas and the results obtained are then thoroughly discussed and commented.
computer-aided_design	simulated spectrometric observations of unresolved resident space objects are required for the interpretation of quantities measured by optical telescopes. this allows for their characterization as part of regular space surveillance activity. a peer-reviewed spacecraft reflectance model is necessary to help improve the understanding of characterization measurements. with this objective in mind, a novel approach to model spacecraft spectral reflectance as an overall spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (sbrdf) is presented. a spacecraft 's overall sbrdf is determined using its triangular-faceted computer-aided design (cad) model and the empirical sbrdf of its homogeneous materials. the cad model is used to determine the proportional contribution of each homogeneous material to the overall reflectance. each empirical sbrdf is contained in look-up tables developed from measurements made over a range of illumination and reflection geometries using simple interpolation and extrapolation techniques. a demonstration of the spacecraft reflectance model is provided through simulation of an optical ground truth characterization using the canadian advanced nanospace experiment-1 engineering model nanosatellite as the subject. validation of the reflectance model is achieved through a qualitative comparison of simulated and measured quantities.

computer-aided_design	the use of virtual surgery, patient-specific saw and drill guides, and custom-made osteosynthesis plates is rapidly spreading from deformity surgery to orthognathic surgery. most of the commercially available systems are using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (cad/cam) wafers to produce patient-specific saw guides. however, most plate systems provided are still the conventional ""in stock"" mini plates that can be individually designed by pre-bending according to the stereolithographic model of the patient. custom made three-dimensional (3d) printed implants have earlier been demonstrated to be an ideal solution in deformity surgery and in reconstruction of complex posttraumatic cases. in this study, we report the novel use of patient-specific saw and drill guides combined with patient-specific 3d titanium alloy implants as a fixation system in maxillary movement after le fort i and bimaxillary osteotomies (n = 32). the implants were individually designed for each patient to follow anatomical structures and to provide exact positioning and stability of the repositioned maxilla.

materials_engineering	modelling and simulation of multiphysical phenomena need to be considered in the design and optimisation of mechanical properties of cast components in order to accelerate the introduction of new cast alloys. the data on casting defects, including microstructure features, are crucial for evaluating the final performance-related properties of the component. in this paper, the required models for the prediction of interdendritic casting defects, such as microporosity and hot tears, are reviewed. the data on calculated solidification shrinkage are presented and its effects on microporosity levels discussed. numerical simulation results for microporosity are presented for a356, 356 and 319 aluminium alloys using procast software. the calculated pressure drop of the interdendritic liquid was observed to be quite significant and the regions of high-pressure drop can be used as an indicator on the severity of interdendritic microporosity defects.
computer-aided_design	introduction: the surgical template is a guide aimed at directing the implant placement, tumor resection, osteotomy and bone repositioning. using it, preoperative planning can be transferred to the actual surgical site, and the precision, safety and reliability of the surgery can be improved. however, the actual workflow of the surgical template design and manufacturing is quite complicated before the final clinical application.areas covered: the major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source of the current and future development of the template design and manufacturing for relevant researchers.expert commentary: this paper aims to present a review of the necessary procedures in the template-guided surgery including the image processing, 3d visualization, preoperative planning, surgical guide design and manufacturing. in addition, the template-guided clinical applications for various kinds of surgeries are reviewed, and it demonstrated that the precision of the surgery has been improved compared with the non-guided operations.
manufacturing_engineering	omitted citations - i.e., missing links between a cited paper and the corresponding citing papers - are the main consequence of several bibliometric database errors. this paper investigates the possible relationship between omitted citations and publishers of the relevant citing papers. this relationship is potentially meaningful because: (i) publishers generally impose editorial styles, which could affect database errors, and (ii) some publishers may be more efficient than others in detecting and correcting pre-existing errors in the manuscripts to be published, reducing the risk of database errors. based on an extensive sample of scientific papers in the manufacturing engineering field, this study examines the citations omitted by the scopus and wos databases, using a recent automated algorithm. major results are that: (i) there are significant differences in terms of omitted-citation rate between publishers and (ii) the omitted-citation rates of publishers may vary depending on the database in use.

hydraulics	a herringbone water-sediment separation structure (hereinafter referred to as ""herringbone structure"") has been shown to be effective in separating coarse inorganic debris; however, less is known regarding the large wood (lw) filtration effect in this structure. this paper presents preliminary research on the wood filtration effect of the herringbone structure based on physical model tests. the results show that the herringbone structure exhibited effective performance in large wood size segregation, with a 100% component filtration rate for lw that diameter (d) larger than ribbed beam opening width (a). the total filtration rate also exceeded 80% when the fraud number (fr) is larger than 2.64 and increased with the increase of fr. after exceeding fr (max), total filtration rate would be decreased due to overflow. beside flow condition, structure parameters influence significantly on lw filtration rate. we attempt to explain the filtration process via particle contact trajectory and particle movement trajectory. the inclined angle of ribbed beam (gamma) contributed the most variation to the filtration rate via influencing the coincidence with particle contact trajectory and particle movement trajectory. the high sensitivity coefficient of ribbed beam (theta) under relatively low fr conditions implies remarkable influences on lw filtration effects by causing clogging problem. the ribbed beam opening width (a) together with lw diameter (d) influenced the size segregation performance.
thermodynamics	environmental applications of graphene (gn) are limited by the occurrence of aggregation. herein, graphene oxide (go) was synthesized, reduced to gn by ascorbic acid, and intercalated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab). gn-ctab was characterized by boehm 's titration, n-2 adsorption/desorption, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectrophotometry, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. then, gn-ctab was used for the adsorptive removal of acid red 265 (ar265) and acid orange 7 (ao7) dyes from water both under batch and column operation. under batch operation, the effect of ph, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, contact time and temperature on dyes adsorption were assessed. adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics were analyzed systematically. regarding the fixed bed operation, the effect of both the bed height and flow rate were studied and experimental results fitted to the thomas and bdst models. then, the bed loss capacity along five adsorption-regeneration cycles was determined in order to further approach the practical application of gn-ctab for wastewater treatment, namely for the removal of dyes.

computer-aided_design	background: recent introduction of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) monolithic zirconia dental prostheses raises the issue of material low thermal degradation (ltd), a wellknown problem with zirconia hip prostheses. this phenomenon could be accentuated by masticatory mechanical stress. until now zirconia ltd process has only been studied in vitro. this work introduces an original protocol to evaluate ltd process of monolithic zirconia prostheses in the oral environment and to study their general clinical behavior, notably in terms of wear. methods/design: 101 posterior monolithic zirconia tooth elements (molars and premolars) are included in a 5-year prospective clinical trial. on each element, several areas between 1 and 2 mm(2) (6 on molars, 4 on premolars) are determined on restoration surface: areas submitted or non-submitted to mastication mechanical stress, glazed or non-glazed. before prosthesis placement, ex vivo analyses regarding ltd and wear are performed using raman spectroscopy, sem imagery and 3d laser profilometry. after placement, restorations are clinically evaluated following criteria of the world dental federation (fdi), complemented by the analysis of fracture clinical risk factors. two independent examiners perform the evaluations. clinical evaluation and ex vivo analyses are carried out after 6 months and then each year for up to 5 years. discussion: for clinicians and patients, the results of this trial will justify the use of monolithic zirconia restorations in dental practice. for researchers, the originality of a clinical study including ex vivo analyses of material aging will provide important data regarding zirconia properties.

machine_design	the goal of this study is to address preliminary design and prototyping of a novel 5-phase segment-type switched reluctance motor (seg-srm) with 10/8 pole configuration. the proposed seg-srm includes a stator having salient poles and a rotor having segmental steel cores which are embedded in aluminum block. the operation of seg-srm depends on exciting two adjacent phases respectively at all times by creating mutual coupling, thus leading less eddy current effects on silicon steel sheets of the stator and better efficiency. a quick design methodology covering all geometrical details of segsrm is given. this comprehensive method is useful for initial machine design and eliminates the machines with undesired outputs. besides, the performance characteristics of the designed seg-srm are investigated by finite element method (fem). finally, a prototype is manufactured and tested in the laboratory based on computed analytical parameters and the operational outcomes of the developed system are presented by verifying finite element studies. it is completely substantiated that this new preliminary design can be used in applications ranging from low speed to medium speed. the comparative study among simulation and experimental studies seeks to address torque production/prediction versus current variation.
machine_design	in this contribution we develop and describe a new, adaptive, pulsed-laser welding method for thin electrical laminations. by using a reflective laser sensor and a custom-made control unit with the appropriate software the system triggers the laser pulse only at the contacts between the laminations. in this way the total laser pulse energy and, consequently, the specific power losses of the electromotor, where the stack is used, are significantly reduced. this new method has great potential in the serial production of electromotors.

hydraulics	biofilm acts stabilising river-bed sediments, interfering with particle entrainment and, consequently, preventing bed disturbance. in this paper we present the results of a series of experiments carried out in indoor channels, aimed to understand biofilm alteration of bed material motion and topographic changes in stream channels. we analysed the erosion patterns and bedload rates in non-cohesive sediments in channels colonised by biofilms and compared them to biofilm-free others. all the channels had the same conditions of light irradiance, temperature, slope, and particle size (sand). discharge and water surface slope were modified to create a range of hydraulic conditions, with pairs of colonised and non-colonised channels subjected to the same flows. we observed that biofilm slightly modified bed roughness and flow hydraulics, but that highly influenced bed disturbance. biofilm caused bed scour to occur in patches unevenly distributed along the channel length, as a result of localised weaknesses of the biofilm. once biofilm was ripped up it was transported in chunks, and sand grains were observed attached to these chunks. in non-colonised sediments the erosion was more homogeneous and the formation and movement of bedforms were observed. on average, bedload rates were 5 times lower when biofilm was present. overall, the protective effect of the biofilm prevented generalised erosion of the channel and delayed the entrainment and transport of sand grains. results emphasised the important role of biofilm in the incipient motion of bed-material in stream channels; this role may affect the magnitude and frequency of subsequent river bed processes, notably the onset of bedload and associated channel morpho-dynamics.

internal_combustion_engine	minimization of parasitic losses in the internal combustion (ic) engine is essential for improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. surface texturing has emerged as a method palliating these losses in instances where thin lubricant films lead to mixed or boundary regimes of lubrication. such thin films are prevalent in contact of compression ring to cylinder liner at piston motion reversals because of momentary cessation of entraining motion. the paper provides combined solution of reynolds equation, boundary interactions, and a gas flow model to predict the tribological conditions, particularly at piston reversals. this model is then validated against measurements using a floating liner for determination of in situ friction of an engine under motored condition. very good agreement is obtained. the validated model is then used to ascertain the effect of surface texturing of the liner surface during reversals. therefore, the paper is a combined study of numerical predictions and the effect of surface texturing. the predictions show that some marginal gains in engine performance can be expected with laser textured chevron features of shallow depth under certain operating conditions.
manufacturing_engineering	the oregon institute of technology (oit), portland center, has been offering manufacturing engineering technology (mfget) and mechanical engineering technology (met) undergraduate programs for students around the greater portland metropolitan area for the past ten (10) years. a master 's degree in manufacturing engineering technology (mmfget) is also offered. these programs are extensions of programs offered at oit main campus in klamath falls. portland campus programs are designed specifically to cater to students employed full-time in industry. this paper discusses engineering technology programs and their direct application in training local company full-time employees to become engineers and managers. most of these employees have associate degrees and years of experience in their respective companies. a discussion of engineering-related, hands-on work experience and understanding of engineering principles and their applications presented. the effectiveness of special instruction techniques, custom-developed for students with limited time availability, while maintaining abet accreditations is also discussed. discussion-oriented learning and teaching models and the impact of adding dimensions to these instructional models, with the industry-experienced students in mind, is emphasized. case studies are presented to show improvement in student engagement, curiosity, and application of new knowledge to actual day-to-day, work-environment problems. advantages and disadvantages of night school are discussed.
strength_of_materials	we proposed an equation formulating the relationship between the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal and the mass loading. the equation developed by sauerbrey concerning quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) was improved by a new approach based on the mechanical strength of materials. this equation is seemingly trivial but greatly improves the accuracy with respect to the frequency-mass relationship to frequency shifts of 10% or more in the case of selected materials. methods to treat the effects of crystal mounting and non-uniformity of deposited films are elucidated.
fluid_mechanics	swimming performance of spermatozoa is an important index for the success of fertilization. for many years, numerous studies have reported the optimal swimming of flagellar organisms. nevertheless, there is still a question as to which is optimal among planar, circular helical and ellipsoidal helical beating. in this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to investigate the beat pattern with the best swimming efficiency based on hydrodynamic dissipation and internal torque exertion. for the parameters considered, our results show that the planar beat is optimal for small heads and the helical flagellum is optimum for a larger heads, while the ellipsoidal beat is never optimal. also, the genetic optimization reveals that the wavenumber and shape of wave envelope are relevant parameters, whereas the wave shape and head geometry have relatively minor effects on efficiency. the optimal beat with respect to the efficiency based on the internal torque exertion of an active elastic flagellum is characterized by a small-wave number and large-amplitude wave in a lower-viscosity medium. the obtained results on the optimal waveform are consistent with observations for planar waveforms, but in many respects, the results suggest the necessity of a detailed flagellar structure-fluid interaction to address whether real spermatozoa exhibit hydrodynamically efficient swimming. the evolutional optimization approach used in this study has distinguished biologically important parameters, and the methodology can potentially be applicable to various swimmers.

hydraulics	one way to study ecological implications induced by hydropeaking represents the coupling of hydrodynamic models with habitat suitability models, in which hydrodynamic parameters are typically used to describe the physical habitat of indicator species. this article discusses the differences in habitat suitability assessment between 2d and 3d cfd modelling as input for the habitat simulation tool casimir. in the first part of the article, the accuracy of the hydraulic model is evaluated by comparing the model results with laboratory (model of a laboratory channel with erodible bed) and field measurements (valsura river, bolzano, italy). in the second part, the habitat suitability for the valsura river case study (affected by hydropeaking), is analyzed comparing different approaches for the reconstruction of the velocity field (depth-averaged velocities from 2d modelling, bottom velocity field reconstruction with log-law approach from 2d modelling and bottom velocity field from 3d modelling). the results show that the habitat suitability index (hsi) using 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models can be significantly different. these differences can be ascribed to a higher capability to depict the features of the flow field with highly variable and heterogeneous boundary conditions and to the possibility to simulate the near bed hydrodynamic parameters, which are relevant for certain target species. in particular, the hsi-values using 3d hydraulics lead to larger areas of highly suitable habitats compared to 2d simulations. moreover, considering the entire flow range of hydropeaking events, the habitat simulations with bottom flow velocities from 3d modelling provide suitable habitats over the entire flow range representing the availability of stable suitable habitats, while the habitat availability of 2d modelled flow velocity is continuously decreasing with increasing flow rates.

machine_design	an electrical variable transmission (evt) is an electromagnetic device with dual mechanical and electrical ports. in hybrid electric vehicles (hev 's) it is used to split the power to the wheels in a part coming from the combustion engine and a part exchanged with the battery. the most important feature is that the power splitting is done in an electromagnetic way. this has the advantage over mechanical power splitting devices of reduced maintenance, high efficiency and inherent overload protection. depending on the operating point part of the power is transmitted in an electromagnetic way, while the rest is transmitted electrically using two back to back inverters. the power flow determines the power rating of the inverters, the cooling and the machine design. this paper gives an overview of the different operating points and the corresponding power flow.
computer-aided_design	fused deposition modeling (fdm) has been recognized as an effective technology to manufacture 3d dimensional parts directly from a digital computer aided design (cad) model in a layer-by-layer style. although it has become a significantly important manufacturing process, but it is still not well accepted additive manufacturing technology for load-carrying parts under dynamic and cyclic conditions due to many processing parameters affecting the part properties. the purpose of this study is to characterize the fdm manufactured parts by detecting how the individual and interactive fdm process parameters will influence the performance of manufactured products under dynamic and cyclic conditions. experiments were conducted through fractional factorial design and artificial neural network (ann). effect of each parameter on the dynamic modulus of elasticity was investigated using analysis of variance (anova) technique. furthermore, optimal processing parameters were determined and validated by conducting verification experiment. the results showed that both ann and fractional factorial models provided good quality predictions, yet the ann showed the superiority of a properly trained ann in capturing the nonlinear relationship of the system over fractional factorial for both data fitting and estimation capabilities.

fluid_mechanics	the piston ring pack is important for the sealing of the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. it plays a major role in friction, wear and oil consumption considerations. both experimental and theoretical studies in this area are difficult due to the complexity of this highly dynamic system. the paper deals with the numerical investigation by means of computational fluid dynamics of the gas and oil flow in the piston ring pack. having been validated with experimental data, the simulation results show gas and oil transport mechanisms, which can be used to improve existing models of 0d/1d-simulations. this leads to a better understanding of the processes in the piston ring pack and helps to further optimize the tribological system.

hydraulics	discrete fluid power systems featuring transmission lines inherently include pressure oscillations. experimental verification of a discrete fluid power power take off system for wave energy converters has shown the cylinder pressure to oscillate as force shifts are performed. this article investigates how cylinder pressure oscillations may be reduced by shaping the valve opening trajectory without the need for closed loop pressure feedback. furthermore the energy costs of reducing pressure oscillations are investigated.
machine_design	in permanent magnet synchronous machines (pmsm), depending on the machine application, different types of permanent magnets (pm) can be used. the most common pms are ferrite magnets, neodymium iron boron magnets (ndfeb), and samarium cobalt magnets (smco). the selection of a suitable magnet for a particular machine design depends on the magnet properties: remanence, conductivity, mechanical rigidity, losses, and demagnetization characteristics. usually, the possibility of hysteresis losses in pm materials is neglected. in this paper, however, it is demonstrated that possible hysteresis losses have to be evaluated in the machine design. it is shown by measurements and simulations that in some machine designs, hysteresis losses in ndfeb, smco, and ferrite magnets can be a source of significant additional ac losses that may lead to too high pm operating temperatures and a reduction in the machine efficiency.
internal_combustion_engine	the success of electric vehicles (evs) greatly depends on battery size, cost, lifetime, and capacity. the battery capacity of evs has to contain enough energy to allow ev users to drive, at least, the minimum distance that internal combustion engine vehicles take. however, even with very efficient evs and combining all the available highly efficient ev technologies, the battery capacity still needs to be large. thus, one alternative to reduce the battery size is to improve the charging infrastructure by implementing sufficient public/private fast-charging locations, which will significantly increase the ev driving range with relatively low battery capacities. however, this kind of infrastructure requires charging with higher current capability, due to the high power levels involved in the fast-charging process. in this paper, a bidirectional dc/dc converter with six inverter legs connected to a three-phase output is proposed. the converter is similar to a three-phase dual-active-bridge (dab) converter with more inverter legs in parallel. these additional inverter legs increase the converter current capability, without affecting the dab main characteristics, preserving similar modulation techniques and dab advantages. an accurate study about the proposed topology is carried out in this paper, and simulations and experimental results are shown for a 20-kw prototype, validating the theoretical analysis.
fluid_mechanics	removing geometric details from the computational domain can significantly reduce the complexity of downstream task of meshing and simulation computation, and increase their stability. proper estimation of the sensitivity analysis error induced by removing such domain details, called defeaturing errors, can ensure that the sensitivity analysis fidelity can still be met after simplification. in this paper, estimation of impacts of removing arbitrarily constrained domain details to the analysis of incompressible fluid flows is studied with applications to fast analysis of incompressible fluid flows in complex environments. the derived error estimator is applicable to geometric details constrained by either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions, and has no special requirements on the outer boundary conditions. extensive numerical examples were presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed error estimator.
computer-aided_design	parametric and implicit methods are traditionally thought to be two irrelevant approaches in structural shape optimization. parametric method works as a lagrangian approach and often uses the parametric boundary representation (b-rep) of curves/surfaces, for example, bezier and b-splines in combination with the conformal mesh of a finite element model, while implicit method relies upon level-set functions, that is, implicit functions for b-rep, and works as an eulerian approach in combination with the fixed mesh within the scope of extended finite element method or finite cell method. the original contribution of this work is the unification of both methods. first, a new shape optimization method is proposed by combining the features of the parametric and implicit b-reps. shape changes of the structural boundary are governed by parametric b-rep on the fixed mesh to maintain the merit in computer-aided design modeling and avoid laborious remeshing. second, analytical shape design sensitivity is formulated for the parametric b-rep in the framework of fixed mesh of finite cell method by means of the hamilton-jacobi equation. numerical examples are solved to illustrate the unified methodology. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
fluid_mechanics	linear momentum actuator disc theory is extended to address the power available to a tidal turbine array spanning the cross-section of an open channel flow. a generalised formulation is presented, which relaxes constraints in previous models on the froude number of the flow and the geometry of the turbine array, and also considers the effects of far-wake mixing on the overall power removed from the flow. in the limiting case of no free surface deformation, the rigid lid model is recovered. blockage, the ratio of turbine frontal area to the cross-sectional area of the surrounding flow passage, has the greatest effect on available power, with the peak power coefficient increasing by 55% from 0.60 to 0.93 as the blockage ratio increases from 0.05 to 0.20. a further 3% increase in peak power coefficient is achieved as the froude number increases from 0.05 to 0.20. the efficiency of energy extraction may be determined relative to the total power extracted from the flow, comprising the power available to the turbines, and the power dissipated in wake mixing. higher blockage turbines operating at low thrust coefficients are shown to be more efficient than lower blockage turbines.
manufacturing_engineering	joint industry-academia projects with regional industry have influenced creation of florida 's first coast manufacturing innovation partnership. the development of the collaboration has the primary goals of project-centered innovations for technology transfer, training the regional workforce with relevance to industry, and sustainability of technology transfer through creation of high-technology jobs. by providing an experiential education in manufacturing systems automation and design in the undergraduate engineering curriculum, engineering students are better prepared upon entering the workforce. initial projects leading to the development of the manufacturing innovation partnerships are outlined, followed by the description of the structure to further expand the scope of experiential project-centered engineering education in design and manufacturing systems engineering.
computer-aided_design	the monte carlo method was used for quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of bis-quinolinium and bis-isoquinolinium compounds as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors for a series of 36 compounds. quantitative structure-activity relationship models were calculated with the representation of the molecular structure by the simplified molecular input-line entry system. one split into the training and test set was examined. the statistical quality of the developed model was good. the best calculated quantitative structure-activity relationship model had following statistical parameters: r (2) = 0.8097 for the training set and r (2) = 0.9372 for the test set. structural indicators defined as molecular fragments responsible for increases and decreases in the inhibition activity were calculated. the computer-aided design of new compounds as potential acetylcholine esterase inhibitors with the application of defined structural alerts was presented.
hydraulics	efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. we tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. we measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (sg) and 10 fast growing (fg) fraxinus ornus l. trees. branches of sg trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35 cm year(-1)), and produced a higher leaf biomass (p < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (p0.05) and xylem safety (psi(50) approximate to -3.2 mpa). slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.
computer-aided_design	the die model characterized with high design efficiency and strong correlation plays an important role in simulation and machining. because of the complexity of structure and the changing shape of flow channel, current design tools lack in the level of automation so that design of an extrusion die is a nontrivial task. in this paper, an integral design method is proposed to improve the design efficiency and model correlation. the computer-aided design (cad) system for plastic profile extrusion die is designed and implemented by integrating visual studio 2010 (vs2010) and unigraphics nx (ug). the closed loop recognition algorithm (clr), multi closed loops intelligent recognition (mclr) algorithm, and multi closed loops matching (mclm) algorithm based on feature recognition are proposed to realize automatic generation of ruled surface in flow channel. the integral design and automatic generation methods of die set are proposed to facilitate efficient formation of different structures and process holes. the particle swarm optimization (pso) algorithm is put forward to obtain best position and specification for the interference parts. three modules (integral sketches, integral flow channel, and integral die set) are developed, which focus on integrating the proposed automation design methods into their framework. a case application on die design is used to illustrate the proposed method. the results show that the developed cad system not only improves the design efficiency of extrusion die but also enhances the design quality.
computer-aided_design	modeling of scientific or engineering applications often yields high-dimensional dynamical systems due to techniques of computer-aided-design, for example. thus a model order reduction is required to decrease the dimensionality and to enable an efficient numerical simulation. in addition, methods of parameterized model order reduction (pmor) are often used to preserve the physical or geometric parameters as independent variables in the reduced order models. we consider linear dynamical systems in the form of ordinary differential equations. in the domain of the parameters, often samples are chosen to construct a reduced order model. for each sample point a common technique for model order reduction can be applied to compute a local basis. moment matching or balanced truncation are feasible, for example. a global basis for pmor can be constructed from the local bases by a singular value decomposition. we investigate approaches for an appropriate selection of a finite set of samples. the transfer function of the dynamical system is examined in the frequency domain, and our focus is on moment matching techniques using the arnoldi procedure. we use a sensitivity analysis of the transfer function with respect to the parameters as a tool to select sample points. simulation results are shown for two examples.

machine_design	this paper presents various experimental tests on the sensorless capability of induction motors (im). an intentionally created saliency is introduced in the rotor so as to allow the rotor position to be estimated by means of a high-frequency (hf) injected signal in the stator winding. experimental measurements are carried out on three prototypes, two with saliency and the third without saliency, as reference. the critical aspects in the prototype realization are discussed in this paper. suggestion on how to solve them from the machine design point of view is included. the rotor saliency has been measured by means of an hf injection. then, the steady-state performance has been measured, together with the mechanical characteristic of the three prototypes. fe analysis is used to predict the variation of the im parameters with rotor position. the results are compared with those achieved from measurements.
materials_engineering	the purpose here is to study patterns of project collaboration found in one government supported programme for construction innovation. preferred types of interaction were identified using data from two questionnaire surveys, one with experienced construction sector respondents and one aimed at construction researchers. all sixteen development projects within the swedish bygginnovationen programme were investigated, relying on documents and a survey of project managers. important types of interaction, according to construction respondents, are informal contacts, joint research projects and staff mobility. for university respondents, informal contacts is also seen as the most important type of interaction, followed by msc thesis work in firms and industrial phd candidates. grant applicants from manufacturing depended more on university laboratories and were less sensitive to firm/university distance. laboratory use was also more frequent for projects relying on the field of materials engineering. in conclusion, there is a consensus about which types of collaboration are valuable. the broadness of participation in the programme, ranging over many industries, both as to origin of ideas and ultimate applications, reaches beyond narrow interpretations of the construction industry. policy makers should recognize the innovation importance of university laboratory facilities and field testing, rather than seeing researchers as sources of ideas.
internal_combustion_engine	this paper proposes a torque control strategy to charge the battery of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (hevs), in which the charge torque by an internal combustion engine (ice) is newly introduced. in our previous paper, only regenerative braking was used to charge the battery. however, this is not sufficient for co2 and nox emissions reduction, and thus, a more effective energy management system (ems) should be developed. to maintain the battery state of charge (soc), a target soc is also introduced in the charge torque. in addition, a charge driving condition where the charge torque by the ice is generated is newly proposed. by introducing the charge driving, the ice driving region on torque-engine speed plane was reduced. as a result, a greater reduction in co2 and nox emissions is expected. based on the ems proposed in our previous papers, an ems incorporating the charge driving is developed. through typical driving cycles, the validity of the proposed ems algorithm incorporating the charge driving is examined.
fluid_mechanics	this paper presents the results of an experimental model study of the transient loading of steam generator tubes during a postulated main steam line break (mslb) accident in a nuclear power plant. the problem involves complex transient two-phase flow dynamics and fluid-structural loading processes. a better understanding of this phenomenon will permit the development of improved design tools to ensure steam generator tube integrity. the pressure and temperature were measured upstream and downstream of a sectional model of a tube bundle in cross-flow, and the transient tube loads were directly measured using dynamic piezoelectric load cells. high-speed videos were taken to observe and better understand the flow phenomena causing the tube loading. the working fluid was r-134a and the tube bundle was a normal triangular array with a pitch ratio of 1.36. the flow through the bundle was choked for the majority of the transient. the transient tube loading is explained in terms of the associated fluid mechanics. an empirical model is developed that enables the prediction of the maximum tube loads once the pressure drop is known.
manufacturing_engineering	a national science foundation (nsf) sponsored project was initiated in 2011 at the department of mechanical and manufacturing engineering (mme), miami university, with the aim of creating online learning modules to increase the efficacy of the coursework. the modules were designed to instil proficiency in computational and experimental analysis, and were grouped along five thematic lines in the form of subject studios. the modules contain multimedia content and are designed for use as supplementary course material, or independently by students in preparation for research tasks or review of specific concepts from prior courses. when used to augment existing courses, a salient feature of the modules is the ability to introduce lab/experiment derived content to lecture-only course formats. this has been found to be particularly effective in engaging students and enabling the introduction of new topics with minimal disruption to the existing daily syllabus of a course. the project 's development and implementation phase will end mid-year. since assessment and continuous improvement were integral parts of the project, this paper presents data from the two year assessment process and describes the changes to the project. the paper also includes a discussion of plans for expansion of modules and practices for keeping content current.
hydraulics	drill stem vibration may cause drilling inefficiencies and often leads to non-productive time. drill stem vibration analysis is performed to prevent and identify rpm values that may cause damaging standing waves in the drill stem. however, different models and assumptions give different vibration results. one simplification commonly done is excluding drilling fluids. this paper investigates the effect of including drilling hydraulics and the dynamic pressure on drill stem vibrations. the model assumes the drill stem is acting as a euler bernoulli beam and was discretized using a finite element formulation. two fluid rheological models, herschel bulkley and power law, were used to determine the uncoupled dynamic pressure drop across the drill stem. the results show that including the dynamic pressure in the drill stem vibration model causes the critical rotational speeds to change as much as 32% (i.e. 59 rpm). as expected, axial and torsional vibrations are not affected, while lateral vibration changes significantly when the ratio of the wellbore diameter to the drill stem outside diameter is below 1.25, with a narrow total drill bit flow area, or when operating at high flow rates. therefore, when creating rpm road maps to avoid vibrations while drilling, the contribution of the dynamic pressure should be included.

manufacturing_engineering	current product lifecycle management systems (plm) have concentrated on product design, not on manufacturing engineering with its development of e.g. material flows and layouts. this paper proposes an approach to describe how to represent the main required manufacturing process data using ontologies together with generic data standards. this approach makes it possible to develop translations between different software, and also providing users with the meaning of different concepts. it contributes to an efficient management of manufacturing information, with a focus on the material flow information as used in discrete event simulation - des.
computer-aided_design	this study investigates the retention load (rl) between zro2 primary crowns and secondary polyetheretherketone (peek) crowns made by different fabrication methods with three different tapers. standardized primary zro2 crowns were fabricated with three different tapers: 0 degrees, 1 degrees, and 2 degrees (n = 10/group). ten secondary crowns were fabricated (i) milled from brecam biohpp blanks (pm); (ii) pressed from industrially fabricated peek pellets (pp) (biohpp pellet); or (iii) pressed from granular peek (pg) (biohpp granulat). one calibrated operator adjusted all crowns. in total, the rl of 90 secondary crowns were measured in pull-off tests at 50 mm/min, and each specimen was tested 20 times. two- and one-way anovas followed by a scheff 's post-hoc test were used for data analysis (p < 0.05). within crowns with a 0 degrees taper, the pp group showed significantly higher retention load values compared with the other groups. among the 1 degrees taper, the pm group presented significantly lower retention loads than the pp group. however, the pressing type had no impact on the results. within the 2 degrees taper, the fabrication method had no influence on the rl. within the pm group, the 2 degrees taper showed significantly higher retention load compared with the 1 ffi taper. the taper with 0 degrees was in the same range value as the 1 degrees and 2 degrees tapers. no impact of the taper on the retention value was observed between the pp groups. within the pg groups, the 0 ffi taper presented significantly lower rl than the 1 degrees taper, whereas the 2 degrees taper showed no differences. the fabrication method of the secondary peek crowns and taper angles showed no consistent effect within all tested groups.
thermodynamics	recent experimental work has shown that variations in the confinement of n-butane at bronsted acid sites due to changes in zeolite framework structure strongly affect the apparent and intrinsic enthalpy and entropy of activation for cracking and dehydrogenation. quantum chemical calculations have provided good estimates of the intrinsic enthalpies and entropies of activation extracted from experimental rate data for mfi, but extending these calculations to less confining zeolites has proven challenging, particularly for activation entropies. herein, we report our efforts to develop a theoretical model for the cracking and dehydrogenation of n-butane occurring in a series of zeolites containing 10-ring channels and differing in cavity size (ton, fer, svr, mfi, mel, stf, and mww). we combine a qm/mm approach to calculate intrinsic and apparent activation parameters, with thermal corrections to the apparent barriers obtained from configurational-bias monte carlo simulations, to account for configurational contributions due to global motions of the transition state. we obtain good agreement between theory and experiment for all activation parameters for central cracking in all zeolites. for terminal cracking and dehydrogenation, good agreement between theory and experiment is found only at the highest confinements. experimental activation parameters, especially those for dehydrogenation, tend to increase with decreasing confinement. this trend is not captured by the theoretical calculations, such that deviations between theory and experiment increase as confinement decreases. we propose that, because transition states for dehydrogenation are later than those for cracking, relative movements between the fragments produced in the reaction become increasingly important in the less confining zeolites.
strength_of_materials	polypropylene (pp)/1, 4-bis(3-tetradecylimidiazolium-1-yl) butane bromide (br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c-14-im]br) blends were prepared via melting blending,and then the structure and properties of the blend were characterised and tested. results of testing indicate that br[c-14 im] (ch2)(4) [c-14 im] br could have a heterogeneous nucleating effect in the pp matrix. moreover, pp was readily to form alpha-crystal in the pp crystallizing process with the help of br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br. xrd data show the crystallizing process of pp could be affected by br[c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br, and thus decreased the crystallinity of pp. dsc results show the melting point and the crystallization temperature of pp/br[c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br blends was close to that of neat pp, this maybe due to the good compatibility of pp to br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im] br with long alkyl chains. in addition, the presence of br [c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br could improve the antistatic properties of pp apparently, and the surface resistivity of the pp was decreased to 8.97 x 10(9) omega cm when the content of br[c(14)im](ch2)(4) [c(14)im]br in the blends was about 3 phr. as for the mechanical properties, the tensile strength decreased while the impact strength of materials presented the opposite results with br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br incorporated into it. dma results show the glass transition (t-g) of pp also decreases when 3 phr br[c(14)im](ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br exists in its matrix. therefore, br[c(14)im] (ch2)(4)[c(14)im]br has the plasticized effect on the pp matrix in our experiments.
fluid_mechanics	purpose: the physiological flow dynamics within the valsalva sinuses, in terms of global and local parameters, are still not fully understood. this study attempts to identify the physiological conditions as closely as possible, and to give an explanation of the different and sometime contradictory results in literature. methods: an in vitro approach was implemented for testing porcine bio-prosthetic valves operating within different aortic root configurations. all tests were performed on a pulse duplicator, under physiological pressure and flow conditions. the fluid dynamics established in the various cases were analysed by means of 2d particle image velocimetry, and related with the achieved hydrodynamic performance. results: each configuration is associated with substantially different flow dynamics, which significantly affects the valve performance. the configuration most closely replicating healthy native anatomy was characterised by the best hemodynamic performance, and any mismatch in size and position between the valve and the root produced substantial modification of the fluid dynamics downstream of the valve, hindering the hydrodynamic performance of the system. the worst conditions were observed for a configuration characterised by the total absence of the valsalva sinuses. conclusion: this study provides an explanation for the different vortical structures described in the literature downstream of bioprosthetic valves, enlightening the experimental complications in valve testing. most importantly, the results clearly identify the fluid mechanisms promoted by the valsalva sinuses to enhance the ejection and closing phases, and this study exposes the importance of an optimal integration of the valve and root, to operate as a single system.

machine_design	reliability integration into tillage machine design process is a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of classical design approaches and to achieve designs with a required reliability level. furthermore, design optimization of soil tillage equipments under uncertainty seeks to design structures which should be both economic and reliable. the originality of this research is to develop an efficient methodology that controls the reliability levels for complex statistical distribution cases of random tillage forces. this developed strategy is based on design sensitivity concepts in order to determine the influence of each random parameter. the application of this method consists in taking into account the uncertainties on the soil tillage forces. the tillage forces are calculated in accordance with analytical model of mckyes and ali with some modifications to include the effect of both soil-metal adhesion and tool speed. the different developments and applications show the importance of the developed method to improve the performance of the soil tillage equipments considering both random geometry and loading parameters. the developed method so-called osf (optimum safety factor) can satisfy a required reliability level without additional computing time relative to the deterministic design optimization study. since the agricultural equipment parameters are extremely nonlinear, we extended the osf approach to several nonlinear probabilistic distributions such as lognormal, uniform, weibull and gumbel probabilistic distribution laws.

manufacturing_engineering	nowadays, mobility grants for undergraduate students are leading to increase the number of foreign students enrolled in many universities. normally, european students receive an erasmus grant provided by the european commission, which contributes to exchange students between european countries. many times, the receiving (host) university does not offer the chance to attend lectures in english, and the same goes for labs. usually, foreign students just have individual tutorial sessions and assessments in english. in the present paper we show a methodology to conduct lab sessions when teaching a multilingual group of engineering students. the group under consideration consists of spanish students and some non-spanish speaking students. lab lectures are taught in spanish, but the methodology proposed allows teaching the aforementioned foreign students. this methodology is based on performing a previous homework, which will prepare students to fulfill successfully laboratory activities. video lessons have been recorded in order to show step by step how to perform each lab, and english subtitles have been added. videos are enough well explained so that students that demonstrate a basic level of english can easily understand the activities proposed. several videos have been recorded and some of them included in this work to illustrate the teaching process. these videos show typical practice lessons taught in various subjects at the mechanical faculty of the university of jaen: thermodynamics, metrology and manufacturing engineering. one of the reasons why this methodology has been proposed is to unify the bilingual teaching methodology for several subjects. another one is related to students whose mother tongue is not english. currently, those students must acquire skills that allow them to work in a multilingual group. so we will propose activities to integrate spanish and foreign students. finally an opinion survey is developed in order to determine improvements in the learning process.
internal_combustion_engine	the experimental study was conducted on single cylinder, forced air cooled hydrogen fuelled spark ignition (si) generator set, which was converted from gasoline fuelled generator set with rated power 2.1 kva at 3000 rpm. the study was carried out at various compression ratios (4.5:1, 6.5:1 (base) and 7.2:1), spark timings (2-20 degrees ca before top dead centre (btdc)) and exhaust gas recirculation (egr) up to 25% by volume. furthermore, the experimental tests were conducted on the engine with varied start of gas injection (501) at various compression ratios in order to find the backfire limiting start of injection (bfl-soi). the results indicated that engine operation at higher compression ratio improved the brake thermal efficiency and reduced the backfire occurrence as residual gas fraction decreased with increased compression ratio. however, nox emission increased with increased compression ratio. in order to reduce the nox emission at source level, the engine was operated with retarded spark timings and different egr percentage. the relative nox emission decreased up to 10% with the spark time retarding of 2 degrees ca btdc from maximum brake torque (mbt) whereas it decreased about 57% with 25% by volume egr. the delay in gas injection could reduce the chance of backfire occurrence and the bfl-soi decreased with increased compression ratio. a notable point emerged from this study is that in hydrogen fuelled spark ignition engine the spark time retarding is not a suitable strategy for nox emission reduction whereas the egr at the optimum level (20%) is a better strategy that could reduce the nox emission up to 50% as compared to base hydrogen engine without egr. copyright 2016, hydrogen energy publications, llc. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.
thermodynamics	polyacrylonitrile fibers (panf) covalently modified with lysine (pan-lys) was facilely synthesized and carefully characterized. the critical factors affecting u(vi) adsorption from aqueous solution were exploited, such as initial ph, contact time, concentration and temperature. the adsorption process is strongly dependent on solution ph. with excellent adsorption capacity and high affinity toward u(vi), the process for u(vi) is extremely rapid and the equilibrium can be reached within 20 min. the thermodynamics and kinetics were strictly evaluated. in addition, the hypothetical adsorption mechanisms were proposed. moreover, the adsorption behavior at low concentrations (3-30 mu g l-1) in simulated seawater was also investigated. therefore, pan-lys can be potentially utilized for the efficient removal of u(vi) from seawater.

machine_design	inspired by the matrix-based methods used in feature extraction and selection, one matrix-pattern-oriented classification framework has been designed in our previous work and demonstrated to utilize one matrix pattern itself more effectively to improve the classification performance in practice. however, this matrix-based framework neglects the prior structural information of the whole input space that is made up of all the matrix patterns. this paper aims to overcome such flaw through taking advantage of one structure learning method named alternative robust local embedding (arle). as a result, a new regularization term r-gl is designed, expected to simultaneously represent the globality and the locality of the whole data domain, further boosting the existing matrix-based classification method. to our knowledge, it is the first trial to introduce both the globality and the locality of the whole data space into the matrixized classifier design. in order to validate the proposed approach, the designed rgi is applied into the previous work matrix-pattern-oriented ho-kashyap classifier (matmhks) to construct a new globalized and localized matmhks named glmatmhks. the experimental results on a broad range of data validate that glmatmhks not only inherits the advantages of the matrixized learning, but also uses the prior structural information more reasonably to guide the classification machine design.

materials_engineering	it is increasingly common to encounter materials researchers engaged in the collaborative analysis and transformation of large-scale scientific data over extended periods of time. a scalable system for managing, tracing, exploring and communicating the analysis of diverse scientific data is required for these researchers. nowadays dataspaces systems offer a pay-as-you-go approach to data management, which offer services on the data in place, without losing the context surrounding the data. thus, we define a model and architecture for a virtual dataspaces (vds) capable of addressing this requirement. the automatic construction process of the virtual dataspaces model (vdm) is described in detail for effectively organising multi-source and heterogeneous data resources. furthermore, the dynamic evolution algorithm of vds is analysed and designed for timely tracking of the life cycle of the data resources. such a system could bring increases facilitating discovery, understanding and sharing of both scientific data resources. an application case in the field of materials engineering is described to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

fluid_mechanics	a multi-pump, multi-piston power take-off wave energy converter ((mppto)-p-2 wec) has been proposed for use with a novel renewable energy harvester termed the ocean grazer. the (mppto)-p-2 wec utilizes wave motion to pump via buoys connected to pistons working fluid within a closed circuit and store it as potential energy that can be converted to electricity via turbines. this paper introduces the mechanical design and model-based performance prediction of a single-piston pump that constitutes the basic building block for the (mppto)-p-2 wec. results provide preliminary validation of aqueous lubrication as a viable means of reducing friction and wear, suggesting that water-based hydraulic fluids can prohibit solid contact at the piston-cylinder interface while reducing volumetric leakage, and allowing for an estimation of the energy extraction efficiency for the mechanical pumping system. pending more thorough and extended tribological investigations using the methodology introduced in this paper, findings suggest that the overall system efficiency will be dictated by the hydrodynamics of the buoys actuating the pumping system.

fluid_mechanics	objectives-dissipative energy loss derived from vector flow mapping represents the viscous dissipation of turbulent blood flow. we aimed to determine the left ventricular (lv) energy loss in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). methods-patients with esrd and a preserved lv ejection fraction, who consisted of a group receiving peritoneal dialysis, a group receiving hemodialysis, and a group receiving preparation for dialysis initiation, were examined by echocardiography; a group of healthy control participants were examined as well. vector flow mapping analysis was then performed from the apical 4-chamber view to calculate the energy loss during diastole and systole in the left ventricle. results-conventional transthoracic echocardiography and lv energy loss calculations were successfully performed in 63 cases and 50 controls. the patients with esrd had significantly higher diastolic energy loss [median (interquartile range), 71.73 (46.08-106.75) versus 23.32 (17.17-29.26) mw/m; p < .001] and higher systolic energy loss [25.28 (19.03-33.93) versus 12.52 (9.35-16.47) mw/m; p < .001]. a significant difference in diastolic energy loss between the peritoneal dialysis and preparation groups was found [54.92 (39.28-89.94) versus 84.82 (62.58-171.4) mw/m; p = .04]. in patients with esrd, the log-transformed diastolic energy loss had a significant association with the peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (p=.011), peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity-to-peak early diastolic mitral annular flow velocity ratio (p = .001), lv mass index (p = .017), and heart rate (p = .003). conclusions-impaired blood flow efficiency was detected in patients with esrd by using dissipative energy loss derived from vector flow mapping. the energy loss value could be a novel parameter for evaluating the ventricular workload of uremic hearts in terms of fluid mechanics.
computer-aided_design	objectives: orbital surgery is a challenging procedure because of its complex anatomy. training could especially benefit from dedicated study models. the currently available devices lack sufficient anatomical representation and realistic soft tissue properties. hence, we developed a 3d-printed simulation device for orbital surgery with tactual (haptic) correct simulation of all relevant anatomical structures. design, setting, and participants: based on computed tomography scans collected from patients treated in a third referral center, the hard and soft tissue were segmented and virtually processed to generate a 3d-model of the orbit. hard tissue was then physically realized by 3d printing. the soft tissue was manufactured by a composite silicone model of the nucleus and the surrounding tissue over a negative mold model also generated by 3d-printing. the final model was evaluated by a group of 5 trainees in oral and maxillofacial surgery (1) and a group of 5 consultants (2). all participants were asked to reconstruct an isolated orbital floor defect with a titanium implant. a stereotactic navigation system was available to all participants. their experience was evaluated for haptic realism, correct representation of surgical approach, general handling of model, insertion of implant into the orbit, placement and fixation of implant, and usability of navigated control. the items were evaluated via nonparametric statistics (1 [poor]-5 [good]). results: group 1 gave an average mark of 4.0 (+/- 0.9) versus 4.6 (+/- 0.6) by group 2. the haptics were rated as 3.6 (+/- 1.1) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.8) [2]. the surgical approach was graded 3.7 (+/- 1.2) [1] and 4.0 (+/- 1.0) [2]. handling of the models was rated 3.5 (+/- 1.1) [1] and 4 (+/- 0.7) [2]. the insertion of the implants was marked as 3.7 (+/- 0.8) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.8) [2]. fixation of the implants was also perceived to be,realistic with 3.6 (+/- 0.9) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.45) [2]. lastly, surgical navigation was rated 3.8 (+/- 0.8) [1] and 4.6 (+/- 0.56) [2]. conclusion: in this project, all relevant hard and soft tissue characteristics of orbital anatomy could be realized. moreover, it was possible to demonstrate that the entire workflow of an orbital procedure may be simulated. hence, using this model training expenses may be reduced and patient security could be enhanced.

internal_combustion_engine	the dynamic model proposed by charlette et al. represents an interesting alternative to the fsd balance equation to predict the transient growth of a flame kernel. the dynamic wrinkling model coupled to the algebraic flame surface density (fsd) model of boger et al. is here evaluated for the first time in an internal combustion engine configuration. preliminary tests enable to evidence practical difficulties when applying the model to this type of complex configuration. improvements are proposed to adapt the model to the engine configuration. final simulations are performed on a spark ignition engine configuration, using both the adapted dynamic model and an equilibrium wrinkling formulation. the results are compared to the ones obtained by robert et al. on the same configuration using the ecfm-les model solving a fsd balance equation. the dynamic model proves to very well predict out-of-equilibrium values and to account for cycle-to-cycle variabilities, as the model parameter is calculated on the fly. on the contrary, the results obtained using the equilibrium formulation clearly demonstrate that the flame-turbulence equilibrium assumption is not adapted to such configurations.

machine_design	in using a fly cutter to machine potassium dihydrogen phosphate (kdp) crystals, rippling in machined surfaces will remain that will have a significant impact on the optical performance. an analysis of these lowspatial frequency ripples is presented and its influence on the root-mean-squared gradient (grms) of the wavefront discussed. a frequency analysis of the machined kdp crystal surfaces is performed using wavelet transform and power spectral density methods. based on a classification of the time frequencies for these macroripples, the multimode vibration of the machine tool is found to be the main reason surface ripples are produced. improvements in the machine design parameters are proposed to limit such effects on the wavefront performance of the kdp crystal.

hydraulics	as a key component in accelerator driven system (ads), the spallation target is exposed to high irradiation intensity radiation, and a larger amount of heat is deposited on it. therefore, the cooling of the target is a challenging task in the target design. integrated target module with a solid beam window, and cooled by reactor primary coolant is a good contender for ads system. the numerical analysis of two target modules was performed by using finite element code to assess the target cooling capacity. it was found that with uniform inlet velocity, the geometry modification of the inlet could improve the heat transfer effectively. but with non-uniform inlet velocity, the geometry modification of the inlet had little effect on cooling capacity.

strength_of_materials	the aim of this paper is to study the shear transfer mechanism through the horizontal contact surface of two rigid blocks. the shear resistance offered by this contact interface is the main mechanism mobilized by the structural elements of many ancient stone dry-masonry structures in order to transfer horizontal actions from earthquakes and wind forces to the foundation. in some cases a certain connection exists between two blocks at the contact surface, which is materialized by wooden or metal parts at the central area of the blocks (poles, empolia). the role of this connection in transferring horizontal forces and its influence on the seismic behaviour is a point long debated by the research community. cyclic experiments were performed at the laboratory of strength of materials and structures of aristotle university of thessaloniki-greece in order to study this sliding behaviour at the interface between two rigid blocks. the experimental sequence under investigation can be divided into two groups. the first group includes specimens without any connection between the rigid blocks, while the second group includes specimens with poles and empolia connecting the rigid blocks. during all tests the imposed cyclic horizontal sliding displacement was combined with constant level of vertical load applied at the top of the upper block. through this experimental process, it became possible to describe the shear transfer mechanism through diagrams of horizontal sliding displacement versus horizontal load, and study the effects on the shear transfer behaviour between these rigid blocks without or with the connection with poles and empolia between them. numerical finite element simulations of this shear transfer mechanism were also performed utilizing two commercial finite element software packages.
computer-aided_design	objective: to fabricate orthodontic brackets from esthetic materials and determine their fracture resistance during archwire torsion.. materials and methods: computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology (cerec inlab, sirona) was used to mill brackets with a 0.018 x 0.025-inch slot. materials used were paradigm mz100 and lava ultimate resin composite (3m espe), mark ii feldspathic porcelain (vita zahnfabrik), and in-ceram yz zirconia (vita zahnfabrik). ten brackets of each material were subjected to torque by a 0.018 x 0.025-inch stainless steel archwire (g&h) using a specially designed apparatus. the average moments and degrees of torsion necessary to fracture the brackets were determined and compared with those of commercially available alumina brackets, mystique mb (dentsply gac). results: the yz brackets were statistically significantly stronger than any other tested material in their resistance to torsion (p < .05). the mean torques at failure ranged from 3467 g.mm for mark ii to 11,902 g.mm for yz. the mean torsion angles at failure ranged from 15.3 to 40.9 degrees. conclusion: zirconia had the highest torsional strength among the tested esthetic brackets. resistance of mz100 and lava ultimate composite resin brackets to archwire torsion was comparable to commercially available alumina ceramic brackets.
thermodynamics	water soluble amphiphilic anion receptors based on urea-substituted 13-cyclodextrin were synthesized via a copper(i) mediated azide-alkyne coupling reaction. the synthetic route was designed to minimize the number of operations of cyclodextrins. stable products were obtained in 90% yield. they were successfully tested as amino acid receptors, showing excellent affinity constants (10(3)-10(4)m(-1)) in a highly competitive environment (ph 8 phosphate-buffered water solution). isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that complex formation strongly depends on the hydrophobic nature of the guest and that the urea moiety of the receptor is necessary to efficiently bind amino acids.

fluid_mechanics	the simple phenomenon of a water drop falling onto a glass plate may seem like a trivial fluid mechanics problem. however, detailed imaging has shown that this process is highly complex and a small air-bubble is always entrapped under the drop when it makes contact with the solid. this bubble can interfere with the uniformity of spray coatings and degrade inkjet fabrication of displays etc. we will describe how we use high-speed interferometry at 5 million frames per second to understand the details of this process. as the impacting drop approaches the solid, the dynamics are characterized by a balance between the lubrication pressure in the thin air layer and the inertia of the bot-tom of the drop. this deforms the drop, forming a dimple at its bottom and making the drop touch the surface along a ring, thereby entrapping the air-layer, which is typically 1-3 mu m thick. this air-layer can be highly compressed and the deceleration of the bottom of the drop can be as large as 300,000 g. we describe how the thicknessevolution of the lubricating air-layer is extracted from following the interference fringes between frames. two-color interferometry is also used to extract absolute layer thicknesses. finally, we identify the effects of nanometric surface roughness on the first contact of the drop with the substrate. here we need to resolve the 100 nm thickness changes occurring during 200 ns intervals, requiring these state of the art high-speed cameras. surprisingly, we see a ring of micro-bubbles marking the first contact of the drop with the glass, only for microscope slides, which have a typical roughness of 20 nm, while such rings are absent for drop impacts onto molecularly smooth mica surfaces.
thermodynamics	we describe a quantitative model for heat separation in a fluid due to motion along a pressure gradient. the physical model involved is relevant to one explanation for the temperature separation in a vortex tube. this effect has a point of saturation in which the fluid 's temperature and pressure are related at its boundaries by an adiabatic law. vortex tube models sometimes assume that this saturation is achieved in physical devices. we conclude that this is likely to be a safe assumption much of the time, but we describe circumstances in which saturation might not be achieved. we propose a test of our model of temperature separation.

materials_engineering	the goal of the study was to find a cost-effective composition of a particle reinforced composite that is light in weight but has sufficient mechanical properties. the matrix of the particulate composite is unsaturated polyester resin that is reinforced with alumina trihydrate particles. part of the alumina trihydrate proportion was replaced with hollow glass microspheres to reduce weight and save costs. in order to find out the influence of the light filler on the physical and mechanical properties of composites, materials with different percentages of the light filler were prepared. test specimens were cut from moulded sheets that were fabricated with vacuum assisted extruder. tensile strength, indentation hardness measured with a barcol impressor, and density were determined. based on the experimental data a multi-criteria optimization problem was formulated and solved to find the optimal design of the material. artificial neural networks and a hybrid genetic algorithm were used. the optimal solution is given as a pareto curve to represent the distinction between the density and selected mechanical properties of the composite material. the composite material filled with 6% hollow glass microspheres showed 3% loss in the tensile strength and 26% loss in the surface hardness compared to the composition without the filler. the weight decreased by 13% compared with the initial composition. the addition of hollow glass microspheres did not lower the net value of the material, it increased 7%.
machine_design	purpose - the purpose of this paper is to focus on the machine design and control strategy of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (pmsg) system, especially utilized in variable speed applications, in order to stabilize the output voltage on the dc link over a wide speed range. design/methodology/approach - different ac/dc power converter topologies are comparatively studied, each with an accordingly designed pmsg, so as to investigate the influence of the armature winding inductance as well as the relationship between the pmsg and power converter topologies. findings - pulse width modulation (pwm) rectifier is preferable for the said application due to its good performance and controllability. moreover, by employing the pwm rectifier, relatively large inductance of the pmsg is considered for both short-circuit current reduction and field regulation. originality/value - field-regulating control is realized with a space vector pwm (svpwm) rectifier, which can weaken the pmsg magnetic field during high-speed operation, while even properly enhance the field at low speed, ensuring a small change of the pmsg output voltage and a stable dc voltage.
materials_engineering	critical metals are significantly important in the preparation of high-tech materials associated with applications on, e.g., renewable energy, sustainable materials engineering and cleaner production. this importance together with supply risk to a substantial extent within the european union (eu) has pushed their recovery from waste being highlighted. electronic waste, usually from end-of-life electronic products, is a notable secondary resource for this purpose because of its distinctive features. a range of critical metals, including rareearth metals, indium, cobalt and valuable metals, such as copper, silver and gold, are possibly recovered from electronic waste. on top of the current practices of electronic waste recycling, it requires innovations on technology and breakthroughs on process design in order to promote critical metal recovery or electronic waste treatment (in general) to be green and sustainable. significant potentials are more and more noticed from hydrochemistry (metallurgy) technologies (processes) that contribute to this development because of its flexibility, relatively high recovery rate and extraction selectivity of critical metals, and possibilities of eliminating secondary waste. in this review, critical evaluation is carried out on the aspects of (1) understanding the features of different hydrochemistry processes for recycling of (critical) metals from electronic waste; (2) identifying the difficulties for a process to be implemented into industrial application which still originate from the high complexity of electronic waste and the secondary waste generation, e.g., wastewater; (3) defining circulability of metals to be recovered and recognizing their potentials to zero waste scheme. according to the evaluation, sustainable even zero waste processing is expected to be achieved for electronic waste treatment in the long term that it is preferred to reduce or prevent the generation of electronic waste and improve material efficiency from the whole life cycle of electronic products.
machine_design	the performance of a reluctance synchronous machine (rsm) strongly depends on the well-designed geometry of the stator and rotor. within the intention of a high torque and a high power factor both, the difference and the ratio of the direct- and quadrature inductance must be set to a maximum. in this paper an easy (semi-)analytic design method is used to determine these inductances for a reluctance machine with a standard induction machine stator and a multiple flux-barrier rotor. by varying the rotor and stator dimensions, such as the bore diameter and slot geometry, the effect on the difference and the ratio of the inductances and therefore on the output performance parameters is studied. for the analysis a simplified analytical model, such as a magnetic circuit model of the reluctance synchronous machine is created and solved iteratively. the rsm leakage inductances are determined by using the same analytical equations as used for induction motors. an optimum design for various objective functions like maximum torque, maximum torque per kva and maximum torque per volume is found, by the means of the analytic model. as a result important conclusions are achieved, regarding the stator and rotor design, respectively.
machine_design	conventional mri protocols are an integral part of routine clinical imaging in pediatric patients. the advent of several newer mri techniques provides crucial insight into the structural integrity and functional aspects of the developing brain, especially with the introduction of 3t mri systems in clinical practice. the field of pediatric neuroimaging continues to evolve, with greater emphasis on high spatial resolution, faster scan time, as well as a quest for visualization of the functional aspects of the human brain. mr vendors are increasingly focusing on optimizing mr technology to make it suitable for children, in whom as compared to adults the head size is usually smaller and demonstrates inherent neuroanatomical differences relating to brain development. the eventual goal of these advances would be to evolve as potential biomarkers for predicting neurodevelopment outcomes and prognostication, in addition to their utility in routine diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. advanced mr techniques like diffusion tensor imaging, functional mri, mr perfusion, spectroscopy, volumetric imaging and arterial spin labeling add to our understanding of normal brain development and pathophysiology of various neurological disease processes. this review is primarily focused on outlining advanced mr techniques and their current and potential pediatric neuroimaging applications as well as providing a brief overview of advances in hardware and machine design.
materials_engineering	deformation asymmetry of magnesium alloys is an important factor on machine design in the automobile industry. represented by the ratio of compressive yield stress (cys) against tensile yield stress (tys), deformation asymmetry is strongly related to texture and grain size. a polycrystalline viscoplasticity model, modified intermediate phi-model, is used to predict the deformation behavior of magnesium alloys with different grain sizes. validated with experimental results, integrated computational materials engineering is applied to find out the route in achieving desired asymmetry via thermomechanical processing. for example, cys/tys in rolled texture is smaller than 1 under different loading directions. in other textures, such as extruded texture, cys/tys is large along the normal direction. starting from rolled texture, asymmetry will increase to close to 1 along the rolling direction after being compressed to a strain of 0.2. our modified phi-model also shows that grain refinement increases cys/tys. along with texture control, grain refinement also can optimize the yield asymmetry. after the grain size decreases to a critical value, cys/tys reaches to 1 because cys increases much faster than tys. by tailoring the microstructure using texture control and grain refinement, it is achievable to optimize yield asymmetry in wrought magnesium alloys. published by elsevier b.v.
computer-aided_design	in this work, an inas-based gate-all-around (gaa) arch-shaped tunneling field-effect transistor (tfet) was designed and analyzed using technology computer-aided design (tcad) simulations. to progress the dc/rf characteristics of gaa arch-shaped tfet, inas, a highly attractive iii-v compound material, is adopted as a channel material. owing to the gaa arch-shaped structure of tfet, the tunneling region under the gate area is extended, and the on-state current (i-on) and subthreshold-swing (s) are improved. however, it has some performance limitations that are related to the height of the source region (h-source) and the epitaxially grown thickness of the channel (t(epi)). thus, we performed a design optimization of the inas-based gaa arch-shaped tfet with the variables h-source and t(epi). after the optimization process, rf characteristics such as gate capacitance, transconductance (g(m)), cutoff frequency (f(t)), and maximum oscillation frequency (f(max)) were extracted and analyzed by small-signal rf modeling. finally, the designed inas-based gaa arch-shaped tfet demonstrated an i-on of 10.6 ma/mu m, s of 6.5 mv/dec, f(t) of 2.3 thz, and f(max) of 20 thz.
internal_combustion_engine	in practice, for effective exhaust waste heat recovery, a heat exchanger must exhibit a high heat transfer performance and a reasonable pressure drop to achieve a high net power output. therefore, a complete numerical thermoelectric generator (teg) model used for engine exhaust gas heat recovery is presented in this paper, based on a common plate-type exhaust heat exchanger. the model not only considered the temperature gradient along the fluid flow direction, but also included the fluid heat transfer and the flow resistance characteristics. the interaction relationships between the exchanger scales, heat transfer and flow resistance characteristics, and thermoelectric performance were mainly studied in this study by numerical simulations using the fortran program. results show that the high teg power can be achieved at the small cross section area, and corresponding to a small optimal module area. a small height is required when the cross section area is constant. to obtain the maximum net power with fluid flow resistance, the optimal cross section area should be 0.0056 m(2), with the optimal scales at a height of 0.005 m, and length of 0.56 m, when applied in an automotive vehicle. exchanger scales are available in a wide optimal design range to help achieve a high net power output, if the scale optimization match is met.

manufacturing_engineering	this paper describes how the manufacturing engineering technology (mnet) program at south dakota state university (sdsu) is using lean production techniques to map the educational outcomes across the curriculum. as a part of the accreditation review process, the mnet program has undertaken a project to determine whether the outcomes used in the program provide value to the constituents. a student research team has been assembled to value stream map the mnet program educational process. the needs of the customer, or educational outcomes that provide value, were determined through surveys and interviews with constituents of the program. a future state map will be developed and compared to a current state value stream map. using the information gleaned from these maps, the curriculum can be critically evaluated and changed to better meet the needs of its constituents.
computer-aided_design	data conversion from a 3d raster to spiral coordinates is the key function in the scanning process for roll powder sintering (rps) additive manufacturing technology. conversion process is especially important, as it produces the basis for a processed object. there are many equations for such conformal transformation, but there is still room to improve the computation efficiency. this paper presents an efficient conversion algorithm, which processes 3d objects and linear transforming it into rolling ribbon. the new algorithm has several significant advantages over the old ones due to applying only one main linear equation. the program based on the linear algorithm is simpler, more compact and faster in comparison to other programs which use trigonometric, transcendental or other equations. the proposed algorithm has been developed and extensively tested on several parts of computer-aided design models for rps processing.
computer-aided_design	milling is a crucial step in producing restorations using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) systems. in this study the trueness of currently available milling devices was evaluated. thirty clinical cases (ten inlays, ten crowns, ten onlays) were milled from ceramic blocks using four different milling approaches: five axis with imes coritec 450i, four axis with cerec mcxl, four axis with cerec mcxl-ef and five axis with inlab mcx5. the milled restorations were scanned and the occlusal and inner surfaces compared to the originally calculated 3d surface using difference analysis software. the (90-10 %) / 2 percentile of the distances were calculated and analysed using one-way anova with the post hoc scheff, test (alpha = 0.05). chipping of marginal areas were visually examined and analysed using one-way anova with a post hoc tamhane test (alpha = 0.05). at inner surfaces, the milling trueness of imes (33.9 +/- 16.3 mu m), x5 (32.3 +/- 9.7 mu m) and mcxl-ef (34.4 +/- 7.5 mu m) was significantly better (p < 0.001) than that of mcxl (62.1 +/- 17.1 mu m). at occlusal surfaces, mcxl-ef (25.7 +/- 9.3 mu m) showed significant higher accuracy (p < 0.001) than mcxl (48.7 +/- 23.3 mu m) and x5 (40.9 +/- 20.4 mu m). imes produced the most chipping (p < 0.001). five-axis milling devices yield high trueness. mcxl-ef is competitive and may allow chairside fabrication with good milling results. accurate milling is required for well-fitting restorations and thereby requires fewer manual finishing steps, yields smaller marginal gaps, resistance to secondary caries and longevity of restorations.
manufacturing_engineering	glass fiber-reinforced composite materials are finding numerous applications in many engineering and domestic fields due to their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. among the machining processes used, drilling is one of the most important processes and is mainly used in joining of composite structures. maintaining of proper surface roughness in drilled holes is very important and is to be controlled. in the present work prediction of surface roughness in drilling of composite materials is carried out using fuzzy logic. in recent years, fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence has been used in manufacturing engineering for modeling and monitoring. an l27 orthogonal array is used for experimentation. a fuzzy rule-based model is developed to predict the surface roughness in drilling of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (gfrp) composites. good agreement is observed between the model results and experimental values. the analysis of experimental results is carried out using pareto analysis of variance (pareto-anova) and anova and presented in detail.
hydraulics	in the present work, the effect of nonlinear void reactivity on the dynamics of a simplified lumped parameter model for a boiling water reactor (bwr) is investigated. a mathematical model of five differential equations comprising of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics encompassing the nonlinearities associated with both the reactivity feedbacks and the heat transfer process has been used. to this end, we have considered parameters relevant to rbmk for which the void reactivity is known to be nonlinear. a nonlinear analysis of the model exploiting the method of multiple time scales (mmts) predicts the occurrence of the two types of hopf bifurcation, namely subcritical and supercritical, leading to the evolution of limit cycles for a range of parameters. numerical simulations have been performed to verify the analytical results obtained by mmts. the study shows that the nonlinear reactivity has a significant influence on the system dynamics. a parametric study with varying nominal reactor power and operating conditions in coolant channel has also been performed which shows the effect of change in concerned parameter on the boundary between regions of sub- and super-critical hopf bifurcations in the space constituted by the two coefficients of reactivities viz. the void and the doppler coefficient of reactivities. in particular, we find that introduction of a negative quadratic term in the void reactivity feedback significantly increases the supercritical region and dominates in determining the system dynamics.

machine_design	in this paper, a comparative optimal design of permanent magnet motors (pmms) for aerospace actuation applications based on single and double layer fractional slot concentrated winding (fscw) topologies with different motor segmentation strategies is undertaken, by means of a combined electromagnetic, fault tolerance and thermal evaluation. initially, analytical machine equations and 2d finite element (fe) analysis are employed for the determination of the motors basic dimensional and operating characteristics. both configurations considered are in a next step optimized regarding the mean torque, efficiency, torque ripple, induced electromotive force (emf) quality and motor weight. the proposed methodology involves appropriate handling of mean torque and induced emf as constraints through the application of a particular single-objective particle swarm optimization (pso) technique accounting also for multiple motor operating conditions. fault tolerance and thermal robustness of the optimized motors are also examined. both single layer and double layer fscw pmm optimal configurations present complementary advantages for this class of applications.
internal_combustion_engine	we analyse the impact of the current and an alternative stricter eu co2 car legislation on transport related co2 emissions, on the uptake of electric vehicles (ev), on the reduction of oil consumption, and on total energy system costs beyond 2020. we apply a times based energy system model for europe. results for 2030 show that a stricter target of 70 g co2/km for cars could reduce total transport co2 emissions by 5% and oil dependence by more than 2% compared to the current legislation. the stricter regulatory co2 car target is met by a deployment of more efficient internal combustion engine cars and higher shares of ev total system costs increase by less than 1%. the analysis indicates that ev deployment and the decarbonisation of the power system including higher shares of variable renewables can be synergistic. our sensitivity analysis shows that the deployment of ev would sharply increase between 2020 and 2030 at learning rates above 12.5%, reaching shares above 30% in 2030. finally, the study highlights that, besides legislating cars, policies for other transport sectors and modes are needed to curb transport related co2 emission growth by 2030.

hydraulics	the failure of the barlin dam in taiwan, china offers an important case study for evaluating concepts in modeling the rapid erosion and channel recovery following intentional and unplanned dam removals. we present a modeling effort that applied a 1d and quasi-2d uncoupled hydraulics and sediment model (netstars) to evaluate how discretization and parameterization influence thefitofbed elevationpredictions to observations following dam failure. our analysis evaluated the model sensitivity to sediment transport function, active layer thickness, and number of stream tubes used to define the cross-section. results indicate that a) the model is more sensitive to active layer thickness and sediment transport function than to the number of stream tubes, b) development of dam removal models are likely to benefit from varying the active layer thickness in time, and c) increased lateral discretization does not appear to improve model fit in the steep and rapidly changing river environment at our site. we conclude with discussion on differences between, identifying the need for, and general use of 1d, quasi-2d, and fully 2d models in dam removal and failure analysis.

strength_of_materials	in the bachelor degree program of mechanical engineering, strength of materials and statics are among the most fundamental and applied courses. the use of experiments and simulations in order to improve the quality of learning these subjects cannot be overstated. in strength of materials the analysis of pure bending and transverse loading are two important objectives. the similarities and the differences of the behavior of a structure to these types of loadings should be understood thoroughly. these behaviors are similar in terms of generating bending stresses; but they are different when it comes to producing shear stresses. during teaching strength of materials for many years, the second author has experienced that many students have problem in differentiating these phenomena. the problem is that students obviously cannot see the different values of internal forces and stresses in these cases. these concepts have been usually taught in lectures using diagrams, formulas and textbooks. this method can be improved by giving students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and to use cad software for simulations. such an experience also provides a means for comparing theoretical, simulation and experimental results. in this research, to address the mentioned need, two devices are designed, fabricated and tested. the main question to be answered by using these devices is,. how the transverse loading of a beam compares with the pure bending of the same beam?"" to answer this question, in this research two devices are designed and constructed. each device consists of a beam with two polymethyl methacrylate (pmma, or simply, plexiglas) layers. loads are applied on these beams in order to produce either transverse loading or pure bending moment. for analyzing pure bending, a four-point bending set up is fabricated. for shear force generation in transverse loading, tip load is applied on the cantilever beam. pasta is used as a test specimen to identify in which of these two cases shear force generates. these experiments are augmented with computer simulation and theoretical results and used in classrooms at the university of southern maine (usm). the objective is to facilitate the understanding of a concept that is usually difficult for students to comprehend using traditional teaching methods. also, for using in a statics course, a separate test setup for analyzing the equilibrium of a hinged bar subjected to a tip force is designed and built. the tip force is applied and measured using a spring scale. there are three parameters that can be varied in this device. these are the bar mass and angle as well as the angle of the applied loading. students will use this device in the statics course to explore the concept of the moment of a force as well as to compare theoretical and experimental predictions of the load needed for maintaining the equilibrium of the bar.
materials_engineering	small-scale fixed-bed coal and biomass gasifiers represent an attractive option for distributed combined heat and power generation. as known, gasification phenomena are very complex, involving drying, devolatilization, pyrolysis, heterogeneous and homogenous reactions, with a large number of intermediate and final products. gasification processes are also influenced by reaction kinetics and fluid-dynamical effects, such as temperature and concentration gradients. for this reason, simulation models are able to predict gasifiers performance under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium only if the gasification process takes place at a known temperature and the reaction time is lower than the reactants residence time. as a consequence, for fixed-bed gasifiers equilibrium models must consider drying and devolatilization taking place at lower temperature in the heat transfer zone, where solid feed is heated by syngas. therefore, moisture and volatiles are not involved in the gasification reactions since they are released before reaching the reaction zone. several models based on steady-state and one-dimensional representations have been developed to reproduce gasification processes in fixed-bed reactors. these models have been found adequate to provide information for engineering design and process optimization. in this framework a steady-state simulation model has been developed at the department of mechanical chemical and materials engineering (dimcm) of the university of cagliari by using the aspen plus computer code for predicting performance of small-scale up-draft fixed-bed coal gasifiers. the model can be used to evaluate the mass and energy balance in each zone of the gasifier and the main characteristics of the syngas produced by the gasification process (composition, mass flow, temperature, heating value, etc.). this paper describes the model and presents the main results of a parametric analysis, which shows how the gasification process is influenced by the main operating parameters. moreover, the results of the model have been compared with the experimental results of an up-draft gasifier fed with an lignite from alaska. the above-mentioned gasifier is part of a pilot gasification and gas treatment plant built at the sotacarbo research centre in sardinia, italy. the comparison shows that the model well represents the performance of the pilot-scale unit.

materials_engineering	a group of teachers of materials engineering degree belongs to the organizing committee of next national conference on composite materials spain that will be held in rey juan carlos university (madrid, spain) in 2015. the objective of this new ects experience is to involve twenty students of the fourth year in the organization and development of the conference. each activity will be worth up to 2 ects in the rey juan carlos university. the proposed activities are related to two subjects that belong to composite materials discipline: "" composite materials"" (third year) and "" manufacturing of composite materials"" (fourth year). the six activities are the following: 1) review of the proceedings submitted by the participants of the conference; 2) design a poster based on the composite materials manufacturing techniques at the labs of rey juan carlos university; 3) student stand; 4) explanation of a conference poster by a student; 5) proofreading and layout of the conference proceedings; and 6) participation of the students in the organization of the conference. for example, in the first activity the students will review some papers which will have been revised previously by the teachers who will have made modifications to insert errors that the students should detect. the modifications will be related to the order of magnitude and units of the physical properties of the materials, scale and axis of the graphs, conditions of manufacturing processes, etc. the review activity will give to the students the opportunity of develop the general competences of critical reasoning, ability to apply the knowledge to the practice, etc., and the specific ones related to composite materials. besides, it will be a good experience for the students to attend this conference. the conferences will be related to the last advances in composite materials and the more relevant companies of this sector will be present in two of the plenary sessions and in stands.
fluid_mechanics	in this study, we explore how blood-material interactions and hemodynamics are impacted by rendering a clinical quality 25 mm st. jude medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve (bmhv) superhydrophobic (sh) with the aim of reducing thrombo-embolic complications associated with bmhvs. basic cell adhesion is evaluated to assess blood-material interactions, while hemodynamic performance is analyzed with and without the sh coating. results show that a sh coating with a receding contact angle (ca) of 160a degrees strikingly eliminates platelet and leukocyte adhesion to the surface. alternatively, many platelets attach to and activate on pyrolytic carbon (receding ca = 47), the base material for bmhvs. we further show that the performance index increases by 2.5% for coated valve relative to an uncoated valve, with a maximum possible improved performance of 5%. both valves exhibit instantaneous shear stress below 10 n/m(2) and reynolds shear stress below 100 n/m(2). therefore, a sh bmhv has the potential to relax the requirement for antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug regimens typically required for patients receiving mhvs by minimizing blood-material interactions, while having a minimal impact on hemodynamics. we show for the first time that sh-coated surfaces may be a promising direction to minimize thrombotic complications in complex devices such as heart valves.
fluid_mechanics	displacement ventilation (dv) systems were initially developed as an efficient buoyant pollutant removal strategy for scandinavian industrial halls in the 1970 's. in the following decades these systems started to be used in mechanical cooling of office buildings and auditoriums. designing displacement ventilation systems is more challenging than conventional overhead mixing systems. most dv system designs require simplified modeling tools. existing simplified models of dv were validated using air temperature measurements performed in test cells that cannot reproduce the conditions that exist in large rooms with thermally active boundary conditions. there is a lack of measurements that investigate the performance of dv systems in occupied large rooms. with the goal of reducing this knowledge gap, this paper presents a set of detailed temperature and co2 measurements in two occupied large rooms with recently designed dv systems. the measurements were performed.in two recently refurbished rooms located in lisbon: a large concert hall and an adjacent orchestra rehearsal room. the measurements and subsequent analysis were used to assess the actual performance of large room, state of the art, dv systems. in addition, these measurements were used to determine the modeling error of the three-node dv model implemented in energyplus when simulating large rooms. comparison between simulations and measurements revealed a good agreement: the average simulation error obtained by averaging the error of all measurements in all temperature nodes is 5.9%, with the largest deviation occurring in the floor level node (7.1% approximate to 0.4 degrees c) average simulation error of 5.9% (the average of error of all measurements in all nodes).

internal_combustion_engine	significant high levels of available waste tires in brazil, which reached approximately 473 thousand tons in 2015, offer an attractive potential for their use as fuel in advanced thermal conversion processes. technologies for energetic valorization of waste tires were reviewed and two alternatives based on updraft gasification in a modified reactor design were proposed. first of all, a large-scale updraft gasifier on igcc (integrated gasification combined cycle) was considered for the gasification of the derived fuel from waste tires, capable to produce between 10.8 and 16.1 mj of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. the second alternative considered a small-scale updraft gasifier feeding an internal combustion engine, coupled to an electricity generator for the production of up to 8.2 mj of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. implementation of these technologies will allow energetic valorization of waste tires in brazil, solving their disposal problems, creating jobs, reducing negative disposal environmental impacts in landfills, and increasing distributed generation of electricity.
materials_engineering	three-dimensional core-shell organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells with tunable properties are demonstrated via electropolymerization. air-stable poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (pedot) shells with controlled thicknesses are rapidly coated onto periodic gaas nanopillar arrays conformally, preserving the vertical 3d structure. the properties of the organic layer can be readily tuned in situ, allowing for (1) the lowering of the highest occupied molecular orbital level (vertical bar delta e vertical bar similar to 0.28 ev), leading to the increase of open-circuit voltage (v-oc), and (2) an improvement in pedot conductivity that results in enhanced short-circuit current densities (j(sc)). the incorporation of various anionic dopants in the polymer during the coating process also enables the tailoring of the polymer/semiconductor interface transport properties. systematic tuning of the device properties results in a j(sc) of 13.6 ma cm(-2), v-oc of 0.63 v, peak external quantum efficiency of 58.5%, leading to a power conversion efficiencies of 4.11%.
strength_of_materials	the shock tests of set of metals show that together with well-known dynamic strength-characteristics of material such as dynamic yielding limit and spall strength, the additional characteristics, namely, threshold of structural instability under shock compression, defect of the velocity at the plateau of compressive pulse and particle velocity variance at the mesoscale should be introduced into analysis of dynamic strength of materials. the structural instability threshold registered in uniaxial strain conditions allows the resistance to penetration in tate-alekseevskii equation to be determined. copyright (c) 2016 the authors. published by elsevier b.v.
materials_engineering	stagnation flow, an import research branch of fluid mechanics, describing the fluid motion near the stagnation region, exists on all solid bodies moving in a fluid. and stagnation point boundary layer flow problems described by partial differential equations have attracted many scholars' attention nowadays. these problems have become difficult and hot in the study of applied mathematics, mechanics and materials engineering. this paper has transformed the governing boundary layer equations into a system of nonlinear differential equations through the similarity transformation, and the analytical approximations of solutions are derived by homotopy analysis method (ham). in addition, the effects of physical factors (such as the slip parameter, magnetic field parameter and reynolds number) on the flow are examed and discussed graphically. they have a great impact on the speed.
hydraulics	in recent years, the validity of embolism quantification methods has been questioned, especially for long-vesseled plants. some studies have suggested that cutting xylem while under tension, even under water, might generate artificial cavitation. accordingly, a rehydration procedure prior to hydraulic measurements has been recommended to avoid this artefact. on the other hand, concerns have been raised that xylem refilling might occur when samples are rehydrated. here, we explore the potential biases affecting embolism quantification for grapevine (vitis vinifera l.) petioles harvested under tension or after xylem relaxation. we employ direct visualization of embolism through x-ray micro-computed tomography (microct) to test for the occurrence of fast refilling (artifactually low per cent loss of conductivity (plc) due to rehydration prior to sample harvest) as well as excision-induced embolism (artifactually high embolism due to air introduction during harvest). additionally, we compared the response functions of both stomatal regulation and xylem embolism to xylem pressure (i-x). short-time (20aeuro...min) xylem tension relaxation prior to the hydraulic measurement resulted in a lower degree of embolism than found in samples harvested under native tensions, and yielded xylem vulnerability curves similar to the ones obtained using direct microct visualization. much longer periods of hydration (overnight) were required before xylem refilling was observed to occur. in field-grown vines, over 85% of stomatal closure occurred at less negative i-x than that required to induce 12% plc. our results demonstrate that relaxation of xylem tension prior to hydraulic measurement allows for the reliable quantification of native embolism in grapevine petioles. furthermore, we find that stomatal regulation is sufficiently conservative to avoid transpiration-induced cavitation. these results suggest that grapevines have evolved a strategy of cavitation resistance, rather than one of cavitation tolerance (diurnal cycles of embolism and repair).
internal_combustion_engine	alternative fuels on internal combustion engine (ice) recently has become an attention due to the concern for environmental protection, and needs on reducing dependency on fossil fuels and meeting the current stringent regulation. alcohol fuel is one of the attractive alternative fuels as it can be produced from renewable resources and is oxygenated. methanol fuel is a well-known alcohol fuel that can be blended at the lower blending ratio with gasoline and produce better engine operation in spark ignition engine. however, there is a problem related to its methanol properties, especially on its energy content and vapour lock characteristics. alcohol with higher carbon number such as iso-butanol has high energy content and is able to displace more petroleum gasoline compared to the methanol-gasoline blended fuel. in this study, the focus on the effect of the iso-butanol additive in the methanol-gasoline fuel of unmodified spark ignition engines. a lower ratio of methanol-gasoline blends (m5) was blended with the isobutanol additive for 5 to 15% with 5% increment compared with base gasoline fuel. tests were conducted at constant load (100%) with a variable of lower engine speed range from 1000 rpm to 2500 rpm. the results indicate that as for engine performance, m5b15 displayed improvement in engine brake power, bte (brake thermal efficiency), and egt (exhaust gas temperature) compared to other blended fuels. nevertheless, there is a higher fuel consumption was recorded for all methanol-gasoline blended fuels with iso-butanol additive compared to base gasoline fuel. in terms of engine emissions, m5b15 gives a significant reduction in co and hc emissions compared to base gasoline fuel. however, the increasing trend projected by nox and co2 emissions had been recorded in all iso-butanol additive in methanol gasoline fuels with m5b15 exerting the highest emissions. it can be concluded that iso-butanol additives are a viable option to be blended with existing lower ratio of methanol-gasoline for spark ignition engine operation as an alternative fuel.

strength_of_materials	in this paper, a unified solution method is presented for the classical beam theory. in strength of materials approach, the geometry, material properties and load system are known and related with the unknowns of forces, moments, slopes and deformations by applying a classical differential analysis in addition to equilibrium, constitutive, and kinematic laws. all these relations are expressed in a unified formulation for the classical beam theory. in the special case of simple beams, a system of four linear ordinary differential equations of first order represents the general mechanical behaviour of a straight beam. these equations are solved using the numerical differential quadrature method (dqm). the application of dqm has the advantages of mathematical consistency and conceptual simplicity. the numerical procedure is simple and gives clear understanding. this systematic way of obtaining influence line, bending moment, shear force diagrams and deformed shape for the beams with geometric and load discontinuities has been discussed in this paper. buckling loads and natural frequencies of any beam prismatic or non-prismatic with any type of support conditions can be evaluated with ease.
hydraulics	nitrogen (n) deposition is expected to have great impact on forest ecosystems by affecting many aspects of plant environmental interactions, one of which involves its influences on plant water relations through modifications of plant hydraulic architecture. however, there is a surprising lack of integrative study on tree hydraulic architecture responses to n deposition, especially at the whole-plant level. in the present study, we used a 5-year n addition experiment to simulate the effects of six different levels of n deposition (20-120 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) on growth and whole-plant hydraulic conductance of a dominant tree species (fraxinus mandshurica rupr.) from the typical temperate forest of ne china. the results showed that alleviation of n limitation by moderate concentrations of fertilization (20-80 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) promoted plant growth, but further n additions on top of the threshold level showed negative effects on plant growth. growth responses of f mandshurica seedlings to n addition of different concentrations were accompanied by corresponding changes in whole-plant hydraulic conductance: higher growth rate was accompanied by reduced whole-plant hydraulic conductance (k-plant) and higher leaf water-use efficiency. a detailed analysis on hydraulic conductance of different components of the whole-plant water transport pathway revealed that changes in root and leaf hydraulic conductance, rather than that of the stem, were responsible for k-plant responses to n fertilization. both plant growth and hydraulic architecture responses to increasing levels of n addition were not linear, i.e., the correlation between measured parameters and n availability exhibited bell-shaped curves with peak values observed at medium levels of n fertilization. changes in hydraulic architecture in response to fertilization found in the present study may represent an important underlying mechanism for the commonly observed changes in water-related tree performances in response to n deposition.
thermodynamics	density and viscosity are essential physical properties and need to be well-known in chemical engineering design as well as process optimization. to expand the potential application of ils, it is important to know the properties of ils mixtures for their widely used. in this work, the values of density and dynamic viscosity of aqueous [c(3)py][dca] with the molarity range from (0.0500 to 1.0096) mol kg(-1) were measured at t = (288.15-318.15) k. in terms of jones-dole equation, the viscosity b-coefficients with large positive value and db/dr < 0 were obtained and it implied that the ionic liquid is water-structure-making. the values of the contribution per mole of the solute to the free energy of activation for viscous flow of the solution, delta m(2)(not equal 0), were obtained on the basis of the feakins' theory. the relationship between delta mu(not equal 0)(2) and temperature is linear so that standard molar activation entropy delta s-2(not equal 0) and enthalpy, delta h-2(not equal 0), were obtained. at constant molality, delta h-2(not equal 0) is a temperature-independent constant so that implies the activation process of the solute for viscous flow of aqueous [c(3)py][dca] is an isocoulombic reaction. according to eyring 's theory, a semi-empirical method to predict the viscosity of aqueous [c(3)py][dca] was put forward and the predicted values are all most the same with corresponding experimental ones.

fluid_mechanics	finding the critical factors that influence the pressure during pumping of concrete has been investigated for years. from fluid mechanics, the relationship between pressure and flow rate, radius or viscosity is known. in the practical guidelines for pumping of conventional vibrated concrete (cvc) the viscosity term is replaced by the concrete yield stress. however, recently, the influence of viscosity on pumping pressure has been reevaluated for self-consolidating concrete (scc). in this paper, the influence of concrete rheology, tribology, flow rate and pipe radius on pumping pressure are discussed, based on full-scale pumping tests. the concrete mixtures varied from pumpable cvc to segregating scc. the influence of flow rate and viscosity on pumping of concrete has been confirmed. it is also shown that with a 20% decrease in pipe radius (from 125 to 100 mm), the pumping pressure can be roughly doubled. an increase in yield stress also increases the pumping pressure, but its influence is only visible when the viscosity is approximately constant. the total flow resistance in the tribometer also appears to correlate well with the pumping pressure, proving that the developed tribometer mimics quite well the flow of concrete in a pipe.

computer-aided_design	the recent tau computer-aided design (cad) contest has aimed to seek novel ideas for accurate and fast common path pessimism removal (cppr). unnecessary pessimism forces the static timing analysis tool to report worse violation than the true timing properties owned by physical circuits, thereby misleading signoff timing into a lower clock frequency at which circuits can operate than actual silicon implementations. therefore, we introduce in this paper ui-timer 1.0, a powerful cppr algorithm which achieves high accuracy and ultrafast runtime. unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path search, ui-timer 1.0 proves that by implicit path representation the amount of search effort can be significantly reduced. our timer is superior in both space and time saving, from which memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per path during the search. experimental results on industrial benchmarks released from tau 2014 cad contest have justified that ui-timer 1.0 achieved the best result in terms of accuracy and runtime over existing cppr algorithms.
machine_design	this paper proposes a method to the model constraints from different models to run an optimization over models with different granularities. through machine learning, the proposed method has proven to be able to accurately map the constraints and minimize the number of call to the model. it handles both continuous and discrete variables and mixes design rules to statistic approach to create a surrogate of the model.
fluid_mechanics	physical examination of any swelling is the first step in making a diagnosis. many a times we see a patient with a spherical swelling, which is usually a cyst. the interpretation of physical signs should be based on sound principles of physics. in the present paper, we explain physical characteristics of a swelling (cyst) using principles of fluid mechanics.
hydraulics	an accurate analysis of the flow transient is very important in safety evaluation of a nuclear power plant. in this study, analysis of a vvvver-1000 reactor is investigated. in order to perform this analysis, a model is developed to simulate the coupled kinetics and thermal-hydraulics of the reactor with a simple and accurate numerical algorithm. for thermal-hydraulic calculations, the four-equation drift-flux model is applied. based on a multi-channel approach, core is divided into some regions. each region has different characteristics as represented in a single fuel pin with its associated coolant channel. to obtain the core power distribution, point kinetic equations with different feedback effects are utilized. the appropriate initial and boundary conditions are considered and two situations of decreasing the coolant flow rate in a protected and unprotected core are analyzed. in addition to analysis of normal operation condition, a full range of thermal-hydraulic parameters is obtained for transients too. finally, the data obtained from the model are compared with the calculations conducted using relap5/mod3 code and bushehr nuclear power plant data. it is shown that the model can provide accurate predictions for both steady-state and transient conditions.
computer-aided_design	purpose of reviewmultiple disease processes, including neoplasia, trauma, and medication side-effects, necessitate segmental resection and subsequent reconstruction of the mandible. as surgical techniques have advanced, several technologies have been developed with the potential to significantly transform a surgeon 's approach to the restoration of mandibular continuity. the purpose of this review is to highlight many of these relatively newer tools and discuss their evolving role in mandibular reconstruction.recent findingsseveral contemporary studies have documented the application of different approaches and modifications to mandibular reconstruction - including computer-aided design or computer-aided modeling, contemporary plating systems, osseointegrated implants, and various modifications to existing osseocutaneous free tissue transfer options - and have reported relatively high success rates.summaryin discussing these reports, we present a survey of current and developing technologies in the field of mandibular reconstruction and aim to provide sufficient context for the gradual integration of these techniques into practice.
hydraulics	hydraulic units are often linked to ecological habitat through geomorphic structure, and a better understanding of the turbulent characteristics of the units is needed. our work examined the near-bed turbulent structure of runs and glides in a restored river and investigated the physical characteristics that influenced the near-bed hydraulics in these units. the research was completed in three restored reaches and one reference reach at the virginia tech stream research, education, and management laboratory. the laboratory is unique because three different restoration treatments were applied contiguously along a stream, and the restoration practices ranged from passive to active. the passive reach included cattle exclusion, while the active reaches included cattle exclusion as well as vegetation plantings, bank sloping and the construction of inset floodplains. three-dimensional velocities were measured near the channel bed in run and glide biotopes within the three restored reaches, as well as an upstream reference reach. the velocities were utilized to analyse and compare near-bed turbulent structure across the reaches. while the restoration activities did not address the channel bed directly, differences in physical structure of the two physical biotopes were observed among restoration treatments, likely because of changes in bank shape and roughness due to vegetation differences. differences between reference and restored reaches were still evident approximately 3years after cattle exclusion and construction activities. few differences were observed in the hydraulic structure between runs and glides, and the near-bed flow structure in both runs and glides was related to local roughness. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.
hydraulics	it is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting shoots after fire in chaparral shrublands. by contrast, little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. we hypothesized that vascular traits, both functional and structural, would also shift in order to support this heightened level of gas exchange and growth. we examined stem xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (k-s) and resistance to cavitation (p-50) for eight chaparral shrub species as well as several potential xylem structural determinants of hydraulic function and compared established unburned plants and co-occurring post-fire resprouting plants. unburned plants were generally more resistant to cavitation than resprouting plants, but the two groups did not differ in k-s. resprouting plants had altered vessel structure compared with unburned plants, with resprouting plants having both wider diameter vessels and higher inter-vessel pit density. for biomechanics, unburned plants had both stronger and denser stem xylem tissue than resprouting plants. shifts in hydraulic structure and function resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration. the interaction between time since disturbance (i.e. resprouting versus established stands) and drought may complicate attempts to predict mortality risk of resprouting plants. it is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting plants after fire in chaparral shrublands, but little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. the ecophysiology of eight species of chaparral shrubs was compared between resprouting plants and adjacent unburned plants. resprouting plants varied from unburned plants in their hydraulics, xylem structure and biomechanics. the observed shifts resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration than unburned plants and demonstrate potential variability of plants in their hydraulic physiology depending on disturbance recovery state.
internal_combustion_engine	electric vehicles (ev), as a promising way to reduce the greenhouse effect, have been researched extensively. with improvements in the areas of power electrics, energy storage and support, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (phev) provides competitive driving range and fuel economy compared to the internal combustion engine vehicle (icev). operating with optimised control strategies or utilising the concept of the energy management system (ems), the efficiency of the phev could be significantly improved. in this review paper, the operating process of the various types of evs will be explained. battery technology and supercapacitor technology will also be discussed as a possibility to increase the energy capacity of phev.
thermodynamics	the advancement in micro/nanotechnologies has been continuously providing possibilities for inventing novel biochemical sensors. however, variations in the transducer type can cause different sensing results due to the differences in their mechanisms of analyzing biomolecular interactions. in this work, we focused on the comparative analysis of static and non-static assays for molecular interactions using on-chip integrated extended-gate field effect transistor (egfet) as a static sensing interface and solidly mounted resonator (smr) as a non-static sensing interface. analysis of polyelectrolytes (pets) surface assembly and antigen-antibody interaction using the two types of biochemical sensors presented consistent and complementary sets of information. meanwhile, due to the difference in their operating mechanisms, variations on the detection efficiency, kinetics and thermodynamics were observed. our results highlighted the critical dependence of signal detection on biochemical sensors' operating mechanisms and provided a valuable guidance for static and non-static assays for biomolecular detections.

fluid_mechanics	a piezoelectric unimorph anemovane is proposed and analyzed for measuring precisely variation of wind direction and speed. the proposed anemovane has various advantages, compared with general anemovane. it can detect the wind in all direction, and be fabricated as small one. this anemovane was designed as the shape similar to a sea urchin. we use cantilevers to imitate prickles projected on the sea urchin sphere. if the wind blows, it hit the cantilever and the pressure makes the voltage signal through the piezoelectric unimorph bender. the simulation of the proposed system was performed using the fem software (comsol multiphysics), and the multi-physics analysis (fluid mechanics, mechanics and electrostatics) was executed by considering real boundary conditions. based on fem analysis of the new anemovane with the new structure and control method, the characteristics between the fluid and the piezoelectric unimorph bender was comprehended. the possibility of the proposed anemovane was verified through the fabrication and the experiment.
thermodynamics	a model-independent statistical framework is presented to interpret data from systems where the mean time derivative of positional cross correlation between world lines, a measure of spreading in a quantum geometrical wave function, is measured with a precision smaller than the planck time. the framework provides a general way to constrain possible departures from perfect independence of classical world lines, associated with planck scale bounds on positional information. a parameterized candidate set of possible correlation functions is shown to be consistent with the known causal structure of the classical geometry measured by an apparatus, and the holographic scaling of information suggested by gravity. frequency-domain power spectra are derived that can be compared with interferometer data. simple projections of sensitivity for realistic experimental set-ups suggests that measurements will confirm or rule out a class of planck scale departures from classical geometry.
materials_engineering	continuum mechanics-based approximation is too often unsatisfactory for solution of real material problems especially in experimental as well as computational fatigue applications. various methods of classical-deterministic analyses often produce inconclusive or conflicting estimates of the fatigue life of a component. in addition, the classical griffith-irwin-orowan concept that assumed the phenomena based on homeomorphism mathematics cannot be developed any closer to the experimental results anymore. it has already reached its saturation point. this note discusses the fundamental reasons of the limitations of classical fracture mechanics and subsequently predicts alternatives. application of classical fracture mechanics to engineering problems is discussed along with possible alternatives employing probabilistic and fractal fracture mechanics in materials engineering.

machine_design	a 2-d magnetizer introduces variation in the flux density (b) across the sample under rotational magnetization. this variation requires additional energy requirements that limits the attainable aspect ratios, flux density levels and stresses the supply. a numerical methodology that accounts for the flux leakage and the eddy currents is proposed to analyze uniformity and variation in b in four 2-d magnetizers. the analysis was done beyond the knee of the magnetization curve. numerical results will show that round magnetizers can mitigate the variation of the square magnetizer by over 92%, by making the mmf more sinusoidal and equalizing the reluctance along the airgap. in addition, deeper yokes minimized the variation by about 50% in the square and the halbach testers. the results of this analysis was a design that mitigates the variation in b by a combination of sinusoidally distributed windings, and a deep yoke. the proposed magnetizer achieved very high flux densities over a relatively wide frequency range, which were 2.04 and 1.69 t at 60 hz and 1 khz, respectively.
manufacturing_engineering	in our research, the simulation model driven engineering for manufacturing cell (smde-mc) is proposed. the purposes of smde-mc are to support the manufacturing engineering processes based on the simulation model and to extend the range of control applications and simulation applications using the pc based control. smde-mc provides the simulation model which controls and monitors the manufacturing cell directly using pc based control in the manufacturing system execution phase. then when the simulation model acts in response to its behaviors, the manufacturing system is controlled by synchronizing the simulation model behaviors. in the manufacturing system implementation phase, the simulation model is mixed and synchronized with real equipment, real controllers, and management applications under a condition where parts of equipment, control programs, and manufacturing management applications are not provided in a manufacturing system.

machine_design	the design of a flywheel system for energy storage is herein performed through the model based systems engineering (mbse) as an example of mechatronic product development and innovation. some relevant advantages of the mbse applied to a material mechatronic system, in some activities, as the requirement analysis, the identification of system capabilities, the definition of architecture and the system validation are identified. moreover, the paper is aimed at investigating some critical issues arising when the mbse tools are applied to machine design, being still a domain poorly inclined to exploit this holistic approach. that trend might be related to technical difficulties in assessing an interoperable framework of simulators aimed at dealing simultaneously with functional and physical models. in addition the technology scouting looks poorly connected within the standard sysml diagrams, without introducing some additional charts. a demonstration of the fruitful impact of the mbse on the machine design is herein proposed, to show some advantages provided as a mechatronic integrated system is conceived and how a complete trade-off analysis could be supported by the mbse modeling activity.
computer-aided_design	multi-scale computer aided design of manufacturing processes of a magnesium bracket for the automotive industry is the main goal of the present paper. tensile tests at various deformation conditions (temperatures, strain rates etc.) were performed to obtain flow stress data necessary for the macro-scale finite element analysis. the digital material representation concept was used to create a micro-scale model and to evaluate the influence of local microstructural features in the form of twins on material behaviour. an algorithm based on the cellular automata method capable of replicating microstructural morphology with twins was proposed to provide the digital material representation model. the bracket made of az31 magnesium alloy was formed at an elevated temperature of 200 degrees c. description of the study as well as results obtained at two length scales are presented in the paper.
materials_engineering	teeth are brittle and highly susceptible to cracking. we propose that observations of such cracking can be used as a diagnostic tool for predicting bite force and inferring tooth function in living and fossil mammals. laboratory tests on model tooth structures and extracted human teeth in simulated biting identify the principal fracture modes in enamel. examination of museum specimens reveals the presence of similar fractures in a wide range of vertebrates, suggesting that cracks extended during ingestion or mastication. the use of 'fracture mechanics' from materials engineering provides elegant relations for quantifying critical bite forces in terms of characteristic tooth size and enamel thickness. the role of enamel microstructure in determining how cracks initiate and propagate within the enamel ( and beyond) is discussed. the picture emerges of teeth as damage-tolerant structures, full of internal weaknesses and defects and yet able to contain the expansion of seemingly precarious cracks and fissures within the enamel shell. how the findings impact on dietary pressures forms an undercurrent of the study.
fluid_mechanics	we present a frame-invariant method for detecting coherent structures from lagrangian flow trajectories that can he sparse in number, as is the case in many fluid mechanics applications of practical interest. 'the method, based on principles used in graph colouring and spectral graph drawing algorithms, examines a measure of the kinematic dissimilarity of all pairs of fluid trajectories, measured either experimentally, e.g. using particle tracking velocimetry, or numerically, by advecting fluid particles in the eulerian velocity field. coherence is assigned to groups of particles whose kinematics remain similar throughout the time interval for which trajectory data are available, regardless of their physical proximity to one another. through the use of several analytical and experimental validation cases, this algorithm is shown to robustly detect coherent structures using significantly less flow data than are required by existing spectral graph theory methods.
thermodynamics	the present paper provides a dynamic, non-linear and fully coupled finite element (fe) formulation based on the timoshenko beam theory to study elasto-thermoelectric responses in thermoelectric devices. the two main motivations of this work are: i) to study mechanical responses in thermoelectric devices, which must be taken into account in the design of peltier cells due to the fragility and relative low strength of the semiconductors, and ii) to provide a numerical tool that decreases the cpu time to allow the introduction of designs based on optimization processes and on sensitivity analyses that could require many evaluations. in order to undertake the objectives of this work, the general three-dimensional governing equations are reduced to one-dimensional ones by means of several assumptions. then, a set of five multi-coupled partial differential equations is obtained. the resultant expressions are thermodynamically consistent and form a multi-coupled monolithic fe formulation, differently to stagger formulations that require two separated steps to reach the final result. numerically, this set of multi-coupled equations is discretized using the fe method and implemented into feap taylor, 2010 [1]. for a proper validation of the code, four benchmarks are performed using one-dimensional dynamic analytical solutions developed by the authors. finally, this formulation is compared with a three-dimensional fe formulation also developed by the authors in pe' rez-aparicio et al., 2015 [2] to model a commercial peltier cell. this comparison reveals that: i) relative errors are lower than 13% and ii) cpu times decrease significantly, more than one order of magnitude. in conclusion, the beam thermoelectric formulation is an accurate model that reduces cpu time and could be used in future design of thermoelectric devices.
computer-aided_design	this paper presents the design and development of a 190 ghz schottky-diode frequency doubler (x2 multiplier) which can handle up to 260 mw input power. in order to increase the power handling capability, a modeling approach incorporating computer-aided design (cad) load-pull techniques to characterize the diode performance is proposed. by the use of this approach, effects of several critical diode parameters on the power handling issue are quantitatively investigated and based on the analysis, a discrete diode chip is designed for the doubler. to ensure rapid heat sink in the doubler circuitry, low cost aluminum nitride ceramic (aln) is selected as the dielectric material of the circuit substrate, which has significantly better thermal conductivity compared with currently widely-used fused quartz. the doubler circuitry is based on a balanced configuration, which brings a merit of avoiding the use of a filter for the input and output signal isolation. the doubler circuit is optimized by co-simulation using ansys 's hfss and keysight 's ads. the measurements show that the doubler can handle up to 260 mw input power with a power conversion efficiency of nearly 8%, resulting in 20 mw output power at 193 ghz.
machine_design	the roller is one of the main parts of a high-pressure grinding roller, which is a type of highly efficient ore crushing equipment. its working life is strongly affected by the materials used. in this paper, a new kind of roller material, the high-vanadium alloy steel (hvas), was investigated. the results showed that the as-cast microstructures of the hvas roller contained martensite, residual austenite, and alloy carbides. the hvas sample quenched at 1,080 degrees c had a high hardness, and it had much higher compressive strength and abrasive wear resistance after tempering at 560 degrees c for 30 min. the mechanical properties of the hvas are more sufficient than the existing roller materials, which are feasible for larger machine design.
hydraulics	hydromechanical systems are prone to significant oscillations, due to the ability of hydraulic oil to store potential energy. this is extremely important when considering mobile hydraulic machinery, especially those machines which handle large loads. oscillations can negatively affect the stability of the payload, the comfort of the operator, and the overall safety of the system. for the particular case of earthmoving machines, several systems have been designed in order to alleviate these oscillations and increase machine operability. these systems include both passive and active designs which attempt to utilize the motion of the payload in such a way as to cancel out the effect of machine vibrations. this paper seeks to assess the potential advantages of active oscillation control strategies with respect to current state of art passive strategies. a reference case vehicle (wheel loader) is presented and analyzed in order to determine its typical vibrational behavior. a simulation model for the reference machine is developed and used in assessing machine performance. the effectiveness of the current passive vibration damping approach with respect to reducing the vibrations perceived by the operator in the cabin, as well as those affecting the payload, is presented. then, an active (electrohydraulic) control structure is presented using both acceleration and pressure feedback, including an adaptive controller constructed using an extremum-seeking algorithm. to quantitatively compare the relative performances of these various systems, an appropriate objective function is defined. simulation results are presented for each of the considered control strategies, and their performances are compared. the simulation indicates a performance of active vibration control systems roughly equivalent to that of currently implemented passive control strategies. in some cases, the active control performance is actually two to three times as effective as the passive control.

hydraulics	in this study, the corrosion behaviors of carbon steel and stainless steel are investigated for water-saturated co2 system to examine the condition of co2 injection wells in co2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery (eor) operations. in our model, potential nonisothermal effects resulting from co2 injection activities, including joule-thomson effect, heat transfer between co2 stream and surrounding well/rock formation, the adiabatic (de-) compression of co2, and the frictional losses, are accounted. the model is applied to onshore and offshore wells using realistic data. in the offshore well, the depth is considered to vary as a power function of lateral distance from the sea floor to the perforation. depending on scales of injection, our calculations show that the corrosion rates in the tubing wall from the wellhead to bottomhole is on the order of 1 mm/y for carbon steel. for stainless steel, the rate obtained is 0.0057 mm/y. results of this study provide insights on the material selection of co2 injection wells, design of injection operations, as well as leakage monitoring and risk assessment in wellbores.

machine_design	the paper presents the optimum design of a permanent magnet synchronous generator for wind power applications. the proposed optimization strategy deals with two contradictory objectives: to reduce generator costs and to raise the energy yield. this task is accomplished by maximizing the difference between the energy proceeds and the generator costs. the generator operating cycle is taken into account by a weibull function that represents the wind profile for a fictitious site. a thermal model is adopted to evaluate the winding temperature and prevent overheating. the optimally designed machine is a 3phase generator for 40 kw direct drive wind turbines. the results show that this strategy would produce a cost-effective machine.
manufacturing_engineering	material flow analysis is an essential engineering task for effective production and requires a large amount of information that is related to products, processes, resources, and plants. due to the lack of a systematic framework and supporting system between engineers and related manufacturing information resources, many simulation engineers have actually wasted time and cost with redundant tasks for simulation. a p3r-driven modeling and simulation system in plm is suggested and implemented in this paper. for this purpose, a p3r data structure is defined for simulation-model generation, and a middleware application is developed based on the p3r object-oriented model. finally, a concurrent material flow analysis system is developed and applied for area and flow analysis. as a case study, the developed methodology and systems of p3r-driven modeling and simulation are practically applied to automotive press shops. based on the results, the proposed methodology and systems in this paper are very useful in terms of reducing time and cost in material flow analysis via simulations. also, it is possible to perform more effective engineering tasks such as simulation for material flow analysis via integrated environment, because relevant data for simulation can be extracted from plm system automatically and that data is compatible with actual or planned shop floor. this will lead to seamless implementation of manufacturing engineering processes with more effective decision making processes. furthermore, concurrent material flow analysis is possible from the early stages of product development and production.

machine_design	the work of product designers has to evolve in phase with the improvements made to technology and changes in regulations. they have to work on different aspects of a product such as its technological, legal, environmental and occupational safety implications. european directive 2006/42/ce promulgates safe machine design principles to prevent professional risks. these principles guide machine designers to reduce residual risks as much as the technological state of the art permits. special machine designers are by definition confronted by a lack of specific standards relating to a priori risk analysis. the aim of this paper is to present an original approach to help them to identify hazards upstream and also throughout the design process. this approach is based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies. hazard identification can be done through the detection of parameters linked to energy sources and flows. the approach then feeds back information to designers about potential contacts between energies and workers, to highlight the need to add preventive measures. we use the functional-structural model is used to represent the machine energy architecture through the different steps of its lifecycle. thus it is possible to identify every interface through which energies circulate. these interfaces are defined by two kinds of parameter: energetic parameters (linked to energy properties), and other design parameters. this paper first presents a detailed classification of energetic parameters that are also indicators of the hazards present in the machine. we then present logical rules for processing these energetic parameters and others, in order to increase the accuracy of the hazard identification performed. to conclude, the results obtained from using this approach during the industrial design of a supply line is detailed to validate the pertinence of its application from the earliest design stages, with improved accuracy during the subsequent design stages.

machine_design	slotted axial-flux machines have excellent power and torque densities. however, it is difficult to reduce their cogging torque due to the complexity associated with implementing classical techniques. in this paper, slot-opening widths and tooth profiles will be shown to be significant in mitigating cogging torque in these machines. in particular, varying the slot opening reduced it by 52%, whereas a parallel-tooth (rectangular) profile lowered it by 24%, when compared with a conventional trapezoidal-tooth profile. an analytical quasi-3-d analysis was formulated and used to analyze and determine cogging torque. it was validated numerically and experimentally. its versatility is in its ability to analyze different shapes of poles and slot openings, which can be extended to model air-gap nonuniformity. this paper also presents cogging torque minimization techniques that maintain the ease of manufacture of the parallel-tooth stator. experimental results showed 73% and 48% reduction in cogging torque, which are achieved by the use of alternating pole arcs and skewed poles.
materials_engineering	because of the important applications of platinum alloys and related platinum-group-metals phases, complete phase diagrams for these systems are important for materials engineering. the currently accepted phase diagram for the ag-pt system is questionable because of its disagreement with earlier experiments and because of its claim for a lone ordered structure at 53%-pt which was not characterized and which contradicts both computational predictions and analogy to the isoelectronic system cu-pt. a complete re-examination of the ag-pt system by computational and experimental means suggests a phase diagram similar to the isoelectronic system cu-pt. the unknown compound, claimed to be 53%-pt, is found to be the l1(1) structure at 50%-pt.

machine_design	this paper proposes a new type of curve, an elliptical roulette, which it initially applies to rotary lobe pumps. once the new rotor profile has been mathematically modeled using the principle of gearing, equations can be derived to assess the presence or absence of undercutting in the tooth profile. the effect of the new profile properties on pumping performance is evaluated using a specially developed three-dimensional fluid analysis model. the proposed curve is tested using six novel rotor profiles based on the elliptical axial ratio parameter lambda (a shorter axis divided by a larger axis). these six new cases and a traditional case are analyzed under the same volume and clearance conditions and their differences compared. the results show that a smaller elliptical axial ratio design produces better flow characteristics. in particular, an elliptical axial ratio smaller than 0.6 not only achieves high discharge efficiency but allows vibration and noise to be controlled by the flow rate fluctuation coefficient, which approximates the traditional indicator. the proposed curve can thus serve as a useful reference for pump or rotary fluid machine design.

materials_engineering	this paper presents an overview and examples of material design and development using (1) classical thermodynamics; (2) calphad (calculation of phase diagrams) modeling; and (3) integrated computational materials engineering (icme) approaches. although the examples are given in lightweight aluminum and magnesium alloys for structural applications, the fundamental methodology and modeling principles are applicable to all materials and engineering applications. the examples in this paper have demonstrated the effectiveness and limitations of classical thermodynamics in solving specific problems (such as nucleation during solidification and solid-state precipitation in aluminum alloys). computational thermodynamics and calphad modeling, when combined with critical experimental validation, have been used to guide the selection and design of new magnesium alloys for elevated-temperature applications. the future of material design and development will be based on a holistic icme approach. however, key challenges exist in many aspects of icme framework, such as the lack of diffusion/mobility databases for many materials systems, limitation of current microstructural modeling capability and integration tools for simulation codes of different length scales.

hydraulics	an understanding of thermal hydraulics, its basic phenomena, and its application to nuclear power plants is vital to safe as well as efficient design and operation. thermal hydraulics for two-phase flow and heat transfer with nuclear applications has been studied for roughly 50 years, and the current body of knowledge is extensive. yet, there remain safety issues, and the licensing of new light water reactor designs or new analysis methodologies is rarely simple. this is due to the state of the art in reactor thermal hydraulics as well as the perspective that the regulator, in this case the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission (nrc), has toward that field of study. this paper discusses the state of the art in nuclear thermal hydraulics, the regulator 's unique role and perspective, and a view of current challenges. the discussion is meant to point out how the regulator 's perspective has been shaped and hopefully provide some guidance on fulfilling research needs for future applications that may need nrc review.
internal_combustion_engine	recently, as a kind of renewable fuel, low-grade biogas has been researched to apply in internal combustion engine. in this paper, an experimental study was conducted to study the influence of injection strategies on the efficient utilization of low-grade biogas in reactivity controlled compression ignition (rcci) mode with port fuel injection of biogas and in-cylinder direct injection of diesel based on a modified electronic controlled high-pressure directly injected compression ignition engine. considered the high proportion of inert gas in biogas, a four-components simulated gas (h-2:co:ch4:n-2 = 5:40:5:50 vol%) has been selected as test fuels to simulate biogas. the effects of several injection control parameters such as pilot injection timing, main injection timing, common rail pressure and pilot injection ratio on the combustion and emissions are analyzed in detail. the research demonstrates that the main injection timing can effectively control the combustion phase and excessive early pilot injection timing leads to retard of combustion. co emissions are relatively high due to homogenous charge of biogas. nox and smoke emissions can be effectively controlled. in rcci mode, the indicated thermal efficiency of biogas/diesel can reach 40%.

thermodynamics	performances of mesoporous materials in removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) from hot gases were evaluated systematically. the adsorption and desorption natures for pahs with different aromatic rings, naphthalene (nap), phenanthrene (phe) and pyrene (pyr) on mesosilicas mcm-41 and sba-15, and mesocarbon cmk-3, were studied. adsorption equilibria were well described by langmuir or freundlich model, giving the order of adsorption capacity of cmk-3 >sba-15 >mcm41 and pry >phe >nap. temperature programmed desorption exhibited the order of ease of desorption of sba-15 >mcm-41 >cmk-3, along with desorption kinetic triplet determined by combined model fitting analysis. the johnson-mehl-avrami (jma) rate equation was found to well describe pah desorption kinetics, except for phe/ sba-15 and pyr/cmk-3 due to potential blockage and strong binding, respectively. mcm-41 with simple 1-d mesoporous structure provided smooth diffusion and consistent behavior but very low adsorption capacity for each pah. sba-15 with micropores/small mesopores as interconnectivity between primary mesopores not only showed high sorption capacities but also diffusion advantages in desorption. cmk-3 with great microporosity facilitated the adsorption at low concentrations due to micropore-filling, and with surface hydrophobicity rendered high affinities especially for the bulkier pyr.

fluid_mechanics	a tsunami is a series of great waves primarily caused by a major subduction-zone earthquake with large-scale displacement of the sea floor or by initiation of submarine landslides. many coastal areas in the western united states are subject to tsunami hazard that is infrequent but potentially extremely destructive. the public safety risk has been only partially mitigated through warning and preparedness of evacuation; there are many coastal communities in the states of alaska, washington, oregon, california, and hawaii where there is insufficient time for complete evacuation, and places of higher elevation and/or taller structures could provide life safety. community disaster resilience would also require that critical and essential facilities provide structural resistance to collapse. towards that goal, the tsunami loads and effects subcommittee of the asce/structural engineering institute (asce/sei) 7 standards committee has developed a new chapter 6 with design requirements for tsunami loads and effects, contained in the 2016 edition of the asce 7 standard minimum design loads for buildings and other structures [minimum design loads for buildings and other structures]. the asce 7-16 tsunami loads and effects chapter will become the first national, consensus-based standard for tsunami resilience for use in the states of alaska, washington, oregon, california, and hawaii. the purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation of the technical basis and methodology for tsunami-resilient design of critical and essential facilities, tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structures, and other multistory building structures. the asce 7 provisions for tsunami loads and effects implements a unified set of analysis and design methodologies with design maps based on probabilistic hazard analysis, loads based on tsunami physics, and a structural ultimate strength basis of design. probabilistic offshore tsunami amplitude maps and tsunami design zone inundation maps were developed using a method consistent with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the treatment of seismic source uncertainties. procedures for tsunami inundation analysis are based on using mapped values of offshore tsunami amplitude or the runup and inundation limit shown in tsunami design zone maps. the asce 7 tsunami loads and effects chapter is consistent with the principles of probabilistic hazard analysis, tsunami physics, and fluid mechanics, integrated into a comprehensive set of design provisions.
hydraulics	one of the most critical aspects in the drilling operation is to reduce the nonproductive time and to avoid the borehole instability issues such as kicks, blow outs, lost circulation, stuck pipe, and breakouts. to investigate these problems, one has to understand the formation properties, fluid hydraulics, and the basic mechanics behind drilling a well. in the previous research on this field, the factors were widely discussed and results obtained were related to the formation properties. however, while considering the stresses in the wellbore, the mechanical factors such as the rpm and contact of casing at different positions in wellbore have usually been neglected. in furtherance to this study, the importance of thermal condition, fluid loss, and filter cake formation study cannot be out ruled. this work includes a new insight toward understanding the stress redistribution due to pipe contact by the wellbore and smear mechanism. additionally, it presents the numerical analysis of influence of casing contact and downhole thermal conditions using the finite-element analysis. the classical equations used to obtain the wellbore stresses include very few parameters such as the far-field stresses, pore pressure, and wellbore geometry. they do not consider the influence of casing contact while drilling, mud-cake permeability, and elastic and inelastic properties of the formation. to take into account the effects of these parameters, finite-element analysis is carried out considering the above-mentioned parameters in various scenarios. the main objective of these simulations is to investigate the hypothesis of the increase in hoop stress considering casing contact with regard to formation stresses orientation. the study of different cases shows the variation of a few hundred psi of hoop stress. however, the thermal effect on the near-wellbore stress regions can be important for drilling in deep water and other complex drilling environments. to see the thermal effect, this study develops a thermo-poroelastic model. it is found that there is decrease in radial stress and hoop stress in near-wellbore region with time. this reduction will have a considerable impact on fracture initiation pressure in the near-wellbore region. also, the smearing effect will be influenced by stress changes due to change in temperature.
computer-aided_design	this paper deals with the study of a process that allows the use of waste sulphates from drywalls and plasterboards in the cement chemistry without affecting the resistance of cement, since cement industry is an important sulphate consumer. the role of the recycling temperature to obtain recycled calcium sulphates (rcs) and their so3 contents, when rcs are used as set retarders in cements, is also studied. gypsum from drywalls, and plaster of paris from plasterboards, were heated at three recycling temperatures (110 degrees c - 150 degrees c - 170 degrees c) and partially dehydrated to obtain rcs. chemical composition and so3 purity of these rcs and of natural gypsums were determined and compared via xrd and dsc/tg. setting time, the compressive strengths and the microstructure of cements with rcs used as set retarder were studied. the main products formed after cement hydration were determined by xrd and their microstructure observed by sem/edx. internal porosity of different blends, area per mm(2) and diameter distribution, was determined through image processing with computer-aided design (cad) software in sem images. cements with rcs from plasterboards as set retarder, with the higher so3 content and higher amount of hemihydrates, preheated at 150-170 degrees c, have mechanical strengths according to cement standards. they show a denser microstructure, lower porosity and more homogeneous matrix after final setting than cements with rcs from drywalls. the selection here suggested of waste sulphates and the preheating process will allow using recycled sulphates from debris in the cement industry, according to eu standards.

machine_design	due to higher magnetic flux density, larger effective magnetic air gap, and lesser use of ferromagnetic materials, large-scale direct-drive superconducting (sc) wind generators have a very high peak fault current and torque, which pose a challenge for their armature windings and mechanical supports. understanding the behavior of the sc generators under faults is important for their application and commercialization. in this paper, a 13.2-mw direct-drive sc wind generator is analyzed under the three-phase symmetric short circuit using 2-d finite-element analyses. the key differences in the short-circuit behavior between sc generators and conventional machines are explained. the effects of a high fault torque on the cost and weight of a generator are also discussed. it is found that the higher fault current and torque in an sc generator are mainly caused by low reactances and nonnegligible armature resistance. generator parameters, including the use of ferromagnetic materials, the value of magnetic loading, the pole number, the number of turns per armature coil, and the number of armature winding sets, have a significant influence on reactances, fault current, and torque. the influences of these parameters on fault current and torque under the three-phase symmetric short-circuit are analyzed in detail. moreover, several ways to decrease the fault current and torque in terms of machine design are proposed.
hydraulics	in addition to buffering plants from water stress during severe droughts, plant water storage (pws) alters many features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil-plant system. how pws impacts water dynamics and drought resilience is explored using a multi-layer porous media model. the model numerically resolves soil-plant hydrodynamics by coupling them to leaf-level gas exchange and soil-root interfacial layers. novel features of the model are the considerations of a coordinated relationship between stomatal aperture variation and whole-system hydraulics and of the effects of pws and nocturnal transpiration (fe,night) on hydraulic redistribution (hr) in the soil. the model results suggest that daytime pws usage and fe,night generate a residual water potential gradient (p,night) along the plant vascular system overnight. this p,night represents a non-negligible competing sink strength that diminishes the significance of hr. considering the co-occurrence of pws usage and hr during a single extended dry-down, a wide range of plant attributes and environmental/soil conditions selected to enhance or suppress plant drought resilience is discussed. when compared with hr, model calculations suggest that increased root water influx into plant conducting-tissues overnight maintains a more favorable water status at the leaf, thereby delaying the onset of drought stress.
materials_engineering	adolf martens (1850-1914) was a pioneer of materials engineering. after his studies in berlin he joined a railway company being responsible for the technical equipment. his interest for the basic mechanisms of mechanical strength and fracture of metallic materials led him to the development of the basic concepts for metallography; his papers published between 1878 and 1889 laid the fundament of this technique. in 1880 martens changed to the royal industrial academy in berlin and by 1884 he was designated as director of the materials testing laboratory at the technical university berlin. under his guidance this institution acquired an excellent reputation in all relevant areas of the german industry, forming the nucleus of the bundesanstalt fur materialforschung und - prufung (bam) - the federal institute for materials research and testing. martens developed equipment in many different areas as mechanical testing of metallic materials and of paper, characterization of the wear behavior of materials and viscosity of lubricants. his overwhelming contribution to materials engineering was recognized as early as 1895 by floris osmond, who denominated martensite a metallographical constituent resulting from quenching of steels. in 2000 iso designated the value obtained from the instrumented indentation method as martens hardness - hm.

manufacturing_engineering	since the birth of european higher education area (ehea), the higher education institutions of european countries have been involved in the complex process of re-designing of their curricula according to the new educational criteria oriented to the convergence of contents and methodologies in teaching university curricula. according to the principles pursued by the so named bologna process, the present work is focused on the description of experiences accumulated by these authors in adaptation of their courses of manufacturing engineering, as a previous stage to complete re-formulation of study plans for engineering programmes that are taught in escuela tecnica superior de ingenieria industrial (etsii) of universidad politecnica de cartagena. the strategies followed for the enhancement of the interest of students towards the theoretical and practical teachings, and the promotion of traverse and specific competences specially associated to these courses are explained in this work, as well as the academic results provided by the new educational methodologies assumed for the teaching-learning process.
manufacturing_engineering	an understanding of the hydraulic system is one of the learning objectives of the manufacturing engineering studies. generally, knowledge of the hydraulic system its components learned from textbooks. the existence of conventional tutorial props are considered can help the understanding of these materials, but this has not enough ability to give a clear illustration how each component in the system is working. this paper aims to look at how far a custom made hydraulic system tutorial props with a transparent flow concept can improve the competence of students in the understanding work of the hydraulic system. the tutorial props of hydraulic system are designed with the theme of material handling, using the robotic 3-arm with a dual-acting cylinder actuator to support the movement of each arm. all components flowed by fluid including valves, hoses, pumps, and actuators are made from transparent material and flowed with visible-colored fluid. the whole system and each component are equipped with a label containing its name and schematic symbol with fluid flow direction. the tutorial props can be operated manually and designed to be easily knocked down. based on verification using the questionnaire of technology acceptance model (tam) to 30 students obtained a value of 3.52 which indicates that the tutorial props are quite acceptable. while based on implementation test by comparing the difference in value between the pretest and posttest of 15 students using textbooks learning method and 15 students using the tutorial props learning method, found that there are significant differences which indicate that using the tutorial props is a better learning method.

computer-aided_design	the success of total knee arthroplasty (tka) depends on many factors. the position of a prosthesis is vitally important. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the value of a computer-aided establishing lower extremity mechanical axis in tka using digital technology. a total of 36 cases of patients with tka were randomly divided into the computer-aided design of navigation template group (nt) and conventional intramedullary positioning group (cip). three-dimensional (3d) ct scanning images of the hip, knee, and ankle were obtained in nt group. x-ray images and ct scans were transferred into the 3d reconstruction software. a 3d bone model of the hip, knee, ankle, as well as the modified loading, was reconstructed and saved in a stereolithographic format. in the 3d reconstruction model, the mechanical axis of the lower limb was determined, and the navigational templates produced an accurate model using a rapid prototyping technique. the tha in cip group was performed according to a routine operation. ct scans were performed postoperatively to evaluate the accuracy of the two tka methods. the averaged operative time of the nt group procedures was min shorter than those of the conventional procedures ( min). the coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, posterior tibial slope were , , in nt group and , , in cip group, respectively. statistically significant group differences were found. the navigation template produced through mechanical axis of lower extremity may provide a relative accurate and simple method for tka.
hydraulics	longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles of alluvial channels are altered by the presence of seepage. however, the available literature suggests that seepage has not been considered in analyses of bank profiles of threshold alluvial channels. in the experimental study reported here, downward seepage was applied to parabolic channels based on tractive force theory in order to determine its effect on the longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles. it was observed that sediment transport in the threshold channels increased when downward seepage was applied. the parabolic shape did not hold, but channels formed a new cross-sectional shape with a flat bed and two curved banks and achieved stability. the reason for the increased sediment transport in a threshold channel after the application of downward seepage was sought by analysing the time-averaged velocities. an empirically derived exponential expression was developed for the bank profiles of threshold alluvial channels affected by seepage. a relationship among hydraulic parameters for a stable channel with downward seepage is also suggested on the basis of the experimental observations.
machine_design	stator winding structure and its manufacturing in permanent magnet synchronous machines (pmsm) is the vital part of the whole machine design. it is important to follow particular procedures in order to keep the winding losses at the acceptable level, which include dc resistance loss and additional losses due to alternative magnetic flux within the area of the stator winding. the winding transposition or using of litz wire, which is effective way of proximity loss suppression, sometimes cannot be implemented due to challenges in assembling or cost aspects (especially in low cost pmsm solutions). in this case it is important to know consequences of using straight (non-twisting) windings in pmsms with relatively high electrical frequency. this article studies impact of the number of stator winding parallel strands on the additional ac losses distribution in the slot where this winding is located. also, thermal condition (which impacts the life time of the insulation) of the winding is analyzed with different number of parallel strands. current and temperature distributions in the slot conductors were attained by finite element method (fem). the total losses caused by additional ac losses in the winding were compared with the measurements results.
hydraulics	vulnerability segmentation, the condition under which plant leaves are more vulnerable to drought-induced cavitation than stems, may act as a ""safety valve"" to protect stems from hydraulic failure. evergreen, winter-deciduous, and drought-deciduous tree species co-occur in tropical savannas, but there have been no direct studies on the role of vulnerability segmentation and stomatal regulation in maintaining hydraulic safety in trees with these three leaf phenologies. to this end, we selected three anacardiaceae tree species co-occurring in a chinese savanna, evergreen pistacia weintnanniifolia, drought-deciduous terminthia paniculata, and winter-deciduous lannea coromandelica, to study inter-species differentiation in leaf and stem hydraulic safety. we found that the two deciduous species had significantly higher sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity and leaf-specific hydraulic conductance than the evergreen species. moreover, two deciduous species were more vulnerable to stem cavitation than the evergreen species, although both drought-deciduous species and evergreen species had drought-resistance leaves. the evergreen species maintained a wide hydraulic safety margin (hsm) in stems and leaves; which was achieved by embolism resistance of both stems and leaves and isohydric stomatal control. both deciduous species had limited hsms in stems and leaves, being isohydric in the winter-deciduous species and anisohydric in drought-deciduous species. the difference in water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity between the leaves and the terminal stems (p5oleaf-stem) was positive in p weinmanniifolia and l. coromandelica, whereas. t paniculata exhibited a lack of vulnerability segmentation. in addition, differences in hydraulic architecture were found to be closely related to other structural traits, i.e., leaf mass per area, wood density, and sapwood anatomy. overall, the winter-deciduous species exhibits a drought-avoidance strategy that maintains the hydraulic safety of the more carbon-costly stems by sacrificing cheaper and more vulnerable leaves, while the evergreen species exhibits a hydraulic strategy of drought tolerance with strong stomatal regulation. in contrast, the drought-deciduous species lacks vulnerability segmentation and sheds leaves at the expense of top shoots during peak drought. this study demonstrates that even sympatric tree species that differ in leaf phenology can exhibit divergent adaptive hydraulic safety strategies.
machine_design	this paper presents the implementation of the taguchi method for a retrofit design of a line-start permanent magnet motor. to evaluate the viability of the method, the optimum designs obtained from both the taguchi and a traditional optimization methods are compared. this outlines the respective advantages and disadvantages of both methods. it shows that the taguchi method is an efficient and robust design approach and possesses some unique advantages compared to conventional design methods. a design sensitivity investigation regarding the variances of certain parameters, due to manufacturing tolerances and material properties discrepancies, is also presented using the taguchi method. from this investigation insight into the contribution of each parameter towards machine performance is gained for the steady-state performance of an embedded radial flux line-start permanent magnet motor.
materials_engineering	in the present investigation, sensing electrode of an electrochemical co2 gas sensor (plate type design) is engineered to overcome various observed failures such as dying out in short time due to au/pt diffusion into the material which discontinues the electrical contact and results into inadequate catalytic action. to improve the sensing electrode performance, a gradient sputtered au coat is applied over it with increasing thickness towards the centre of the pellet. in another design, au is loaded with varying concentration into the electrolyte material and its coat is applied on the electrolyte to overcome the diffusion. performance of different sensors with varied configuration of catalyst au is compared on the parameters namely stability and response time. the gradient sputtered electrode gave fast electrode kinetics, whereas sensor stability is found better for au loaded material. an insight into effect of au loading in the binary electrolyte (li2co3 +caco3) is obtained by complex impedance spectroscopy.
fluid_mechanics	a numerical analysis is presented of cell adhesion in capillaries whose diameter is comparable to or smaller than that of the cell. in contrast to a large number of previous efforts on leukocyte and tumor cell rolling, much is still unknown about cell motion in capillaries. the solid and fluid mechanics of a cell in flow was coupled with a slip bond model of ligand-receptor interactions. when the size of a capillary was reduced, the cell always transitioned to ""bullet-like"" motion, with a consequent decrease in the velocity of the cell. a state diagram was obtained for various values of capillary diameter and receptor density. we found that bullet motion enables firm adhesion of a cell to the capillary wall even for a weak ligand-receptor binding. we also quantified effects of various parameters, including the dissociation rate constant, the spring constant, and the reactive compliance on the characteristics of cell motion. our results suggest that even under the interaction between p-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (psgl-1) and p-selectin, which is mainly responsible for leukocyte rolling, a cell is able to show firm adhesion in a small capillary. these findings may help in understanding such phenomena as leukocyte plugging and cancer metastasis.

thermodynamics	the rate of heat released during the combustion in diesel engines is important for many reasons, including performance evaluation, pollutant formation, and control. combustion in diesel engines can be generally divided into three phases: pre-mixed, diffusive or mixed-controlled, and late combustion. the objective of this paper is to estimate the rate of heat released by the fuel in a marine diesel engine, in order to identify the pre-mixed and diffusive phases, using the sampling importance resampling (sir) bayesian particle filter. experimental pressure data obtained from a piezoelectric sensor, installed in a research marine diesel engine (man innovator 4c), was used to feed the observation model in such bayesian approach. the evolution model for the pressure was formulated in terms of a set of ordinary differential equations, coming from the first law of thermodynamics, together with a random walk model for the unknown state variable. the proposed approach was able to identify the pre-mixed and diffusive combustion phases, for different engine loads. results were compared with a simple inversion procedure, showing a good agreement. the combustion ignition delay was also calculated, showing its variation with the engine load.
internal_combustion_engine	exergy analysis, which is based on the first and second thermodynamic laws, is a significant tool to assess energy systems. in this study, energy and exergy analyses of a compression ignition internal combustion engine operating with sunflower methyl and ethyl ester and their blends with diesel fuel no. 2 are investigated. results are presented as the first and the second law efficiency, effective work, and exergy destruction values at 10 different engine speeds. it is concluded that 75% and 50% ethyl ester blends are the most appropriate fuels for the engine in terms of its performance.
internal_combustion_engine	in asia, two wheelers are popular mode of transportation to a large group of people because of their relative affordability and ability to maneuver in heavy city traffic. however, the rate of fuel consumption and emission contribution by them, especially in urban areas need more attention to improve sustain ability of energy and air quality. recently, plug-in hybrid technology has been emerged as one of the most promising alternatives in reducing petroleum consumption and emission. this paper presents the implementation of plug-in hybrid technology on a two wheeler by formulation of novel control strategy suitable for indian city driving needs. experimental investigations on hub motor and ic (internal combustion) engine has been carried out to fix the change-over speed in hybrid mode, followed by road test on prototype vehicle. the performance of prototype vehicle on idc (indian driving cycle) simulated road pattern and actual road driving, confirmed the change-over speed of vehicle in hybrid mode. the converted plug-in hybrid electric two wheeler also demonstrated the drive strategy adopted for higher energy efficiency up to 2.5 times. so, plug-in hybrid electric two wheelers show significant improvements in fuel economy by replacing petroleum fuel with electricity for portions of trip to achieve nations' energy security.

strength_of_materials	effect of aging treatment on the microstructure, creep resistance, and high temperature mechanical properties of the mg-6zn-3cu alloy (zc63) with la- and ce-rich rare earth additions was investigated by impression creep and shear punch tests (spt). impression creep tests were performed in the temperature range 423-498 k and under punching stress in the range 150-700 mpa for dwell times up to 3600 s. the ultimate shear strength (uss) was measured by the spt in the temperature range 298-498 k. the results showed that aging treatment increased the shear strength of the cast alloys, whereas it had detrimental effects on the creep strength of materials. these observations were discussed on the basis of the microstructural features and phase constituents of the investigated alloys in the as-cast and aged conditions.

internal_combustion_engine	the aim of this investigation is to study the performance of a twin-entry turbine under pulsed flow conditions. the ansys-cfx code is used to solve three-dimensional compressible turbulent flow equations. the computational results are compared with those of a one-dimensional model and experimental data, and good agreement is found.
manufacturing_engineering	despite health and safety legislation and ergonomics regulations for several years many swedish companies are still unable to effectively prevent the consequences of poor ergonomics. corrective measures are often made (too) late when employees complain and work-related disorders have already occurred. besides, several studies have shown that poor ergonomics result in deteriorated assembly quality and reduced productivity and that late measures are often costly. other studies have proven that design engineers are often unaware of design consequences and do not know how to apply ergonomics principles in new product and production design. therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore what is required to improve the situation. one way to find out was to ask engineers involved in product and production development. thus, 64 engineers in design and manufacturing engineering in five swedish companies were interviewed about ergonomics conditions related to quality and productivity issues. in general, their answers unexpectedly demonstrated a fairly good awareness of the implications of poor assembly ergonomics but also that appropriate product and production design methods and tools to prevent these are missing. 58 of the respondents thought that poor ergonomics could result in reduced product quality. 47 stated that profitability calculations are necessary for changes of poor ergonomic solutions. 37 said that ergonomics risks are accepted due to lack of appropriate calculation methods. altogether, many suggestions emerged for how to improve product and production design methods and tools in order to achieve more complete and sustainable manufacturing solutions. relevance to industry: the relationship between ergonomics and assembly quality deserves more attention in order to achieve both good working conditions and sustainable and cost-efficient manufacturing solutions. assembly ergonomics and quality relationships must therefore be proactively considered already in early design phases of new product and assembly concepts.

machine_design	an integrated design platform for the newer type of machines is presented in this work. the machine parameters are evaluated out using developed modelling tool. with the machine parameters, the machine is modelled using computer aided tool. the designed machine is brought to simulation tool to perform electromagnetic and electromechanical analysis. in the simulation, conditions setting are performed to setup the materials, meshes, rotational speed and the excitation circuit. electromagnetic analysis is carried out to predict the behavior of the machine based on the movement of flux in the machines. besides, electromechanical analysis is carried out to analyse the speed-torque characteristic, the current-torque characteristic and the phase angle-torque characteristic. after all the results are analysed, the designed machine is used to generate s block function that is compatible with matlab/simulink tool for the dynamic operational characteristics. this allows the integration of existing drive system into the new machines designed in the modelling tool. an example of the machine design is presented to validate the usage of such a tool.
strength_of_materials	the presence of defects not only modifies the stiffness and strength of materials, but also changes their morphologies. the latter effect is extremely significant for low-dimensional materials such as graphene. we show in this work that graphene swells while point defects such as mono-vacancies are created at finite concentrations. the distorted geometry resulted from this areal expansion, in combination with the in-plane softening effect, predicts an unusual defect concentration dependence of stiffness measured for supported graphene membrane in nanoindentation tests, which leads to a defect-induced stiffening phenomenon. the mechanism is elucidated through an analytical membrane model as well as numerical simulations at atomistic and continuum levels. in addition to elucidate the counter-intuitive observations in experiments and computer simulations, our findings also highlight the role of defect-modulated morphology engineering that can be applied to design nanoscale material and structural applications.

internal_combustion_engine	this paper deals with the evaluation and analysis of a bottoming orc cycle coupled to an ic engine by means of conventional and advanced exergy analysis. using experimental data of an orc coupled to a 2 l turbocharged engine, both conventional and advanced exergy analysis are carried out. splitting the exergy in the advanced exergy analysis into unavoidable and avoidable provides a measure of the potential of improving the efficiency of this component. on the other hand, splitting the exergy into endogenous and exogenous provides information between interactions among system components. the result of this study shows that there is a high potential of improvement in this type of cycles. although, from the conventional analysis, the exergy destruction rate of boiler is greater than the one of the expander, condenser and pump, the advanced exergy analysis suggests that the first priority of improvement should be given to the expander, followed by the pump, the condenser and the boiler. a total amount of 3.75 kw (36.5%) of exergy destruction rate could be lowered, taking account that only the avoidable part of the exergy destruction rate can be reduced.

fluid_mechanics	background and aims in vascular plants, important questions regarding phloem function remain unanswered due to problems with invasive experimental procedures in this highly sensitive tissue. certain brown algae (kelps; laminariales) also possess sieve tubes for photoassimilate transport, but these are embedded in large volumes of a gelatinous extracellular matrix which isolates them from neighbouring cells. therefore, we hypothesized that kelp sieve tubes might tolerate invasive experimentation better than their analogues in higher plants, and sought to establish nereocystis luetkeana as an experimental system. methods the predominant localization of cellulose and the gelatinous extracellular matrix in n. luetkeana was verified using specific fluorescent markers and confocal laser scanning microscopy. sieve tubes in intact specimens were loaded with fluorescent dyes, either passively (carboxyfluorescein diacetate; cfda) or by microinjection (rhodamine b), and the movement of the dyes was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. key results application of cfda demonstrated source to sink bulk flow in n. luetkeana sieve tubes, and revealed the complexity of sieve tube structure, with branches, junctions and lateral connections. microinjection into sieve elements proved comparatively easy. pulsed rhodamine b injection enabled the determination of flow velocity in individual sieve elements, and the direct visualization of pressure-induced reversals of flow direction across sieve plates. conclusions the reversal of flow direction across sieve plates by pressurizing the downstream sieve element conclusively demonstrates that a critical requirement of the munch theory is satisfied in kelp; no such evidence exists for tracheophytes. because of the high tolerance of its sieve elements to experimental manipulation, n. luetkeana is a promising alternative to vascular plants for studying the fluid mechanics of sieve tube networks.
strength_of_materials	lateral dynamic soil pile interaction is investigated through an improved tajimi type solution. the soil is treated as a continuum with hysteretic material damping as previously proposed by the authors, and the pile is modelled as beam using traditional strength-of-materials solutions. following the pioneering work of novak and nogami, a more accurate analytical model for the static and harmonic response of a pile in a soil layer overlying rock is proposed, and closed form expressions for pile head stiffness are derived. results are validated through comparisons against rigorous solutions from literature. hereafter, the winkler model was considered as a simple alternative for predicting pile head stiffness and damping. an extensive review of available winkler moduli demonstrated that the winkler model performance strongly depends on the selection of the respective moduli but found to be satisfactory in static conditions. most existing expressions for dynamic winkler moduli were found to render the model incapable of capturing resonant effects. consequently, a new expression for a dynamic winkler modulus is derived based on a modification of the classic dynamic plane strain modulus of baranov novak. implemented in the winkler model this expression is capable of accurately computing dynamic stiffness attenuation and damping increase for frequencies up to the first resonance over a wide range of pile slenderness ratios.
manufacturing_engineering	mechanical manufacturing engineering is an important professional basic course and degree course for mechanical design, manufacturing and automation and has an important position on the outstanding engineers' training program. the problems existed in the present course teaching of mechanical manufacturing engineering were detailed analyzed and the paper explored constructing the teaching curriculum system and teaching contents for the teaching of outstanding engineers' training and reforming the old, outdated teaching methods and means. the reformation results show that the students' learning enthusiasm and initiative are improved and their engineering consciousness and innovation ability have greatly been improved.
thermodynamics	equilibrium thermodynamic modelling, quartz in garnet (quig) raman geobarometry, and modelling of garnet nucleation at overstepped conditions were applied to three garnet-bearing blueschists from a 1.5km-long transect across the eclogite-blueschist unit in sifnos, greece, in order to evaluate the accuracy of pt conditions calculated via equilibrium thermodynamics. quig barometry uses the raman shift of quartz inclusions in garnet to estimate the pressure of garnet nucleation and is independent of chemical equilibrium. garnet nucleation temperatures were estimated by determining the stability field of the palaeo-assemblage inferred from garnet inclusion suites on mineral assemblage diagrams calculated in the mnnckfmash system and on temperatures obtained from zr in rutile thermometry. these conditions were then compared to pt conditions calculated at the equilibrium garnet isograd, and the method of intersecting isopleths. the pt conditions calculated with intersecting garnet isopleths over- and underestimated the temperature of nucleation in samples sph99-1a and sph99-7, respectively, whereas they significantly underestimated nucleation pressure in sph99-5. nucleation of garnet in sph99-1a at 12 kbar and similar to 484 degrees c requires overstepping of similar to 6 kbar and a reaction affinity of 2.2kj mol(1) o. sph99-5 requires overstepping of similar to 8 kbar with garnet reaction affinities of at least 2.0kj mol(1) o at 15 kbar and similar to 520 degrees c. sph99-7 requires overstepping of approximately 15 kbar and affinities of about 2.0-2.4kj mol(1) o at similar to 23 kbar and similar to 530 degrees c. the geotherms calculated from sph99-7 (similar to 6.7 degrees c km(1)) and sph99-5 (9.8 degrees c km(1)) are in accordance with previous studies. the geotherm calculated from sph99-1a, however, is warmer (11.3 degrees c km(1)), and could reflect changes in the rate of subduction or differences in structural position within the down-going slab. the 10 kbar pressure difference between sph99-7 and sph99-1a can be explained by thrusting and accretion of thin slices of underplated wedge material facilitated by slab rollback and gravitational collapse.
internal_combustion_engine	different cooling structures for cylinder head and block and the corresponding thermal status, thermal dissipation and frictional power dissipation were investigated in this study. in a conventional engine cooling configuration, the coolant flow travels from the block to the head, leading to the coolant temperature of the head being higher than that of block. furthermore, the over-cooling problem in the block will occur because the cooling system is designed for the cooling requirements of the cylinder head without considering the cooling load of the block. this paper developed a 3d single cylinder model to analyse the influence of coolant flow direction and split structure cooling for the head and block. the analysis indicated that the top-bottom flow cooling structure can effectively reduce the cylinder head thermal load and slightly increase the temperature of the cylinder liner. the combined split and top-bottom cooling structure is proven as the optimal solution with the advantages of lower thermal and frictional power dissipation compared with that of the conventional cooling structure.

thermodynamics	in the context of the ever harsher production conditions encountered in the oil and gas industry, there is a need for improved materials qualification methods for sour (h2s) environments. the classic approach, based on h2s partial pressure, does not adequately characterize the corrosive severity of, in particular, high-pressure environments such as high-pressure high-temperature wells. this paper describes the introduction of non-ideal thermodynamics in the characterization of environmental severity. the focus is on sour exposure and using h2s fugacity or h2s aqueous concentration rather than h2s partial pressure. experimental work has shown that these approaches are valid, at least for sulfide stress corrosion cracking of steel, and some of the benefits are demonstrated. it is recommended to extend this work to other materials and degradation mechanisms and also to upgrade laboratory test methods and industry standards for this purpose.
machine_design	purpose - inverting electroheat problems involves synthesizing the electromagnetic arrangement of coils and geometries to realize a desired heat distribution. to this end two finite element problems need to be solved, first for the magnetic fields and the joule heat that the associated eddy currents generate and then, based on these heat sources, the second problem for heat distribution. this two-part problem needs to be iterated on to obtain the desired thermal distribution by optimization. being a time consuming process, the purpose of this paper is to parallelize the process using the graphics processing unit (gpu) and the real-coded genetic algorithm, each for both speed and accuracy. design/methodology/approach - this coupled problem represents a heavy computational load with long wait-times for results. the gpu has recently been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the finite element computations and cut down solution times. it has also been used to speedup the naturally parallel genetic algorithm. the authors use the gpu to perform coupled electroheat finite element optimization by the genetic algorithm to achieve computational efficiencies far better than those reported for a single finite element problem. in the genetic algorithm, coding objective functions in real numbers rather than binary arithmetic gives added speed and accuracy. findings - the feasibility of the method proposed to reduce computational time and increase accuracy is established through the simple problem of shaping a current carrying conductor so as to yield a constant temperature along a line. the authors obtained a speedup (cpu time to gpu time ratio) saturating to about 28 at a population size of 500 because of increasing communications between threads. but this far better than what is possible on a workstation. research limitations/implications - by using the intrinsically parallel genetic algorithm on a gpu, large complex coupled problems may be solved very quickly. the method demonstrated here without accounting for radiation and convection, may be trivially extended to more completely modeled electroheat systems. since the primary purpose here is to establish methodology and feasibility, the thermal problem is simplified by neglecting convection and radiation. while that introduces some error, the computational procedure is still validated. practical implications - the methodology established has direct applications in electrical machine design, metallurgical mixing processes, and hyperthermia treatment in oncology. in these three practical application areas, the authors need to compute the exciting coil (or antenna) arrangement (current magnitude and phase) and device geometry that would accomplish a desired heat distribution to achieve mixing, reduce machine heat or burn cancerous tissue. this process presented does it more accurately and speedily. social implications - particularly the above-mentioned application in oncology will alleviate human suffering through use in hyperthermia treatment planning in cancer treatment. the method presented provides scope for new commercial software development and employment. originality/value - previous finite element shape optimization of coupled electroheat problems by this group used gradient methods whose difficulties are explained. others have used analytical and circuit models in place of finite elements. this paper applies the massive parallelization possible with gpus to the inherently parallel genetic algorithm, and extends it from single field system problems to coupled problems, and thereby realizes practicable solution times for such a computationally complex problem. further, by using gpu computations rather than cpu, accuracy is enhanced. and then by using real number rather than binary coding for object functions, further accuracy and speed gains are realized.
fluid_mechanics	in the computation of fluid mechanics problems with moving boundaries, including fluid-structure interaction, fluid mesh deformation is a common problem to be solved. an automatic mesh deformation technique for large deformations of the fluid mesh is presented on the basis of a pseudo-solid method in which the fluid mesh motion is governed by the equations of elasticity. a two-dimensional mathematical model of a linear elastic body is built by using the finite element method. the numerical result shows that the proposed method has a better performance in moving the fluid mesh without producing distorted elements than that of the classic one-step methods.
manufacturing_engineering	the automotive industry is facing a tremendous growth in the engineering of software-intensive systems, giving rise to various challenges. to prevent problems related to the fit of new software technologies in vehicles and the manufacturing processes, a well functioning interaction between the functions for product development and manufacturing is crucial. this is complicated by the fact that the changeable nature of software development causes unprecedented needs for collaboration and coordination between these two functions. this paper reports on a process assessment that focuses on the interface between the functions for product development and manufacturing in the development and design of software-intensive automotive systems. the main purpose of the study was to identify the key issues for improvement in the area assessed. the assessment was performed at two swedish automotive companies where data were collected from documents and in interviews with practitioners. nine key improvement issues were established ranging from challenges in requirements engineering to the need for knowledge transfer between manufacturing and product development. in addition, to increase the understandability of the results and map possible avenues for solution and future research, the paper provides an extensive analysis of each improvement issue in relation to the state-of-the-art.
machine_design	the objective of this study is to find the optimal combination of factors used in the process of wastewater treatment to collect the suspended rubber content from the disc cleaning process. the factors include the amount of grass2 and the waiting time required for the rubber to coagulate. the study was conducted using two sets of experiments. one is to find the deterministic optimal amount of grass2 and waiting time, and the other one is to find whether it is practical to use the fiber optic sensor as a tool to indicate the sufficient amount of grass2 required. the results from the experiments show that using the fiber optic sensor requires a greater amount of grass2 than the deterministic method since the objective function of the sensor model was to maximize light intensity in the wastewater, while the objective function of the deterministic model was to maximize the percentage of the achieved rubber contents.
hydraulics	several studies suggest that invertebrate abundance and richness are disrupted and reset at confluences. thus, junctions contribute disproportionately to the overall aquatic biodiversity of the river. in general terms, authors have reported high abundance and diversity due to the major physical heterogeneity at junctions. however, data are still scarce and uncertainties are plentiful. the impact of a great input of fine sediments on the distribution patterns of benthic invertebrates at a river confluence was quantitatively analyzed herein. the junction of the subtropical bermejo river (high suspended sediment load) with the large paraguay river is the selected study area to achieve this aim. while diversity increased slightly downstream the junction (from 0.21 to 0.36), density and richness of the macroinvertebrate assemblage significantly diminished downstream the confluence (from 29050 to 410 ind/m(2); p<0.05) due to the input of fine sediment from the bermejo river (mean fine sediment increased downstream from 6.3 to 10.2 mg/l), causing a negatively impact on invertebrate assemblage. this study highlights the ecological importance of the sediment input effects on benthic invertebrates, a topic still poorly explored in river ecology. it is speculated that the spatial extent of the impact would be dependent upon the hydrological and sedimentological context, highly unequal between both rivers. new hypotheses should be tested through new studies considering different hydrological stages.
materials_engineering	path length measuring is a relevant engineering problem. leonardo da vinci designed for the military appropriate equipment, the podometer, to do so. modern equipment such as step meters and map meters are quite similar to da vinci 's design, despite geometrical statistical - stereological - methods based on theorems of cauchy and buffon that were potentially available for a long period of time for doing a better job. the theorems have moreover been applied earlier for the engineering purposes indicated in this paper. even saltikov 's reintroduction for quantitative image analysis purposes in 1945 was ignored. gradually, the last half of a century, stereological methods became more popular in concrete technology. nevertheless, the stereology-based global averaging operation required to make the step from materials technology to engineering properties is inherent to making errors, as the literature demonstrates. the methodological framework has been described in earlier papers by this author as to path length measurements in sections of cracked concrete and on x-ray images of steel fibre reinforced concrete (sfrc). by laying side by side in this paper the direct engineering approach (from da vinci to map meter) and the science (stereology)-based approaches, the profit in economy and reliability can nevertheless be stressed. particularly the element of geometric averaging based on simple mathematical-statistical notions is highlighted, because the literature reflects still major violations to these scientific principles. three-dimensional information in the indicated fields of materials engineering is also readily obtained, provided proper sampling is guaranteed.
internal_combustion_engine	toluene is frequently used as laser-induced fluorescence (lif) tracer for visualizing mixing processes, for example, in internal combustion engines. the signal evaluation relies on a linear dependence of the lif signal on tracer concentration - which is not present in many practically relevant cases. this paper presents an investigation of the dependence of the lif signal intensities on the toluene concentration, revealing a non-linear signal response already at concentrations approximately ten times below those given by the room-temperature vapor pressure. toluene was vaporized in a mass-flow controlled evaporator and investigated in a free jet. nitrogen was used as bath gas with a variable addition of oxygen. after excitation at 266 nm, an intensified ccd camera recorded the spectrally filtered fluorescence. in separate experiments, the effective fluorescence lifetime upon picosecond uv-laser excitation was determined. the results indicate that the fluorescence lifetime decreases with increasing tracer concentration due to self-quenching. results from imaging and fluorescence lifetime measurements are consistent. the investigation reveals that the self-quenching of toluene is dominated by collisions with excited-state toluene molecules, which causes an additional dependence of the magnitude of self-quenching on the laser fluence.

thermodynamics	in this computational study, the thermodynamics of h-2, proton, and hydride transfer from 13 ammonium borohydride and six phosphonium borohydride intramolecular and intermolecular frustrated lewis pairs (flps) was probed to gain insight into whether intramolecular or intermolecular amine-containing flps are preferred to phosphine-containing flps in flp-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions. h-2, hydride, and proton transfer from intramolecular ammonium borohydrides was, on average, 2.6 kcal/mol, 0.7 kcal/mol, and about 3.8 pk(a) units, respectively, less likely than from intramolecular phosphonium borohydrides. using the thermodynamic quantities for h-2, hydride, and proton transfer to eight probe substrates, intramolecular phosphonium borohydrides were found to be thermodynamically preferred to intramolecular ammonium borohydrides in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.
strength_of_materials	several samples of residual base course material were studied to investigate the effects of compaction on their physical and mechanical properties. test results of compaction and cbr obtained for borrow pit material are compared with repeatedly used soil samples from the road. from analysis of changes of strength of materials before, during and after construction, and also site observations, it is recommended to establish not only the minimum requirements for compaction density, but also the maximum density. some guidelines are discussed for control of the level of compaction at the site.
